He expresses opinions about the use of drugs which might surprise many readers, until it is realized that his opinions here were expressed before his first experiences with psychedelic drugs: the following is the Epilogue to The Devils of Loudun, published in 1952. Very soon thereafter, Huxley was to take the psychedelic drug mescaline under the guidance of the Canadian psychiatrist and researcher Humphrey Osmond. In 1954 Huxley published The Doors of Perception which represented a metamorphosis in his opinion about the use of drugs. Such complete reversals of thinking on the basis of evidence are, unfortunately, far too rare among professionals of any kind, and the comparison of what is written here with The Doors of Perception should provide an important lesson to the many researchers and politicians who have since denounced psychedelic drugs as a "scourge of humanity": in the following piece we hear some of the very same ignorant pronouncements about drugs still echoed today by those having the least direct knowledge of the potential of psychedelic drugs to assist humanity to find a more satisfying and ecological mode of existence. —Peter Webster Without an understanding of man's deep-seatedurge to self-transcendence, of his very natural reluctance totake the hard, ascending way, and his search for some bogusliberation either below or to one side of his personality, wecannot hope to make sense of our own particular period of historyor indeed of history in general, of life as it was lived in thepast and as it is lived today. For this reason I propose todiscuss some of the more common Grace- substitutes, into whichand by means of which men and women have tried to escape from thetormenting consciousness of being merely themselves. In France there is now one retailer of alcohol toevery hundred inhabitants, more or less. In the United Statesthere are probably at least a million desperate alcoholics,besides a much larger number of very heavy drinkers whose diseasehas not yet become mortal. Regarding the consumption ofintoxicants in the past we have no precise or statisticalknowledge. In Western Europe, among the Celts and Teutons, andthroughout medieval and early modern times, the individual intakeof alcohol was probably even greater than it is today. On themany occasions when we drink tea, or coffee, or soda pop, ourancestors refreshed themselves with wine, beer, mead and, inlater centuries, with gin, brandy and usquebaugh. The regulardrinking of water was a penance imposed on wrongdoers, oraccepted by the religious, along with occasional vegetarianism,as a very severe mortification. Not to drink an intoxicant was aneccentricity sufficiently remarkable to call for comment and theusing of a more or less disparaging nickname. Hence suchpatronymics as the Italian Bevilacqua, the French Boileau and theEnglish Drinkwater Alcohol is but one of the many drugs employed byhuman beings as avenues of escape from the insulated self. Of thenatural narcotics, stimulants and hallucinators there is, Ibelieve, not a single one whose properties have not been knownfrom time immemorial. Modern research has given us a host ofbrand new synthetics; but in regard to the natural poisons it hasmerely developed better methods of extracting, concentrating andrecombining those already known. From poppy to curare, fromAndean coca to Indian hemp and Siberian agaric, every plant orbush or fungus capable, when ingested, of stupefying or excitingor evoking visions, has long since been discovered andsystematically employed. The fact is strangely significant; forit seems to prove that, always and everywhere, human beings havefelt the radical inadequacy of their personal existence, themisery of being their insulated selves and not something else,something wider, something in Wordsworthian phrase, "farmore deeply interfused." Exploring the world around him,primitive man evidently "tried all things and held fast tothat which was good." For the purpose of self-preservationthe good is every edible fruit and leaf, every wholesome seed,root and nut. But in another context—the context ofself-dissatisfaction and the urge to self- transcendence—thegood is everything in nature by means of which the quality ofindividual consciousness can be changed. Such drug-inducedchanges may be manifestly for the worse, may be at the price ofpresent discomfort and future addiction, degeneration andpremature death. All this is of no moment. What matters is theawareness, if only for an hour or two, if only for a few minutes,of being someone or, more often, something other than theinsulated self. "I live, yet not I, but wine or opium orpeyotl or hashish liveth in me." To go beyond the limits ofthe insulated ego is such a liberation that, even whenself-transcendence is through nausea into frenzy, through crampsinto hallucinations and coma, the drug induced experience hasbeen regarded by primitives and even by the highly civilized asintrinsically divine. Ecstasy through intoxication is still anessential part of the religion of many African, South Americanand Polynesian peoples. It was once, as the surviving documentsclearly prove, a no less essential part of the religion of theCelts, the Teutons, the Greeks, the peoples of the Middle Eastand the Aryan conquerors of India. It is not merely that"beer does more than Milton can to justify God's ways toman." Beer is the god. Among the Celts, Sabazios was thedivine name given to the felt alienation of being dead drunk onale. Further to the south, Dionysos was, among other things, thesupernatural objectification of the psychophysical effects of toomuch wine. In Vedic mythology, Indra was the god of that nowunidentifiable drug called soma. Hero, slayer of dragons, he wasthe magnified projection upon heaven of the strange and gloriousotherness experienced by the intoxicated. Made one with the drug,he becomes, as Soma-Indra, the source of immortality, themediator between the human and the divine. In modern times beer and the other toxic short cutsto self-transcendence are no longer officially worshipped asgods. Theory has undergone a change, but not practice; for inpractice millions upon millions of civilized men and womencontinue to pay their devotions, not to the liberating andtransfiguring Spirit, but to alcohol, to hashish, to opium andits derivatives, to the barbiturates, and the other syntheticadditions to the age-old catalogue of poisons capable of causingself-transcendence. In every case, of course, what seems a god isactually a devil, what seems a liberation is in fact anenslavement. The self-transcendence is invariably downward intothe less than human, the lower than personal. Like intoxication, elementary sexuality, indulgedin for its own sake and divorced from love, was once a god,worshipped not only as the principle of fecundity, but as amanifestation of the radical Otherness immanent in every humanbeing. In theory, elementary sexuality has long since ceased tobe a god. But in practice it can still boast of a countless hostof sectaries. There is an elementary sexuality which is innocent,and there is an elementary sexuality which is morally andaesthetically squalid. D. H. Lawrence has written verybeautifully of the first; Jean Genet, with horrifying power andin copious detail, of the second. The sexuality of Eden and thesexuality of the sewer—both of them have power to carry theindividual beyond the limits of his or her insulated self. Butthe second and (one would sadly guess) the commoner variety takesthose who indulge in it to a lower level of subhumanity, evokesthe consciousness, and leaves the memory, of a completeralienation, than does the first. Hence, for all those who feelthe urge to escape from their imprisoning identity, the perennialattraction of debauchery and of such strange equivalents ofdebauchery as have been described in the course of thisnarrative. In most civilized communities public opinioncondemns debauchery and drug addiction as being ethically wrong.And to moral disapproval is added fiscal discouragement and legalrepression. Alcohol is heavily taxed, the sale of narcotics iseverywhere prohibited and certain sexual practices are treated ascrimes. But when we pass from drug-taking and elementarysexuality to the third main avenue of downwardself-transcendence, we find, on the part of moralists andlegislators, a very different and much more indulgent attitude.This seems all the more surprising since crowd-delirium, as wemay call it, is more immediately dangerous to social order, moredramatically a menace to that thin crust of decency,reasonableness and mutual tolerance which constitutes acivilization, than either drink or debauchery. True, ageneralized and long-continued habit of overindulgence insexuality may result, as J. D. Unwin has argued,*( J. D. Unwin, Sexand Culture, London, 1934), in lowering the energy level ofan entire society, thereby rendering it incapable of reaching ormaintaining a high degree of civilization. Similarly drugaddiction, if sufficiently widespread may lower the military,economic and political efficiency of the society in which itprevails. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries raw alcoholwas the secret weapon of the European slave traders; heroin, inthe twentieth, of the Japanese militarists. Dead drunk, the Negrowas an easy prey. As for the Chinese drug addict, he could berelied upon to make no trouble for his conquerors. But thesecases are exceptional. When left to itself, a society generallymanages to come to terms with its favorite poison. The drug is aparasite on the body politic, but a parasite which its host (tospeak metaphorically) has strength and sense enough to keep undercontrol. And the same applies to sexuality. No society whichbased its sexual practices upon the theories of the Marquis deSade could possibly survive; and in fact no society has ever comenear to doing such a thing. Even the most easygoing of thePolynesian paradises have their rules and regulations, theircategorical imperatives and commandments. Against excessivesexuality, as against excessive drug-taking, societies seem to beable to protect themselves with some degree of success. Theirdefense against crowd-delirium and its often disastrousconsequences is, in all too many cases, far less adequate. Theprofessional moralists who inveigh against drunkenness arestrangely silent about the equally disgusting vice ofherd-intoxication—of downward self-transcendence intosubhumanity by the process of getting together in a mob. "Where two or three are gathered together inmy name, there am I in the midst of them." In the midst oftwo or three hundred, the divine presence becomes moreproblematical. And when the numbers run into the thousands, ortens of thousands, the likelihood of God being there, in theconsciousness of each individual, declines almost to thevanishing point. For such is the nature of an excited crowd (andevery crowd is automatically self-exciting) that, where two orthree thousand are gathered together, there is an absence notmerely of deity, but even of common humanity. The fact of beingone of a multitude delivers a man from his consciousness of beingan insulated self and carries him down into a less than personalrealm, where there are no responsibilities, no right or wrong, noneed for thought or judgment or discrimination —only astrong vague sense of togetherness, only a shared excitement, acollective alienation. And the alienation is at once moreprolonged and less exhausting than that induced by debauchery;the morning after less depressing than that which followsself-poisoning by alcohol or morphine. Moreover, thecrowd-delirium can be indulged in, not merely without a badconscience, but actually, in many cases, with a positive glow ofconscious virtue. For, so far from condemning the practice ofdownward self-transcendence through herd-intoxication, theleaders of church and state have actively encouraged the practicewhenever it could be used for the furtherance of their own ends.Individually and in the co-ordinated and purposive groups whichconstitute a healthy society, men and women display a certaincapacity for rational thought and free choice in the light ofethical principles. Herded into mobs, the same men and womenbehave as though they possessed neither reason nor free will.Crowd-intoxication reduces them to a condition of infrapersonaland antisocial irresponsibility. Drugged by the mysterious poisonwhich every excited herd secretes, they fall into a state ofheightened suggestibility, resembling that which follows aninjection of sodium amytal or the induction, by whatever means,of a light hypnotic trance. While in this state they will believeany nonsense that may be bawled at them, will act upon anycommand or exhortation, however senseless, mad or criminal. Tomen and women under the influence of herd-poison, "whateverI say three times is true"—and whatever I say threehundred times is Revelation, is the directly inspired Word ofGod. That is why men in authority—the priests and the rulersof peoples—have never unequivocally proclaimed theimmorality of this form of downward self-transcendence. True,crowd-delirium evoked by members of the opposition and in thename of heretical principles has everywhere been denounced bythose in power. But crowd- delirium aroused by government agents,crowd-delirium in the name of orthodoxy, is an entirely differentmatter. In all cases where it can be made to serve the interestsof the men controlling church and state, downwardself-transcendence by means of herd-intoxication is treated assomething legitimate, and even highly desirable. Pilgrimages andpolitical rallies, corybantic revivals and patrioticparades—these things are ethically right so long as they areour pilgrimages, our rallies, our revivalsand our parades. The fact that most of those who take partin these affairs are temporarily dehumanized by herd-poison is ofno account in comparison with the fact that their dehumanizationmay be used to consolidate the religious and political powersthat be. When crowd-delirium is exploited for the benefit ofgovernments and orthodox churches, the exploiters are always verycareful not to allow the intoxication to go too far. The rulingminorities make use of their subjects' craving for downwardself-transcendence in order, first, to amuse and distract themand, second, to get them into a subpersonal state of heightenedsuggestibility. Religious and political ceremonials are welcomedby the masses as opportunities for getting drunk on herd-poison,and by their rulers as opportunities for planting suggestions inminds which have momentarily ceased to be capable of reason orfree will. The final symptom of herd-intoxication is amaniacal violence. Instances of crowd- delirium culminating ingratuitous destructiveness, in ferocious self-mutilation, infratricidal savagery without purpose and against the elementaryinterests of all concerned, are to be met with on almost everypage of the anthropologists' textbooks and—a little lessfrequently, but still with dismal regularity —in thehistories of even the most highly civilized peoples. Except whenthey wish to liquidate an unpopular minority the officialrepresentatives of state and church are chary of evoking a frenzywhich they cannot be sure of controlling. No such scruplesrestrain the revolutionary leader, who hates the status quoand has only one wish—to create a chaos on which, when hecomes to power, he may impose a new kind of order. When therevolutionary exploits men's urge to downward self-transcendence,he exploits it to the frantic and demoniac limit. To men andwomen sick of being their insulated selves and weary of theresponsibilities which go with membership in a purposive humangroup, he offers exciting opportunities for "getting awayfrom it all" in parades and demonstrations and publicmeetings. The organs of the body politic are purposive groups. Acrowd is the social equivalent of a cancer. The poison itsecretes depersonalizes its constituent members to the pointwhere they start to behave with a savage violence, of which, intheir normal state, they would be completely incapable. Therevolutionary encourages his followers to manifest this last andworst symptom of herd-intoxication and then proceeds to directtheir frenzy against his enemies, the holders of political,economic and religious power. In the course of the last forty years thetechniques for exploiting man's urge toward this most dangerousform of downward self-transcendence have reached a pitch ofperfection unmatched in all of history. To begin with, there aremore people to the square mile than ever before, and the means oftransporting vast herds of them from considerable distances, andof concentrating them in a single building or arena, are muchmore efficient than in the past. Meanwhile, new and previouslyundreamed-of devices for exciting mobs have been invented. Thereis the radio, which has enormously extended the range of thedemagogue's raucous yelling. There is the loudspeaker, amplifyingand indefinitely reduplicating the heady music of class- hatredand militant nationalism. There is the camera (of which it wasonce naively said that "it cannot lie") and itsoffspring, the movies and television; these three have made theobjectification of tendentious phantasy absurdly easy. Andfinally there is that greatest of our social inventions, free,compulsory education. Everyone now knows how to read and everyoneconsequently is at the mercy of the propagandists, governmentalor commercial, who own the pulp factories, the linotype machinesand the rotary presses. Assemble a mob of men and womenpreviously conditioned by a daily reading of newspapers; treatthem to amplified band music, bright lights, and the oratory of ademagogue who (as demagogues always are) is simultaneously theexploiter and the victim of herd-intoxication, and in next to notime you can reduce them to a state of almost mindlesssubhumanity. Never before have so few been in a position to makefools, maniacs or criminals of so many. In Communist Russia, in Fascist Italy, in NaziGermany, the exploiters of humanity's fatal taste for herd-poisonhave followed an identical course. When in revolutionaryopposition, they encouraged the mobs under their influence tobecome destructively violent. Later, when they had come to power,it was only in relation to foreigners and selected scapegoatsthat they permitted herd-intoxication to run its full course.Having acquired a vested interest in the status quo, theynow checked the descent into subhumanity at a point well thisside of frenzy. For these neo-conservatives, mass intoxicationwas chiefly valuable, henceforward, as a means for heighteningtheir subjects' suggestibility and so rendering them more docileto the expressions of authoritarian will. Being in a crowd is thebest known antidote to independent thought. Hence the dictators'rooted objection to "mere psychology" and a privatelife. "Intellectuals of the world, unite! You have nothingto lose but your brains." Drugs, elementary sexuality andherd-intoxication—these are the three most popular avenuesof downward self-transcendence. There are many others, not sowell trodden as these great descending highways, but leading noless surely to the same infra-personal goal. Consider, forexample, the way of rhythmic movement. In primitive religionsprolonged rhythmic movement is very commonly resorted to for thepurpose of inducing a state of infra-personal and subhumanecstasy. The same technique for achieving the same end has beenused by many civilized peoples—by the Greeks, for example,by the Hindus, by many of the orders of Dervishes in the Islamicworld, by such Christian sects as the Shakers and the HolyRollers. In all these cases rhythmic movement, long-drawn andrepetitive, is a form of ritual deliberately practiced for thesake of the downward self-transcendence resulting from it.History also records many sporadic outbreaks of involuntary anduncontrollable jigging, swaying and head-wagging. These epidemicsof what in one region is called Tarantism, in another St. Vitus'sdance, have generally occurred in times of trouble followingwars, pestilences and famines, and are most common where malariais endemic. The unwitting purpose of the men and women whosuccumb to these collective manias is the same as that pursued bythe sectaries who use the dance as a religious rite—namely,to escape from insulated selfhood into a state in which there areno responsibilities, no guilt-laden past or haunting future, butonly the present, blissful consciousness of being someone else. Intimately associated with the ecstasy-producingrite of rhythmic movement is the ecstasy-producing rite ofrhythmic sound. Music is as vast as human nature and hassomething to say to men and women on every level of their being,from the self-regardingly sentimental to the abstractlyintellectual, from the merely visceral to the spiritual. In oneof its innumerable forms music is a powerful drug, partlystimulant and partly narcotic, but wholly alterative. No man,however highly civilized, can listen for very long to Africandrumming, or Indian chanting, or Welsh hymn-singing, and retainintact his critical and self-conscious personality. It would beinteresting to take a group of the most eminent philosophers fromthe best universities, shut them up in a hot room with Moroccandervishes or Haitian voodooists, and measure, with a stop watch,the strength of their psychological resistance to the effects ofrhythmic sound. Would the Logical Positivists be able to hold outlonger than the Subjective Idealists; Would the Marxists provetougher than the Thomists or the Vedantists? What a fascinating,what a fruitful field for experiment! Meanwhile, all we cansafely predict is that, if exposed long enough to the tom-tomsand the singing, every one of our philosophers would end bycapering and howling with the savages. The ways of rhythmic movement and of rhythmic soundare generally superimposed, so to speak, upon the way ofherd-intoxication. But there are also private roads, roads whichcan be taken by the solitary traveler who has no taste forcrowds, or no strong faith in the principles, institutions andpersons in whose name crowds are assembled. One of these privateroads is the way of the mantram, the way of what Christcalled "vain repetition." In public worship "vainrepetition" is almost always associated with rhythmic sound.Litanies and the like are chanted, or at least intoned. It is asmusic that they produce their quasi-hypnotic effects. "Vainrepetition," when practiced privately, acts upon the mind,not because of its association with rhythmic sound (for it workseven when the words are merely imagined), but in virtue of aconcentration of attention and memory. The constant reiterationof the same word or phrase frequently brings on a state of lightor even profound trance. Once induced, this trance can either beenjoyed for its own sake, as a delicious sense of infra-personalotherness, or else deliberately used for the purpose of improvingpersonal conduct by autosuggestion and of preparing the way forthe ultimate achievement of upward self-transcendence. Of thesecond possibility more will be said in a later paragraph. Hereour concern is with "vain repetition" as a descendingroad into an infra- personal alienation. We must now consider a strictly physiologicalmethod of escape from insulated selfhood. The way of corporalpenance. The destructive violence which is the final symptom ofherd- intoxication is not invariably directed outward. Thehistory of religion abounds in gruesome tales of gregariousself-whipping, self-gashing, self-gelding, even self-killing.These acts are the consequences of crowd-delirium, and areperformed in a state of frenzy. Very different is the corporalpenance undertaken privately and in cold blood. Here theself-torment is initiated by an act of the personal will; but itsresult (in some cases at least) is a temporary transformation ofthe insulated personality into something else. In itself, thissomething else is the consciousness, so intense as to beexclusive, of physical pain. The self-tortured person identifieshimself with his pain and, in becoming merely the awareness ofhis suffering body, is delivered from that sense of past guiltand present frustration, that obsessive anxiety about the future,which constitute so large a part of the neurotic ego. There hasbeen an escape from selfhood, a downward passage into a state ofpure physiological excruciation. But the self-tormentor need notnecessarily remain in this region of infra-personalconsciousness. Like the man who makes use of "vainrepetition" to go beyond himself, he may be able to use histemporary alienation from selfhood as the bridge, so to speak,leading upward into the life of the spirit. This raises a very important and difficultquestion. To what extent, and in what circumstances, is itpossible for a man to make use of the descending road as a way tospiritual self-transcendence; As first sight it would seemobvious that the way down is not and can never be the way up. Butin the realm of existence matters are not quite so simple as theyare in our beautifully tidy world of words. In actual life adownward movement may sometimes be made the beginning of anascent. When the shell of the ego has been cracked and therebegins to be a consciousness of the subliminal and physiologicalothernesses underlying personality, it sometimes happens that wecatch a glimpse, fleeting but apocalyptic, of that otherOtherness, which is the Ground of all being. So long as we areconfined within our insulated selfhood, we remain unaware of thevarious not-selves with which we are associated—the organicnot-self, the subconscious not-self, the collective not-self ofthe psychic medium in which all our thinking and feeling havetheir existence, and the immanent and transcendent not-self ofthe Spirit. Any escape, even by a descending road, out ofinsulated selfhood makes possible at least a momentary awarenessof the not-self on every level, including the highest. WilliamJames, in his Varieties of Religious Experience, givesinstances of "anaesthetic revelations," following theinhalation of laughing gas. Similar theophanies are sometimesexperienced by alcoholics, and there are probably moments in thecourse of intoxication by almost any drug, when awareness of anot-self superior to the disintegrating ego becomes brieflypossible. But these occasional flashes of revelation are boughtat an enormous price. For the drugtaker, the moment of spiritualawareness (if it comes at all) gives place very soon to subhumanstupor, frenzy or hallucination, followed by dismal hangoversand, in the long run, by a permanent and fatal impairment ofbodily health and mental power. Very occasionally a single"anaesthetic revelation" may act, like any othertheophany, to incite its recipient to an effort ofself-transformation and upward self-transcendence. But the factthat such a thing sometimes happens can never justify theemployment of chemical methods of self-transcendence. This is adescending road and most of those who take it will come to astate of degradation, where periods of subhuman ecstasy alternatewith periods of conscious selfhood so wretched that any escape,even if it be into the slow suicide of drug addiction, will seempreferable to being a person. What is true of drugs is true, mutatis mutandis,of elementary sexuality. The road runs downhill; but on the waythere may occasionally be theophanies. The Dark Gods, as Lawrencecalled them, may change their sign and become bright. In Indiathere is a Tantric yoga, based upon an elaboratepsychophysiological technique, whose purpose is to transform thedownward self-transcendence of elementary sexuality into anupward self-transcendence. In the West the nearest equivalent tothese Tantric practices was the sexual discipline devised by JohnHumphrey Noyes and practiced by the members of the OneidaCommunity. At Oneida elementary sexuality was not onlysuccessfully civilized; it was made compatible with, andsubordinate to, a form of Protestant Christianity, sincerelypreached and earnestly acted upon. Herd-intoxication disintegrates the ego morethoroughly than does elementary sexuality. Its frenzies, itsfollies, its heightened suggestibility can be matched only in theintoxications induced by such drugs as alcohol, hashish andheroin. But even to the member of an excited mob there may come(at some relatively early stage of his downwardself-transcendence) a genuine revelation of the Otherness that isabove selfhood. This is one of the reasons why some good maysometimes come out of even the most corybantic of revivalmeetings. Some good as well as very great evil may also resultfrom the fact that men and women in a crowd tend to become morethan ordinarily suggestible. While in this state they aresubjected to exhortations which have the force, when they comeonce again to their senses, of posthypnotic commands. Like thedemagogue, the revivalist and the ritualist disintegrate the egoof their hearers by herding them together and dosing them withplenty of vain repetition and rhythmic sound. Then, unlike thedemagogue, they give suggestions some of which may be genuinelyChristian. These, if they "take," result in areintegration of broken-down personalities on a somewhat higherlevel. There can also be reintegrations of personality under theinfluence of the posthypnotic commands issued by a rabble-rousingpolitician. But these commands are all incitements to hatred onthe one hand and to blind obedience and compensatory illusion onthe other. Initiated by a massive dose of herd-poison, confirmedand directed by the rhetoric of a maniac who is at the same timea Machiavellian exploiter of other men's weakness, political"conversion" results in the creation of a newpersonality worse than the old and much more dangerous becausewholeheartedly devoted to a party whose first aim is theliquidation of its opponents. I have distinguished between demagogues andreligionists, on the ground that the latter may sometimes do somegood, whereas the former can scarcely, in the very nature ofthings, do anything but harm. But it must not by imagined thatthe religious exploiters of herd-intoxication are whollyguiltless. On the contrary, they have been responsible in thepast for mischiefs almost as enormous as those brought upon theirvictims (along with the victims of those victims) by therevolutionary demagogues of our own time. In the course of thelast six or seven generations, the power of religiousorganizations to do evil has, throughout the Western world,considerably declined. Primarily this is due to the astoundingprogress of applied science and the consequent demand by themasses for compensatory illusions that have an air of beingpositivistic rather than metaphysical. The demagogues offer suchpseudo-positivistic illusions and the churches do not. As theattractiveness of the churches declines, so also does theirinfluence, so do their wealth, their political power and, alongwith these, their capacity for doing evil on a large scale.Circumstances have now delivered the churchmen from certain ofthe temptations, to which, in earlier centuries, theirpredecessors almost invariably succumbed. They would be welladvised voluntarily to deliver themselves from such temptationsas still remain. Conspicuous among these is the temptation toacquire power by pandering to men's insatiable craving fordownward self-transcendence. Deliberately to induceherd-intoxication—even if it is done in the name ofreligion, even if it is all supposedly "for the good"of the intoxicated—cannot be morally justified. On the subject of horizontal self-transcendencevery little need be said—not because the phenomenon isunimportant (far from it), but because it is too obvious torequire analysis and of occurrence too frequent to be readilyclassifiable. In order to escape from the horrors of insulatedselfhood most men and women choose, most of the time, to goneither up nor down, but sideways. They identify themselves withsome cause wider than their own immediate interests, but notdegradingly lower and, if higher, higher only within the range ofcurrent social values. This horizontal, or nearly horizontal,self- transcendence may be into something as trivial as a hobby,or as precious as married love. It can be brought about throughself-identification with any human activity, from running abusiness to research in nuclear physics, from composing music tocollecting stamps, from campaigning for political office toeducating children or studying the mating habits of birds.Horizontal self- transcendence is of the utmost importance.Without it, there would be no art, no science, no law, nophilosophy, indeed no civilization. And there would also be nowar, no odium theologicum or ideologicum, nosystematic intolerance, no persecution. These great goods andthese enormous evils are the fruits of man's capacity for totaland continuous self-identification with an idea, a feeling, acause. How can we have the good without the evil, a highcivilization without saturation bombing or the extermination ofreligious and political heretics The answer is that we cannothave it so long as our self-transcendence remains merelyhorizontal. When we identify ourselves with an idea or a cause weare in fact worshipping something homemade, something partial andparochial, something that, however noble, is yet all too human."Patriotism," as a great patriot concluded on the eveof her execution by her country's enemies, "is notenough." Neither is socialism, nor communism, norcapitalism; neither is art, nor science, nor public order, norany given religion or church. All these are indispensable, butnone of them is enough. Civilization demands from the individualdevoted self-identification with the highest of human causes. Butif this self-identification with what is human is not accompaniedby a conscious and consistent effort to achieve upwardself-transcendence into the universal life of the Spirit, thegoods achieved will always be mingled with counterbalancingevils. "We make," wrote Pascal, "an idol of truthitself; for truth without charity is not God, but His image andidol, which we must neither love or worship." And it is notmerely wrong to worship an idol; it is also exceedinglyinexpedient. The worship of truth apart fromcharity—self-identification with science unaccompanied byself-identification with the Ground of all being—results inthe kind of situation which now confronts us. Every idol, howeverexalted, turns out, in the long run, to be a Moloch, hungry forhuman sacrifice.

Harner. 1973, Oxford University Press In a volume devoted to the study of shamanismand hallucinogenic drugs it is important to include dataconcerning a group whose experiences with the hallucinogenicpeyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii) in shamanistic ritualsresulted in serious conflict and, ultimately, proscription of theceremonial use of the drug. 1 Inthis contribution we presentinformation concerning the Apaches of the Mescalero IndianReservation, some of whom used peyote in shamanistic contextsbetween about 1870 until some time after 1910. We then examinesome of the reasons why its use was abandoned and why theiraccredited shamanistic practices subsequently have excluded theuse of hallucinogens.2 The Apaches presently living on the reservationinclude members of three tribes, in order of descending numbers,Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Lipans (R. M. Boyer, 1962, AppendixA). The reservation was established in 1873 for the Mescaleros.The Chiricahuas were taken as prisoners of war in 1886 after thecapitulation of Geronomo and his followers. When they were freedin 1913, the majority chose to move to the reservation and tobecome part of the Mescalero tribe. The Lipans were destroyed asfunctioning groups during the latter half of the nineteenthcentury, when their few known remaining members joined theMescaleros. Nineteenth-century authors stated that theMescaleros used peyote in religious rites in 1867 (Methvin,1899:36-37), the Chiricahuas in 1875 (Tones, 1899:95)1� and theLipans in 1885 (Havard, 1885:521; 1886:38). Nevertheless, it isnot generally known that these Apaches ate peyote. They wereexcluded from Shonle's (1925) map of the distribution of the useof peyote in the United States and they were listed as non-usersin a booklet compiled under the aegis of the Bureau of IndianAffairs (Newberne, 1925.) During his field work in the 1930's, Opler(1936); learned that the Mescaleros had practiced ratherelaborate ceremonies centering on the utilization of peyote forsome forty years and that the Lipans had used it in shamanisticcontexts (Opler, 1938, 1940, 1945)� According to the aged informant Antonio Apache,the Lipans obtained peyote from the Carrizo Indians (Opler,1938); and the Mescaleros are said to have learned peyote ritesfrom the Lipans not long before 1870 (LaBarre, 1938) or from theTonkawas, Lipans, Yaquis, or other non-Apachean groups ofnorthern Mexico (Opler, 1936:148). But for some slight degree ofexperimentation by today's young people with marijuana andperhaps LSD, the reservation Apaches are not known to have usedany other hallucinogenic drugs with the exception of alcohol.Modern informants affirm that peyote has been and may now be usedfor social purposes, but that formerly it was ingested onlyduring Mescalero and Lipan shamanistic ceremonies. We have beenunable to confirm its use during the years 1958-71. No one nowhas knowledge of peyote use by the Chiricahuas of thereservation. To understand why the shamanistic use of peyotewas abandoned requires an insight into Apache religious conceptsand a cognizance of personality structure among these people.Initially we shall summarize the religious tenets. Aboriginal religio-medical philosophies, thecriteria for according the status of shaman to individuals, andshamanistic procedures have been similar if not identical amongthe three tribes in recorded times (Boyer, 1964)� They conceivethe world to be permeated by supernatural power which has nointrinsic attribute of good or evil; its virtue resides in itspotency. Power approaches people through the agency of a plant,animal, or natural phenomenon by means of a dream or otherhallucinatory experience; its acceptance is frequentlyaccompanied by an ordeal. Ritual instruction may be receiveddirectly from the power or from other shamans. Any person is apossible power recipient. Thus, Opler (1936:146) described theMescaleros as "a tribe of shamans, active or potentiallyactive." An individual might own any number of powers.If he is thought to use power for purposes which are not orientedtoward the common good, he is accorded the status of witch. Yetthose who are thought to use their powers for the benefit of thegroup, the shamans, are implicitly witches since a shaman whosaves a life must then either sacrifice his own or that of aloved person. Obviously, jealousies, enmities, and suspicionabound. Each shaman has private instructions concerning the useof power, and his rites are individually owned. Consistent withnative concepts of leadership and authority (Basehart, 1959,1960, 1970), there has never been a chief shaman. Opler's informants stated, and today's Apachesagree, that ritual peyote use was acquired from personal contactwith power that approached people while it was invested in peyoteflowers or "buttons." Various Mescalero shamansacquired peyote power and became leaders of a peyote camp inwhich curing and other ceremonies were conducted. During suchrites, various shamans and other participants used and wereaffected by peyote, experiencing the usual perceptual and logicaldistortions, hallucinations, and physical effects. Whether theLipans had a formal peyote camp is not known. There is a fundamental incongruity between theprinciples involved in ordinary Mescalero shamanistic ceremoniesand the rules that applied to peyote rites. In ordinaryshamanistic practices, a single shaman is tire principal figureand the experiences of attendants at ceremonies are subordinate.Religious ecstasy, visions, and communications with supernaturalsare the shaman's prerogatives and validate his power andefficacy. The use of peyote by other people at ceremonies madeits psychological and physiological effects common, and theuniqueness of the shaman's experiences disappeared. The peyotemeetings became places in which shamanistic rivalries andwitchcraft flourished. Disruption resulted, rather thancohesiveness through shared experience. The peyote ceremonies were not accompanied bythe acceptance of Christian beliefs and practices, and theMescaleros never became involved in the Peyote Religion (seeSlotkin, 1956). Instead, the use of peyote was intended to affirmthe vitality of traditional religious practices at a time whenthe impact of reservation confinement contributed to an increasedawareness of social and cultural deprivation. Yet antagonismsbecame so open and bloody that eventually the peyote gatheringswere abandoned. The hostilities which became overt during themeetings were ascribed to the peyote. Since its use involvedwitchcraft practices, its ingestion was equated with thepotential for witchcraft. It will be recalled that, in the nativeconceptualization, power has no intrinsic attribute of good orevil, and can be used for moral or immoral purposes at the willof its human owner. To our knowledge, peyote power is uniqueamong the Mescaleros in that it is uniformly considered to bebad. Some Mescaleros believe that one other power, the owl, isintrinsically evil. Thus, the hoot of an owl is considered topresage death. However, some Apaches regard the owl as the bearerof the power of a human witch, others believe ghosts to inhabitowls, and yet others deem owls to be witches whose actions aremotivated by their own evil will or power. During 1959-60 there were thirteen accreditedMescalero, Chiricahua, and Lipan shamans on the reservation.Perhaps fifteen Mescaleros, here termed pseudoshamans, claimed toown supernatural power but were considered generally to beimposters. One of the shamans, Ancient One, was the soleliving person known to have participated in the peyote camp. Ofthe shamans, only he and Black Eyes (Boyer, 1961; Klopfer andBoyer, 1961), both Mescaleros, were at times judged to bewitches. It was said that they and two of the pseudoshamans stillused peyote in the illicit practices of witchcraft and love magicceremonies, rites which are potentially dangerous to those whoperform them. The shamans, considered to be legitimate possessorsof peyote power, were not punished by that power for theiractions. However, the peyote had "turned back" on thepseudoshamans. As a consequence, one of them lost one of his legsin an accident and the other was castigated indirectly when oneof his close relatives was killed and another lost a limb. Let us turn now to a brief and partialrecapitulation of facets of current socialization practices. R.M. Boyer (1962) found that child-rearing techniques tend to beuniform in emotional content, and usually in actual practice,provided the mother has been brought up on the reservation.Further, during the prelatency period of a child's growth,socialization practices strongly resemble aboriginal tactics. Typically, there is gross inconsistency in thematernal care of children. Frequently, the baby of the family isafforded tender and loving care but periodically the mother willimpulsively abandon the infant to the supervision of others,sometimes to children of only four or five years of age, forhours or days while she engages in narcissistic pursuits,commonly involving drinking. Ordinarily, a husband does notobject to such treatment of small children because his attentionand regard are no more constant. Under such conditions, thedevelopment of a sense of basic trust (Erikson, 1950) isStultified; one result is the marked ambivalence andsuspiciousness which form aspects of Apache personality. With the birth of a baby, usually when theprevious child is 18 to 24 months old, the older child isabruptly, and often brutally, displaced. The resultant siblingrivalry is intense but strongly disapproved. Nevertheless, itsrepression is insecure and its effects become blatantly manifestwhen teenagers and adults are under the influence of alcohol. Werefer here to only two of the severe psychological traumataencountered by growing children. In the aboriginal situation, othersocialization practices were reasonably effective in directinghostilities engendered by such child-rearing practices, forexample, those mentioned above toward outsiders, witches, ghostsand other culturally defined objects. During the long period whenthese Apaches were nomadic hunters, gatherers, and raiders, suchexternalization of aggression served to strengthen groupsolidarity. With changing life conditions, in the presence offeeble repression of interfamilial and intragroup resentments,individuals' hatreds are generally discharged in manners whichresult in anomie and various forms of self-destruction (Boyer andBoyer, 1972)� L. B. Boyer's essential research methodconsisted of conducting psychoanalytically oriented investigativeinterviews (Boyer, 1964a). He had from 1 to 145 interviews eachwith 60 different persons of both sexes, ranging in age from 4 to65 years. He found a personality configuration which was typicalfor these Apaches. They are impulse-ridden, fear loss of control,especially of feebly repressed hostile urges, and are suggestibleand phobic. They tend to avoid introspection and seek outercontrols and explanations for their behavior and thoughts. Theyare suspicious and dependent and their libidinal attachments areunstable. The men, who are caught between passive and aggressiveurges, have insecure sexual identities. The typical Apachepersonality configuration corresponds with the Westernpsychiatric diagnosis of character disorder with hysterical andimpulsive attributes. L. B. Boyer was generally considered to be ashaman and, accordingly, was in an unusually good position tolearn about shamans and their activities. He found them to havepersonality configurations that concur with those which aretypical for the Apaches, differing only to the degree to whichthey successfully employ imposture and in their having greatercreative potential (Boyer, 1962).3 They are not autoculturaldeviants who have resolved serious psychopathological conditionsthrough assuming shamanistic roles (Ackerknecht, 1943; Devereux,1956; Silverman, 1967)� The personality structure of theimpostor as delineated by psychoanalysts (Greenacre, 1958) isclinically similar to that of the usual Apache shaman. A capacity to regress in the service of the ego(Kris, 1952) and an ego-controlled availability of primaryprocess thinking (Freud, 191�5) are related to creativity andshowmanship. These characteristics appear to be necessary for thesuccessful practice of shamanism and for convincingimpostureship. It is noteworthy that the pseudoshamans who wereinterviewed were found clinically to lack creative potentials andthe capacity to use regression in the service of the ego. Because it was impossible to conductpsychiatric interviews in depth with all of the shamans andpseudoshamans, the Rorschach test was employed as a researchadjunct. Protocols were obtained from all Apaches of fifty yearsof age and older (referred to here as the old-age group), 12 ofthe 13 shamans and 7 pseudoshamans (Boyer, Klopfer, Brawer, andKawai, 1964). The protocols of the shamans and pseudoshamans werecompared with those of the old-age group and with each other. Asexpected, the protocols of the old-age group showed hystericalsigns. The shamans demonstrated more hysterical signs and,additionally, a way of handling data with keener awareness ofpeculiarities and more selective theoretical interest; they hadcreative characteristics and a high degree of reality testingpotential in addition to a capacity to regress in the service ofthe ego. Viewed heteroculturally, or within Devereux's frameworkof the ideal psychological normal, they more nearly approachednormality than did their culture mates." The personality ofthe pseudoshamans was strikingly different. They were nothysterical, had variable degrees of reality testing potential,and impoverished personalities. Klopfer concluded from indirectdata that the shamans were able to use imposture convincinglywhereas pseudoshamans could not. COMMENT Historical and modern data provide some partialand tentative answers to the intriguing question of why theMescaleros abandoned the use of peyote in shamanistic rituals andtoday forbid its use. Apache child-rearing practices engender muchhostility. Aggression was and is addressed institutionally towardoutsiders, witches, ghosts, and cultural bogies in an attempt toproduce individual repression of hostile impulses originallydirected toward familial and societal members. The effort wasmore effective aboriginally but has never been strikinglysuccessful. In the past, as today, when individuals were underthe influence of hallucinogens, including alcohol, their unstablerepression of hateful impulses toward parent and siblingsurrogates became blatantly overt and threatened tribal unity. The use of peyote in the camps introduced aforeign element into Apache shamanistic procedures, thesimultaneous assumption of authority by more than onepractitioner. Each of them vied for supremacy of power andstatus. The physiopsychological effects of the hallucinogenreduced the efficacy of their repression of the hostilities whichhad resulted from their socialization experiences. The drug-induced regression resulted in theirreleasing aggression in its earlier, childish form, directlytoward parent and sibling surrogates. Bloodshed and feudsoccurred; the Apache wisely banned the peyote camps. It would appear that the ascription of thequality of evil to peyote (power), an act which involved basicdeviation from the conceptualization of power without intrinsicproperties of good or evil, was intended to deny the presence ofintragroup hostility. The use of peyote was proscribed for shamans;thenceforth it was employed by possessors of supernatural powersolely in witchcraft rituals, as was owl power, and love magicpractices. It can be no coincidence that only peyote andowl power have been considered to be evil in themselves. In eachinstance, murderous wishes are projected onto the power inquestion. The Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Lipans fearthe use of peyote for two stated reasons: (1) it has an evilpower which will drive them to do evil and (2) it causeshallucinations, that is, reduces their capacity to perceive andjudge external reality accurately. There is fear of the visual aberrations and ofthe strange qualities of movement encountered. In the first case,intrapersonal asocial tendencies are projected onto the peyote.Sexual transgressions arouse little overt anxiety among theseApaches except when inter-generational incest has occurred, butthey fear their poorly controlled aggressive impulses. The secondcase is similar. The Apaches may displace their fear of loss ofcontrol over destructive urges onto fear of loss of control ofperceptual accuracy. A number of questions remain, of which we shalldeal briefly with three. First, why did two shamans continue to usepeyote in illicit practices! Both were considered to be verypowerful and were feared by most Apaches. Black Eyes,intoxicated, frequently bragged that he was a witch and onceflaunted peyote buttons before the psychoanalytic author. AncientOne had no need to flaunt his witchcraft potential. He was saidto have killed many individuals, both tribal enemies and Apaches,sometimes by means which appeared to have required theintervention of the supernatural. His own children were so awedby his presumed powers that they even hesitated to whisper theirconviction that he was a witch. Perhaps these two men deemedthemselves to be so strong that they were above social sanctionsand continued to use peyote both to demonstrate their contemptfor their fellow Mescaleros and for material purposes. It isprobable that they could demand greater recompense and commandgreater respect from performing rituals which were conceptualizedas illegitimate in Apache practice and belief. Second, why did two pseudoshamans use peyote intheir rituals? They had impoverished personalities, and weregenerally scorned both as shamans and witches and employed solelyby the most suggestible. We postulate that they used peyote in anattempt to raise their esteem in their eyes and those of others,hoping that they would truly become powerful if they couldexploit the effects of the hallucinogens. Each of them confidedto L. B. Boyer while intoxicated that they doubted their ownclaims of power possession and consciously sought to deceiveothers. Third, the use of alcohol among these Apachesis commonplace. While it is officially and to some extentsocially disapproved, it is accepted as "one way oflife," a way accepted even prior to white domination. Underits influence, hallucinosis is frequent, and exceedingly violentactions often occur. Further, in the drunken state, perception isblurred and distorted, paralleling one aspect of the experiencesinduced by the ingestion of peyote. Why, then, was the use ofalcohol socially permissible, while peyote was proscribed? Asignificant reason would appear to be the incorporation of peyoteinto the shamanistic ritual complex from the time of itsintroduction to the Apaches; the consumption of alcohol, to ourknowledge, has never been culturally acceptable in ceremonialcontexts. Where the group situation at peyote meetings fosteredconflict centering on the varying powers controlled by andcontrolling particular individuals, aggression released duringdrinking parties was channeled outside the personally mediatedworld of the supernatural. It will be most interesting to observe futureApache involvement with hallucinogens, inasmuch as their use hasbecome commonplace among adolescents and young adults throughoutthe United States. Will the ban against the use of peyote extendto other hallucinatory agents with which Apaches may becomefamiliar in their increasing intercourse with the world beyondthe reservation? Or, might acquaintance with some hallucinogenspave the way for the re-definition of peyote, especially in viewof the diminished commitment of the majority of present-dayApaches to the system of supernatural beliefs associated withshamanism? Research designed to answer these and relatedquestions should yield significant data for cross-culturalcomparison of processes of sociocultural change. REFERENCES Ackerknecht, E.

Almost noone remembers an aboriginal name, xucladjin-dei (Castetter andOpler, 1936:61)� 3� Subsequently, Boyer reviewed therelevant literature on shamanism and concluded that,cross-culturally, shamans have personality configurations similarto those exhibited by Apache practitioners (Boyer, 1964b). 4� Devereux's (1956) stand has beenfrequently misunderstood. He held that shamans must be consideredto be seriously neurotic or psychotic when compared with thehypothetical psychological normal. Boyer's viewpoint has beensimilarly misunderstood. Thus Handelman (1968) has stated thatBoyer considers shamans to be psychologically abnormal, inferringtherefrom that he deems them to be autocultural deviants, whichis not true (Boyer, 1969).

I. HAYAKAWA IN THE COURSE of twenty-two volumes of ETC., thepresent is the fifth special issue. Like our previous specialissues, it is an attempt to examine a topic of current scientificor theoretical interest from the point of view of generalsemantics. For some time, judging from unsolicited manuscripts coming toETC., it has been clear that there is widespread interest,both scientific and popular, in drug-induced psychedelicexperiences. ETC. was fortunate in having on its EditorialCommittee Dr. Robert E. Mogar, associate professor of psychology,San Francisco State College, and director of the Institute forPsychedelic Research, to serve as editor of this special issue.He read the manuscripts on hand, invited other contributions, andarranged the material. Without Dr. Mogar, there would have beenno psychedelic issue, not only because of his skill in selectingand editing the varied contributions, but more importantlybecause his enthusiastic espousal of the project convinced methat such an issue would be of real service to our readers. For all my gratitude to Dr. Mogar and the personal regard inwhich I hold the contributors to this issue, I am forced by myown convictions to introduce a discordant note. I am far fromconvinced of the therapeutic or "spiritual" value ofthe psychedelic experience. Indeed, I cannot get rid of thefeeling that this issue is likely to do the world as much harm asgood. In the present climate of opinion, with hallucinogens likeLSD available on almost every college campus in the U.S., theglowing accounts of "consciousness-expanding"experiences resulting from their use under controlled conditionsand responsible supervision are all too likely to be seized uponas justification for their uncontrolled use without medical orscientific supervision of any kind. A recent issue of the Gater,student newspaper at San Francisco State College, carries thefollowing advertisement (December 3, 1965): THE PSYCHEDELIC CHAPEL Presents: "Trip Thru The Astral Plane" Featuring Recording Artist Ivan Ulz Service Begins 8:30 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 4, l 10 Page St. (WHERE The Jet Set MEETS The Sin Crowd) I shudder as I see in my mind's eye, sitting in the"chapel," the Jet Set and the Sin Crowd, "turnedon" and "tripping through the Astral Plane," withthe music of Recording Artist Ivan Ulz (whatever he sings orplays) crashing and reverberating through their skulls, eachmember with a dog-eared copy of this issue of ETC. in hispocket. The most interesting semantic point made by contributors tothis issue is that under the influence of psychedelic drugs, oneis "freed" from the categories and symbolizationsthrough which our experience is ordinarily presented to us,bundled, prepackaged, and labeled in terms of the linguisticconventions (and therefore perceptual habits) of the culture. To"transcend" these cultural imperatives is asserted tobe an "expanding" of consciousness, so that one seesafresh—presumably as if one were a little child again. But is such "transcending" necessarily beneficial?It is obviously an advantage if you have long been cursed withinappropriate "maps" of the "territory" ofreality. From seeing afresh, you might start making better maps.It is an advantage, too, if you have long treated the map as ifit were the territory—that is, if you are so engrossed inthe world of symbolism as to have forgotten what the symbolsstand for. But what if, like a good poet or scientist, you have longbeen accustomed to seeing the world with "consciousness ofabstracting"? What if you have used symbols properly, sothat you have remained constantly aware of the realities behindthe symbols—of the complex, uncategorizable, squirming"beknottedness of space-time" behind the categories?The process of abstracting, of creating classifications andmaking the symbols that stand for them, are the normal andnecessary survival mechanisms of the human class of life. What isso wonderful about suspending this great, uniquely human process,except where the process has gone awry? As Weston La Barre saidin this connection, "It is not immediately evident that anabnormal toxic functioning of an adaptive organ, the brain, isnecessarily a supernormal functioning…"* I do not doubt that dangerous substances such as LSDtemporarily shake us up and cause us to "transcend"habitual ways of experiencing. But transcending of itself is notenough. What happens afterward? In what ways are perceptions ofthe self or the environment altered or restructured for thebetter? What conditions produce what changes? The contributors tothis issue, I am sorry to say, touch on these questions butlightly. The fact that symbolic processes often go awry is, of course,well known to general semanticists, who have their ownprescriptions as to what to do about it. These involve, asKorzybski said, learning to experience at nonverbal levels,refraining from "bursting into speech," and maintaining"silence, within and without."** These also involvelearning to establish a constant interplay between experientialand higher levels of abstraction, checking each level againstthose below, and all of them against the realities of the world.Disciplines such as these are not easy to master. They involvefor many of us the upsetting of cherished ideas and therelinquishing of many long-ingrained automatism of thought andspeech. They also involve time-time to re-experience theworld, time to examine carefully both language and the world itpurportedly describes, in order painfully and painstakingly todevelop a better language. General semantics, like many otherdisciplines offering deliverance from the world of illusion andself- delusion, offers no easy path to enlightenment. However, we live in an advertising culture. ROLAIDS offers usinstant relief from indigestion. CLAIROL offers instant youth andbeauty. The new MUSTANG makes instant Casanovas out of CasperMilquetoasts. Is it any wonder that there lurks in many of us ahope that a product can be found that offers instant relief fromall spiritual ills—instant insight, instant satori? The full appreciation of art or literature or music requiresyears of study, years of experience and exposure to master works.But under LSD, tremendous "esthetic" and"creative" experiences are said to be accessible,instantly and without effort. "You got a televisionset?" asked one hipster of another. "No, man," wasthe reply. "I just turn on and watch the wallpaper."(If the reader thinks this is a caricature of what is claimed forthe psychedelic experience, let him read on!) Is there anymeaningful sense in which such hallucinatory experiences can betermed "esthetic" or "creative"? But perhaps my basic reason for distrusting the dependence on"mind-expanding" drugs is that most people haven'tlearned to use the senses they possess. Speaking only for myself,I not only hear music; I listen to it when it isaround, so that I find Muzak and other background music, intendedto be heard but not listened to, utterly intolerable. When I am,in Carl Rogers' terms, open to my experience, I find the colorsof the day, whether gray and foggy and muted or bright andsunlit, such vivid experiences that I sometimes pound my steeringwheel with excitement. A neon-lit supermarket is often too muchfor me—so terribly rich in angles and colors and dizzyingperspectives that I must deliberately narrow my perceptions tothe things on my grocery list lest I take forever to do theshopping. Paintings and sculptures and ceramics get me sointensely excited that I often come out of a museum higher than akite. In short, I use my senses—at least some ofthem, some of the time. And I say, why disorient your beautifulsenses with drugs and poisons before you have half discoveredwhat they can do for you? I find myself in sharp disagreement, therefore, with myfriends who have contributed to this issue. They are still mydear friends despite disagreements. I hope I remain theirs. * Weston La Barre, in a review of Utopiates: The Use andUsers of LSD-25, American Anthropologist, 67 (1965),596. Italics supplied. ** See A.

MOGAR The objective level . . . remains fundamentally unspeakable. [It] is not words, can not be reached by words alone, and has nothing to do with 'good' and 'bad.' —ALFRED KORZYBSKI In this strident era of over-communication, we are more likely to perish by the word than by the sword, and least of all to perish by a loving silence. —IHAB HASSAN AS THE CONTENTS of this issue make clear, theconsciousness-expanding drugs and the states they produce havedirect relevance to a wide range of fields and disciplines aswell as many aspects of modern culture. It is not surprising thenthat general semantics—with its broad applicability, itstrans-disciplinary orientation, and its concern with social aswell as scientific issues—provides a useful framework forcomprehending psychedelic phenomena. Similarly, it seems lessthan a coincidence that five papers were submitted almostsimultaneously to ETC., each examining some aspect of thisclass of experiences using the principles of general semantics.The decision to devote an entire issue to the psychedelics wasprompted also by the concerted effort of these writers totranscend the emotionalism and pro-con zeal characterizingmuch of the literature to date. Since most of the papers werewritten by students of general semantics rather than primaryinvestigators of these phenomena, each article has been commentedupon by a recognized authority on some aspect of thepsychedelics. In planning the issue, an attempt was made tomaximize diversity among contributors so as to present a broadbut comprehensive coverage and to include as many viewpoints aspossible. Modern Man Plagued by Overabstraction SINCE psychedelic substances have been known and ingestedthroughout man's history, the increasing interest and fascinationgenerated recently seem particularly significant. The reasonsbehind this widespread attraction (or avoidance) are of coursemultiple and complex. Although presently unclear, one generalreason can be identified: Either as a means of investigatinghigher thought processes or as a potentially valuable personalexperience, the LSD-induced state is intriguing because it mesheswith the zeitgeist in the social sciences and with majortrends in the larger culture. There is considerable evidence and commentary from a varietyof quarters which support this contention. As a case in point,Aldous Huxley's prolific writings give eloquent testimony to adominant theme in contemporary thought; namely, the strangelyambivalent relationship between culture and the individual. We are at once the beneficiaries of our culture and its victims.... Culture and that pre-condition of all culture, language, have made possible all the achievements of talent and sanctity. They have also given us fanaticism, superstition . . . nationalistic idolatry, and mass-murder in the name of God.1 Huxley showed a life-long preoccupation with the artificialpolarities which have continually plagued Western man. LikeKorzybski, Huxley anticipated by a quarter of a century WilliamBarrett's pronouncement that the most formidable problem facingman in the twentieth century is the conciliation of opposites.Huxley wrestled persistently with the contrived antagonismerected between the scientific and the poetic, mind and body,reason and impulse. He was one of the few men of modern timesdeeply aware of the essential union and coexistence of opposites.It is perhaps significant that a man who felt equally at homewith contemporary science and art, mystical states of awareness,and general semantics should write three books and many articlesdevoted to psychedelic phenomena. The ambivalence of man toward the culture he has inheritedand continually creates, articulated so incisively by Huxley, hasreached new heights in the present era. On the one hand, we haveat our command a technology capable of making the lives of menhealthy, safe, and reasonably secure for the first time inhistory. Until recently, the motive power of civilization,particularly in Western cultures, has necessarily focused onsurvival and environmental mastery. In Maslow's terms, theorganismic equilibrium made possible by satiated bodily needs,physical safety, and some measure of psychological security isprerequisite to more uniquely human pursuits. This hierarchicalconception of man's strivings depicts him as a self-directedcreature with impulses toward growth and self-enhancement as wellas homeostatic maintenance.2 To the degree thatMaslow's humanistic image of man engages the modern temper, therealization of human potentialities should reach unprecedentedheights in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, many writers, impressed with theprogressive subordination of personal identity to what ErikErikson calls the "technological superidentity," do notforesee any greater actualizing of man's vast personal resources.Particular attention has been called to our ultra-rationalcommitment to structured, controlled forms of experience; thatis, the restricted range of experience sanctioned by publicconsensus. A corollary to this feature of modern culture is ourinordinate investment in language and higher-order abstractionsat the expense of nonverbal experience and nonverbalcommunication. In this connection, L. L. Whyte refers to the"western dissociation," a division of mind and bodywhich scientific-industrial society has pushed almost to thelimit of endurance.3 More recently, Burton and Kantorhave noted: As a culture attains higher forms, it desiccates itself by abstractions and reduces the immediacy of personal experience. The prevalent cry of alienation and "loss of meaning" today is just that quality of culture which denies the body and ignores the integrative aspects of its impulses.4 The paradoxical relationship between language and experiencehas been well stated by Robert Cohen: It is most impelling to observe how verbal language, which evolved as an instrument to describe, to define, to sing, to acquaint man with the thoughts of another, which binds time and makes each man heir to the efforts of his brother (and a potential slave to the past) can destroy its maker.... This possibility arises from a lessened ability to recognize and hence respond to important fundamental sense impressions.5 LSD and the Corrective Measures of Korzybski AS STUDENTS of general semantics are well aware, the problemsalluded to by these representative writers were explicitlyrecognized by Korzybski. Science and Sanity depicts ingraphic detail the "unsane" consequences of"identifying or confusing words with objects and feelings,or memories and ideas with experiences which belong to theun-speakable objective level."6 It is throughlack of consciousness of abstracting that objectification,identification, and allness occur—habits of thought whichnarrow and restrict human consciousness rather than heighten it.Korzybski considered consciousness of the abstraction process themost effective safeguard against these semantic restraints andthe key to further human evolution. Consciousness of abstractionwas defined as "awareness that in our process of abstractingwe have left out characteristics."7 Stateddifferently, an individual apprehends himself and his world fullyand accurately to the degree that he continually translateshigher-order abstractions back to the naive sensory level,becoming experientially aware of the discrepancy betweenconceptualization and sense impression. Today there is a growing recognition of the semantic dangersdescribed by Korzybski and a greater appreciation of thecorrective measures he recommended. For example, in order tocounteract the destructive consequences of"surplus-repression" (intensional thought?), HerbertMarcuse suggested the cultivation of "libidinalrationality" (consciousness of abstraction?)—a processwhich would abolish elementalism and reintegrate humanexperience.8 Similarly, the literary critic, IhabHassan, has noted: For the neo-Freudians {viz., Norman 0. Brown}, the problem is repression, abstraction, and the solution is the construction of a Dionysian ego. In their view, language ultimately becomes "the natural speech of the body," a phrase adopted from Rilke.9 These semantic problems and prescriptions account in part forthe current interest in the drug-induced psychedelic experienceand its potential value as a therapeutic or educative device. Asthe contributors to this volume make clear, the LSD- stateincreases one's ability "to recognize and hence respond tofundamental sense impressions" without semantic barriers.The freshness of perception and feeling of unity whichcharacterize the experience suggest that the "is" ofidentity is temporarily eliminated. Like the structuraldifferential method devised by Korzybski, the LSD experience maybe viewed as nonverbal training in nonidentity. At its best thepsychedelic state permits the subject to evaluate with somedetachment (1) the structure of his semantic framework (itssimilarity to reality), and (2) his semantic reactions (so thatthey take place more on the silent objective level). These twokinds of learning experience were recommended by Korzybski as themost effective means of increasing consciousness of abstracting.10 In the present era, the press of cultural demands on theindividual, symbolized by an undue emphasis on language andconventional modes of perception, are perhaps greater and feltmore keenly than a generation ago. While recognizing that"it takes a good 'mind' to be 'insane,'11Korzybski noted that "the average person 1933 must beconsidered pathological."12 From a similarperspective, Nettler has succinctly stated our current dilemma: We may have to choose between the "health" of the man who behaves badly because he sees accurately, and the "health" of the man who behaves nicely because he has learned the popular (i.e., socially self-delusional) way of seeing falsely.13 LSD and the Search for Meaning IN THIS CONNECTION, it is important to note that interest inthe psychedelic experience is heavily concentrated among theupper-middle class, intellectual-professional strata of society;among healthy, well-adjusted people according to standardcriteria of normality. The type of self-dissatisfaction expressedby this segment of our population seems consistent with thecultural climate mentioned earlier. More specifically, the natureof human discontent in a modern technological (and affluent)society has been undergoing rapid and profound change. In recentyears, artists and scholars representing every field of endeavorhave flooded the various media of communication with discussionsof the quest for identity and meaning, the decline of traditionalvalues and religion, modern man's deep sense of alienation, andthe advent of science as a way of life. The current interest inhumanistic psychology, oriental philosophy, existentialpsychiatry, self-actualization, and psychedelic drugsrepresents reactions to these trends and offers solace to the"encapsulated man" living in an age of "stridentover-communication" Similarly, the conventional neuroses andcharacter disorders are in decline, being replaced by what onewriter termed the philosophical neurosis.14 It maywell be as some critics suggest that orthodox psychotherapy withits emphasis on early childhood conflicts and social adjustmentis already obsolete. Many individuals who understand all too wellthe antecedents of their behavior still feel unfulfilled and findtheir lives lacking in significance and purpose. In the light of what seems to be an incompatibility betweenpsychotherapy as traditionally conceived, on the one hand, andthe nature of modern discontent, on the other, it is notsurprising that many people who fit this description express aninterest in the psychedelic experience and find their way to LSD.A case in point is the almost four hundred voluntary subjects whohave undergone a large-dose LSD session at the InternationalFoundation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, California.Approximately one-third of the total sample did not presentcomplaints of a psychiatric nature and revealed minimal neuroticsymptomology according to both diagnostic evaluation andpsychological test data. Consistent with the independentassessment, the interest expressed by these subjects in thepsychedelic experience seemed to be "growth-motivated"rather than "deficiency- motivated."15 Somewere dimly aware of potentialities or personal aptitudes whichthey hoped to activate and develop more fully. Others expressed afeeling of emptiness and lack of meaningful purpose whileadequately meeting the exigencies of life. Still others sought adeeper understanding or more satisfying resolutions to problemsof an existential nature. Being relatively free of emotional disturbance, thesesubjects were more likely to grapple with fundamental problemsduring the LSD experience. In addition to examining self-identityand the relationship between self and non-self, questions oflove, death, creation, and the conciliation of opposites receivedfrequent attention. Follow-up interviews, clinical ratings, andsubjective reports indicated that these subjects benefitedconsiderably from the psychedelic experience along the lines ofself-actualization, richer creative experience, and enhancementof specific abilities and talents. Although extremely tentativeat this point, these preliminary findings are at least suggestiveof the ways in which these powerful agents might be employed toexplore and enhance human consciousness. Research: Current Status and Future Trends SINCE more than three hundred studies on the use of LSD-25 asa therapeutic agent have been reported, only the most salient andconsistent findings will be summarized.16 Despitegreat diversity in the conduct of these studies, impressiveimprovement rates have been almost uniformly reported, with bothadults and children, and in group as well as individualpsychotherapy. Used in conjunction with traditionalpsychotherapy, or as a primary vehicle for inducing rapidpersonality change, LSD has been found to facilitate improvementin patients representing the complete spectrum of neurotic,psychosomatic, and character disorders. Particularly noteworthyare the positive results obtained with cases highly resistant toconventional forms of therapy. High remission rates amongalcoholics, for example, have frequently been reported followinga single, large-dose LSD session. Based on their findings withmore than one thousand alcoholics, Hoffer and his coworkersconcluded that LSD was twice as effective as any other treatmentprogram.17 Other chronic conditions carrying a poorprognosis which have responded favorably to psychedelic therapyinclude sexual deviations, criminal psychopathy, autism inchildren, and adolescent behavior disorders. When employed as an adjunct to psychotherapy, mostinvestigators have associated the beneficial effects of LSD withreduced defensiveness, the reliving of early childhoodexperiences, increased access to unconscious material, andgreater emotional expression. In contrast, when used as a primaryvehicle for rapid personality change, emphasis is usually placedon the transcendental quality of the experience, the re-synthesisof basic values and beliefs, and major changes in therelationship between self and environment. Since most reports on the therapeutic effectiveness of LSDhave been based on clinical judgments of questionablereliability, it is worth noting that comparable results have beenobtained by investigators in many other countries. The likelihoodof a significant positive bias is further lessened by the widelydivergent theoretical persuasions represented in this research.These include Freudian, Jungian, behavioristic, existentialist,and a variety of eclectic orientations. It seems safe to concludefrom the breadth and consistency of the clinical evidence thatLSD can produce far-reaching beneficial effects in some people,under some conditions. However, controlled studies of the processvariables involved have yet to be conducted. Specifically, inwhat ways do various kinds of people respond to LSD, both duringthe experience and afterward? What are the optimal conditions ofadministration for given objectives? How can we account for thevarious kinds and extent of change which follow an LSDexperience? In short, despite the mass of accumulated data on theoutcome of psychedelic therapy, relationships among processvariables remain obscure. Primarily because of the controversy surrounding thesechemical agents (which interestingly is confined to the UnitedStates), controlled research aimed at maximizing safety,effectiveness, and applicability has barely begun. In addition toquestions concerning the potential uses of LSD as a therapeuticor educative device, its possible value as a basic research toolfor investigating higher mental processes and their relationshipto behavior has also been minimally explored. Although theclinical evidence and testimonial reports indicate that LSDpromises to be a valuable tool for both the study and enhancementof cognitive and perceptual functioning, such claims have beenneither supported nor refuted by means of controlled studies.Other hypotheses readily testable include the often notedsimilarity of the psychedelic experience to certain phases of thecreative process and its possible relationship to other alteredstates of consciousness such as hypnosis, transcendentalexperiences, identity crises, and dream states. Psychological Interpretations of the Psychedelic Experience AN ALMOST INVARIANT effect of the psychedelics, cuttingacross the wide range of individual reactions, is anextraordinary alteration in perception. This usually takes theform of intensified sensory acuity in all modalities and ablurring of self-nonself boundaries. Whether expanded awarenessor increased insight accompany these unhabitual perceptions andaltered frames of reference is not a function of the chemicalagent. In contrast to the earlier search for"drug-specific" effects of LSD, it is now generallyrecognized that the nature, intensity, and content of theexperience are the resultant of complex transactions between thesubject's past history and personality, the set and expectanciesof both subject and administrator, and the physical andpsychological environment in which the experience takes place.Importantly, most of these determinants can be intentionallyarranged and manipulated so as to foster either a propitious or astressful experience. Based on data obtained from a large sampleof cases, Harman noted that when the context of the experience isoptimized, the subject "is able to re- examine hisrelationships with others, his attitudes and values, his beliefsabout his own nature and that of the world he lives in—allwith unusual nonattachment and freedom from threat."18Similarly, in a careful study of 690 administrations of LSD,Chandler and Hartman concluded that: . . . the drug does not appear to produce any serious or marked impairment in the major ego functions. The patient remains oriented for person, place, and time. He does not appear to lose contact with everyday reality . . . he can withdraw his awareness from the physical reality of the moment and allow his attention to become completely absorbed by the phenomena at the deeper psychic levels, but he retains the ability to focus his awareness back on to external objective reality whenever he chooses...19 The striking similarity between this state and certain phasesof the creative process has been described by Frank Barron20and demonstrated in a study of thirty artists given LSD. Inpsychoanalytic terms, the psychedelic experience resembles a"regression in the service of the ego" or a merging ofimpulse and realistic thinking. In the light of the culturaltrends noted earlier, it is noteworthy that this capacity toblend primary and secondary processes has been recognizedrecently as a condition of superior functioning or positivemental health. Irnportantly, there is some evidence indicatingthat individuals tend to display more of this ability followingan LSD session as well as during the psychedelic experienceitself. If conditions are favorable, the experience and itsaftermath have much in common with a self-actualizing "peakexperience." 21 The process of transformationoperative in such cases seems highly similar to Erik Erikson'spenetrating analysis of the "identity crisis" as acatalyst for rapid personal growth.22 A number of studies have demonstrated that relatively stableindividual characteristics (for example, personality) are asimportant as set and setting in determining response to LSD. In astudy of changes in values and beliefs, personality, andbehavioral patterns in major life areas, Mogar and Savage foundthat the nature, magnitude, and stability of post-LSD changeswere related to personality variables and modal defense patterns.23As might be expected, subjects with a well-defined but flexibleself-structure responded most favorably to the drug, while thosewith either underdeveloped or overly rigid ego defenses respondedleast favorably. This differential finding parallels thedistinction often made between the creative process and psychoticstates. An analysis of imaginal responses to the Rorschach ledHolt and Havel to conclude: We find primary process thinking in conscious subjects either out of strength or out of weakness. In the former case, it is more likely to appear in a playful or esthetic frame of reference, accompanied by pleasant affect. If, on the other hand, primary thinking breaks through the usual defenses uninvited and unwanted, the subject may feel anxious or threatened and is likely to act defensively.24 Like the psychedelic experience, both creative and psychoticstates are characterized by greater access to unconsciousmaterial. However, in contrast to the regressive quality ofpsychosis, creativity involves a temporary and voluntarybreaking up of perceptual constancies which permits theindividual "to shake free from dead literalism, to recombinethe old familiar elements into new, imaginative, amusing, orbeautiful patterns."25 Despite these importantdifferences, it should be emphasized that altered states ofconsciousness, whether willfully induced, stress-induced, ordrug-induced, all favor sensation and image over word-concept.This type of deviation from conventional perception will bewelcomed and valuable rather than feared and harmful to thedegree that the psychological and social context of theexperience are congenial to the needs of a particular individual.As it was stressed earlier, systematic research into therelationship among relevant factors must be conducted before"optimum" conditions can be reliably specified forgiven objectives and subjects. LSD As Training in Visualization IN THE LIGHT of the cardinal features of the psychedelicexperience and its apparent similarity to the creative process,it is worth noting that each contributor to this issue makes somereference to the rupture which often exists between experienceand language. As indicated previously, awareness of the causes,correlates, and consequences of this basic human problem is nolonger a unique concern of general semantics. On the contrary, itis now widely recognized as a dominant theme in contemporarythought. As a phenomenon of modern culture, the psychedelicexperience highlights this central problem and suggests one meansof alleviating it. There is some indication that LSD will prove effective as amethod of nonaristotelian training producing greater semanticflexibility. As an aid to sane, creative living, Korzybskiemphasized the need to "visualize our theories." Thesoundness of this recommendation has been dramatically confirmedby Albert Einstein: The words of the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities in my case are . . . visual and some of muscular type. Conventional words and other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage.26 It has been suggested that psychedelic drugs facilitate theconversion of semantic reactions into sensations and images. Inthis respect, there is a striking similarity between the LSDexperience and "training in visualization whichautomatically abolishes objectification, identification, andallness."27 Korzybski's description of thisvisualization process reads like countless reports of psychedelicexperiences. . . . the higher abstractions are translated back into new lower abstractions, which are closer to life. Such an individual "sees," "visualizes," has "intuitions," in his symbolic interplays. He then has a new structural vision through a new survey of his own experiences and all the experiences of others when translated in terms of lower centres. He gains a deeper insight, which he ultimately makes useful to all of us.28 In commenting on the growing distrust of language as a mediumof expression among contemporary artists, Ihab Hassan sums up thefascination and promise symbolized (if not actualized) by thepsychedelics: "The story is really a very old one. To hearagain, to see again, to feel again, and perhaps sometimes to lovewhat is seen or heard or felt...."29 IN THE FOLLOWNG pages, each contributor describes some aspectof the class of experiences associated with the ingestion of apsychedelic agent. Yet the emphasis is clearly on a broad arrayof experiences or states of consciousness which have been inducedby a variety of means, throughout man's history, and in everyculture of the world. If nothing else, the current advent ofperception-altering chemical agents calls attention to ourtraditional neglect of novel thoughts and impulses. These papersalso demonstrate an important application of general semantics toyet another facet of man's behavior and experience.

MARSH MANY READERS of the Sunday supplements are familiar with thenames, if not the operational characteristics, of at least threeof the new "brain-changing" drugs: LSD-25, psilocybin(popularized as "the magic mushroom"), and mescaline, aderivative of the now-notorious peyote plant used by members ofthe Native American (Indian) Church in their religiousceremonies. These three drugs have been publicized, often inlurid prose, by journalists more interested in their news valuethan in their chemical properties. The sensation-seeking reader has been told that a cult ofsuburban intellectuals and city-dwelling beatniks has grown uparound these drugs. He knows that the drugs have the power ofproducing strange visions, and he suspects them of producingstrange forms of behavior. What he does not suspect is that thereis a serious possibility that the drugs will one day be a boon tomankind. Whether they will or not remains to be seen. Meanwhile, amongserious students of the drugs, a war rages over the questionwhich may prove to be among the most critical in history. One group claims big things. Thanks to the drugs and theircapacity for expanding human consciousness, they say, psychiatryis at a turning point, and Utopia itself may be upon us before weknow it. 1Another group is darkly dubious. The new drugs will lead us, theyfear, not into Utopia but into psychosis, and in a pinch could beused by a future dictator as an insidious adjunct to thoughtcontrol. 2 This division of opinion, as so often happens, is reflectedin a division of terminology. Early experimenters with the drugs,hypothesizing that they had the power of inducing in an ingestanta short-term model psychosis complete with hallucinations andparanoid delusions of grandeur and persecution, dubbed them"psychotomimetic." Experience showed, however, thatsome ingestants persistently refused to retreat into psychosis,even on a short-term basis, but instead blossomed out with avariety of positively healthy symptoms and began to reportextraordinary spontaneous increases in self-insight. Soeventually the word "psychedelic" was coined3 as analternative to "psychotomimetic.""Psychedelic," by way of its Greek origins, meanssimply "mind-manifesting." It implies that the newdrugs do not so much drive an ingestant into a state of psychosisas to open out his mind, whatever its characteristics, making itavailable for inspection. Whether the new drugs are psychotomimetic or psychedelic,then—whether they diminish or enlarge—is the issue. Ifthey reduce us to the condition of crazy men, they may possesslimited value in carefully controlled psychiatric research, butthey are scarcely promising as a vehicle for mass liberation. If,however, they endow us with self-knowledge, manifesting to us ourown minds, their promise is great. Broadly, the commentators on the new drugs have tended to beeither psychotomimeticists or psychedelicists. They have tendedeither to view the drugs with suspicion as potentially dangeroussources of mental disturbance or to view them optimistically asuseful, almost magical means to self-discovery andself-actualization. In-between positions have been taken, ofcourse, but perhaps not so frequently as the facts warrant. THERE ARE at least three reasons, all of them semantic, forthe prevalence of this two-valued attitude. First, there is thefact that the language available for talking about the drugexperience is simply not equal to the task. Dr. Timothy Leary haswritten about this elsewhere in this issue of ETC. Theessence of the problem, in the opinion of the present writer, isthat a process cannot be stored in a box. The static,subject-predicate, thing-and-properties language we haveinherited from our culture does not easily contain the shifting,dynamic, flowing experience undergone by the drug ingestant. Theexperience is nondual and infinitely valued. Language isdualistic and two-valued. Attempting to express the drugexperience in language is like trying to stuff the cosmos into atrunk. Then there is the prevailing Western attitude toward thebody, one of Puritan distrust. We tend to feel that things of themind and spirit should be somehow remote and unbodied. To suggestthat the mind is a function of the brain and can therefore beunlocked by a drug is to suggest the vaguely indecent. What isgood for us should not be come by too easily and should not bequite pleasant. Furthermore, the spirit should be kept clear ofthe body or else ignored altogether. Finally, we are confronted by a special form ofguilt-by-association. A certain number of "far out,beat" people have obtained black market supplies of the newbrain-changing drugs and taken them for kicks. Some have thentalked about their experiences in a jazzy, flippant way. As aresult many responsible people have felt both repelled andthreatened, consequently falling into the semantic trap ofimputing to the drugs the characteristics of the consumers andcondemning the drugs themselves as intrinsically bad. For these three reasons and others, objectivity about thedrugs is difficult. The drugs are extraordinarily difficult totalk about. This is unfortunate, since the way they are talkedabout determines to a large extent the way they operate, whetherthey are positively psychedelic or negatively psychotomimetic. MANY responsible investigators emphasize the importance of"set and setting" in determining the effects of thedrugs.4 The subject's expectations, his mood at thetime of drug ingestion, and the physical and social environmentapparently determine, to a considerable extent, the nature of thesubjective experience. If the experience is approached in anattitude of scientific curiosity combined with a sort ofreverence for the possibilities of human inwardness, the resultswill be quite different from what they will be if one takes thedrug as though he were going on a binge. Since one's attitudesare shaped so much by one's language and may even be inseparablefrom it, it matters how one chooses to speak about the experiencebefore, during, and afterward.5 It matters alsowhether one takes the drug with the half-guilty expectation ofgoing out of his mind or in the serene confidence that he will bebrought to himself. In short, the drug experience is like any experience: itsmeaning lies primarily within the person, not within the drug,which merely liberates. What it liberates into, insanity orecstatic insight, depends on the subject and the circumstances. Thus the drug experience is a semantic experience. It is theexperience of creating and discovering meanings. There is perhapsno more fruitful way of looking at it than this: that it sheds agood deal of light on the communication process and on thediscipline of general semantics. There is an extraordinary numberof ways in which it does this, but, owing to lack of space, onlyseven will be discussed. 1. The release of the symbolizing function. Theincredible human capacity for symbol and image production isdriven home forcibly to many people who consume one of the drugsor browse in the literature. Huxley, Watts, Leary, Dunlap,Newland, and others have written vividly and sometimes eloquentlyabout this. The present author, at the time of his firstLSD-ingestion, was stunned to discover the fantastic fertility ofhis own image- and symbol-producing centers under the impact ofthe drug. He underwent the experience of birth, felt himselftransformed into mythological persons, floated graciously throughlovely caverns of sparkling ice and splendid gold-encrustedGothic cathedrals, and watched in awe as jeweled patterns formedand reformed in an endless variety of living mandalar shapes,fourfold marvels of incredible beauty modulating into endlessvariations of themselves, dissolving into spinning galaxies ofinfinite dimension and significance, or lapsing into marvelouslyunique free-forms dancing in total spontaneity throughunpredictable patterns of absolute wonder. Above all, there was the experience of light. This appearedin many forms: as a "diamond center" of incredibleluster (and somehow, too, of incredible significance); aspatterned living flame, shaping itself into fourfoldconfigurations in a sort of visual equivalent to the music comingfrom the phonograph; as music itself visible, apprehendeddirectly by the inner eye in the form of three-dimensional shapesglowing from within; and as shining fields, banks, walls,fortresses, trees and rivers of living gems and jewels. We are here led directly into the problem of intensionality.Obviously, this internal splendor was not, as Korzybski wouldsay, extensional. It was not available for public inspection andverification. No one except the author looked on to confirm thereality of the spectacle. And yet its reality seemed beyonddispute; it seemed even to be a reality of a higher order thanthe extensional reality of the public world. It seemed, too, tohave a higher meaning—or rather to be meaning itself, to benot so much a symbolization of another reality as the very act ofsymbolization; not precisely to mean something, but actually tomean meaning as such. KENNETH BOULDING has said that man's capacity to proliferateinternal images is at once his chief glory and his greatesthazard.6 It enables him to elaborate those roadmapswhich get him through life meaningfully, but also those deceptiveroadmaps which lose him in the jungle. In other words, it helpshim to extensionalize as well as to intensionalize.Extensionalization and intensionalization, the public and theprivate, play into each other. The raw, given facts of theuniverse are chaotic and meaningless until some sort of structureis imposed on them, and then they take on meaning and order.7Then they serve as a useful roadmap to get us through life in asufficiently rewarding way. The meaning of things, however, lies not in the things norentirely in us, but rather in a fluent traffic between inner andouter—with particular emphasis on the inner. More precisely,meanings appear to be discovered but in fact are manufactured.Under LSD, we seem to come up against that part of our innerworld where meanings are made, where the patterning processoperates in its pure form. It is a startling experience. One whohas known it is not likely to forget it, and we may speculatethat, having once seen his own intensionality in an isolatedform, one will thereafter be better equipped to persuade it toserve him and less likely to be misled by it to create maps forwhich there are no territories. 2. The experience of unity. One of the most startlingfeatures of the drug experience is that, while one remembers thenames of things with perfect clarity, they no longer seem to himappropriate. This object is called a table and that one is calleda chair, just as before, but there is now seen to be somethingrichly amusing about the process of labeling them. One's eyes areopened. The difference between the table and the chair is stillperceived as real enough, but it is also perceived as entirelyarbitrary, a conventional distinction that could well be replacedby an infinity of other distinctions equally conventional. The unity of all things becomes suddenly apparent withblazing simplicity. The opposites rush together like a clap ofthunder. Each separate quality, normally perceptible only bycontrast with its opposite, is still perceptible as a separatequality, only now the illusoriness of its separateness isapparent. Big and little, wet and dry, pain and pleasure are nolonger seen as polar pairs but rather as points on a continuum.So, likewise, are ugliness and beauty, love and hate, femininityand masculinity, and all the rest. So, most particularly, aresameness and otherness, the LSD experient discovering to hisamazement and joy that the separateness that divides him fromothers is a masquerade for the identity that connects him This may be interpreted as a mystical doctrine, to be sureand as such it will be sufficiently annoying or meaningless tothe more rigidly positivistic. But the more flexibly inclinedwill recognize the semantic soundness of the perception that thethings and qualities which fill our lives are, to some extent atleast, verbal constructions that are capable of passing away withthe passing away of the names that gave them birth. 3. Seeing through the game. Of all the benefits of thedrug experience, this is perhaps the greatest and the mostlong-lasting. The author, a college professor, remembers duringhis third LSD experience staring at the physician who hadadministered the drug with the awed and liberating awareness thatthe man was no more a doctor than he himself was a professor.Both the "professor" and the "doctor,"although duly certificated by the proper authorities, were, itnow appeared, manifestly frauds. What's more, the discoveryproved liberating and refreshing in the extreme. Twogame-players, one hiding behind the doctor role, the otherplaying at being a professor, had come out from their costumes,abandoned the game, and, thanks to LSD, now sat confronting eachother in a condition of headlong and naked reality. The feelingof lightness and release was incredible. TIMOTHY LEARY is among those who have emphasized thegame-like nature of most human behavior as well as LSD's capacityfor liberating one from the tyranny of games. He has defined agame as an acquired cultural sequence characterized by roles,rules, goals, rituals, language, values, and strategies.8 This is avery comprehensive definition which covers virtually every formof human behavior, especially those not shared with otheranimals. Leary has been attacked for this by critics who objectthat to abandon one's games would be to abandon most meaningfulhuman activity including, for example, the "game" ofscience. Actually, of course, one does not abandon the"scientific game" or any other "acquired culturalsequence" provided it is serviceable. But, if he is wise,one does attempt to see through the games he plays andcontinually to ask the question: Is this game nowthe best one to play in order to actualize my humanpossibilities? To reject all games, to reject all "roles,rules, goals, rituals, language, values, and strategies," isto reject civilization itself, along with sanity, maturity,meaning, and all possibility of being human instead of merelyanimal. But to take them all seriously is equally destructive ormore so. There are arguments for both conservatism andliberalism, and one can choose between dying the death ofossification and dying the death of formlessness. On the whole,however, the first seems the more terrifying prospect. In any case, six hours' freedom from the tyranny of the ego,a holiday enjoyed by many who have consumed LSD, is likely topredispose one unfavorably against ever again granting it theabsolute sway to which it is accustomed. The ego is the socialgame par excellence, absolutely necessary to our survivaland yet tyrannously opposed to our growth and our deepestsatisfaction. Jay Haley has amusingly yet incisively exposed itsinfinitely subtle maneuvers in that ongoing game of one-upmanship called psychoanalysis.9 The ego, he says, isthe organ of one-upmanship, always striving to get one-up or stayone-up, and hence always restless and anxious. Following ananonymous English scholar, Haley suggests that the analysis willbe spontaneously and successfully terminated when the patientreaches the "point where he doesn't really care whether theanalyst is in control of the relationship or whether he is incontrol."10 At that point the patient is cured.He has seen through the game, and though his ego still functionsas the integrative principle which holds his personalitytogether, it has become transparent and no longer dominates theself. Prolonged psychotherapy is no doubt necessary before the egowill permanently accept its role as servant instead of master ofthe self. The LSD experience, however, can give the ingestant astartling glimpse of what life would be like if the ego could bepersuaded to relax its grip. This might well facilitate theprocess of therapy, just as the process of therapy serves to makethe LSD experience richer and deeper. In any case the game-like,linguistic, and conventional nature of the ego is often lucidlyapparent to the LSD ingestant. 4. Receptivity. All points in the communication cycleare important, but perhaps in our anxious age it is the receptionof messages which gives particular trouble. Most of us encodewillingly enough, but we are not, as a rule particularlyinterested in decoding. We talk, but we don't listen. We turn onthe radio, then ignore it. We are eager to impress others, butnot to hear them. Under LSD many people learn, for the first time, what itmeans to be absolutely present. Since they have temporarilyrenounced their games and seen through their own need to beone-up, they can afford to be aware of whatever the environment,external or internal, may happen to present without wishing tochange it. For the moment, at least, they have nothing to lose bylistening. They may even dare listen to themselves, perhaps forthe first time. Under these conditions, extraordinary things can occur. Otherpeople may be seen as precious, infinitely complex, and quitemiraculous. The physical environment may become altogetherstartling. One may feel that he is looking not at a book, atable, or a chair, but at The Book, The Table, or The Chair. Toparaphrase Aldous Huxley, the Absolute seems to blaze forth fromall around one.11 Music becomes incredible: Oldwarhorses like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony become fresh andpowerful again. A record of a choir hunched around a microphonein a remote recording studio quite literally fills the room withangels. The music becomes textured and alive. It may even becomevisible and glow with an inner light. Paintings move and open up to reveal new dimensions. Colorsbecome intense and preternaturally vibrant. Objects in nature,such as mountains and trees, shine with beauty and drip withsignificance. One's internal world opens up to one, both therepressed world of the personal unconscious and the pre-existent,archetypal realm of the collective unconscious. One looks in uponwhat Huxley calls the "antipodes of the mind," i.e.,the world of Visionary Experience.12 The creatures,the gardens, the pools of light he sees there fill him with aweand peace. SEMANTICALLY, the condition of being absolutely present tothe outer and the inner reality has at least two advantages.First, it allows a person to tune in on that feedback, bothexternal and internal, which enables him to correct his ownerrors in encoding. He is able to reduce the noise level in thevarious communication systems in which he is involved byre-encoding his message streams until they convey the meaningsthat he intends them to convey. Secondly, it allows a person toinhabit the world of the actual, the world of fact, instead ofthe unreal and empty world of the prefabricated abstraction. Itallows him to experience the world instead of merely thinkingabout it and hence, perhaps, to begin to live in it at last. InHuxley's words: To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and unconditionally . . . this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.13 5. Awareness of the shadow. This Jungian expression isused because of its vividness. In Jung's conception, the shadowis the repressed, dark side of the personality, a countertype ofthe collective, adapted side, which is bathed in the"light" of consciousness, so to speak. It is the sourceof much that is awkward and "evil" in human behavior,although paradoxically its liberation may result in a certainamount of "good." This is because the shadow containswithin it not only the destructive and vicious elements of thepersonality but also much that only appears wicked and Satanicbut which is, in fact, merely unknown, untried, and unaccepted.In theological symbolism, God is at a loss without the eager, iffiery, cooperation of Satan, as Genesis, the Book ofJob, the story of Jesus' temptations, that of the temptationof Buddha by Mara, and other religious myths and documentsattest. Under LSD, the shadow may be explosively liberated. Indeed,this is one of the hazards of the drug, and it is one reason whyits administration should be selective and controlled. The fewrecorded instances in which LSD has been harmful, precipitatingsevere depression, psychosis, and even suicide, are probablycases in which either there has been a "shadowproblem," or something has been amiss with set and setting,or both. If the shadow is poorly integrated with the ego and therest of the personality, its liberation—the upsurge ofrepressed materials from the unconscious—may cause a more orless irreversible panic leading to the disintegration of theself. On the other hand, if the subject's expectations areunhealthy or if the environment contains threatening orforbidding elements, then the release of the shadow even in areasonably well integrated person may be more than he can copewith. But if all candidates for LSD consumption are carefullyscreened, and if the drug is administered under optimumconditions, there appears to be virtually no danger. In any case,one who has experienced a conscious uprush of shadow materialwill not soon forget it, whether it be mild or fierce. Theauthor's reliving of the birth experience (an event which, inJung's language, may have been an archetypal experience as wellas a shadow experience) is a case in point: It was mild in thesense of not being unduly alarming, and yet it was quiteunforgettable. Similarly impressed on the author's memory is thetransformation by which a physician monitoring the LSD experimentbecame alternately brutal devil and shining saint and, on anotheroccasion, that by which a handsome middle-aged woman becamealternately a dewy young virgin and a menacing, toothless witch. The confrontation with the shadow, however, may be fiercerather than mild. It may produce intense anxiety or even wildterror.14 The subject may feel helplessly cut off fromthe rest of the world, or he may people it with monsters of hisown creation. Perfectly benign companions who have only thewelfare of the subject in mind may appear to be degeneratecriminals from whom there is no escape. One may feel as though heis trapped in some diabolical plot engineered by malevolentBeings in a corrupt back alley of the universe. It is notsurprising that under these circumstances subjects have beenknown to attempt violence or flight. And yet, from the semantic standpoint at least, there isgenuine value in such paranoid experiences, provided they aresuccessfully lived through. This value lies in the confirmationthey provide for the reality of projection. The dramaticalteration in appearance undergone by the physician and the womanpreviously mentioned was a purely semantic phenomenon. Thechanges in no sense occurred within the two people but rather inhim who experienced the change. They were entirely changes in themeaning of the people as that meaning was created and thenexternalized by their observer. Similarly, the more alarmingkinds of experience alluded to, such as the transformation offriendly helpers into degenerate monsters, are likewise purelythe result of projection, a fact which becomes dazzlinglyapparent after the effects of the drug recede. A CURIOUS PROPERTY of LSD and the other new drugs is that theperceptual alterations they produce do not ordinarily reach thelevel of hallucination. The ingestant typically retains awarenessthroughout of the altered nature of his perceptions. Publicreality continues to be his reference point. Thus he is able toinspect his own projections as they occur. In extreme cases,however, the ingestant may move in and out of hallucination sothat recognition of his own projections must be deferred. Ineither case the ingestant normally completes the experience witha heightened awareness of his own capacity for creating meaningsthat superficially appear to be external to him. In addition, of course, there are the changes of meaning onediscovers in one's inner world. The retrieval of unconsciousmaterial by psychoanalytical methods may be easily interpreted asa semantic process, a clarification of inner awareness andevaluation. For permanence of results, the psychoanalyticalmethod may be superior to the method of LSD—though this isfar from certain—but the method of LSD is vastly superior inthe respect that the uprush of imagery it provokes is so dramaticand startling as to be unforgettable. 6. The discovery of love. People who have taken LSD donot "know all the answers," nor have they automaticallysolved all their problems by virtue of having consumed the drug.But they often feel peculiarly at ease in one another'spresence—a phenomenon which, when perceived by others, issometimes a source of annoyance because it is liable to bemistakenly interpreted as a sign of clannishness. The reason forthe easiness frequently felt by LSD-ingesters in one another'scompany is simply this: Because they have seen through the game,briefly at least, and because they sense that they are in thepresence of others who have seen through the game, they feel notonly less impelled to attack but also relatively immune fromattack. They feel relatively free to drop their defenses and theother claptrap supporting the ego and simply stand freely andopenly in one another's presence. But there is more than this. Under LSD they have feltlove—perhaps for the first time. The quality of the lovethey have felt is unusual. Thanks to their experience with theshadow and the uprush of forbidden material from that realm, theyhave seen the continuity, the essential unity, of love and hate,and they have (ideally, at least) accepted that unity. In short,they have accepted their feelings—not the "nice"ones only, but the awkward, "bad," embarrassingfeelings as well—and they are comfortable about it. Becausethey have allowed themselves to hate, they can now allowthemselves to love. Because they have admitted that they areafraid, they can now stand quietly secure in each other'spresence. Still more remarkable than this, however, is the factthat they remember what it is like to feel love without jealousyor the necessity of possession. Having seen through the game andhaving found out that bare-faced liar, the ego, they have, atleast a little, renounced the need to be one-up and junked atleast some of the apparatus by which the ego maintains itself. The ego dies hard, of course, but he is perverselyintelligent and his aid may be enlisted in the campaign to subduehimself. People do not consciously wish to suffer, and so the egomay let go its grip a little when it is convinced that to do sois in its own best interests. The ego, having seen its ownunreality, begins to relax: How can I feel jealous of you orrejected by you, how can I wish to possess you, or be possessedby you, if I am you? If my separateness from you is a nameand my identity with you the reality, what do I fear? 7. The attainment of the Self. Implicit in theforegoing is a rudimentary theory of personality. Grosslyoversimplified its main features would be these: SomeLSD-ingestants feel that they have acquired knowledge, throughdirect experience, of an aspect of the self other than the onethey are familiar with. It is as though they had discovered asecond self. This second self is perceived as a kind of UnitarySelf, while the familiar, daily self could be called the game-self. The Unitary Self quite literally shimmers and dazzles. Itconsists of a set of apparently endless dimensions not evident toordinary consciousness but sometimes awesomely present to theconsciousness liberated by LSD. Because of its apparentendlessness, the ingestant may feel that it connects him with allother people and creatures. Hence the term Unitary. The game-self, on the other hand, consists of the accumulatedroles, rules, rituals, goals, language systems, values, andstrategies inherited from one's culture Instead of being unitaryin its action, the game-self tends to be separative. It is theorgan of one-upmanship. While the Unitary Self unites theindividual with other individuals, the game-self sets him againstthem in a subtle contest for social supremacy. When the ingestant discovers his game-self he is liable to besomewhat contemptuous of it. He may feel, under the influence ofthe drug, that he wishes to devote his life to the service of theUnitary Self. Yet, as the effects of the drug ebb away he feelsthe game-self slowly reassert itself. The chief effects of theLSD experience are perhaps due to the interplay of these twoselves. If, following a drug session, the game-self reasserts itselftotally, then the LSD experience has provided kicks and a ratherhaunting memory, but little more. If the game-self does notreassert itself sufficiently, then the ingestant is lost tosociety or he has slipped over into psychosis. If, however, thegame-self and the Unitary Self have to some extentinterpenetrated, so to speak, producing a degree oftransformation in the ingestant's self-concept, then theingestant has taken a step toward that condition ofindividuality-within-relationship which is the true meaning ofpsychological maturity. An ingestant who achieves this feelshimself to be part of society as a whole, even part of the totalcosmos, and yet uniquely himself and valuable in his uniqueness. THE BLISS experienced by some LSD-ingestants results from theexperience of unity with the cosmos. The ingestant feelsessentially one with what he sees as an incredibly gloriouswhole. On the other hand, the terror experienced by someingestants results from their clinging to the game-self, whosepartly fraudulent nature has been exposed by the action of thedrug and whose continued existence in its present form has beenthreatened. This is a point at which psychosis may seem imminent. Let us,therefore, ask our central question once again, the answer towhich may be so crucial to the future of the race: Are the newdrugs psychotomimetic or are they psychedelic, psychosismimicking or mind-manifesting? Which? The answer is conditional on circumstances. Whoever hasexperienced the expansion of consciousness and the unveiling ofthe Unitary Self resulting from one of the drugs can have nodoubts: They are unmistakably psychedelic in their effects. Butwhoever has skirted a psychotic episode—with itsaccompaniments of paranoid terror, violence, flight, and suicidaldepression—knows that the drugs are quite capable of beingpsychotomimetic (and suspects that perhaps they may even bepsychotogenetic or psychosis-producing) in their impact. But, as usual, a two-valued orientation is inadequate to thefacts. Not "either-or" but "both-and"expresses the truth of the matter. It is essential to bemulti-valued in approaching the new drugs, which are so profoundand subtle in their operations within the psyche. Not only arethey psychedelic, but also they are psychotomimetic. Even more,they are psychedelic because they are psychotomimetic, andpsychotomimetic because they are psychedelic. To be shownthe truth about ourselves, to be shown that we are all, to someextent, frauds and pretenders, strategy-ridden game-playersintent on getting one-up on our fellow game-players, is analarming experience. And this is the experience the new drugs maygive us. They psychedelically show us what we are, and we maypsychotomimetically react with terror. In such a case the terrorresults from the fact that to cease identifying exclusively withthe game-self and instead to identify a little more with theUnitary Self is, in a psychological sense, to die to what we havebeen in order to be born to what we are capable of becoming. Itis not surprising that some ingestants, in the face of thisthreat of imminent death, suddenly panic. And yet there is value even in panic, psychedelic benefit inpsychotomimetic terror. "Hell," as Joe K. Adams haspointed out, "is at least as instructive as heaven."15One who has been surprised in the act of furtively playing withhis own excrements might as well relax and stop putting on airsin public. Having been exposed as a confirmed coprophiliac, heneed have no further fear of detection. Similarly, the publicdisclosure, as the result of a drug session, that one harborswithin oneself not only a field of shining jewels but also a nestof scorpions is most liberating. One's defenses drop away. Thereis no longer any need to pretend. It becomes easier to admitpublicly that one is aggressive, hostile, fearful, competitive,slightly paranoid, and utterly addicted to the game ofone-upmanship. And this in turn opens up the possibility that onemay take steps to bring about a change. IT IS a medical truism that sometimes the patient must getworse in order to get better. Many people in psychotherapy reportincreased anxiety as a prelude to decreased anxiety. One reasonfor this is that psychotherapy is, in part, a shock treatment forforcing the patient to see through his own faulty assumptionsabout the meaning of his behavior, to drop his defenses. Thetreatment hurts, but it is essential to growth. LSD and the othernew drugs may accomplish similar results in a startling way andwith incredible speed. They may also, of course, fail to do so. They may even,unless their administration is properly managed, be harmful tothe ingestant. The chief problem appears to be to bring about theconditions that create trust. If this trust falters, theingestant may perceive the temporary loss of the game-self as aloss of identity and so slip into panic. On the other hand, ifthere is no loss of trust he may feel that he has come into hisown true identity at last. This "true identity," this Self, is what liesbeyond all names and games. Nameless and unknowable, it is feltsimply as that which knows, a kind of totally uncategorized,spontaneously integrating principle of creative unity. It isconsciousness itself: the Tao, the Nameless, the Way that cannotbe "wayed," the Name that cannot be named, the "IAm" that cannot be conjugated. Whatever it is that movesspontaneously and freely to give shape and pattern andmeaning—this is what the LSD-ingestant may perceive himselfto be. Without trust, on the other hand, without confidence inhimself, in his immediate situation, and even in the cosmos as awhole, he may see himself and others as monstrous andthreatening. His situation then will be, in a heightened form,that of the ordinary man under ordinary circumstances: He mustachieve faith in the processes of life or perish. References 1. The operations of theInternational Federation for Internal Freedom at Zihuatanejo,Mexico, which terminated abruptly on June 16 1963, and which wereluridly but inaccurately reported by much of the Mexican andAmerican press, were perhaps utopian in goal but not, at first,in form. Until the final, confused weeks, when the operations ofthe Federation were interfered with by an alarmed and threatenedcommunity, a rather systematic attempt was made by the members ofIFIF to work out, pragmatically, a sensible, controlled modusoperandi for investigating the social and psychologicalusefulness, if any, of LSD-ingestion under suitable conditions.The author was present in Zihuatanejo during the concluding daysof the experiment and was involved in events which qualify him tooffer the foregoing opinion as well as opinions asserted in thispaper.

Marsh, "Meaning andthe Mind Drugs.") THIS IS a lively and intelligent paper and I am glad to seethat Dr. Marsh has taken issue boldly and directly with thematter of psychedelic and psychotomimetic experiences. I do not think, however, that even he has emphasizedsufficiently how valuable LSD-25 and mescaline, for instance,have been as psychotomimetics. Our greater understanding of theexperience of schizophrenic patients, derived from studying themadness-mimicking effect of these substances, has enabled us todo things which might have been otherwise impossible. Since manydiscussions of psychedelics and psychotomimetics deal largelywith their potentials, it may be as well to familiarize ourselveswith some of their actualities. 1. We have been able to devise much better hospitals formentally ill people. Working closely with my friend, Kyo Izumi, aCanadian architect from Saskatchewan, we developed a newformulation for mental hospitals in terms of what we have calledsocio-architecture. Parts of at least five mental hospitals havenow been built using these ideas. Of the Saskatchewan Hospital,Yorkton, Saskatchewan, designed by Izumi himself and hispartners, the Joint Information Service of the AmericanPsychiatric Association wrote: Kyoshi Izumi, a pioneer in psychiatric architecture, designed the physical structure, and designed, or in some cases specified, all the furnishings. The result must certainly rank among the most attractive and architecturally advanced buildings ever constructed for psychiatric services .... as for the physical plant, it was a pleasure to view a facility that was more than merely new. Creativity and imagination were evident in scores of details. We felt the wards and day rooms combined efficiency with comfort and cheerfulness to a very exceptional degree.1 TO MY KNOWLEDGE, Mr. Izumi himself took LSD-25 on severaloccasions so that he could experience and explore the effect ofperceptual anomalies upon his experience of space, time, color,and texture. While doing this, he took particular notice ofcertain kinds of architectural configurations. These experiencesof his, along with my own—combined with perceptual studiesby our colleagues, Drs. Weckowitz and Sommer, and an extensivereading of the writings of mentally ill people—formed thebasis of our original formulations and so of his splendiddesigns. Psychotomimetic experiences have thus been used for thebenefit of the mentally ill and also of the well people who workin hospitals. In addition to this, some of the principles whichwe have discovered are also being used to develop a better kindof living accommodation, particularly when large numbers ofpeople have to live in a communal building. It may be argued thatKyo Izumi, an unusually gifted person, would have done this justas well without the use of LSD-25. I do not know how this couldbe proved or disproved, but I do know that both he and I believethat it played a crucial part in deepening our understanding ofthe problem and so enlarging the communication between us. Thefruits of this collaboration are there to be judged by any whocare to go and look at them. It is not frivolous to say thathere, indeed, are some of those concrete results of thepsychotomimetic experience which critics have been so keen todiscover. 2. Because we came to believe that psychotic people were cutoff by their changes in perception, which they could not readilydescribe, and did not necessarily understand, we began to payclose attention to their umwelts, or experiential worlds.It became evident that due to a professional preoccupation withthe "meaning" of their experiences, the experiencesthemselves were often almost completely neglected. Patients who,for instance, described that the world looked different wereusually supposed to be saying that it was feeling different. Inother words, their perceptual anomalies were ascribed to somechange of mood or affect. For many years little interest had beenpaid to the actual experiences of the ill and the socialconsequences which might derive from them. To explore theseexperiences more thoroughly we developed the HOD (Hoffer-OsmondDiagnostic Text),2 which is an exceedingly crude butunexpectedly effective instrument for exploring the umweltsof schizophrenic and other patients. This is already showingconsiderable usefulness. An ex-schizophrenic patient onceremarked, "I wish you had had this test when I was ill. Iwould have known you knew something about my illness." The HOD combined with our interest in psychotomimetics hasled to new and very exciting developments in the use of hypnosisby Fogel and Hoffer3 (in Canada) and Aaronson4(here in Princeton). Because we ourselves had experienced markedchanges in perception and had listened to our patients reportingthese same happenings, it was easy to suppose that however theywere produced they might have many interesting effects. A greatadvantage of hypnosis and post hypnotic suggestion is that it canbe used to study in a very detailed way the effects of clear-cutand circumscribed perceptual anomalies. Much work of this kind isnow in progress, and while it is time consuming and demanding, itseems that this will be a very potent tool for exploring thepsyche. Aaronson noted with some surprise that he had been unableto predict what the psychological effects of a particular set ofperceptual changes would be and suggested that substantialrevisions of our theories of personality may become necessary. Inthe course of this work, Hoffer and Fogel have found that in somesubjects the LSD experience can be evoked without LSDand—even more surprising—that the effects of the drugcan be almost totally repressed, by post hypnotic suggestion. 4. Mescaline, LSD-25, etc., have great possibilities fortraining psychiatrists, psychologists, and others, who are thenless likely to produce standardized answers for their patients'distresses. Many psychiatrists suppose that because they havedevised or accepted from others an explanation for theirpatients' behavior which makes sense to them, they understandwhat has been happening to their patients. This, however, isoften not so and the psychiatrist's too ready assumption ofomniscience, although it may be reassuring to him, simplyprevents him from listening to the patient's halting, but oftenquite accurate, explanation. Miss Norma McDonald, herself asufferer from schizophrenia, wrote: One of the most encouraging things which has happened to me in recent years was the discovery that I could talk to normal people who had had the experience of taking mescaline or lysergic acid, and they would accept the things I told them about my adventures in mind without asking stupid questions or withdrawing into a safe smug world of disbelief. Schizophrenia is a lonely illness and friends are of great importance. I have needed true friends to help me to believe in myself when I doubted my own mind, to encourage me with their praise, jolt me out of unrealistic ideas with their honesty, and teach me by their example how to work and play. The discovery of LSD-25 by those who work in the field of psychiatry has widened my circle of friends.5 Schizophrenics are lonely because they cannot let theirfellows know what is happening to them and so lose the socialsupport, help and encouragement which they need so much yet sorarely evoke. LSD-25, used as a psychotomimetic, allows us tostudy these problems of communication from the inside and learnhow to devise better means of helping the sick. This combinedwith the HOD and the hypnosis work allow us to reduce thealienation of these very ill people. We are no longer forced tosuppose that the experience of the schizophrenic person mustalways be harmful; indeed, there is growing evidence that thepsychosocial variability which they endure, although dearlybought by the individual, may be valuable and even necessary tosociety, especially in times of change. 5. Our early work on alcoholism6 was based on theidea that it might be helpful to produce a condition resemblingdelirium tremens and so allow the patient to "hitbottom" earlier than he might otherwise do. Later, after wehad become aware of the possibilities of the psychedelicexperience and had exchanged ideas with Dr. A. M. Hubbard ofVancouver, one of the pioneers of psychedelic therapy on thiscontinent, we changed directions: Nevertheless, the originalimpetus came from our interest in the psychosis-mimickingexperience. THESE FEW illustrations show that these remarkable substances have already impinged on psychiatry in a positive way,quite apart from their extensive and very interesting use inpsychotherapy. While I would be the last to discourageinvestigators from exploring that huge panorama which sweeps fromthe creative to the transcendental experiences, I would urge thatwe continue to study carefully and intensively some of the rathermundane matters which I have noted here. While there may bemarked similarities in the ultimate experiences of birth anddeath, and while it is valuable to recognize that we have much incommon, the fact is that our day-to-day experience of the world,our umwelts, can be surprisingly dissimilar. It is oftenthese dissimilarities, unrecognized and—until we developbetter means of acquainting ourselves withthem—unrecognizable, that lead to the greatest and oftenmost tragic failures in communication. Life, like art, is, inWilliam Blake's words, "a matter of minuteparticulars." We must accept, however difficult it may be todo so, that the "minute particulars" experienced by oneperson may be very different from those experienced by otherpeople, even though they may be very close to him. By patience,determination, and skill, we can perhaps develop "universalparticulars" in which many more can share and can know thatthey are sharing. To do this we must start with very simplematters and discover the various ways in which each one of usbuilds a world comfortable for him, but more or lessincomprehensible and sometimes even grotesquely strange forothers.

Copyright Alan Watts & California Law Review. The experiences resulting from the use of psychedelic drugsare often described in religious terms. They are therefore ofinterest to those like myself who, in the tradition of WilliamJames, (1) are concernedwith the psychology of religion. For more than thirty years Ihave been studying the causes, the consequences, and theconditions of those peculiar states of consciousness in which theindividual discovers himself to be one continuous process withGod, with the Universe, with the Ground of Being, or whatevername he may use by cultural conditioning or personal preferencefor the ultimate and eternal reality. We have no satisfactory anddefinitive name for experiences of this kind. The terms"religious experience," "mysticalexperience," and "cosmic consciousness" are alltoo vague and comprehensive to denote that specific mode ofconsciousness which, to those who have known it, is as real andoverwhelming as falling in love. This article describes suchstates of consciousness induced by psychedelic drugs, althoughthey are virtually indistinguishable from genuine mysticalexperience. The article then discusses objections to the use ofpsychedelic drugs that arise mainly from the opposition betweenmystical values and the traditional religious and secular valuesof Western society. The Psychedelic Experience The idea of mystical experiences resulting from drug use isnot readily accepted in Western societies. Western culture has,historically, a particular fascination with the value and virtueof man as an individual, self-determining, responsible ego,controlling himself and his world by the power of consciouseffort and will. Nothing, then, could be more repugnant to thiscultural tradition than the notion of spiritual or psychologicalgrowth through the use of drugs. A "drugged" person isby definition dimmed in consciousness, fogged in judgment, anddeprived of will. But not all psychotropic(consciousness-changing) chemicals are narcotic and soporific, asare alcohol, opiates, and barbiturates. The effects of what arenow called psychedelic (mind-manifesting) chemicals differ fromthose of alcohol as laughter differs from rage, or delight fromdepression. There is really no analogy between being"high" on LSD and "drunk" on bourbon. True,no one in either state should drive a car, but neither should onedrive while reading a book, playing a violin, or making love.Certain creative activities and states of mind demand aconcentration and devotion that are simply incompatible withpiloting a death-dealing engine along a highway. I myself have experimented with five of the principalpsychedelics: LSD-25, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyl-tryptamine(DMT), and cannabis. I have done so, as William James triednitrous oxide, to see if they could help me in identifying whatmight be called the "essential" or "active"ingredients of the mystical experience. For almost all theclassical literature on mysticism is vague, not only indescribing the experience, but also in showing rationalconnections between the experience itself and the varioustraditional methods recommended to induce it-fasting,concentration, breathing exercises, prayers, incantations, anddances. A traditional master of Zen or Yoga, when asked whysuch-and-such practices lead or predispose one to the mysticalexperience, always responds, "This is the way my teachergave it to me. This is the way I found out. If you're seriouslyinterested, try it for yourself." This answer hardlysatisfies an impertinent, scientifically minded, andintellectually curious Westerner. It reminds him of archaicmedical prescriptions compounding five salamanders, powderedgallows rope, three boiled bats, a scruple of phosphorus, threepinches of henbane, and a dollop of dragon dung dropped when themoon was in Pisces. Maybe it worked, but what was the essentialingredient? It struck me, therefore, that if any of the psychedelicchemicals would in fact predispose my consciousness to themystical experience, I could use them as instruments for studyingand describing that experience as one uses a microscope forbacteriology, even though the microscope is an"artificial" and "unnatural" contrivancewhich might be said to "distort" the vision of thenaked eye. However, when I was first invited to test the mysticalqualities of LSD-25 by Dr. Keith Ditman of the NeuropsychiatricClinic at UCLA Medical School, I was unwilling to believe thatany mere chemical could induce a genuine mystical experience. Atmost, it might bring about a state of spiritual insight analogousto swimming with water wings. Indeed, my first experiment withLSD-25 was not mystical. It was an intensely interestingaesthetic and intellectual experience that challenged my powersof analysis and careful description to the utmost. Some months later, in 1959, I tried LSD-25 again with Drs.Sterling Bunnell and Michael Agron, who were then associated withthe Langley-Porter Clinic, in San Francisco. In the course of twoexperiments I was amazed and somewhat embarrassed to find myselfgoing through states of consciousness that corresponded preciselywith every description of major mystical experiences that I hadever read. (2)Furthermore, they exceeded both in depth and in a peculiarquality of unexpectedness the three "natural andspontaneous" experiences of this kind that had happened tome in previous years. Through subsequent experimentation with LSD-25 and the otherchemicals named above (with the exception of DMT, which I findamusing but relatively uninteresting), I found I could move withease into the state of "cosmic consciousness," and indue course became less and less dependent on the chemicalsthemselves for "tuning in" to this particular wavelength of experience. Of the five psychedelics tried, I foundthat LSD-25 and cannabis suited my purposes best. Of these two,the latter---cannabis---which I had to use abroad in countrieswhere it is not outlawed, proved to be the better. It does notinduce bizarre alterations of sensory perception, and medicalstudies indicate that it may not, save in great excess, have thedangerous side effects of LSD. For the purposes of this study, in describing my experienceswith psychedelic drugs I avoid the occasional and incidentalbizarre alterations of sense perception that psychedelicchemicals may induce. I am concerned, rather, with thefundamental alterations of the normal, socially inducedconsciousness of one's own existence and relation to the externalworld. I am trying to delineate the basic principles ofpsychedelic awareness. But I must add that I can speak only formyself. The quality of these experiences depends considerablyupon one's prior orientation and attitude to life, although thenow voluminous descriptive literature of these experiencesaccords quite remarkably with my own. Almost invariably, my experiments with psychedelics have hadfour dominant characteristics. I shall try to explain them -inthe expectation that the reader will say, at least of the secondand third, "Why, that's obvious! No one needs a drug to seethat." Quite so, but every insight has degrees of intensity.There can be obvious-1 and obvious-2---and the latter comes onwith shattering clarity, manifesting its implications in everysphere and dimension of our existence. The first characteristic is a slowing down of time, a concentrationin the present. One's normally compulsive concern for thefuture decreases, and one becomes aware of the enormousimportance and interest of what is happening at the moment. Otherpeople, going about their business on the streets, seem to beslightly crazy, failing to realize that the whole point of lifeis to be fully aware of it as it happens. One therefore relaxes,almost luxuriously, into studying the colors in a glass of water,or in listening to the now highly articulate vibration of everynote played on an oboe or sung by a voice. From the pragmatic standpoint of our culture, such anattitude is very bad for business. It might lead to improvidence,lack of foresight, diminished sales of insurance policies, andabandoned savings accounts. Yet this is just the corrective thatour culture needs. No one is more fatuously impractical than the"successful" executive who spends his whole lifeabsorbed in frantic paper work with the objective of retiring incomfort at sixty-five, when it will all be too late. Only thosewho have cultivated the art of living completely in the presenthave any use for making plans for the future, for when the plansmature they will be able to enjoy the results. "Tomorrownever comes." I have never yet heard a preacher urging hiscongregation to practice that section of the Sermon on the Mountwhich begins, "Be not anxious for the morrow...." Thetruth is that people who live for the future are, as we say ofthe insane, "not quite all there"--- or here: byover-eagerness they are perpetually missing the point. Foresightis bought at the price of anxiety, and when overused it destroysall its own advantages. The second characteristic I will call awareness ofpolarity. This is the vivid realization that states, things,and events that we ordinarily call opposite are interdependent,like back and front, or the poles of a magnet. By polar awarenessone sees that things which are explicitly different areimplicitly one: self and other, subject and object, left andright, male and female-and then, a little more surprisingly,solid and space, figure and background, pulse and interval,saints and sinners, police and criminals, in-groups andout-groups. Each is definable only in terms of the other, andthey go together transactionally, like buying and selling, forthere is no sale without a purchase, and no purchase without asale. As this awareness becomes increasingly intense, you feelthat you yourself are polarized with the external universe insuch a way that you imply each other. Your push is its pull, andits push is your pull---as when you move the steering wheel of acar. Are you pushing it or pulling it? At first, this is a very odd sensation, not unlike hearingyour own voice played back to you on an electronic systemimmediately after you have spoken. You become confused, and waitfor it to go on! Similarly, you feel that you aresomething being done by the universe, yet that the universe isequally something being done by you-which is true, at least inthe neurological sense that the peculiar structure of our brainstranslates the sun into light, and air vibrations into sound. Ournormal sensation of relationship to the outside world is thatsometimes I push it, and sometimes it pushes me. But if the twoare actually one, where does action begin and responsibilityrest? If the universe is doing me, how can I be sure that, twoseconds hence, I will still remember the English language? If Iam doing it, how can I be sure that, two seconds hence, my brainwill know how to turn the sun into light? From such unfamiliarsensations as these, the psychedelic experience can generateconfusion, paranoia, and terror-even though the individual isfeeling his relationship to the world exactly as it would bedescribed by a biologist, ecologist, or physicist, for he isfeeling himself as the unified field of organism and environment. The third characteristic, arising from the second, is awarenessof relativity. I see that I am a link in an infinitehierarchy of processes and beings, ranging from molecules throughbacteria and insects to human beings, and, maybe, to angels andgods-a hierarchy in which every level is in effect the samesituation. For example, the poor man worries about money whilethe rich man worries about his health: the worry is the same, butthe difference is in its substance or dimension. I realize thatfruit flies must think of themselves as people, because, likeourselves, they find themselves in the middle of their ownworld-with immeasurably greater things above and smaller thingsbelow. To us, they all look alike and seem to have nopersonality-as do the Chinese when we have not lived among them.Yet fruit flies must see just as many subtle distinctions amongthemselves as we among ourselves. From this it is but a short step to the realization that allforms of life and being are simply variations on a single theme:we are all in fact one being doing the same thing in as manydifferent ways as possible. As the French proverb goes, plusca change, plus c'est la meme chose (the more it varies, themore it is one). I see, further, that feeling threatened by theinevitability of death is really the same experience as feelingalive, and that as all beings are feeling this everywhere, theyare all just as much "I" as myself. Yet the"I" feeling, to be felt at all, must always be asensation relative to the "other"-to something beyondits control and experience . To be at all, it must begin and end.But the intellectual jump that mystical and psychedelicexperiences make here is in enabling you to see that all thesemyriad I-centers are yourself---not, indeed, your personal andsuperficially conscious ego, but what Hindus call the paramatman,the Self of all selves. (3) As the retina enables us to see countless pulses ofenergy as a single light, so the mystical experience shows usinnumerable individuals as a single Self. The fourth characteristic is awareness of eternal energy,often in the form of intense white light, which seems to be boththe current in your nerves and that mysterious e which equalsmc2. This may sound like megalomania or delusion of grandeur-butone sees quite clearly that all existence is a single energy, andthat this energy is one's own being. Of course there is death aswell as life, because energy is a pulsation, and just as wavesmust have both crests and troughs, the experience of existingmust go on and off. Basically, therefore, there is simply nothingto worry about, because you yourself are the eternal energy ofthe universe playing hide- and-seek (off-and-on) with itself. Atroot, you are the Godhead, for God is all that there is. QuotingIsaiah just a little out of context: "I am the Lord, andthere is none else. I form the light and create the darkness: Imake peace, and create evil. I, the Lord, do all thesethings." (4) Thisis the sense of the fundamental tenet of Hinduism, Tat tramasi---"THAT (i.e., "that subtle Being of which thiswhole universe is composed") art thou." (5) A classical case ofthis experience, from the West, is in Tennyson's Memoirs: A kind of waking trance I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone. This has generally come upon me thro' repeating my own name two or three times to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, the individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this not a confused state, but the clearest of the clearest, the surest of the surest, the weirdest of the weirdest, utterly beyond words, where death was an almost laughable impossibility, the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction but the only true life. (6) Obviously, these characteristics of thepsychedelic experience, as I have known it, are aspects of asingle state of consciousness--for I have been describing thesame thing from different angles. The descriptions attempt toconvey the reality of the experience, but in doing so they alsosuggest some of the inconsistencies between such experience andthe current values of society. Opposition to Psychedelic Drugs Resistance to allowing use of psychedelic drugs originates inboth religious and secular values. The difficulty in describingpsychedelic experiences in traditional religious terms suggestsone ground of opposition. The Westerner must borrow such words assamadhi or moksha from the Hindus, or satorior kensho from the Japanese, to describe the experience ofoneness with the universe. We have no appropriate word becauseour own Jewish and Christian theologies will not accept the ideathat man's inmost self can be identical with the Godhead, eventhough Christians may insist that this was true in the uniqueinstance of Jesus Christ. Jews and Christians think of God inpolitical and monarchical terms, as the supreme governor of theuniverse, the ultimate boss. Obviously, it is both sociallyunacceptable and logically preposterous for a particularindividual to claim that he, in person, is the omnipotent andomniscient ruler of the world-to be accorded suitable recognitionand honor. Such an imperial and kingly concept of the ultimate reality,however, is neither necessary nor universal. The Hindus and theChinese have no difficulty in conceiving of an identity of theself and the Godhead. For most Asians, other than Muslims, theGodhead moves and manifests the world in much the same way that acentipede manipulates a hundred legs-spontaneously, withoutdeliberation or calculation. In other words, they conceive theuniverse by analogy with an organism as distinct from amechanism. They do not see it as an artifact or construct underthe conscious direction of some supreme technician, engineer, orarchitect. If, however, in the context of Christian or Jewish tradition,an individual declares himself to be one with God, he must bedubbed blasphemous (subversive) or insane. Such a mysticalexperience is a clear threat to traditional religious concepts.The Judaeo-Christian tradition has a monarchical image of God,and monarchs, who rule by force, fear nothing more thaninsubordination. The Church has therefore always been highlysuspicious of mystics, because they seem to be insubordinate andto claim equality or, worse, identity with God. For this reason,John Scotus Erigena and Meister Eckhart were condemned asheretics. This was also why the Quakers faced opposition fortheir doctrine of the Inward Light, and for their refusal toremove hats in church and in court. A few occasional mystics maybe all right so long as they watch their language, like St.Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross, who maintained, shallwe say, a metaphysical distance of respect between themselves andtheir heavenly King. Nothing, however, could be more alarming tothe ecclesiastical hierarchy than a popular outbreak ofmysticism, for this might well amount to setting up a democracyin the kingdom of heaven-and such alarm would be shared equallyby Catholics, Jews, and fundamentalist Protestants. The monarchical image of God, with its implicit distaste forreligious insubordination, has a more pervasive impact than manyChristians might admit. The thrones of kings have wallsimmediately behind them, and all who present themselves at courtmust prostrate themselves or kneel, because this is an awkwardposition from which to make a sudden attack. It has perhaps neveroccurred to Christians that when they design a church on themodel of a royal court (basilica) and prescribe church ritual,they are implying that God, like a human monarch, is afraid. Thisis also implied by flattery in prayers: O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne behold all the dwellers upon earth: most heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold....(7) The Western man who claims consciousness ofoneness with God or the universe thus clashes with his society'sconcept of religion. In most Asian cultures, however, such a manwill be congratulated as having penetrated the true secret oflife. He has arrived, by chance or by some such discipline asYoga or Zen meditation, at a state of consciousness in which heexperiences directly and vividly what our own scientists know tobe true in theory. For the ecologist, the biologist, and thephysicist know (but seldom feel) that every organism constitutesa single field of behavior, or process, with its environment.There is no way of separating what any given organism is doingfrom what its environment is doing, for which reason ecologistsspeak not of organisms in environments but oforganism-environments. Thus the words "I" and"self" should properly mean what the whole universe isdoing at this particular "here-and-now" called JohnDoe. The kingly concept of God makes identity of self and God, orself and universe, inconceivable in Western religious terms. Thedifference between Eastern and Western concepts of man and hisuniverse, however, extends beyond strictly religious concepts.The Western scientist may rationally perceive the idea oforganism-environment, but he does not ordinarily feel this to betrue. By cultural and social conditioning, he has been hypnotizedinto experiencing himself as an ego- as an isolated center ofconsciousness and will inside a bag of skin, confronting anexternal and alien world. We say, "I came into thisworld." But we did nothing of the kind. We came out of it injust the same way that fruit comes out of trees. Our galaxy, ourcosmos, "peoples" in the same way that an apple tree"apples." Such a vision of the universe clashes with the idea of amonarchical God, with the concept of the separate ego, and evenwith the secular, atheist/agnostic mentality, which derives itscommon sense from the mythology of nineteenth-century scientistAccording to this view, the universe is a mindless mechanism andman a sort of accidental microorganism infesting a minuteglobular rock that revolves about an unimportant star on theouter fringe of one of the minor galaxies. This"put-down" theory of man is extremely common among suchquasi scientists as sociologists, psychologists, andpsychiatrists, most of whom are still thinking of the world interms of Newtonian mechanics, and have never really caught upwith the ideas of Einstein and Bohr, Oppenheimer and Schrodinger.Thus to the ordinary institutional-type psychiatrist, any patientwho gives the least hint of mystical or religious experience isautomatically diagnosed as deranged. From the standpoint of themechanistic religion, he is a heretic and is given electroshocktherapy as an up-to-date form of thumbscrew and rack. And,incidentally, it is just this kind of quasi scientist who, asconsultant to government and law-enforcement agencies, dictatesofficial policies on the use of psychedelic chemicals. Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than anintellectual handicap. Lack of awareness of the basic unity oforganism and environment is a serious and dangeroushallucination. For in a civilization equipped with immensetechnological power, the sense of alienation between man andnature leads to the use of technology in a hostile spirit---tothe "conquest" of nature instead of intelligentco-operation with nature. The result is that we are eroding anddestroying our environment, spreading Los Angelization instead ofcivilization. This is the major threat overhanging Western,technological culture, and no amount of reasoning ordoom-preaching seems to help. We simply do not respond to theprophetic and moralizing techniques of conversion upon which Jewsand Christians have always relied. But people have an obscuresense of what is good for them-call it "unconsciousself-healing," "survival instinct," "positivegrowth potential," or what you will. Among the educatedyoung there is therefore a startling and unprecedented interestin the transformation of human consciousness. All over theWestern world publishers are selling millions of books dealingwith Yoga, Vedanta, Zen Buddhism, and the chemical mysticism ofpsychedelic drugs, and I have come to believe that the whole"hip" subculture, however misguided in some of itsmanifestations, is the earnest and responsible effort of youngpeople to correct the self-destroying course of industrialcivilization. The content of the mystical experience is thus inconsistentwith both the religious and secular concepts of traditionalWestern thought. Moreover, mystical experiences often result inattitudes that threaten the authority not only of establishedchurches, but also of secular society. Unafraid of death anddeficient in worldly ambition, those who have undergone mysticalexperiences are impervious to threats and promises. Moreover,their sense of the relativity of good and evil arouses thesuspicion that they lack both conscience and respect for law. Useof psychedelics in the United States by a literate bourgeoisiemeans that an important segment of the population is indifferentto society's traditional rewards and sanctions. In theory, the existence within our secular society of agroup that does not accept conventional values is consistent withour political vision. But one of the great problems of the UnitedStates, legally and politically, is that we have never quite hadthe courage of our convictions. The Republic is founded on themarvelously sane principle that a human community can exist andprosper only on a basis of mutual trust. Metaphysically, theAmerican Revolution was a rejection of the dogma of Original Sin,which is the notion that because you cannot trust yourself orother people, there must be some Superior Authority to keep usall in order. The dogma was rejected because, if it is true thatwe cannot trust ourselves and others, it follows that we cannottrust the Superior Authority which we ourselves conceive andobey, and that the very idea of our own untrustworthiness isunreliable! Citizens of the United States believe, or are supposed tobelieve, that a republic is the best form of government. Yet vastconfusion arises from trying to be republican in politics andmonarchist in religion. How can a republic be the best form ofgovernment if the universe, heaven, and hell are a monarchy? (8) Thus, despite thetheory of government by consent, based upon mutual trust, thepeoples of the United States retain, from the authoritarianbackgrounds of their religions or national origins, an utterlynaive faith in law as some sort of supernatural and paternalisticpower. "There ought to be a law against it!" Ourlaw-enforcement officers are therefore confused, hindered, andbewildered-not to mention corrupted-by being asked to enforcesumptuary laws, often of ecclesiastical origin, that vast numbersof people have no intention of obeying and that, in any case, areimmensely difficult or simply impossible to enforce-for example,the barring of anything so undetectable as LSD-25 frominternational and interstate commerce. Finally, there are two specific objections to use ofpsychedelic drugs. First, use of these drugs may be dangerous.However, every worth-while exploration is dangerous-climbingmountains, testing aircraft, rocketing into outer space, skindiving, or collecting botanical specimens in jungles. But if youvalue knowledge and the actual delight of exploration more thanmere duration of uneventful life, you are willing to take therisks. It is not really healthy for monks to practice fasting,and it was hardly hygienic for Jesus to get himself crucified,but these are risks taken in the course of spiritual adventures.Today the adventurous young are taking risks in exploring thepsyche, testing their mettle at the task just as, in times past,they have tested it---more violently---in hunting, dueling,hot-rod racing, and playing football. What they need is notprohibitions and policemen, but the most intelligentencouragement and advice that can be found. Second, drug use may be criticized as an escape from reality.However, this criticism assumes unjustly that the mysticalexperiences themselves are escapist or unreal. LSD, inparticular, is by no means a soft and cushy escape from reality.It can very easily be an experience in which you have to testyour soul against all the devils in hell. For me, it has been attimes an experience in which I was at once completely lost in thecorridors of the mind and yet relating that very lostness to theexact order of logic and language, simultaneously very mad andvery sane. But beyond these occasional lost and insane episodes,there are the experiences of the world as a system of totalharmony and glory, and the discipline of relating these to theorder of logic and language must somehow explain how what WilliamBlake called that "energy which is eternal delight" canconsist with the misery and suffering of everyday life. (9) The undoubted mystical and religious intentof most users of the psychedelics, even if some of thesesubstances should be proved injurious to physical health,requires that their free and responsible use be exempt from legalrestraint in any republic that maintains a constitutionalseparation of church and state. (10)To the extent that mystical experience conformswith the tradition of genuine religious involvement, and to theextent that psychedelics induce that experience, users areentitled to some constitutional protection. Also, to the extentthat research in the psychology of religion can utilize suchdrugs, students of the human mind must be free to use them. Underpresent laws, I, as an experienced student of the psychology ofreligion, can no longer pursue research in the field. This is abarbarous restriction of spiritual and intellectual freedom,suggesting that the legal system of the United States is, afterall, in tacit alliance with the monarchical theory of theuniverse, and will, therefore, prohibit and persecute religiousideas and practices based on an organic and unitary vision of theuniverse.

The implication was that the individualobjector found himself bound to obey a higher echelon of commandthan the President and Congress. The analogy is military andmonarchical, and therefore objectors who, as Buddhists ornaturalists, held an organic theory of the universe often haddifficulty in obtaining recognition.

The user of cannabis, in particular, isapt to have peculiar difficulties in establishing his"undoubted mystical and religious intent" in court.Having committed so loathsome and serious a felony, his chancesof clemency are better if he assumes a repentant demeanor, whichis quite inconsistent with the sincere belief that his use ofcannabis was religious. On the other hand, if he insistsunrepentantly that he looks upon such use as a religioussacrament, many judges will declare that they "dislike hisattitude," finding it truculent and lacking in appreciationof the gravity of the crime, and the sentence will be that muchharsher. The accused is therefore put in a"double-bind" situation, in which he is "damned ifhe does, and damned if he doesn't." Furthermore, religiousintegrity-as in conscientious objection-is generally tested andestablished by membership in some church or religiousorganization with a substantial following. But the feloniousstatus of cannabis is such that grave suspicion would be castupon all individuals forming such an organization, and the testcannot therefore be fulfilled. It is generally forgotten that ourguarantees of religious freedom were designed to protectprecisely those who were not members of establisheddenominations, but rather such (then) screwball and subversiveindividuals as Quakers, Shakers, Levellers, and Anabaptists.There is little question that those who use cannabis or otherpsychedelics with religious intent are now members of apersecuted religion which appears to the rest of society as agrave menace to "mental health," as distinct from theold-fashioned "immortal soul." But it's the same oldstory. (back) (11) Amerindians belonging to the NativeAmerican Church who employ the psychedelic peyote cactus in theirrituals, are firmly opposed to any government control of thisplant, even if they should be guaranteed the right to its use.They feel that peyote is a natural gift of God to mankind, andespecially to natives of the land where it grows, and that nogovernment has a right to interfere with its use The sameargument might be made on behalf of cannabis, or the mushroom Psilocybemexicana Heim. All these things are natural plants, notprocessed or synthesized drugs, and by what authority canindividuals be prevented from eating theme There is no lawagainst eating or growing the mushroom Amanita pantherina,even though it is fatally poisonous and only experts candistinguish it from a common edible mushroom. This case can bemade even from the standpoint of believers in the monarchicaluniverse of Judaism and Christianity, for it is a basic principleof both religions, derived from Genesis, that all naturalsubstances created by God are inherently good, and that evil canarise only in their misuse. Thus laws against mere possession, oreven cultivation, of these plants are in basic conflict withbiblical principles. Criminal conviction of those who employthese plants should be based on proven misuse. "And God said'Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is uponthe face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is thefruit of a tree yielding seed- to you it shall be for meat....And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it wasvery good."

This essay was written in 1960. Besides the philosopher's stone that would turn base metalinto gold, one of the great quests of alchemy in both Europe andAsia was the elixir of immortality. In gullible enthusiasm forthis quest, more than one Chinese emperor died of the fabulousconcoctions of powdered jade, tea, ginseng, and precious metalsprepared by Taoist priests. But just as the work of transforminglead into gold was in many cases a chemical symbolism for aspiritual transformation of man himself, so the immortality to beconferred by the elixir was not always the literally everlastinglife but rather the transportation of consciousness into a statebeyond time. Modern physicists have solved the problem ofchanging lead into gold, though the process is somewhat moreexpensive than digging gold from the earth. But in the last fewyears modem chemists have prepared one or two substances forwhich it may be claimed that in some cases they induce states ofmind remarkably similar to cosmic consciousness. To many people such claims are deeply disturbing. For onething, mystical experience seems altogether too easy when itsimply comes out of a bottle, and is thus available to people whohave done nothing to deserve it, who have neither fasted norprayed nor practiced yoga. For another, the claim seems to implythat - spiritual insight is after all only a matter of bodychemistry involving a total reduction of the spiritual to thematerial. These are serious considerations, even though one maybe convinced that in the long run the difficulty is found to restupon semantic confusion as to the definitions of"spiritual" and "material." However, it should be pointed out that there is nothing newor disreputable in the idea that spiritual insight Is anundeserved gift of divine grace, often conveyed through suchmaterial or sacramental means as the water of baptism and thebread and wine of the mass. The priest who by virtue of hisoffice transforms bread and wine into the body and blood ofChrist, ex opere operato, by the simple repetition of theformula of the Last Supper, is in a situation not radicallydifferent from that of the scientist who, by repeating the rightformula of an experiment, may effect a transformation in thebrain. The comparative worth of the two operations must be judgedby their effects. There were always those upon whom thesacraments of baptism and communion did not seem to"take," whose lives remained effectively unregenerate.Likewise, none of these consciousness-changing chemicals areliterally mystical experience in a bottle. Many who receive themexperience only ecstasies without insight, or just an unpleasantconfusion of sensation and imagination. States akin to mysticalexperience arise only in certain individuals and then oftendepend upon considerable concentration and effort to use thechange of consciousness in certain ways. It is important here,too, to stress the point that ecstasy is only Incidental to theauthentic mystical experience, the essence of which might best bedescribed as insight, as the word is now used in psychiatry. A chemical of this kind might perhaps be said to be an aid toperception in the same way as the telescope, microscope, orspectroscope, save in this case that the instrument is not anexternal object but an internal state of the nervous system. Allsuch instruments are relatively useless without proper trainingand preparation not only in their handling, but also in theparticular field of investigation, These considerations alone are already almost enough to showthat the use of such chemicals does not reduce spiritual insightto a mere matter of body chemistry. But it should be added thateven when we can describe certain events in terms of chemistrythis does not mean that such events are merely chemical. Achemical description of spiritual experience has somewhat thesame use and the same limits as the chemical description of agreat painting. It is simple enough to make a chemical analysisof the paint, and for artists and connoisseurs alike there issome point in doing so. It might also be possible to work out achemical description of all the processes that go on in theartist while he is painting. But it would be incrediblycomplicated, and in the meantime the same processes could bedescribed and communicated far more effectively in some otherlanguage than the chemical. We should probably say that a processis chemical only when chemical language is the mosteffective means of describing it. Analogously, some of thechemicals known as psychedelics provide opportunities formystical insight in much the same way that well-prepared paintsand brushes provide opportunities for fine painting, or abeautifully constructed piano for great music. They make iteasier, but they do not accomplish the work all by themselves. The two chemicals which are of most use in creating a changeof consciousness conducive to spiritual experience are mescalineand lysergic acid diethylamide (known, for short, as LSD). Theformer is a synthetic formulation of the active ingredients ofthe peyote cactus, and the latter a purely synthetic chemical ofthe indole group which produces its effects even in such minuteamounts as twenty-five micrograms. The specific effects of thesechemicals are hard to identify with any clarity, and so far as isknown at present they seem to operate upon the nervous system byreducing some of the inhibitory mechanisms which ordinarily havea screening effect upon our consciousness. Certain psychiatristswho seem overly anxious to hang on to the socially approvedsensation of reality---more or less the world as perceived on ableak Monday morning---classify these chemicals as hallucinogensproducing toxic effects of a schizoid or psychotic character. Iam afraid this is psychiatric gobbledygook: a sort ofauthoritative rumble of disapproval. Neither substance is anaddictive drug, like heroin or opium, and it has never beendemonstrated that they have harmful effects upon people who werenot otherwise seriously disturbed. It is begging the question tocall the changes of consciousness which they educehallucinations, for some of the unusual things felt and seen maybe no more unreal than the unfamiliar forms perceived through amicroscope. We do not know. It is also begging the question tocall their effects toxic, which might mean poisonous, unless thisword can also be used for the effects of vitamins or proteins.Such language is evaluative, not descriptive in any scientificsense. Somewhat more than two years ago (1958) I was asked by apsychiatric research group to take 100 micrograms of lysergicacid, to see whether it would reproduce anything resembling amystical experience. It did not do so, and so far as I know thereason was that I had not then learned how to direct my inquirieswhen under its influence. It seemed instead that my senses hadbeen given a kaleidoscopic character (and this is no more than ametaphor) which made the whole world entrancingly complicated, asif I were involved in a multidimensional arabesque. Colors becameso vivid that flowers, leaves, and fabrics seemed to be illuminedfrom inside. The random patterns of blades of grass in a lawnappeared to be exquisitely organized without, however, any actualdistortion of vision. Black ink or sumi paintings byChinese and Japanese artists appeared almost to be threedimensional photographs, and what are ordinarily dismissed asirrelevant details of speech, behavior, appearance, and formseemed in some indefinable way to be highly significant.Listening to music with closed eyes, I beheld the mostfascinating patterns of dancing jewelry, mosaic, tracery, andabstract images. At one point everything appeared to beuproariously funny, especially the gestures and actions of peoplegoing about their everyday business. Ordinary remarks seemed toreverberate with double and quadruple meanings, and therole-playing behavior of those around me not only becameunusually evident but also implied concealed attitudes contraryor complementary to its overt intention. In short, the screeningor selective apparatus of our normal interpretative evaluation ofexperience had been partially suspended, with the result that Iwas presumably projecting the sensation of meaning orsignificance upon just about everything. The whole experience wasvastly entertaining and interesting, but as yet nothing like anymystical experience that I had had before. It was not until a year later that I tried LSD again, thistime at the request of another research team. Since then I haverepeated the experiment five times, with dosages varying from 75to 100 micrograms. My impression has been that such experimentsare profound and rewarding to the extent that I do my utmost toobserve perceptual and evaluative changes and to describe them asclearly and completely as possible, usually with the help of atape recorder. To give a play-by- play description of eachexperiment might be clinically interesting, but what I amconcerned with here is a philosophical discussion of some of thehigh points and recurrent themes of my experiences. Psychiatristshave not yet made up their minds as to whether LSD is useful intherapy, but at present I am strongly inclined to feel that itsmajor use may turn out to be only secondarily as a therapeuticand primarily as an instrumental aid to the creative artist,thinker, or scientist. I should observe, in passing, that thehuman and natural environment in which these experiments areconducted is of great importance, and that its use in hospitalwards with groups of doctors firing off clinical questions at thesubject is most undesirable. The supervising physician shouldtake a human attitude, and drop all defensive dramatizations ofscientific objectivity and medical authority, conducting theexperiment in surroundings of some natural or artistic beauty. I have said that my general impression of the firstexperiment was that the "mechanism" by which we screenour sense-data and select only some of them as significant hadbeen partially suspended. Consequently, I felt that theparticular feeling which we associate with "themeaningful" was projected indiscriminately upon everything,and then rationalized in ways that might strike an independentobserver as ridiculous---unless, perhaps, the subject wereunusually clever at rationalizing. However, the philosophercannot pass up the point that our selection of some sense-data assignificant and others as insignificant is always with relationto particular purposes---survival, the quest for certainpleasures, finding one's way to some destination, or whatever itmay be. But in every experiment with LSD one of the first effectsI have noticed is a profound relaxation combined with anabandonment of purposes and goals, reminding me of the Taoistsaying that "when purpose has been used to achievepurposelessness, the thing has been grasped." I have felt,in other words, endowed with all the time in the world, free tolook about me as if I were living in eternity without a singleproblem to be solved. It is just for this reason that the busyand purposeful actions of other people seem at this time to be socomic, for it becomes obvious that by setting themselves goalswhich are always in the future, in the "tomorrow which nevercomes," they are missing entirely the point of being alive. When, therefore, our selection of sense-impressions is notorganized with respect to any particular purpose, all thesurrounding details of the world must appear to be equallymeaningful or equally meaningless. Logically, these are two waysof saying the same thing, but the overwhelming feeling of my ownLSD experiences is that all aspects of the world becomemeaningful rather than meaningless. This is not to say that theyacquire meaning in the sense of signs, by virtue of pointing tosomething else, but that all things appear to be their own point.Their simple existence, or better, their present formation, seemsto be perfect, to be an end or fulfillment without any need forjustification. Flowers do not bloom in order to produce seeds,nor are seeds germinated in order to bring forth flowers. Eachstage of the process---seed, sprout, bud, flower, and fruit---may be regarded as the goal. A chicken is one eggs way ofproducing others. In our normal experience something of the samekind takes place in music and the dance, where the point of theaction is each moment of its unfolding and not just the temporalend of the performance. Such a translation of everyday experience into something ofthe same nature as music has been the beginning and theprevailing undertone of all my experiments. But LSD does notsimply suspend the selective process by cutting it out. It wouldbe more exact to say that it shows the relativity of our ordinaryevaluation of sense-data by suggesting others. It permits themind to organize its sensory impressions in new patterns. In mysecond experiment I noticed, for example, that all repeatedforms---leaves on a stem, books on shelves, mullions inwindows---gave me the sensation of seeing double or evenmultiple, as if the second, third, and fourth leaves on the stemwere reflections of the first, seen, as it were, in severalthicknesses of window glass. When I mentioned this, the attendingphysician held up his finger to see if it would give me a doubleimage. For a moment it seemed to do so, but all at once I sawthat the second image had its basis in a wisp of cigar smokepassing close to his finger and upon which my consciousness hadprojected the highlights and outline of a second finger. As Ithen concentrated upon this sensation of doubling or repeatingimages, it seemed suddenly as if the whole field of sight were atransparent liquid rippled in concentric circles as in dropping astone into a pool. The normal images of things around me were notdistorted by this pattern. They remained just as usual, but myattention directed itself to highlights, lines, and shadows uponthem that fitted the pattern, letting those that did not fallinto relative insignificance. As soon, however, as I noticed thisprojection and became aware of details that did not fit thepattern, it seemed as if whole handfuls of pebbles had beenthrown into-the optical space, rippling it with concentriccircles that overlapped in all directions, so that every visiblepoint became an intersection of circles. The optical fieldseemed, in fact, to have a structured grain like a photographscreened for reproduction, save that the organization of thegrains was not rectilinear but circular. In this way every detailfitted the pattern and the field of vision became pointillist,like a painting by Seurat. This sensation raised a number of questions. Was my mindimperiously projecting its own geometrical designs upon theworld, thus "hallucinating" a structure in things whichis not actually there? Or is what we call the "real"structure of things simply a learned projection or hallucinationwhich we hold in common? Or was I somehow becoming aware of theactual grain of the rods and cones in my retina, for even ahallucination must have some actual basis in the nervous system?On another occasion I was looking closely at a handful of sand,and in becoming aware that I could not get it into clear focus Ibecame conscious of every detail and articulation of the way inwhich my eyes were fuzzing the image---and this was certainlyperception of a grain or distortion in the eyes themselves. The general impression of these optical sensations is thatthe eyes, without losing the normal area of vision, have becomemicroscopes, and that the texture of the visual field isinfinitely rich and complex. I do not know whether this is actualawareness of the multiplicity of nerve-endings in the retina, or,for that matter, in the fingers, for the same grainy feelingarose in the sense of touch. But the effect of feeling that thisis or may be so is, as it were, to turn the senses back uponthemselves, and so to realize that seeing the external world isalso seeing the eyes. In other words, I became vividly aware ofthe fact that what I call shapes, colors, and textures in theoutside world are also states of my nervous system, that is, ofme. In knowing them I also know my self. But the strange part ofthis apparent sensation of my own senses was that I did notappear to be inspecting them from outside or from a distance, asif they were objects. I can say only that the awareness ofgrain or structure in the senses seemed to be awareness ofawareness, of myself from inside myself. Because of this, itfollowed that the distance or separation between myself and mysenses, on the one hand, and the external world, on the other,seemed to disappear I was no longer a detached observer, a littleman inside my own head, having sensations. I was thesensations, so much so that there was nothing left of me, theobserving ego, except the series of sensations whichhappened---not to me, but just happened---moment by moment, oneafter another. To become the sensations, as distinct from having them,engenders the most astonishing sense of freedom and release. Forit implies that experience is not something in which one istrapped or by which one is pushed around, or against which onemust fight. The conventional duality of subject and object,knower and known, feeler and feeling, is changed into a polarity:the knower and the known become the poles, terms, or phases of asingle event which happens, not to me or from me, but ofitself. The experiencer and the experience become a single,ever-changing self-forming process, complete and fulfilled atevery moment of its unfolding, and of infinite complexity andsubtlety. It is like, not watching, but being, a coilingarabesque of smoke patterns in the air, or of ink dropped inwater, or of a dancing snake which seems to move from every partof its body at once. This may be a "drug-inducedhallucination," but it corresponds exactly to what Dewey andBentley have called the transactional relationship of theorganism to its environment. This is to say that all our actionsand experiences arise mutually from the organism and from theenvironment at the same time. The eyes can see light because ofthe sun, but the sun is light because of the eyes. Ordinarily,under the hypnosis of social conditioning, we feel quite distinctfrom our physical surroundings, facing them rather than belongingin them. Yet in this way we ignore and screen out the physicalfact of our total interdependence with the natural world. We areas embodied in it as our own cells and molecules are embodied inus. Our neglect and repression of this interrelationship givesspecial urgency to all the new sciences of ecology, studying theinterplay of organisms with their environments, and warning usagainst ignorant interference with the balances of nature. The sensation that events are happening of themselves, andthat nothing is making them happen and that they are nothappening to anything, has always been a major feature ofmy experiences with LSD. It is possible that the chemical issimply giving me a vivid realization of my own philosophy, thoughthere have been times when the experience has suggestedmodifications of my previousthinking. (1) But just as the sensation ofsubject-object polarity is confirmed by the transactionalpsychology of Dewey and Bentley, so the sensation of eventshappening "of themselves" is just how one would expectto perceive a world consisting entirely of process. Now thelanguage of science is increasingly a language of process---adescription of events, relations, operations, and forms ratherthan of things and substances. The world so described is a worldof actions rather than agents, verbs rather than nouns, goingagainst the common-sense idea that an action is the behavior ofsome thing, some solid entity of "stuff." But thecommonsense idea that action is always the function of an agentis so deeply rooted, so bound up with our sense of order andsecurity, that seeing the world to be otherwise can be seriouslydisturbing. Without agents, actions do not seem to come fromanywhere, to have any dependable origin, and at first sight thisspontaneity can be alarming. In one experiment it seemed thatwhenever I tried to put my (metaphorical) foot upon some solidground, the ground collapsed into empty space. I could find nosubstantial basis from which to act: my will was a whim, and mypast, as a causal conditioning force, had simply vanished. Therewas only the present conformation of events, happening. For awhile I felt lost in a void, frightened, baseless, insecurethrough and through Yet soon I became accustomed to the feeling,strange as it was. There was simply a pattern of action, ofprocess, and this was at one and the same time the universe andmyself with nothing outside it either to trust or mistrust. Andthere seemed to be no meaning in the idea of its trusting ormistrusting itself, just as there is no possibility of a finger'stouching its own tip. Upon reflection, there seems to be nothing unreasonable inseeing the world in this way. The agent behind every action isitself action. If a mat can be called matting, a cat can becalled catting. We do not actually need to ask who or what"cats," just as we do not need to ask what is the basicstuff or substance out of which the world is formed---for thereis no way of describing this substance except in terms of form,of structure, order, and operation. The world is not formedas if it were inert clay responding to the touch of a potter'shand; the world is form, or better, formation, for uponexamination every substance turns out to be closely knit pattern.The fixed notion that every pattern or form must be made of somebasic material which is in itself formless is based on asuperficial analogy between natural formation and manufacture, asif the stars and rocks had been made out of something as acarpenter makes tables out of wood. Thus what we call the agentbehind the action is simply the prior or relatively more constantstate of the same action: when a man runs we have a"manning-running" over and above a simple"manning." Furthermore, it is only a somewhat clumsyconvenience to say that present events are moved or caused bypast events, for we are actually talking about earlier and laterstages of the same event. We can establish regularities of rhythmand pattern in the course of an event, and so predict its futureconfigurations, but its past states do not "push" itspresent and future states as if they were a row of dominoes stoodon end so that knocking over the first collapses all the othersin series. The fallen dominoes lie where they fall, but pastevents vanish into the present, which is just another way ofsaying that the world is a self-moving pattern which, when itssuccessive states are remembered, can be shown to have a certainorder. Its motion, its energy, issues from itself now, not fromthe past, which simply falls behind it in memory like the wakefrom a ship. When we ask the "why" of this moving pattern, weusually try to answer the question in terms of its original, pastimpulse or of its future goal. I had realized for a long timethat if there is in any sense a reason for the world's existenceit must be sought in the present, as the reason for the wake mustbe sought in the engine of the moving ship. I have alreadymentioned that LSD makes me peculiarly aware of the musical ordance-like character of the world, bringing my attention to restupon its present flowing and seeing this as its ultimate point.Yet I have also been able to see that this point has depths, thatthe present wells up from within itself with an energy which issomething much richer than simple exuberance. One of these experiments was conducted late at night. Somefive or six hours from its start the doctor had to go home, and Iwas left alone in the garden. For me, this stage of theexperiment is always the most rewarding in terms of insight,after some of its more unusual and bizarre sensory effects haveworn off. The garden was a lawn surrounded by shrubs and hightrees---Pine and eucalyptus---and floodlit from the house whichenclosed it on one side. As I stood on the lawn I noticed thatthe rough patches where the grass was thin or mottled with weedsno longer seemed to be blemishes. Scattered at random as theywere, they appeared to constitute an ordered design, giving thewhole area the texture of velvet damask, the rough patches beingthe parts where the pile of the velvet is cut. In sheer delight Ibegan to dance on this enchanted carpet, and through the thinsoles of my moccasins I could feel the ground becoming aliveunder my feet, connecting me with the earth and the trees and thesky in such a way that I seemed to become one body with my wholesurroundings. Looking up, I saw that the stars were colored with the samereds, greens, and blues that one sees in iridescent glass, andpassing across them was the single light of a jet plane takingforever to streak over the sky. At the same time, the trees,shrubs, and flowers seemed to be living jewelry, inwardlyluminous like intricate structures of jade, alabaster, or coral,and yet breathing and flowing with the same life that was in me.Every plant became a kind of musical utterance, a play ofvariations on a theme repeated from the main branches, throughthe stalks and twigs, to the leaves, the veins in the leaves, andto the fine capillary network between the veins. Each newbursting of growth from a center repeated or amplified the basicdesign with increasing complexity and delight, finally exultingin a flower. From my description it will seem that the garden acquired anatmosphere that was distinctly exotic, like the gardens ofprecious stones in the Arabian Nights, or like scenes in aPersian miniature. This struck me at the time, and I began towonder just why it is that the glowingly articulated landscapesof those miniatures seem exotic, as do also many Chinese andJapanese paintings. Were the artists recording what they, too,had seen under the influence of drugs? I knew enough of the livesand techniques of Far Eastern painters to doubt this. I asked,too, whether what I was seeing was "drugged." In otherwords, was the effect of the LSD in my nervous system theaddition to my senses of some chemical screen which distorted allthat I saw to preternatural loveliness? Or was its effect ratherto remove certain habitual and normal inhibitions of the mind andsenses, enabling us to see things as they would appear to us ifwe were not so chronically repressed? Little is known of theexact neurological effects of LSD, but what is known suggests thelatter possibility. If this be so, it is possible that the artforms of other cultures appear exotic---that is, unfamiliarlyenchanting---because we are seeing the world through the eyes ofartists whose repressions are not the same as ours. The blocks intheir view of the world may not coincide with ours, so that intheir representations of life we see areas that we normallyignore. I am inclined to some such solution because there havebeen times when I have seen the world in this magical aspectwithout benefit of LSD, and they were times when I was profoundlyrelaxed within, my senses unguardedly open to their surroundings. Feeling, then, not that I was drugged but that I was in anunusual degree open to reality, I tried to discern the meaning,the inner character of the dancing pattern which constituted bothmyself and the garden, and the whole dome of the night with itscolored stars. All at once it became obvious that the whole thingwas love-play, where love means everything that the word canmean, a spectrum ranging from the red of erotic delight, throughthe green of human endearment, to the violet of divine charity,from Freud's libido to Dante's "love that moves the sun andother stars." All were so many colors issuing from a singlewhite light, and, what was more, this single source was not justlove as we ordinarily understand it: it was also intelligence,not only Eros and Agape but also Logos. I could see that theintricate organization both of the plants and of my own nervoussystem, like symphonies of branching complexity, were not justmanifestations of intelligence---as if things like intelligenceand love were in themselves substances or formless forces. It wasrather that the pattern itself is intelligence and is love, andthis somehow in spite of all its outwardly stupid and crueldistortions. There is probably no way of finding objective verificationfor insights such as this. The world is love to him who treats itas such, even when it torments and destroys him, and in states ofconsciousness where there is no basic separation between the egoand the world suffering cannot be felt as malice inflicted upononeself by another. By the same logic it might seem that with outthe separation of self and other there can be no love. This mightbe true if individuality and universality were formal opposites,mutually exclusive of one another, if, that is, theinseparability of self and other meant that all individualdifferentiations were simply unreal. But in the unitary, ornondualistic, view of the world I have been describing this isnot so. Individual differences express the unity, as branches,leaves, and flowers from the same plant, and the love between themembers is the realization of their basic interdependence. I have not yet been able to use LSD in circumstances of greatphysical or moral pain, and therefore my explorations of theproblem of evil under its influence may appear to be shallow.Only once in these experiments have I felt acute fear, but I knowof several cases in which LSD has touched off psychic states ofthe most alarming and unpleasant kind. More than once I haveinvited such states under LSD by looking at images ordinarilysuggestive of "the creeps"---the mandibles of spiders,and the barbs and spines of dangerous fish and insects. Yet theyevoked only a sense of beauty and exuberance, for our normalprojection of malice into these creatures was entirely withdrawn,so that their organs of destruction became no more evil than theteeth of a beautiful woman. On another occasion I looked for along time at a colored reproduction of Van Eyck's LastJudgment, which is surely one of the most horrendous productsof human imagination. The scene of hell is dominated by thefigure of Death, a skeleton beneath whose batlike wings lies awrithing mass of screaming bodies gnawed by snakes whichpenetrate them like maggots in fruit. One of the curious effectsof LSD is to impart an illusion of movement in still images, sothat here the picture came to life and the whole entanglement oflimbs and serpents began to squirm before my eyes. (2) Ordinarily such a sight should have been hideous, but now Iwatched it with intense and puzzled interest until the thoughtcame to me, "Demon est deus inversus---the Devil isGod inverted---so let's turn the picture upside down." I didso, and thereupon burst into laughter for it became apparent atonce that the scene was an empty drama, a sort of spiritualscarecrow, designed to guard some mystery from profanation by theignorant. The agonized expressions of the damned seemed quiteevidently "put on," and as for the death's-head, thegreat skull in the center of the painting, it became just what askull is---an empty shell---and why the horror when there isnothing in it? I was, of course, seeing ecclesiastical hells for what theyare. On the one hand, they are the pretension that socialauthority is ultimately inescapable since there are post-mortempolice who will catch every criminal. On the other hand, they are"no trespassing" signs to discourage the insincere andthe immature from attaining insights which they might abuse. Ababy is put in a play pen to keep it from getting at the matchesor falling downstairs, and though the intention of the pen is tokeep the baby closed in, parents are naturally proud when thechild grows strong enough to climb out. Likewise, a man canperform actions which are truly moral only when he is no longermotivated by the fear of hell, that is, when he grows into unionwith the Good that is beyond good and evil, which, in otherwords, does not act from the love of rewards or the fear ofpunishments. This is precisely the nature of the world when it isconsidered as self-moving action, giving out a past instead ofbeing motivated by a past. Beyond this, the perception of the empty threat of thedeath's-head was certainly a recognition of the fact that thefear of death, as distinct from the fear of dying, is one of themost baseless mirages that trouble us. Because it is completelyimpossible to imagine one's own personal absence, we fill thevoid in our minds with images of being buried alive in perpetualdarkness. If death is the simple termination of a stream ofconsciousness, it is certainly nothing to fear. At the same time,I realize that there is some apparent evidence for survival ofdeath in a few extraordinarily unexplainable mediumisticcommunications and remembrances of past lives. These I attribute,vaguely enough, to subtler networks of communication andinterrelationship in the pattern of life than we ordinarilyperceive. For if forms repeat themselves, if the structure ofbranching trees is reverberated in the design of watercourses inthe desert, it would not be so strange if a pattern so intricateas the human nervous system were to repeat configurations thatarise in consciousness as veritable memories of the most distanttimes. My own feeling, and of course it is nothing more than anopinion, is that we transcend death, not as individualmemory-systems, but only in so far as our true identity is thetotal process of the world as distinct from the apparentlyseparate organism. As I have said, this sense of being the whole process isfrequently experienced with LSD, and, for me, it has often arisenout of a strong feeling of the mutuality of opposites. Line andplane, concept and percept, solid and space, figure and ground,subject and object appear to be so completely correlative as tobe convertible into each other. At one moment it seems that thereare, for example, no lines in nature: there are only theboundaries of planes, boundaries which are, after all, the planesthemselves. But at the next moment, looking carefully into thetexture of these planes, one discovers them to be nothing but adense network of patterned lines. Looking at the form of a treeagainst the sky, I have felt at one moment that its outline"belongs" to the tree, exploding into space. But thenext moment I feel that the same form is the "inline"of the sky, of space imploding the tree. Every pull is felt as apush, and every push as a pull, as in rotating the rim of a wheelwith one's hand. Is one pushing or pulling? The sense that forms are also properties of the space inwhich they expand is not in the least fantastic when oneconsiders the nature of magnetic fields, or, say, the dynamics ofswirling ink dropped into water. The concepts of verbal thoughtare so clumsy that we tend to think only of one aspect of arelationship at a time. We alternate between seeing a given formas a property of the figure and as a property of the ground, asin the Gestalt image of two profiles in black silhouette, aboutto kiss. The white space between them appears as a chalice, butit is intensely difficult to see the kissing faces and thechalice simultaneously. Yet with LSD one appears to be able tofeel this simultaneity quite vividly, and thus to become aware ofthe mutuality of one's own form and action and that of thesurrounding world. The two seem to shape and determine each otherat the same moment, explosion and implosion concurring in perfectharmony, so giving rise to the feeling that one is actual self isboth. This inner identity is felt with every level of theenvironment---the physical world of stars and space, rocks andplants, the social world of human beings, and the ideationalworld of art and literature, music and conversation. All aregrounds or fields operating in the most intimate mutuality withone's own existence and behavior so that the "origin"of action lies in both at once, fusing them into a single act. Itis certainly for this reason that LSD taken in common with asmall group can be a profoundly eucharistic experience, drawingthe members together into an extremely warm and intimate bond offriendship. All in all, I have felt that my experiments with thisastonishing chemical have been most worth while, creative,stimulating, and, above all, an intimation that "there ismore in heaven and earth than is dreamed of in yourphilosophy." Only once have I felt terror, the sense ofbeing close to madness, and even here the insight gained was wellworth the pain. Yet this was enough to convince me thatindiscriminate use of this alchemy might be exceedinglydangerous, and to make me ask who, in our society, is competentto control its use. Obviously, this applies even more to suchother powers of science as atomic energy, but once something isknown there is really no way of locking it up. At the presenttime, 1960, LSD is in the control of pharmacologists and a fewresearch groups of psychiatrists, and though there areunscrupulous and frankly psychotic psychiatrists, this seems tome a far more reliable form of control than that exercised by thepolice and the Bureau of Narcotics---which is not control at all,but ineffective repression, handing over actual control to theforces of organized crime. On the whole, we feel justified in using dangerous powerswhen we can establish that there is a relatively low probabilityof disaster. Life organized so as to be completely foolproof andsecure is simply not worth living, since it requires the finalabolition of freedom. It is on this perfectly rational principleof gambling that we justify the use of travel by air andautomobile, electric appliances in the home, and all the otherdangerous instruments of civilization. Thus far, the record ofcatastrophes from the use of LSD is extremely low, and there isno evidence at all that it is either habit-forming or physicallydeleterious. It is, of course, possible to become psychicallydependent on stimuli which do not establish any craving that canbe identified in physiological terms. Personally, I am no exampleof phenomenal will power, but I find that I have no inclinationto use LSD in the same way as tobacco or wines and liquors. Onthe contrary, the experience is always so fruitful that I feel Imust digest it for some months before entering into it again.Furthermore, I find that I am quite instinctively disinclined touse it without the same sense of readiness and dedication withwhich one approaches a sacrament, and also that the experience isworth while to the precise degree that I keep my critical andintellectual faculties alert. It is generally felt that there is a radical incompatibilitybetween intuition and intellect, poetry and logic, spiritualityand rationality, To me, the most impressive thing about LSDexperiences is that these formally opposed realms seem instead tocomplement and fructify one another, suggesting, therefore, amode of life in which man is no longer an embodied paradox ofangel and animal, of reason fighting instinct, but a marvelouscoincidence in whom Eros and Logos are one. (1) I have often made the point, asin The Way of Zen, that the "real" world is concreterather than abstract, and thus that the conceptual patterns oforder, categorization, and logic which the human mind projectsupon nature are in some way less real. But upon several occasionsLSD has suggested a fundamental identity of percept and concept,concrete and abstract. After all, our brains and the patterns inthem are themselves members of the concrete, physical universe,and thus our abstractions are as much forms of nature as thestructure of crystals or the organization of ferns. (back) (2) Later, with the aid of a seaurchin's shell I was able to find out something of the reasonsfor this effect. All the small purple protuberances on the shellseemed to be wiggling, not only to sight but also to touchWatching this phenomenon closely, I realized that as my eyesmoved across the shell they seemed to change the intensity ofcoloring, amounting to an increase or decrease in the depth ofshadow. This did not happen when the eyes were held still. Nowmotion, or apparent motion, of the shadow will often seem to bemotion of the object casting it, in this case the protrusions onthe shell. In the Van Eyck painting there was likewise analteration, a lightening or darkening, of actual shadows whichthe artist had painted, and thus the same illusion of movement.

Old age is too often synonymous with rigidity rather than wisdom. Not so with Walter Houston Clark, Professor of Psychology of Religion at Andover Newton Theological School in Newton, Massachusetts, former dean and professor at the Hartford School of Religious Education, author of The Oxford Group (1951) and The Psychology of Religion (1958), and founder of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. In an article on "Mysticism as a Basic Concept inDefining the Religious Self," Professor Clark wrote that The [psychedelic] drugs are simply an auxiliary which, used carefully within a religious structure, may assist in mediating an experience which, aside from the presence of the drug, cannot be distinguished psychologically from mysticism. Studies have indicated that, when the experience is interpreted transcendentally or religiously, chances are improved for the rehabilitation of hopeless alcoholics and hardened criminals. Even though observations like these mean that the psychologist can learn a little more of the religious life, in no sense does it ultimately become any less of a mystery. Though man may sow and till, winds may blow and the rains fall, nevertheless it is still God that gives the increase. Today, amid the confusion of grave problems caused not somuch by decades of "drug abuse" as by decades ofincreasingly futile attempts to legislate away the use ofprohibited substances by pious decree, it is all too easilyforgotten that the rediscovery of the psychedelic drugs mid-waythrough the present century was as promising a find as mankindhas seen. A significant, if minority group of our bestscientists, doctors, philosophers, writers, artists, andintellectuals of every description began explorations with thepsychedelics, a search that was really only the continuation ofan age-old quest involving the great majority of peoples andtribes of the ancient world. Psychedelic drugs have, in fact,been used as religious and curing aids since the very beginningof human existence, and only in the 1950's was any significant"scientific" research begun using them. This research planted the seeds of a revolution of a kindthat science purportedly thrives upon, but the sprouting of theseeds was aborted early on by scandal. In the following articlewe read about some research that was later to be ignored not somuch because it was scandalous, but because it challenged some ofthe underlying paradigms of the entire scientific enterprise.Some of the findings of psychedelic research seemed to herald amerging of the "scientific" and "religious"or "mystical" viewpoints, despite very powerfulresistance by both sides to opposing views. The scientificviewpoint had for a long time generally disdained religion asprimitive superstition, and religious thinkers of everydenomination had tended to view the destructive uses to whichscience had been put as evidence of its ultimate inability toadvance the human condition. Yet some scholars such as ProfessorClark saw the rediscovery of psychedelics as the key to theblossoming of a new view. In the words of Alan Watts, For a long time we have been accustomed to the compartmentalization of religion and science as if they were two quite different and basically unrelated ways of seeing the world. I do not believe that this state of doublethink can last. It must eventually be replaced by a view of the world which is neither religious nor scientific but simply our view of the world. More exactly, it must become a view of the world in which the reports of science and religion are as concordant as those of the eyes and the ears. (Preface to The Joyous Cosmology, 1962). In retrospect, it will be seen by historians of the 21stcentury that the scandal of the 1960's was not Dr. Timothy Learyleading a generation down the road to a drugged oblivion, (forthat generation is today doing quite well!) but rather that suchPuritanical views of mere over-enthusiasm for a new discovery leda generation of scientists and world leaders to throw away whatin any other epoch would have been a Holy Grail, a discovery ofsuch fundamental importance that the great discoveries that hadmade modern technological civilization possible would seem almosttrivial by comparison. The situation continues today unabated,despite the continued availability of the wisdom of ProfessorClark and the many other pioneers of psychedelic discovery. Peter Webster The Psychedelics and Religion WALTER HOUSTON CLARK from: PSYCHEDELICS, edited by Bernard Aaronson andHumphrey Osmond, Doubleday & Company, 1970. Copyright 1970Aaronson & Osmond. The recent discovery of the religious properties of LysergicAcid Diethylamide-25 is not such a wholly new phenomenon as somepeople seem to believe. There is some evidence to suggest thatthe secret potion that was part of the ordeal of initiation intothe Eleusinian mysteries in ancient Greece contained apsychedelic drug. The somewhat mysterious drug called soma, usedin India, sometimes for religious purposes, was psychedelic,while the Mexican mushroom whose active principle is psilocybinhas been used by the Aztecs for centuries in their sacraments.Their word for it, significantly, meant "God's flesh." The peyote button, the top of a certain spineless cactusplant, has been and is now used by some members of nearly all theAmerican Indian tribes in cultic ceremonies. The peyote religiongoes back nearly a century in historical records and certainly iseven more ancient. At present it is represented by the NativeAmerican Church, a loose collection of some two hundred thousandmembers, according to its claim. Peyote among the Indians has hada history of controversy not unlike LSD among whites. However,despite years of repressive laws and legal harassment, there hasbeen little or no hard evidence of claims made as to itsharmfulness, and some indication that it has done good. Moreimportantly, laws made to repress its use have been declaredunconstitutional in several states on the ground that they haveviolated constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion.(1) Perhaps the most distinguished and eloquent advocate of theview that certain chemicals may promote religious states of mindwas William James, who some seventy years ago inhaled thepsychedelic of his day, nitrous oxide. He referred to thisself-experiment, in The Varieties of Religious Experience,in his chapter on mysticism, where he wrote the often quotedwords: . . . our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it parted by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.... No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.(2) But "religion" is an elusive term, and whether ornot we can regard states associated with the psychedelics asreligious depends on how we define it. Doubtless there are thosewho would regard any state initiated by the ingestion of achemical as by definition non-religious. For such people,the reading of this chapter will be an idle exercise. Tillichdefines religion as "ultimate concern," while bothWilliam James and W. R. Inge speak of the roots of religion asultimately mystical. Rudolf Otto, in The Idea of the Holy(1958), speaks of the non-rational elements of the religious lifein terms of horror, dread, amazement, and fascination as the mysteriumtremendum, "the mystery that makes one tremble."Certainly, as I will point out in more detail later, the subjectwho has consumed the forbidden fruit of the psychedelics willoften testify that he has been opened to his own "ultimateconcern" in life and may even speak in terms reminiscent ofthe medieval mystics. Furthermore, one of the chief objections ofthe opponents of the psychedelics is that for many the experiencemay be "dread-full," as cogent an illustration ofOtto's thesis as one could well expect to find. Long before I took very seriously the claims that eaters ofpsychedelic chemicals made as to their religious experiences, Idefined religion as "the inner experience of an individualwhen he senses a Beyond, especially as evidenced by the effect ofthis experience on his behavior when he actively attempts toharmonize his behavior with the Beyond."(3) Consequently, itwould be to this standard that I would refer experiencestriggered by the psychedelic drugs, in order to determine whetherthey should be called religious or not. From the definition, it will be clear that the core ofreligious experience is subjective therefore never to be fullyshared with another person. Consequently we are forced to rely toa large degree on the words of the religious person for anydetermination of religion. This necessity disturbs the modernpsychologist whose too-narrow conception of his discipline as ascience bars him from probing the nature of the religiousconsciousness despite its cogency as a source of profoundpersonality change. As he observes the conventional churchgoerand hears him glibly using such terms as "conviction of sin"rebirth" "redemption" and"salvation," the psychologist may too hastily concludethat such terms are mere pious language that brings a certainsentimental comfort to the worshiper but hardly represents anymarked change in his relations with his fellow men. Thepsychologist has forgotten, if he ever knew, that such terms arethe echoes of experiences that, perhaps many years ago but alsotoday, have transformed the lives of prince and beggars enablingthem to unify their lives and attain heights that could have beenpossible in no other way. It is this effectiveness, along withthe subjective reports by subjects of encounters filled withmystery and awe, for which we must be on the lookout as we try toappraise the religious significance and value of these strangechemicals. But before we start our survey I must say something about theplace of the non-rational in the religious life. Notice that Icall it non-rational, not irrational. The religiouslife involves at least three basic factors: First is the life ofspeculation and thought, the expression of the rational functionof the human mind. The second is the active expression ofreligious principles, the concern for others and the observanceof ethics and other social demands that grow out of one'sreligious commitment. Religion shares these two functions withother interests and duties of humankind. But the third functionis unique, and without it no other function or activity can becalled religious in any but a very pale and secondary sense. Thisthird function is the experience of the sacred, the encounterwith the holy, which not so much logically, but intuitively, ornon-rationally, the subject recognizes as that which links himwith the seers and the saints of today and of yesterday. Anon-drug example will be found in Arthur Koestler'sautobiographical The Invisible Writing (1955), in thechapter entitled "The Hours by the Window." It is thisnon-rational perception of the holy that so moves the individualand interpenetrates both his thinking and his activity, infusingthem with tremendous energy and giving to his whole life thatstamp we call religious. We must ask whether in any sense thepsychedelic substances arouse this factor, to determine whetherwe can characterize the result as religion. If we can accept the direction of the argument thus far, thatthe essential core of religion may be found in the mysticalconsciousness and the direct experience of the holy, I can showconsiderable evidence that it is this aspect of the nonrationalconsciousness that the psychedelic drugs release. I consider myfirst example sufficiently persuasive to make the point. Dr. Walter N. Pahnke of Spring Grove Hospital, Baltimore, ina doctorate study at Harvard, used twenty theological students ina double-blind study of the effects of psilocybin. All twentywere given similar preparations; half were given the drug andhalf placebos; then all attended the same two-and-one-half-hourGood Friday service. The experimental group reported overwhelmingevidence of mystical experiences, while the control groupreported next to none.(4) The reports included intuitions andencounters with ultimate reality, the holy, and God; in otherwords the "Beyond" of my definition. Furthermore, asix-month follow-up showed much evidence that the subjects feltthey had experienced an enlivening of their religious lives,resulting in an increased involvement with the problems of livingand the service of others. The previous sentence supports that aspect of my definitionthat emphasizes the active functions of religion, the effect ofthe experience of the Beyond on the individual when he"actively attempts to harmonize his life with theBeyond." Western prejudices in religion favor the pragmatictest, so claims of encounter with God or ultimate reality arealways more impressive when they can be supported by concreteevidence of benefit like this. Further cogent evidence issupplied us in studies of alcoholics treated with LSD by Osmondand Hoffer in the early 1950S in Saskatchewan. According to Dr.Hoffer's report, of sixty difficult cases, half were no longerdrinking five years later, while there was a very highcorrespondence between success and the report of the subject thathis experience had been transcendental in William James's senseof the term.(5) Still more evidence pointing in the same general directioncomes from work done by Dr. Timothy Leary when he was at Harvard.He received permission from the State Commission of Correction togive psilocybin to thirty-five inmates at Concord StateReformatory. Since Dr. Leary had reported that the convicts werehaving religious experiences and the work was controversial, Ipersuaded him to introduce me to some of them so that I couldinvestigate at first hand. While unable to follow up all thesubjects, I talked with those who were still in prison---by andlarge those who had committed the more serious crimes and so wereserving long terms. I found that it was indeed true that thesemen referred to their experiences as religious in varying ways.One reported a vision in which he had participated with Christ inHis Crucifixion. Shortly after this, he had looked out thewindow. "Suddenly all my life came before my eyes,"said this man, an armed robber of nearly forty who had spent mostof his adult life behind bars, "and I said to myself, What awasted Since that time these men have formed, within the walls,an AA-type organization called the Self-Development Group, torehabilitate themselves and others. I could not deny that therewere profound religious forces at work among these men as theresult of the drug treatment (Leary and Clark, 1963). In their book The Varieties of Psychedelic ExperienceMasters and Houston present a wealth of cases illustratingpsychedelic experiences of various kinds. Though nearly all their206 subjects reported religious imagery of some kind, only a fewdemonstrated mystical experience of what the authors consider atransforming and integrating kind at the deepest level; but theybelieve that the drugs do facilitate the latter, making theirbelief clear chiefly through a remarkable illustrative case intheir final chapter. The subject, a successful psychologist inhis late thirties, had been irresistibly attracted to whatsociety regards as "evil" from his earliest youth. Hebelieved in nothing, was a militant atheist, was sexuallypromiscuous, and to his students "preached a gospel of totaldebauchery." The appearance of neurotic symptoms had led himinto a process of self-analysis and therapy, which had been onlypartly successful. But only three sessions with LSD led thisperson, through an intricate series of shattering symbolicexperiences, to an almost total transformation of self. A yearafterward, this transformation was seen by the subject as anencounter with God that had been both religious and lasting. Thisfact was attested to by those who knew him. The foregoing is just a sampling of many studies that reportreligious elements following the ingestion of psychedelic drugs.When the environment suggests religion, a higher proportion, upto 85-90 per cent, of the experiences are perceived as religiousby the subjects. Those who resist the religious interpretationare much less likely to experience it, but even some of these,much to their surprise, may "experience God." The following case is an illustration: As part of anexperiment at a mental hospital, I had occasion to guide a youngcollege graduate I will call Duncan Cohen. Brought up as a Jew,he had become a strong atheist and married outside his faith. Theinvestigation required a number of sessions, and the study of itsreligious aspects was only an incidental aspect of theexperiment. The setting aimed to be supportive, the surroundingssoftened with flowers and music, and the subjects were encouragedto bring with them into their private hospital rooms anything ofsignificance to them, including their choice of music if desired.Duncan was given sixteen daily doses of 180 micrograms of LSD. Hewas initially irritated by me as a person who taught in atheological school; and, though he came to trust me more and moreas the sessions continued, he steadfastly resisted any religiousinterpretation of the sessions, which, even from the first, heregarded primarily as experiences of rebirth. The early sessionsinvolved a climactic series of symbolic encounters with variousmembers of his family, followed by a dramatic enactment of hisown death, in which he acted both as "corpse" and"funeral director," while I was asked to pray as the"officiating rabbi." Still the essentially religiousnature of much of these proceedings was either denied or onlydimly sensed. I tried to avoid pressing any religiousinterpretation on him, though my interests doubtless actedsuggestively on him. The climax came after the fifteenth ingestion. About fourhours after taking the drug on that day, he had been sitting onthe lawn outside the hospital watching two grasshoppersmaneuvering in what he interpreted as a kind of cosmic dance.Suddenly, he felt at one with them and with the cosmos besides. Iwas aware of it only after he caught sight of me and came runningover to me in great excitement calling, "Dr. Clark, I havehad a mystical experience; I have met God!" A nine-month follow-up indicated that Duncan regards thetotal experience as a most significant one. He has continued togrow and mature, as he sees it. There have been some difficulttimes. "What I regarded as the end of the experience when Ileft the hospital," he told me, "was simply thebeginning of an experience of maturing which is stillcontinuing." He reports more tolerance and open-mindedness,and he recoils when he thinks of what he now regards as hisformer narrow-mindedness. He has reflected with increased insighton the role of religion in history, history being a favoritesubject. I do not know that he is any more hospitable toinstitutionalized religion, though now he is willing to accept aview of life that for him is more, rather than less, religiousthan that of the conventional churchgoer. At any rate,psychedelic religious cults, like the League for SpiritualDiscovery, have an appeal for him that they did not have before.Religion in a profound sense, in human nature and in history, hasmore meaning to him. In the middle 1950s Aldous Huxley published his influential TheDoors of Perception, describing an experience with mescalineand advocating it as a means of vitalizing the religious life,with particular emphasis on its mystical aspects. R. C. Zaehner,in his Mysticism: Sacred and Profane (1957), takes issuewith Huxley and points out that while mescaline may be able torelease pantheistic or monistic types of religion, includingthose closely associated with psychosis, it cannot be said tostimulate a theistic religious experience. He does not see itsuse justified by Christian doctrine. Zaehner's reasoning is basedpartly on a self-experiment with mescaline, and so he cannot beclassified with those many critics of the psychedelics anxious tomake people's flesh creep without having any firsthand knowledgeof what they are talking about. But, commendable though ProfessorZaehner's effort may have been, he falls into a familiar fallacycommon to all users and non-users of the psychedelics, includingHuxley, namely, that of generalizing too widely on the basis ofhis own personal experience and point of view. It is true that the religious experience of many of the drugusers seems to them to fit more readily into pantheistic andEastern religious patterns. But the experience itself isessentially non-rational and indescribable. In order that it maybe described, one is forced to use concepts of one type oranother, none of which seem to do justice to the experience.Consequently these are of great variety, and while some willagree with the Zaehner theological typology, others have no moretrouble seeing their experiences as essentially Christian thandid St. Teresa when she described one of her mystical visions asrevealing to her the secrets of the Trinity. I have known thosewhose psychedelic experiences have returned them from atheism tothe Christian tradition in which they had been brought up, and Ihave also known those who preferred Eastern concepts. W. T. Stace, in Mysticisrn and Philosophy (1960),distinguishes between the mystical experience itself, which hefinds to be universal in its characteristics, and theinterpretation of that experience, which differs from faith tofaith and from century to century. Thus the Christian will referhis experience to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, while theBuddhist will explain an identical psychological experience interms of Nirvana. Stace further aids us in clarifying the natureof a psychedelic experience in his "principle of causalindifference." This states that what makes an experiencemystical is not what touches it off, whether drug or Christiansacrament, but its experiential characteristics. It may then beconceptualized in any way deemed suitable by the experiencer. Imay add that, just as a Christian sacrament may or may notstimulate a mystical experience in any given worshiper, the samething may be said of mescaline or LSD. Stace gives us an exampleof mystical experience meeting his specifications triggered bymescaline.(6) In another part of his book, he discusses the experience ofpantheism, which so often has gotten the mystic into trouble.Calling the experience "transsubjective," he points outits paradoxical character, in which the mystic may feel himselfboth merged with the Godhead and infinitely the creature of Godat the same time. Consequently, we can understand how, in somesense, mysticism can be felt to be compatible with theism by onemystic and with atheistic Buddhism by another. The same argumentwill help to explain the variety of theological and philosophicalconcepts used to interpret the psychedelic experience. There would be no greater mistake than to suppose, since thepsychedelics are frequently accompanied by religious experience,that God, when He created these chemicals, baptized them andsegregated them for religious purposes. Indeed, had this been Hispurpose, it would seem that He has not kept up with Histheological and medical reading, for He might have foreseen thedifficulties He was preparing for their users. As I have alreadypointed out, there is no guarantee that a given person will havewhat satisfies him as a religious experience. However, certainconditions will favor this religious result, and I will indicatebriefly a few of the most important. First of all, there is the subject himself---his nature, andthe desire he may have for the religious experience. A personalready religiously sensitive is more apt to have a religiousexperience than one who is not, and one who deliberately prepareshimself is more apt to be rewarded than one who is indifferent orunaware of the possibility. Vide the case of Duncan Cohen,who had ingested LSD fourteen times without a religious outcome;the only experimental subject in the Good Friday experiment whofailed to report a mystical experience was one who did notbelieve it possible and deliberately set out to demonstrate thisbelief, partly by omitting the religious preparation engaged inby the other subjects. The setting is another factor that favors or discouragesreligion. If the drug is taken in a church or the subject issurrounded by religious symbolism, he is more apt to obtain areligious result. Appropriate readings at strategic points duringthe period when the drug is active, say from the Bible or theTibetan Book of the Dead, particularly when accompanied byreligious music, are other favoring circumstances. If the guideis a deeply religious person and anxious to promote a religiousoutcome, this will be another plus factor. Subjects have reportedfeeling this with respect to Dr. Leary, and doubtless this helpsto explain the high incidence of religious experiences reportedin his experiments. It is obvious that all these factors dependfor their influence on the suggestibility of the subject.However, it would be a mistake to think that suggestibility willexplain it all, since, once the experience gets started, theunconscious of the individual subject seems to take over thedirection of matters in large measure. But the initialsuggestibility of the subject and the manner in which it isexploited, by himself or by others, will enhance thesuggestibility that most investigators feel to be one of thesalient characteristics of the psychedelic state. Critics, to prove their point that psychedelic experiencesare not truly religious, often cite the fact that beneficialresults do not always last. But in this respect they are nodifferent from other types of religious experience. Everyevangelist is well acquainted with backsliders. Ifpersonality-changes brought about through psychedelic experienceare to be made permanent, they must be followed up. The issues that the psychedelics pose seem to most people tobe in the realm of therapy, health, and the law. They may be moreimportantly religious. One of the functions of religion---perhapsits chief function---is that of supplying life with meaning. Themost luminous source of this meaning, through the ages, has beenthe religious experience of religiously gifted leaders, thedreamers of dreams and the seers of visions, prophets, converts,evangelists, seers, martyrs, and mystics. According to theirenlightenment, these men and women have stood before the Lord,some in joy, some in vision, some in transport, and some in fearand trembling. But however rapt, these are the people who havemade their mark on that profoundest function of man's strangesojourn on this earth. Astonished, amazed, offended, and evenhorror-stricken, the present generation of responsible defendersof the status quo have seen many of those who haveingested these drugs present pictures of such conditions ascapture the imagination of youth with a cogency that churchesfind hard to match. The psychedelic movement is a religiousmovement. The narrowly restrictive laws that have been passedhave made it a lawless movement with respect to the use of thedrugs, though generally it is not in other respects. It has had its parallels in other ages, and it will beinstructive for us to take a brief look at history. The earlyChristians were looked on with some alarm by that magnificentpeace-keeping agency, the Roman Empire. Because they refused eventhat insignificant homage to the divine Emperor that would havesatisfied the State, these dissenters were persecuted and led todeath in the arena, their persecutors being among the moreconscientious of their rulers. Heretics and Jews during theMiddle Ages were burned at the stake for engaging in secret ritesand the holding of views disapproved by the Church. Among theformer were many mystics who had undergone experiences verysimilar to, and probably often identical with, those of many ofthe psychedelic hipsters of our times. Sitting in judgment onthese sensitive religious spirits (such as Meister Eckhart) werenot irresponsible sadists but sober clerics whose business it wasto protect other souls from heresy. These judges had no firsthandknowledge of the mystic's vision. They were rational andconscientious men charged with the duty of saving their fellowsfrom the flames of Hell, even as conscientious judges of our timeenforce the modern equivalent of the stake as they sentence tolong prison terms those whose visions and ecstasy they have nevershared. They only know that laws have been broken, and they wishto protect society. They act according to their lights. But religious people have never been notable for setting lawabove the dictates of their consciences, and it is this stubbornhabit of the human mind that has brought us such protection asreligious conviction has against the state. It will also makelaws against the psychedelic drugs almost unenforceable. Yet ithas been religious conviction hardened into legalism, whethertheological or civil, that has led to intolerable controversy,self-righteous cruelties, and some of the most savage wars ofhistory. This shameful record has led to the principle ofreligious freedom such as that written into the Americanconstitution, which, nevertheless, only partially protectsreligious minorities from the tyranny of the majority. In generalthere is no type of religious experience for which the averageAmerican, high or low, has so little tolerance as that typefostered by the psychedelic drugs. The reason is that themystical side of human nature has been so repressed that it islittle understood. It has been looked on as esoteric and Eastern,therefore vaguely opposed to the American way of life. Societymust be protected against it, say conservative churchgoers,Daughters of the American Revolution, respected members of theacademic community, and the American Medical Association. In order to call attention to a neglected aspect of thecontroversy over the psychedelics, I have a little overstated acase in order to make my point clear. For certainly I recognizethe fact that the drugs have their dangers and need to becontrolled, though I wish that legislators and enforcementagencies would make greatly needed research much easier. Some ofthe world's most experienced and eminent investigators in thisarea find the drug denied to them. But it is not surprising thatcults that see in the psychedelics a sacramental substance ofgreat potency have been growing apace during the past few years,from the Neo-American Church, whose leaders militantly stand ontheir constitutional right to use the substances sacramentally,to the Church of the Awakening, which is more conservative butwhich nevertheless has applied to the FDA for the right to usepeyote as does the Native American Church. This right, like otherreligious rights, has been hard won by the Indians throughloyalty of cult members, self-sacrifice, and the willingness ofindividuals to go to jail if need be in support of theirconvictions. If the Indians can use peyote, it is hard to see whywhite churches cannot make good their right to do likewise. Inthe meantime, both legal and illegal use of the psychedelics goeson, sometimes religious and sometimes nonreligious, sometimeswith irresponsible foolhardiness and sometimes with the highestresolution that such promising tools shall not be lost tosociety, at least until their most cunning secrets be wrestedfrom them through careful research and responsible practice. But there is no doubt that the drugs and their religious useconstitute a challenge to the established churches. Here is ameans to religious experience that not only makes possible a morevital religious experience than the churches can ordinarilydemonstrate, but the regeneration of souls and the transformationof personality are made possible to an extent that seems to befar more reliable and frequent than what the ordinary churchescan promise. LSD is a tool through which religious experiencemay, so to speak, be brought into the laboratory that it may morepractically become a matter for study. It is important thatreligious institutions face the issues raised so that anydecisions they may have to make will derive from sound knowledgerather than prejudice, ignorance, and fear. I do not have thewisdom nor does anyone yet have the knowledge to say in advancewhat the action of the churches will be or ought to be. But I dosay that if such decisions are to be sound, they must be based onthorough information, freedom from hysteria, and above all,open-mindedness to what may reliably be learned both of the greatpromise and the dangers of these fascinating substances.

DO DRUGS HAVE RELIGIOUS IMPORT? HUSTON SMITH, Ph.D. Until six months ago, if I picked up my phone in theCambridge area and dialed KISS- BIG a voice would answer,"Ifif." These were coincidences: KISS-BIG simplyhappened to be the letter equivalents of an arbitrarily assignedtelephone number, while I.F.I.F. represented the initials of anorganization with the improbable name of the InternationalFederation for Internal Freedom. But the coincidences wereapposite to the point of being poetic. "Kiss big"caught the euphoric, manic, life-embracing attitude thatcharacterized this most publicized of the organizations formed toexplore the newly synthesized consciousness-changing substances,while the organization itself was surely one of the"iffy-est" phenomena to appear on our social andintellectual scene in some time. It produced the first firings inHarvard's history, an ultimatum to get out of Mexico in fivedays, and "the miracle of Marsh Chapel" in which duringa two-and-one-half hour Good Friday service ten theologicalstudents and professors ingested psilocybin and were visited bywhat they generally reported to be the deepest religiousexperiences of their lives. Despite the last of these phenomena and its numerous if lessdramatic parallels, students of religion appear by and large tobe dismissing the psychedelic drugs which have sprung to ourattention in the sixties as having little religious relevance.The position taken in one of the most forward-looking volumes oftheological essays to have appeared in recent years (1) accepts R. C.Zaehner's Mysticism Sacred and Profane as having"fully examined and refuted" the religious claims formescaline which Aldous Huxley sketched in The Doors ofPerception. This closing of the case strikes me as premature,for it looks as if the drugs have light to throw on the historyof religion, the phenomenology of religion, the philosophy ofreligion, and the practice of the religious life itself. 1. Drugs and Religion Viewed Historically In his trial-and-error life explorations man almosteverywhere has stumbled upon connections between vegetables(eaten or brewed) and actions (yogic breathing exercises,whirling dervish dances, flagellations) which altered states ofconsciousness. From the psychopharmacological standpoint we nowunderstand these states to be the products of changes in brainchemistry. From the sociological perspective we see that theytended to be connected in some way with religion. If we discountthe wine used in our own communion services, the instancesclosest to us in time and space are the peyote of The NativeAmerican (Indian) Church and Mexico's 2,000- year-old"sacred mushrooms," the latter rendered in Aztec as"God's flesh"—striking parallel to "the bodyof our Lord" in the Christian Eucharist. Beyond theseneighboring instances lie the soma of the Hindus, the haomaand hemp, identical with and better known as marijuana, of theZoroastrians, the Dionysus of the Greeks who "everywhere . .. taught men the culture of the vine and the mysteries of hisworship and everywhere [was] accepted as a god," (2) the benzoinof Southeast Asia, Zen's tea whose fifth cup purifies and whosesixth "calls to the realm of the immortals," (3) the pituriof the Australian aborigines and probably the mystic kykeonthat was eaten and drunk at the climactic close of the sixth dayof the Eleusinian mysteries. (4) There is no need to extend the list,especially as Philippie de Felice's comprehensive study of thesubject, Poisons Sacr�s, Ivresses Divines (Sacred Poisons,Divine Raptures), is about to appear in English. More interesting than the fact that consciousness-changingdevices have been linked with religion is the possibility thatthey actually initiated many of the religious perspectives which,taking root in history, continued after their psychedelic originswere forgotten. Bergson saw the first movement of Hindus andGreeks toward "dynamic religion" as associated with the"divine rapture" found in intoxicating beverages; (5) more recentlyRobert Graves, Gordon Wasson and Alan Watts have suggested thatmost religions arose from such chemically-induced theophanies.Mary Barnard is the most explicit proponent of this thesis."Which . . . was more likely to happen first," she asksin the autumn 1963 journal of Phi Beta Kappa: "thespontaneously generated idea of an afterlife in which thedisembodied soul, liberated from the restrictions of time andspace, experiences eternal bliss, or the accidental discovery ofhallucinogenic plants that give a sense of euphoria, dislocatethe center of consciousness, and distort time and space, makingthem balloon outward in greatly expanded vistas?" Her ownanswer is that "the [latter] experience might have had . . .an almost explosive effect on the largely dormant minds of men,causing them to think of things they had never thought of before.This, if you like, is direct revelation." Her use of thesubjunctive "might" renders this formulation of heranswer equivocal, but she concludes her essay on a note that iscompletely unequivocal: "Looking at the matter coldly,unintoxicated and unentranced, I am willing to prophesy thatfifty theo-botanists working for fifty years would make thecurrent theories concerning the origins of much mythology andtheology as out-of-date as pre-Copernican astronomy." (6) This is an important hypothesis—one which must surelyengage the attention of historians of religion for some time tocome. But as I am concerned here only to spot the points at whichthe drugs erupt onto the field of serious religious study, not toride the geysers to whatever height, I shall not pursue MissBarnard's thesis. Having located what appears to be the crux ofthe historical question, namely the extent to which drugs notmerely duplicate or simulate theologically sponsored experiencesbut generate or shape theologies themselves, I turn tophenomenology. 2. Drugs and Religion Viewed Phenomenologically Phenomenology attempts a careful description of humanexperience. The question the drugs pose for the phenomenology ofreligion, therefore, is whether the experiences they inducediffer from religious experiences reached au nature and if sohow. Even the Bible notes that chemically induced psychic statesbear some resemblance to religious ones. Peter had toappeal to a circumstantial criterion—the early hour of theday—to defend those who were caught up in the Pentecostalexperience against the charge that they were merely drunk:"These men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is onlythe third hour of the day" (Acts 2:15); and Paul initiatesthe comparison when he admonishes the Ephesians not to "getdrunk with wine . . . but [to] be filled with the spirit"(Ephesians 5:18). Are such comparisons, paralleled in theaccounts of virtually every religion, superficial? How far canthey be pushed? Not all the way, students of religion have thus far insisted.With respect to the new drugs, Professor R. C. Zaehner has drawnthe line emphatically. "The importance of Huxley's Doorsof Perception," he writes, "is that in it theauthor clearly makes the claim that what he experienced under theinfluence of mescalin is closely comparable to a genuine mysticalexperience. If he is right . . . the conclusions . . . arealarming." (7)Zaehner thinks that Huxley is not right, but Zaehner is mistaken. There are, of course, innumerable drug experiences whichhaven't a religious feature; they can be sensual as readily asspiritual, trivial as readily as transforming, capricious asreadily as sacramental. If there is one point about which everystudent of the drugs agrees, it is that there is no such thing asthe drug experience per se—no experience which the drugs, asit were, merely secrete. Every experience is a mix of threeingredients: drug, set (the psychological makeup of theindividual) and setting (the social and physical environment inwhich it is taken). But given the right set and setting, thedrugs can induce religious experiences indistinguishable fromones that occur spontaneously. Nor need set and setting beexceptional. The way the statistics are currently running, itlooks as if from one-fourth to one-third of the generalpopulation will have religious experiences if they take the drugsunder naturalistic conditions, meaning by this conditions inwhich the researcher supports the subject but doesn't try toinfluence the direction his experience will take. Among subjectswho have strong religious inclinations to begin with, theproportion of those having religious experiences jumps tothree-fourths. If they take them in settings which are religioustoo, the ratio soars to nine out of ten. How do we know that the experiences these people have reallyare religious? We can begin with the fact that they say they are.The "one-fourth to one-third of the general populous"figure is drawn from two sources. Ten months after they had hadtheir experiences, 24 percent of the 194 subjects in a study bythe California psychiatrist Oscar Janiger characterized them ashaving been religious. (8)Thirty-two percent of the 74 subjects in Ditman and Hayman'sstudy reported that in looking back on their LSD experience itlooked as if it had been "very much" or "quite abit" a religious experience; 42 percent checked as true thestatement that they "were left with a greater awareness ofGod, or a higher power, or ultimate reality." (9) The statement thatthree-fourths of subjects having religious "sets" willhave religious experiences comes from the reports of sixty-ninereligious professionals who took the drugs while the Harvardproject was in progress. (10) In the absence of (a) a single definition of a religiousexperience acceptable to psychologists of religion generally, and(b) foolproof ways of ascertaining whether actual experiencesexemplify any definition, I am not sure there is a better way oftelling whether the experiences of the 333 men and women involvedin the above studies were religious than by noting whether theyseemed so to them. But if more rigorous methods are preferred,they exist; they have been utilized and confirm the conviction ofthe man in the street that drug experiences can indeed bereligious. In his doctoral study at Harvard University, Dr.Walter Pahnke worked out a typology of religious experience (inthis instance of the mystical variety) based on the classic casesof mystical experiences as summarized in Walter Stace's Mysticismand Philosophy. He then administered psilocybin to tentheology students and professors in the setting of a Good Fridayservice. The drug was given "double-blind," meaningthat neither Dr. Pahnke nor his subjects would know which tenwere getting psilocybin and which ten placebos to constitute acontrol group. Subsequently the reports the subjects wrote oftheir experiences were laid successively before threecollege-graduate housewives who, without being informed about thenature of the study, were asked to rate each statement as to thedegree (strong, moderate, slight, or none) to which itexemplified each of the nine traits of mystical experience asenumerated in the typology of mysticism worked out in advance.When the test of significance was applied to their statistics, itshowed that "those subjects who received psilocybinexperienced phenomena which were indistinguishable from, if notidentical with . . . the categories defined by our typology ofmysticism." (11) With the thought that the reader might like to test his ownpowers of discernment on the question being considered, I inserthere a simple test I gave to a group of Princeton studentsfollowing a recent discussion sponsored by the Woodrow WilsonSociety. Below are accounts of two religious experiences. One occurred under the influence of drugs, one without their influence. Check the one you think was drug-induced. I Suddenly I burst into a vast, new, indescribably wonderful universe. Although I am writing this over a year later, the thrill of the surprise and amazement, the awesomeness of the revelation, the engulfment in an overwhelming feeling-wave of gratitude and blessed wonderment, are as fresh, and the memory of the experience is as vivid, as if it had happened five minutes ago. And yet to concoct anything by way of description that would even hint at the magnitude, the sense of ultimate reality . . . this seems such an impossible task. The knowledge which has infused and affected every aspect of my life came instantaneously and with such complete force of certainty that it was impossible, then or since, to doubt its validity. II All at once, without warning of any kind, I found myself wrapped in a flame-colored cloud. For an instant I thought of fire . . . the next, I knew that the fire was within myself. Directly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among other things, I did not merely come to believe, but I saw that the universe is not composed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary, a living Presence; I became conscious in myself of eternal life.... I saw that all men are immortal: that the cosmic order is such that without any peradventure all things work together for the good of each and all; that the foundation principle of the world . . . is what we call love, and that the happiness of each and all is in the long run absolutely certain. On the occasion referred to, twice the number of students(46) answered incorrectly as answered correctly (23). I bury thecorrect answer in a footnote to preserve the reader's opportunityto test himself. (l2) Why, in the face of this considerable evidence, does Zaehnerhold that drug experiences cannot be authentically religious?There appear to be three reasons: 1. His own experience was "utterly trivial." Thisof course proves that not all drug experiences are religious; itdoes not prove that no drug experiences are religious. 2. He thinks that the experiences of others which appear tobe religious to them are not truly so. Zaehner distinguishesthree kinds of mysticism: nature mysticism in which the soul isunited with the natural world; monistic mysticism in which thesoul merges with an impersonal absolute; and theism in which thesoul confronts the living, personal God. He concedes that drugscan induce the first two species of mysticism, but not itssupreme instance, the theistic. As proof, he analyzes Huxley'sexperience as recounted in The Doors of Perception to showthat it produced at best a blend of nature and monisticmysticism. Even if we were to accept Zaehner's evaluation of thethree forms of mysticism, Huxley's case, and indeed Zaehner'sentire book, would prove only that not every mystical experienceinduced by the drugs is theistic. Insofar as Zaehner goes beyondthis to imply that drugs do not and cannot induce theisticmysticism, he not only goes beyond the evidence but proceeds inthe face of it. Professor Slotkin reports that the peyote Indians"see visions, which may be of Christ Himself. Sometimes theyhear the voice of the Great Spirit. Sometimes they become awareof the presence of God and of those personal shortcomings whichmust be corrected if they are to do His will." (l3) And G. M.Carstairs, reporting on the use of psychedelic bhang (marijuana)in India, quotes a Brahmin as saying, "It gives goodbhakti.... You get a very good bhakti with bhang," bhaktibeing precisely Hinduism's theistic variant.(l4) 3. There is a third reason why Professor Zaehner might doubtthat drugs can induce experiences that are genuinely mystical.Professor Zaehner is a Roman Catholic, and Roman Catholicdoctrine teaches that mystical rapture is a gift of grace and assuch can never be reduced to man's control. This may be true;certainly the empirical evidence cited does not preclude thepossibility of a genuine ontological or theological differencebetween natural and drug-induced religious experiences. At thispoint, however, we are considering phenomenology rather thanontology, description rather than interpretation, and on thislevel there is no difference. Descriptively, drug experiencescannot be distinguished from their natural religious counterpart.When the current philosophical authority on mysticism, Dr. W. T.Stace, Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, was askedwhether the drug experience is similar to the mysticalexperience, he answered, "It's not a matter of its being similarto mystical experience; it is mystical experience." What we seem to be witnessing in Zaehner's MysticismSacred and Profane is a reenactment of the age-old pattern inthe conflict between science and religion. Whenever a newcontroversy arises, religion's first impulse is to deny thedisturbing evidence science has produced. Seen in perspective,Zaehner's refusal to admit that drugs can induce experiencesdescriptively indistinguishable from those which arespontaneously religious is the current counterpart of theseventeenth century theologians' refusal to look throughGalileo's telescope or, when they did, their persistence indismissing what they saw as machinations of the devil. When thefact that drugs can trigger religious experiences becomesincontrovertible, discussion will move to the more difficultquestion of how this new fact is to be interpreted. The latterquestion leads beyond phenomenology into philosophy. 3. Drugs and Religion Viewed Philosophically Why do people reject evidence? Because they find itthreatening, we may suppose. Theologians are not the onlyprofessionals to utilize this mode of defense. In his PersonalKnowledge, Michael Polanyi recounts the way the medicalprofession ignored such palpable facts as the painless amputationof human limbs, performed before their own eyes in hundreds ofsuccessive cases, concluding that the subjects were impostors whowere either deluding their physician or colluding with him. Onephysician, Esdaile, carried out about 300 major operationspainlessly under mesmeric trance in India, but neither in Indianor in Great Britain could he get medical journals to printaccounts of his work. Polanyi attributes this closed-mindednessto "lack of a conceptual framework in which theirdiscoveries could be separated from specious and untenableadmixtures." The "untenable admixture" in the fact thatpsychotomimetic drugs can induce religious experience is theirapparent implicate: that religious disclosures are no moreveridical than psychotic ones. For religious skeptics, thisconclusion is obviously not untenable at all; it fits inbeautifully with their thesis that all religion is atheart an escape from reality. Psychotics avoid reality byretiring into dream worlds of make-believe; what better evidencethat religious visionaries do the same than the fact thatidentical changes in brain chemistry produces both states ofmind? Had not Marx already warned us that religion is the"opiate" of the people? Apparently he was moreliterally accurate than he supposed. Freud was likewise too mild.He "never doubted that religious phenomena are to beunderstood only on the model of the neurotic symptoms of theindividual." (15)He should have said "psychotic symptoms." So the religious skeptic is likely to reason. What about thereligious believer? Convinced that religious experiences are notfundamentally delusory, can he admit that psychotomimetic drugscan occasion them? To do so he needs (to return to Polanyi'swords) "a conceptual framework in which [the discoveriescan] be separated from specious and untenable admixtures,"the latter being in this case the conclusion that religiousexperiences are in general delusory. One way to effect the separation would be to argue thatdespite phenomenological similarities between natural anddrug-induced religious experiences, they are separated by acrucial ontological difference. Such an argument wouldfollow the pattern of theologians who argue for the "realpresence" of Christ's body and blood in the bread and wineof the Eucharist despite their admission that chemical analysis,confined as it is to the level of "accidents" ratherthan "essences," would not disclose this presence. Butthis distinction will not appeal to many today, for it turns onan essence-accident metaphysics which is not widely accepted.Instead of fighting a rear-guard action by insisting that if drugand non-drug religious experiences can't be distinguishedempirically there must be some trans-empirical factor whichdistinguishes them and renders the drug experience profane, Iwish to explore the possibility of accepting drug-inducedexperiences as religious in every sense of the word withoutrelinquishing confidence in the truth claims of religiousexperience generally. To begin with the weakest of all arguments, the argument fromauthority: William James didn't discount his insightswhich occurred while his brain chemistry was altered. Theparagraph in which he retrospectively evaluates his nitrous oxideexperiences has become classic, but it is so pertinent to thepresent discussion that it merits quoting again. One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question—for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back on my own experiences, they all converge toward a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. (16) To this argument from authority, I add two that try toprovide something by way of reasons. Drug experiences that assumea religious cast tend to have fearful and/or beatific features,and each of my hypotheses relates to one of these aspects of theexperience. Beginning with the ominous, "fear of the Lord,"awe-ful features, Gordon Wasson, the New Yorkbanker-turned-mycologist, describes these as he encountered themin his psilocybin experience as follows: "Ecstasy! In commonparlance . . . ecstasy is fun.... But ecstasy is not fun. Yourvery soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. After all, whowill choose to feel undiluted awe . . . ? The unknowing vulgarabuse the word; we must recapture its full and terrifyingsense." Emotionally the drug experience can be like havingforty-foot waves crash over you for several hours while you clingdesperately to a life raft which may be swept from under you atany minute. It seems quite possible that such an ordeal, like anyexperience of a close call, could awaken rather fundamentalsentiments respecting life and death and destiny and trigger the"no atheists in foxholes" effect. Similarly, as thesubject emerges from the trauma and realizes that he is not goingto be insane as he had feared, there may come over him anintensified appreciation like that frequently reported bypatients recovering from critical illness. "It happened onthe day when my bed was pushed out of doors to the open galleryof the hospital," reads one such report. I cannot now recall whether the revelation came suddenly or gradually; I only remember finding myself in the very midst of those wonderful moments, beholding life for the first time in all its young intoxication of loveliness, in its unspeakable joy, beauty, and importance. I cannot say exactly what the mysterious change was. I saw no new thing, but I saw all the usual things in a miraculous new light—in what I believe is their true light. I saw for the first time how wildly beautiful and joyous, beyond any words of mine to describe, is the whole of life. Every human being moving across that porch, every sparrow that flew, every branch tossing in the wind, was caught in and was a part of the whole mad ecstasy of loveliness, of joy, of importance, of intoxication of life. (17) If we do not discount religious intuitions because they areprompted by battlefields and physical crises; if we regardthe latter as "calling us to our senses" more oftenthan they seduce us into delusions, need comparable intuitions bediscounted simply because the crises that trigger them are of aninner, psychic variety? Turning from the hellish to the heavenly aspects of the drugexperience, some of the latter may be explainable by thehypothesis just stated; that is, they may be occasioned by therelief that attends the sense of escape from high danger. Butthis hypothesis cannot possibly account for all thebeatific episodes for the simple reason that the positiveepisodes often come first, or to persons who experience nonegative episodes whatever. Dr. Sanford Unger of the NationalInstitute of Mental Health reports that among his subjects"50 to 60 percent will not manifest any real disturbanceworthy of discussion," yet "around 75" will haveat least one episode in which exaltation, rapture, and joy arethe key descriptions. (18)How are we to account for the drug's capacity to induce peakexperiences, such as the following, which are not precededby fear? A feeling of great peace and contentment seemed to flow through my entire body. All sound ceased and I seemed to be floating in a great, very very still void or hemisphere. It is impossible to describe the overpowering feeling of peace, contentment, and being a part of goodness itself that I felt. I could feel my body dissolving and actually becoming a part of the goodness and peace that was all around me. Words can't describe this. I feel an awe and wonder that such a feeling could have occurred to me. (19) Consider the following line of argument. Like every otherform of life, man's nature has become distinctive throughspecialization. Man has specialized in developing a cerebralcortex. The analytic powers of this instrument are a standingwonder, but it seems less able to provide man with the sense thathe is meaningfully related to his environment, to life, the worldand history in their wholeness. As Albert Camus describes thesituation, "If I were . . . a cat among animals, this lifewould have a meaning, or rather this problem would not arise, forI should belong to this world. I would be this world to which Iam now opposed by my whole consciousness."(20) Note that it is Camus'consciousness that opposes him to his world. The drugs do notknock this consciousness out, but while they leave it operativethey also activate areas of the brain that normally lie below itsthreshold of awareness. One of the clearest objective signs thatthe drugs are taking effect is the dilation they produce in thepupils of the eyes, while one of the most predictable subjectivesigns is the intensification of visual perception. Both of theseresponses are controlled by portions of the brain that lie deep,further to the rear than the mechanisms that governconsciousness. Meanwhile we know that the human organism isinterlaced with its world in innumerable ways it normally cannotsense—through gravitational fields, body respiration, andthe like; the list could be multiplied until man's skin began toseem more like a thoroughfare than a boundary. Perhaps the deeperregions of the brain which evolved earlier and are more likethose of the lower animals— "If I were . . . a cat . .. I should belong to this world"—can sense thisrelatedness better than can the cerebral cortex which nowdominates our awareness. If so, when the drugs rearrange theneurohumors that chemically transmit impulses across synapsesbetween neurons, man's consciousness and his submerged,intuitive, ecological awareness might for a spell becomeinterlaced. This is, of course, no more than a hypothesis, buthow else are we to account for the extraordinary incidence underthe drugs of that kind of insight the keynote of which Jamesdescribed as invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our difficulties and troubles, were melted into one and the same genus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one, is itself the genus, and so soaks up and absorbs its opposites into itself. (21) 4. The Drugs and Religion Viewed "Religiously" Suppose that drugs can induce experiences that areindistinguishable from religious ones, and that we can respecttheir reports. Do they shed any light, not (we now ask) on life,but on the nature of the religious life? One thing they may do is throw religious experience itselfinto perspective by clarifying its relation to the religious lifeas a whole. Drugs appear able to induce religious experiences; itis less evident that they can produce religious lives. It followsthat religion is more than religious experiences. This is hardlynews, but it may be a useful reminder, especially to those whoincline toward "the religion of religious experience,"which is to say toward lives bent on the acquisition of desiredstates of experience irrespective of their relation to life'sother demands and components. Despite the dangers of faculty psychology, it remains usefulto regard man as having a mind, a will, and feelings. One of thelessons of religious history is that to be adequate a faith mustrouse and involve all three components of man's nature. Religionsof reason grow arid; religions of duty, leaden. Religions ofexperience have their comparable pitfalls, as evidenced byTaoism's struggle (not always successful) to keep fromdegenerating into quietism, and the vehemence with which ZenBuddhism has insisted that once students have attained satori,they must be driven out of it, back into the world. The case ofZen is especially pertinent here, for it pivots on anenlightenment experience—satori or kensho—whichsome (but not all) Zennists says resembles LSD. Alike ordifferent, the point is that Zen recognizes that unless theexperience is joined to discipline, it will come to naught. Even the Buddha ... had to sit.... Without joriki, the particular power developed through zazen [seated meditation], the vision of oneness attained in enlightenment . . . in time becomes clouded and eventually fades into a pleasant memory instead of remaining an omnipresent reality shaping our daily life.... To be able to live in accordance with what the Mind's eye has revealed through satori requires, like the purification of character and the development of personality, a ripening period of zazen. (22) If the religion of religious experience is a snare and adelusion, it follows that no religion that fixes its faithprimarily in substances that induce religious experiences can beexpected to come to a good end. What promised to be a shortcutwill prove to be a short circuit; what began as a religion willend as a religion surrogate. Whether chemical substances can behelpful adjuncts to faith is another question. Thepeyote-using Native American Church seems to indicate that theycan be; anthropologists give this church a good report, notingamong other things that members resist alcohol and alcoholismbetter than do non-members. (23) The conclusion to which evidencecurrently points would seem to be that chemicals can aid thereligious life, but only where set within a context of faith(meaning by this the conviction that what they disclose is true)and discipline (meaning diligent exercise of the will in theattempt to work out the implications of the disclosures for theliving of life in the every day, common sense world). Nowhere today in Western civilization are these twoconditions jointly fulfilled. Churches lack faith in the sensejust mentioned, hipsters lack discipline. This might lead us toforget about the drugs, were it not for one fact: the distinctivereligious emotion and the one drugs unquestionably canoccasion—Otto's mysterium tremendum, majestas, mysteriumfascinans; in a phrase, the phenomenon of religiousawe—seems to be declining sharply. As Paul Tillich said inan address to the Hillel Society at Harvard several years ago: The question our century puts before us [is]: Is it possible to regain the lost dimension, the encounter with the Holy, the dimension which cuts through the world of subjectivity and objectivity and goes down to that which is not world but is the mystery of the Ground of Being? Tillich may be right; this may be the religious question ofour century. For if (as we have insisted) religion cannot beequated with religious experience, neither can it long surviveits absence.

PAHNKE from: The International Journal of Parapsychology,Vol. VIII, No. 2, Spring 1966, pp. 295-313. copyright 1966. The claim has been made that the experience facilitated bypsychedelic drugs, such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, can besimilar or identical to the experience described by the mysticsof all ages, cultures, and religions. This paper will attempt toexamine and explain this possibility. There is a long and continuing history of the religious useof plants that contain psychedelic substances. Scholars such asOsmond (1957b), Schultes (1963), and Wasson (1961) have madevaluable contributions to this intriguing field. In someinstances, such natural products were ingested by a priest,shaman, or witch doctor to induce a trance for revelatorypurposes; sometimes they were taken by groups of people whoparticipated in sacred ceremonies. For example, the dried headsof the peyote cactus, whose chief active ingredient is mescaline,were used by the Aztecs at least as early as 300 B.C. and arecurrently being employed by over fifty thousand Indians of theNative American Church as a vital part of their religiousceremonies. Both ololiuqui, a variety of morning-gloryseed, and certain kinds of Mexican mushrooms (called teonanacatl,"flesh of the gods") were also used for divinatory andreligious purposes by the Aztecs. These practices have continuedto the present among remote Indian tribes in the mountains of thestate of Oaxaca, in Mexico. Modern psychopharmacological researchhas shown the active chemicals to be psilocybin in the case ofthe mushrooms, and several compounds closely related to LSD inthe case of ololiuqui. Amanita muscaria, the mushroom thathas been used for unknown centuries by Siberian shamans to inducereligious trances, does not contain psilocybin. The mostimportant psychologically active compound from this mushroom hasnot yet been isolated, but promising work is in progress. Othernaturally occurring plants, which are used by various SouthAmerican Indian tribes in a religious manner for prophecy,divination, clairvoyance, tribal initiation of male adolescents,or sacred feasts are: cohoba snuff, made from the pulverizedseeds of Piptadenia; the drink vinho de Jurumens,made from the seeds of Mimosa hostilis; and the drink caapi,made from Banisteriopsis. These last three productscontain various indolic compounds that are all closely related topsilocybin, both structurally and in their psychic effects(bufotenine, dimethyl-tryptamine, and harmine, respectively).Both LSD and psilocybin contain the indolic ring, and mescalinemay be metabolized to an indole in the body. An Experimental Examination of the Claim that PsychedelicDrug Experience May Resemble Mystical Experience Some of the researchers who have experimented withsynthesized mescaline, LSD, or psilocybin have remarked upon thesimilarity between drug-induced and spontaneous mysticalexperiences because of the frequency with which some of theirsubjects have used mystical and religious language to describetheir experiences. These data interested the author in a carefulexamination and evaluation of such claims. An empirical study,designed to investigate in a systematic and scientific way thesimilarities and differences between experiences described bymystics and those facilitated by psychedelic drugs, wasundertaken (Pahnke, 1966, 1967). First, a phenomenologicaltypology of the mystical state of consciousness was carefullydefined, after a study of the writings of the mystics themselvesand of scholars who have tried to characterize mysticalexperience. [For example, William James (1935) was an invaluablepioneer in this area.] Then, some drug experiences wereempirically studied, not by collecting such experiences whereveran interesting or striking one might have been found and analyzedafter the fact, but by conducting a double-blind, controlledexperiment with subjects whose religious background andexperience, as well as personality, had been measured beforetheir drug experiences. The preparation of the subjects, thesetting under which the drug was administered, and the collectionof data about the experience were made as uniform as possible.The experimenter himself devised the experiment, collected thedata, and evaluated the results without ever having had apersonal experience with any of these drugs. A nine-category typology of the mystical state ofconsciousness was defined as a basis for measurement of thephenomena of the psychedelic drug experiences. Among the numerousstudies of mysticism, the work of W. T. Stace (1960) was found tobe the most helpful guide for the construction of this typology.His conclusion---that in the mystical experience there arecertain fundamental characteristics that are universal and notrestricted to any particular religion or culture (althoughparticular cultural, historical, or religious conditions mayinfluence both the interpretation and description of these basicphenomena)---was taken as a presupposition. Whether or not themystical experience is "religious" depends upon one'sdefinition of religion and was not the problem investigated. Ourtypology defined the universal phenomena of the mysticalexperience, whether considered "religious" or not. The nine categories of our phenomenological typology may besummarized as follows: Category I: Unity Unity, the most important characteristic of the mysticalexperience, is divided into internal and external types, whichare different ways of experiencing an undifferentiated unity. Themajor difference is that the internal type finds unity through an"inner world" within the experiencer while theexternal type finds unity through the external world outside theexperiencer. The essential elements of internal unity are loss ofusual sense impressions and loss of self without becomingunconscious. The multiplicity of usual external and internalsense impressions ( including time and space ), and the empiricalego or usual sense of individuality, fade or melt away whileconsciousness remains. In the most complete experience, thisconsciousness is a pure awareness beyond empirical content, withno external or internal distinctions. In spite of the loss ofsense impressions and dissolution of the usual personal identityor self, the awareness of oneness or unity is still experiencedand remembered. One is not unconscious but is rather very muchaware of an undifferentiated unity. External unity is perceived outwardly with thephysical senses through the external world. A sense of underlyingoneness is felt behind the empirical multiplicity. The subject orobserver feels that the usual separation between himself and anexternal object (inanimate or animate) is no longer present in abasic sense; yet the subject still knows that on another level,at the same time, he and the objects are separate. Another way ofexpressing this same phenomenon is that the essences of objectsare experienced intuitively and felt to be the same at thedeepest level. The subject feels a sense of oneness with theseobjects because he "sees" that at the most basic levelall are a part of the same undifferentiated unity. The capsulestatement ". . . all is One" is a good summary ofexternal unity. In the most complete experience, a cosmicdimension is felt, so that the experiences feels in a deep sensethat he is a part of everything that is. Category II: Transcendence of Time and Space This category refers to loss of the usual sense of time andspace. This means clock time but may also be one's personal senseof his past, present, and future. Transcendence of space meansthat a person loses his usual orientation as to where he isduring the experience in terms of the usual three-dimensionalperception of his environment. Experiences of timelessness andspacelessness may also be described as experiences of"eternity" or "infinity." Category III: Deeply Felt Positive Mood The most universal elements (and, therefore, the ones thatare most essential to the definition of this category) are joy,blessedness, and peace. The unique character of these feelings inrelation to the mystical experience is the intensity thatelevates them to the highest levels of human experience, and theyare highly valued by the experiencers. Tears may be associatedwith any of these elements because of the overpowering nature ofthe experience. Such feelings may occur either at the peak of theexperience or during the "ecstatic afterglow," when thepeak has passed but while its effects and memory are still quitevivid and intense. Love may also be an element of deeply feltpositive mood, but it does not have the same universality as joy,blessedness, and peace. Category IV: Sense of Sacredness This category refers to the sense of sacredness that isevoked by the mystical experience. The sacred is here broadlydefined as that which a person feels to be of special value andcapable of being profaned. The basic characteristic of sacrednessis a non-rational, intuitive, hushed, palpitant response of aweand wonder in the presence of inspiring realities. No religious"beliefs" or traditional theological terminology neednecessarily be involved, even though there may be a sense ofreverence or a feeling that what is experienced is holy ordivine. Category V: Objectivity and Reality This category has two interrelated elements: ( 1 ) insightfulknowledge or illumination felt at an intuitive, non-rationallevel and gained by direct experience; and (2) the authoritativenature of the experience, or the certainty that such knowledge istruly real, in contrast to the feeling that the experience is asubjective delusion. These two elements are connected, becausethe knowledge through experience of ultimate reality (in thesense of being able to "know" and "see" whatis really real) carries its own sense of certainty. Theexperience of "ultimate" reality is an awareness ofanother dimension unlike the "ordinary" reality (thereality of usual, everyday consciousness); yet the knowledge of"ultimate" reality is quite real to the experiencer.Such insightful knowledge does not necessarily mean an increasein facts, but rather in intuitive illumination. What becomes"known" (rather than merely intellectually assented to)is intuitively felt to be authoritative, requires no proof at arational level, and produces an inward feeling of objectivetruth. The content of this knowledge may be divided into two maintypes: (a) insights into being and existence in general, and (b)insights into one's personal, finite self. Category VI: Paradoxicality Accurate descriptions and even rational interpretations ofthe mystical experience tend to be logically contradictory whenstrictly analyzed. For example, in the experience of internalunity there is a loss of all empirical content in an emptyunity which is at the same time full and complete. Thisloss includes the loss of the sense of self and the dissolutionof individuality; yet something of the individual entity remainsto experience the unity. The "I" both exists and doesnot exist. Another example is the separateness from, and at thesame time unity with, objects in the experience of external unity(essentially a paradoxical transcendence of space). Category VII: Alleged Ineffability In spite of attempts to relate or write about the mysticalexperience, mystics insist either that words fail to describe itadequately or that the experience is beyond words. Perhaps thereason is an embarrassment with language because of theparadoxical nature of the essential phenomena. Category VIII: Transiency Transiency refers to duration, and means the temporary natureof the mystical experience in contrast to the relative permanenceof the level of usual experience. There is a transient appearanceof the special and unusual levels or dimensions of consciousnessas defined by our typology, their eventual disappearance, and areturn to the more usual. The characteristic of transiencyindicates that the mystical state of consciousness is notsustained indefinitely. Category IX: Persisting Positive Changes in Attitude andBehavior Because our typology is of a healthful, life-enhancingmysticism, this category describes the positive, lasting effectsof the experience and the resulting changes in attitude. Thesechanges are divided into four groups: (1) toward self, (2) towardothers, (3) toward life, and (4) toward the mystical experienceitself. (1) Increased integration of personality is the basic inwardchange in the personal self. Undesirable traits may be faced insuch a way that they may be dealt with and finally reduced oreliminated. As a result of personal integration, one's sense ofinner authority may be strengthened, and the vigor and dynamicquality of a person's life may be increased. Creativity andgreater efficiency of achievement may be released. An inneroptimistic tone may result, with a consequent increase infeelings of happiness, joy, and peace. (2) Changes in attitudeand behavior toward others include more sensitivity, moretolerance, more real love, and more authenticity as a person byvirtue of being more open and more one's true self with others.(3) Changes toward life in a positive direction includephilosophy of life, sense of values, sense of meaning andpurpose, vocational commitment, need for service to others, andnew appreciation of life and the whole of creation. Life may seemricher. The sense of reverence may be increased, and more timemay be spent in devotional life and meditation. (4) Positivechange in attitude toward the mystical experience itself meansthat it is regarded as valuable and that what has been learned isthought to be useful. The experience is remembered as a highpoint, and an attempt is made to recapture it or, if possible, togain new experiences as a source of growth and strength. Themystical experiences of others are more readily appreciated andunderstood. The purpose of the experiment in which psilocybin wasadministered in a religious context was to gather empirical dataabout the state of consciousness experienced. In a private chapelon Good Friday, twenty Christian theological students, ten ofwhom had been given psilocybin one and one half hours earlier,listened over loudspeakers to a two-and-onehalf-hour religiousservice which was in actual progress in another part of thebuilding and which consisted of organ music, four solos,readings, prayers, and personal meditation. The assumption wasmade that the condition most conducive to a mystical experienceshould be an atmosphere broadly comparable to that achieved bytribes who actually use natural psychedelic substances inreligious ceremonies. The particular content and procedure of theceremony had to be applicable (i.e., familiar and meaningful) tothe participants. Attitude toward the experience, both before andduring, was taken into serious consideration in the experimentaldesign. Preparation was meant to maximize positive expectation,trust, confidence, and reduction of fear. The setting was plannedto utilize this preparation through group support and rapport;through friendship and an open, trusting atmosphere; and throughprior knowledge of the procedure of the experiment in order toeliminate, if possible, feelings of manipulation that mightarise. In the weeks before the experiment, each subject participatedin five hours of various preparation and screening procedures,which included psychological tests, medical history, physicalexamination, questionnaire evaluation of previous religiousexperience, intensive interview, and group interaction. Thetwenty subjects were graduate-student volunteers, all of whomwere from middle-class Protestant backgrounds and from onedenominational seminary in the free-church tradition. None of thesubjects had taken psilocybin or related substances before thisexperiment. The volunteers were divided into five groups of fourstudents each on the basis of compatibility and friendship. Twoleaders, who knew from past experience the positive and negativepossibilities of the psilocybin reaction, met with their groupsto encourage trust, confidence, group support, and fearreduction. The method of reaction to the experience wasemphasized (i.e., to relax and co-operate with, rather than tofight against, the effects of the drug). Throughout thepreparation, an effort was made to avoid suggesting thecharacteristics of the typology of mysticism. The leaders werenot familiar with the typology that had been devised. Double-blind technique was employed in the experiment, sothat neither the experimenter nor any of the participants(leaders or subjects) knew the specific contents of the capsules,which were identical in appearance. Half of the subjects and oneof the leaders in each group received psilocybin (thirtymilligrams for each of the ten experimental subjects and fifteenmilligrams each for five of the leaders). Without prior knowledgeof the drug used, or of its effects, the remaining ten subjectsand the other five leaders each received two hundred milligramsof nicotinic acid, a vitamin that causes transient feelings ofwarmth and tingling of the skin, in order to maximize suggestionfor the control group. Data were collected during the experiment and at varioustimes up to six months afterward. On the experimental day, taperecordings were made both of individual reactions immediatelyafter the religious service and of the group discussions thatfollowed. Each subject wrote an account of his experience as soonafter the experiment as was convenient. Within a week allsubjects had completed a 147-item questionnaire which had beendesigned to measure the various phenomena of the typology ofmysticism on a qualitative, numerical scale. The results of thisquestionnaire were used as a basis for a one-and-one-half-hour,tape-recorded interview which immediately followed. Six monthslater each subject was interviewed again after completion of afollow-up questionnaire in three parts, with a similar scale.Part I was open ended; the participant was asked to list anychanges that he felt were a result of his Good Friday experienceand to rate the degree of benefit or harm of each change. Part II(fifty-two items) was a condensed and somewhat more explicitrepetition of items from the post-drug questionnaire. Part III(ninety-three items) was designed to measure both positive andnegative attitudinal and behavioral changes that had lasted forsix months and were due to the experience. The individualdescriptive accounts and Part I of the follow-up questionnairewere content-analyzed with a qualitative, numerical scale byjudges who were independent of the experiment and who knew onlythat they were to analyze twenty accounts written by persons whohad attended a religious service. Prior to the experiment, the twenty subjects had been matchedin ten pairs on the basis of data from the pre-drugquestionnaires, interviews, and psychological tests. Pastreligious experience, religious background, and generalpsychological make-up were used for the pairings, in that orderof importance. The experiment was designed so that by randomdistribution one subject from each pair received psilocybin andone received the control substance, nicotinic acid. This divisioninto an experimental and a control group was for the purpose ofstatistical evaluation of the scores from each of the threemethods of measurement that used a numerical scale: the post-drugquestionnaire, the follow-up questionnaire, and the contentanalysis of the written accounts. A summary of percentage scores and significance levelsreached by the ten experimentals and ten controls, for eachcategory or subcategory of the typology of mysticism, ispresented in Table I. The score from each of the three methods ofmeasurement was calculated as the percentage of the maximumpossible score if the top of the rating scale for each item hadbeen scored. The percentages from each method of measurement werethen averaged together. A comparison of the scores of theexperimental and control subject in each pair was used tocalculate the significance level of the differences observed bymeans of the non-parametric Sign Test. As can be seen from TableI, for the combined scores from the three methods of measurement,p was less than .020 in all categories except deeply feltpositive mood (love) and persisting positive changes in attitudeand behavior toward the experience, where p was still less than.055. (TABLE I) Although this evidence indicates that the experimentals as agroup achieved to a statistically significant degree a higherscore in each of the nine categories than did the controls, thedegree of completeness or intensity must be examined. In terms of our typology of mysticism, ideally the most"complete" mystical experience should have demonstratedthe phenomena of all the categories in a maximal way. Theevidence (particularly from the content analysis and alsosupported by impressions from the interviews) showed that suchperfect completeness in all categories was not experienced by allthe subjects in the experimental group. In the data, the variouscategories and subcategories can be divided into three groups inregard to the degree of intensity or completeness, as shown inTable II. Criteria were the percentage levels and the consistencyamong different methods of measurement. The closest approximationto a complete and intense degree of experience was found for thecategories of internal unity, transcendence of time and space,transiency, paradoxicality, and persisting positive changes inattitude and behavior toward self and life. The evidenceindicated that the second group had almost, but not quite, thesame degree of completeness or intensity as the first group. Thesecond group consisted of external unity, objectivity andreality, joy, and alleged ineffability. There was a relativelygreater lack of completeness for sense of sacredness, love, andpersisting positive changes in attitude and behavior towardothers and toward the experience. Each of these last eightcategories and sub-categories was termed incomplete to a greateror lesser degree for the experimentals, but was definitelypresent to some extent when compared with the controls. Whenanalyzed most rigorously and measured against all possiblecategories of the typology of mysticism, the experience of theexperimental subjects was considered incomplete in this strictestsense. Usually such incompleteness was demonstrated by results ofthe content analyses. (TABLE II) The control subjects did not experience many phenomena of themystical typology, and even then only to a low degree ofcompleteness. The phenomena for which the scores of the controlswere closest to (although still always less than) theexperimentals were: blessedness and peace, sense of sacredness,love, and persisting positive changes in attitude and behaviortoward others and toward the experience. The design of the experiment suggested an explanation for thefact that the control subjects should have experienced anyphenomena at all. The meaningful religious setting of theexperiment would have been expected to encourage a response ofblessedness, peace, and sacredness. In the case of love andpersisting changes toward others and toward the experience,observation by the controls of the profound experience of theexperimentals and interaction between the two groups on aninterpersonal level appeared, from both post-experimentalinterviews, to have been the main basis for the controls'experience of these phenomena. The experience of the experimental subjects was certainlymore like mystical experience than that of the controls, who hadthe same expectation and suggestion from the preparation andsetting. The most striking difference between the experimentalsand the controls was the ingestion of thirty milligrams ofpsilocybin, which it was concluded was the facilitating agentresponsible for the difference in phenomena experienced. After an admittedly short follow-up period of only sixmonths, life-enhancing and enriching effects similar to some ofthose claimed by mystics were shown by the higher scores of theexperimental subjects when compared to the controls. In addition,after four hours of follow-up interviews with each subject, theexperimenter was left with the impression that the experience hadmade a profound impact (especially in terms of religious feelingand thinking) on the lives of eight out of ten of the subjectswho had been given psilocybin. Although the psilocybin experiencewas unique and different from the "ordinary" reality oftheir everyday lives, these subjects felt that this experiencehad motivated them to appreciate more deeply the meaning of theirlives, to gain more depth and authenticity in ordinary living,and to rethink their philosophies of life and values. The datadid not suggest that any "ultimate" reality encounteredhad made "ordinary" reality no longer important ormeaningful. The fact that the experience took place in thecontext of a religious service, with the use of symbols that werefamiliar and meaningful to the participants, appeared to providea useful framework within which to derive meaning and integrationfrom the experience, both at the time and later. The relationship and relative importance of psychologicalpreparation, setting, and drug were important questions raised byour results. A meaningful religious preparation, expectation, andenvironment appeared to be conducive to positive drugexperiences, although the precise qualitative and quantitativerole of each factor was not determined. For example, everythingpossible was done to maximize suggestion, but suggestion alonecannot account for the results, because of the differentexperience of the control group. The hypothesis thatsuggestibility was heightened by psilocybin could not be ruledout on the basis of our experiment. An effort was made to avoidsuggesting the phenomena of the typology of mysticism, and theservice itself made no such direct suggestion. Implications for the Psychology of Religion The results of our experiment would indicate that psilocybin(and LSD and mescaline, by analogy) are important tools for thestudy of the mystical state of consciousness. Experiencespreviously possible for only a small minority of people, anddifficult to study because of their unpredictability and rarity,are now reproducible under suitable conditions. The mysticalexperience has been called by many names suggestive of areas thatare paranormal and not usually considered easily available forinvestigation (e.g., an experience of transcendence, ecstasy,conversion, or cosmic consciousness); but this is a realm ofhuman experience that should not be rejected as outside the realmof serious scientific study, especially if it can be shown that apractical benefit can result. Our data would suggest that such anoverwhelming experience, in which a person existentiallyencounters basic values such as the meaning of his life (past,present, and future), deep and meaningful interpersonalrelationships, and insight into the possibility of personalbehavior change, can possibly be therapeutic if approached andworked with in a sensitive and adequate way. Possibilities for further research with these drugs in thepsychology of religion can be divided into two different kinds inrelation to the aim: (1) theoretical understanding of thephenomena and psychology of mysticism, and (2) experimentalinvestigation of possible social application in a religiouscontext. The first, or theoretical, kind of research would be toapproach the mystical state of consciousness as closely aspossible under controlled experimental conditions and to measurethe effect of variables such as the dose of the drug, thepreparation and personality of the subject, the setting of theexperiment, and the expectation of the experimenter. The workdescribed above was a first step in the measurement of thesevariables, but more research is needed. The results should beproved to be reproducible by the same and by differentexperimenters under similar conditions. Such work could lead to abetter understanding of mysticism from physiological,biochemical, psychological, and therapeutic perspectives. Several experimental approaches can be envisioned for thesecond kind of research---to determine the best method for usefulapplication in a religious context. One suggestion would be theestablishment of a research center where carefully controlleddrug experiments could be done by a trained research staff whichwould consist of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, andprofessional religious personnel. Subjects, ideally, would spendat least a week at the center to facilitate thorough screening,preparation, and observation of their reactions, both during andafter drug experiments. Another suggestion would be the study ofthe effect of mystical experience on small natural groups of fromfour to six people who would meet periodically, both prior to andafter a drug experience, for serious personal and religiousdiscussion, study, and worship. The reactions of a varied rangeof subjects with different interests could be studied, butperhaps a good place to start would be with personsprofessionally interested in religion, such as ministers,priests, rabbis, theologians, and psychologists of religion. Such research may have important implications for religion.The universal and basic human experience that we have calledmystical is recorded from all cultures and ages of human history,but mysticism has never been adequately studied and understoodfrom physiological, biochemical, sociological, psychological, andtheological perspectives. Perhaps there is more of a biochemical basis to such"natural" experiences than has been previouslysupposed. Certainly many ascetics who have had mysticalexperiences have engaged in such practices as breathing andpostural exercises, sleep deprivation, fasting, flagellation withsubsequent infection, sustained meditation, and sensorydeprivation in caves or monastic cells. All these techniques havean effect on body chemistry. There is a definite interplaybetween physiological and psychological processes in the humanbeing. Some of the indolic substances in the body do not differgreatly from the psychedelic drugs. Many persons concerned with religion are disturbed bydrug-facilitated mystical experiences because of their apparentease of production, with the implication that they are"unearned" and therefore "undeserved."Perhaps the Puritan and Calvinistic element of our Westernculture---especially in the United States, where most of thecontroversy about psychedelic drugs has centered---may be afactor in this uneasiness. Although a drug experience might seemunearned when compared with the rigorous discipline that manymystics describe as necessary, our evidence has suggested thatcareful preparation and expectation play an important part, notonly in the type of experience attained but in later fruits forlife. Positive mystical experience with psychedelic drugs is byno means automatic. It would seem that the "drugeffect" is a delicate combination of psychological set andsetting in which the drug itself is the trigger or facilitatingagent---i.e., in which the drug is a necessary but not sufficientcondition. Perhaps the hardest "work" comes after theexperience, which in itself may only provide the motivation forfuture efforts to integrate and appreciate what has been learned.Unless such an experience is integrated into the ongoing life ofthe individual, only a memory remains rather than the growth ofan unfolding renewal process which may be awakened by themystical experience. If the person has a religious framework anddiscipline within which to work, the integrative process isencouraged and stimulated. Many persons may not need thedrug-facilitated mystical experience, but there are others whowould never be aware of the undeveloped potentials withinthemselves, or be inspired to work in this direction, withoutsuch an experience. "Gratuitous grace" is anappropriate theological term, because the psychedelic mysticalexperience can lead to a profound sense of inspiration,reverential awe, and humility, perhaps partially as a result ofthe realization that the experience is a gift and notparticularly earned or deserved. Mysticism and inner experience have been stressed much moreby Eastern religions than by Western. Perhaps Western culture isas far off balance in the opposite direction---with itsmanipulation of the external world, as exemplified by theemphasis on material wealth, control of nature, and admiration ofscience. Mysticism has been accused of fostering escapism fromthe problems of society, indifference to social conditions, anddisinterest in social change. While the possibility of suchexcesses must always be remembered, our study has suggested thebeneficial potential of mystical experience in stimulating theability to feel and experience deeply and genuinely with the fullharmony of both emotion and intellect. Such wholeness may havebeen neglected in modern Western society. The participants in our experiment who were given psilocybinfound the religious service more meaningful, both at the time andlater, than did the control subjects. This finding raises thepossibility that psychedelic drug experiences in a religioussetting may be able to illuminate the dynamics and significanceof worship. Increased understanding of the psychologicalmechanism involved might lead to more-meaningful worshipexperiences for those who have not had the drug experience. Theanalogy with the efficacy of the sacraments is one example ofwhat would have to be considered for a better psychologicalunderstanding of what goes on during worship. Such considerationsraise the question of the place of the emotional factor, comparedto the cognitive, in religious worship. An even more basicquestion is the validity of religious experience of the mysticaltype in terms of religious truth. Reactions to such religiousimplications will vary with theological position andpresuppositions, but one value of our study can be to stimulatethoughtful examination of the problems. Although our experimental results indicated predominantlypositive and beneficial subjective effects, possible dangers mustnot be underestimated and should be thoroughly evaluated byspecific research designed to discover the causes and methods ofprevention of physical or psychological harm, both short-term andlong-term. While physiological addiction has not been reportedwith psychedelic substances, psychological dependence might beexpected if the experience were continually repeated. The intensesubjective pleasure and enjoyment of the experience for its ownsake could lead to escapism and withdrawal from the world. Anexperience which is capable of changing motivation and valuesmight cut the nerve of achievement. Widespread apathy towardproductive work and accomplishment could cripple a society.Another possible danger might be suicide or prolonged psychosisin very unstable or depressed individuals who are not ready forthe intense emotional discharge. If it can be determined that anyof these forms of harm occur in certain types of individuals,research could be directed toward the development of pretestmethods to screen out such persons. Our evidence would suggestthat research on conditions and methods of administration of thedrugs might minimize the chance of harmful reactions. Spectacularimmediate advance must be sacrificed for ultimate progress bycareful, yet daring and imaginative, research under adequatemedical supervision. The ethical implications also cannot be ignored. Any researchthat uses human volunteers must examine its motives and methodsto make certain that human beings are not being manipulated likeobjects for purposes they do not understand or share. But inresearch with powerful mental chemicals that may influence themost cherished human functions and values, the ethical problem iseven more acute. The mystical experience, historically, hasfilled man with wondrous awe and has been able to change hisstyle of life and values; but it must not be assumed that greatercontrol of such powerful phenomena will automatically result inwise and constructive use. Potential abuse is just as likely.Those who undertake such research carry a heavy responsibility. This is not to say that research should be stopped because ofthe fear of these various risks in an extremely complex andchallenging area that has great promise for the psychology ofreligion. But while research is progressing on the theoretical orprimary level and before projects for testing useful socialapplications in a religious context become widespread, seriousand thoughtful examination of the sociological, ethical, andtheological implications is needed without delay. Not the least of these implications is the fear that researchthat probes the psyche of man and involves his spiritual valuesmay be a sacrilegious transgression by science. If theexploration of certain phenomena should be prohibited, should themystical experiences made possible by psychedelic drugs be one ofthe taboo areas? Such restrictions raise several relevantquestions: Who is wise enough to decide in advance that suchresearch will cause more harm than good? If such restrictions areapplied, where will they end, and will they not impede knowledgeof unforeseen possibilities? This attitude on the part ofreligion is not new. Galileo and Servetus encountered it hundredsof years ago. The issue should not be whether or not to undertakesuch research, but rather how to do so in a way that sensitivelytakes into consideration the contribution, significance, andvalues of religion. A better scientific understanding of themechanisms and application of mysticism has the potential for agreater appreciation and respect for heretofore rarely exploredareas of human consciousness. If these areas have relevance forman's spiritual life, this should be a cause for rejoicing, notalarm. If the values nurtured by religion are fundamental for anunderstanding of the nature of man, then careful and sensitivescientific research into the experiential side of man's existencehas the potential for illumination of these values. Theimportance of such research should be emphasized, especiallybecause of its possible significance for religion and theology. At present we are a long way from legitimate social use ofsuch drugs in our society. We do not yet have nearly enoughadequate knowledge of the long- term physiological orpsychological effects. It is true that thus far no organ ortissue damage has been reported in the usual dosage range, andphysiological addiction has not occurred. But as in the case ofany new drug, deleterious side effects sometimes do not becomeapparent until years after a drug has been introduced. The socialsuffering caused by the misuse of alcohol is a major publichealth problem throughout the Western world. We certainly need tohesitate before introducing a new agent, much more powerful thanalcohol and perhaps with a potential for the development ofsubtle psychological dependence. And yet, paradoxically, thesevery drugs may hold a promise for the treatment of chronicalcoholism by way of the psychedelic mystical experience(Kurland, Unger, and Shaffer, 1957; Unger et. al., 1966; Unger,1965). Such questions can be satisfactorily answered only bythorough scientific research of the possibilities and by soberevaluation of the results. Many unknown conscious and unconscious factors operate in themystical experience. Much investigation is needed in this area,and drugs like psilocybin can be a powerful tool. Experimentalfacilitation of mystical experiences under controlled conditionscan be an important method of approach to a better understandingof mysticism. Better understanding can lead to appreciation ofthe role and place of such experiences in the history andpractice of religion. If parapsychology is concerned in an interdisciplinary waywith the question of the potentials of human experience, then thecontrolled exploration of experimental mysticism, facilitated bypsychedelic drugs, is an important parapsychological researcharea, where psychopharmacology, psychiatry, psychology, andtheology can meet to mutual advantage.

PAHNKE A paper presented to a public symposium at Wesleyan University, March 1967. From LSD, Man & Society Richard C. DeBold and Russell C. Leaf, editors ©Wesleyan University Press, Middletown, Connecticut, 1967 See also the Discussion which followed the presentation of Dr. Pahnke's paper. THE relationship between LSD and religious experience is an issuethat is quite complex and needs careful analysis to avoid a looseand uncritical association. It would be misleading to assume thatthe experiences are automatically identical. LSD-type drugs have been called by many names. In the early 1950'sthe term psychotomimetic, i.e., psychosis-mimicking,was generally used; but this rather negatively loaded term wasseen by some as being too narrow and limiting to accommodate thewide range of experiences being reported and observed. In 1957Dr. Humphry Osmond (Osmond, 1957) proposed the term psychedelic,i.e., mind-opening or mind-manifesting, to encompass the fullrange of positive and negative experiences that he had seen inhis work with such drugs. Psychedelic will be the term used inthis paper to refer to the unique class of LSD-type drugs. In this discussion a survey will first be made of the variouskinds of psychedelic experiences with an especial examinationof the mystical type, and possible reasons for this variety willbe mentioned. Then we shall look at some of the evidence thatpsychedelic mystical experiences occur at all and discuss whetheror not they can be considered "religious." The LSD churchesthat have grown out of the evangelistic enthusiasm associatedwith LSD will also be examined along with their possible impacton individuals and society. Finally, the future prospects forthe investigation and use of psychedelic drugs will be discussed. Psychedelic experiences can be divided into five types: psychotic,psychodynamic, cognitive, aesthetic and psychedelic peak or mystical.These have been described elsewhere (Pahnke and Richards, 1966),and a brief description of each will suffice. The psychotic experience is described as very intense,negative, dysphoric and hellish by those who have been throughit. Characteristic elements include fear to the point of panic,paranoid distrust, delusions of suspicion or grandeur, toxic confusion,impairment of abstract reasoning, remorse, depression, isolationand/ or somatic discomfort, all of which can be of monumentalproportions. These words can perhaps be better illuminated bythe following description written by a well-prepared subject whotook LSD under medical supervision: Time itself seemed to have frozen. I was sick way down inside.I had lost trust in the doctor and the judgment of part of myown mind. The terrible thing was that I was going insane and thenormal part of my mind knew this was taking place. I was two peoplein the same body. The one with the insane mind was pulling theone with the sane mind over on his side. I think I was 95% insane. Then things became even more confused and frightening. It seemedas if I had three minds, two that were insane and one perfectlynormal. In other words, I was having the experience of havinga front row seat watching myself who was insane. Faces now looked distorted, eyes were of a cruel expression, andthey seemed to have the power of looking through me and my verythoughts. The least amount of noise sounded one hundred timeslouder. Everything I heard was driving me into a living hell.The doctor looked like the devil to me. He had tricked me. I didn't think either of us was sane now. As a matter of fact,I thought everyone was inhuman, and I would go through life inthis situation and this would go on forever. There never evenexisted something as wonderful as death that could get me—bodyand mind—out of this horrible, unnatural life (Unger, 1964). This account illustrates especially well the feeling of many peopleat some time during an LSD session that something has gone wrongand that they never will be the same again. Such feelings onlyincrease the panic and hopelessness. Adequate preparation andskilled handling, however, do make a crucial difference in theoutcome of most cases. In this particular instance, the patientwas guided through an extremely frightening and unpleasant partof his experience to a very positive and helpful climax. Unfortunately,such a happy ending is quite uncertain in uncontrolled settings. The second type of experience is the psychodynamic, inwhich material that had previously been unconscious or preconsciousbecomes vividly conscious. We see abreaction and catharsis inthe reliving of traumatic incidents from the past or in the experiencingof symbolic material. The use of LSD in Europe employs what hasbeen termed the psycholytic method, which emphasizes the uncoveringof psychodynamic material. Suggestion certainly plays a role,because the patients of Freudian therapists produce incidentsfrom the stages of psychosexual development, whereas archetypalsymbols are often encountered by patients of Jungian therapists.Essential to this method, however, is the support and guidanceof a skilled therapist, both while the patient is having the experienceand while he is between drug sessions. A detailed descriptionof the psycholytic method has now been published in the paperspresented at an international LSD conference in 1965 (Abramson,1967). The third type of experience, the cognitive, is characterizedby astonishingly lucid thought. The mind seems subjectively tobe able to view things from a new perspective and to see the interrelationshipsof many levels or dimensions all at once. Such experiences usuallyoccur when the drug effects are waning. The very existence ofsuch states of mind led people to speculate that creativity researchmight be aided with psychedelic drugs. Harman and his co-workers(Harman, McKim, Mogar, Fadiman and Stolaroff, 1966) have alreadypublished a pilot study in which twenty-seven professionally employedmales underwent a single moderate-dose psychedelic session ina small group setting. Each subject had a particular problem onwhich he could not obtain closure and hoped to gain some new perspectivethrough the psychedelic experience. The setting was structuredso that expectation was maximized, and the sessions were run witha minimum of interruption. The results in terms of problems actuallysolved were promising (9 out of 44 attempted problems yieldedpractical solutions), but not conclusive because of the lack ofa control group. Certainly this is an area that merits furtherinvestigation. The fourth type of experience is the aesthetic. Perhapsthe reported increase in all sensory modalities is what attractssome people to take LSD for "kicks." These reports donot exaggerate. Fascinating changes in sensation and perceptiondo occur: synaesthesia in which sounds can be "seen;"objects such as flowers or stones that appear to pulsate and become"alive;" ordinary things that seem imbued with greatbeauty; music that takes on an incredible emotional power; andvisions of beautiful colors, intricate geometrical patterns, architecturalforms, landscapes or almost anything imaginable. The fifth type of experience is the focus of interest in thispresentation and has been called by various names: psychedelicpeak, transcendental or mystical. For the sake of this discussionwe shall refer to it as the psychedelic mystical or experimentalmystical experience. Its psychological characteristics have beendescribed elsewhere (Pahnke, in unpublished thesis) and will beonly briefly summarized here. These characteristics, nine in number, were derived from a studyof the literature of spontaneous mystical experiences reportedthroughout world history from almost all cultures and religions.In studying accounts of these strange, unusual experiences, anattempt was made to extract the universal psychological characteristicsas free from interpretation as possible. Scientific evidence indicatesthat these universal characteristics derived from spontaneousmystical experiences also precisely describe experimental psychedelicones. The nine characteristics can be listed as follows: 1. Unity is a sense of cosmic oneness achieved throughpositive ego-transcendence. Although the usual sense of identityor ego fades away, consciousness and memory are not lost; instead,the person becomes very much aware of being part of a dimensionmuch vaster and greater than himself. In addition to the routeof the "inner world" where all external sense impressionsare left behind, unity can also be experienced through the externalworld, so that a person reports that he feels a part of everythingthat is (e.g., objects, other people, nature or the universe),or, more simply, that "all is one." 2. Transcendence of time and space means that thesubject feels beyond past, present and future and beyond ordinarythree-dimensional space in a realm of eternity or infinity. 3. Deeply felt positive mood contains the elements of joy,blessedness, peace and love to an overwhelming degree of intensity,often accompanied by tears. 4. Sense of sacredness is a non-rational, intuitive, hushed,palpitant response of awe and wonder in the presence of inspiringrealities. The main elements are awe, humility and reverence,but the terms of traditional theology or religion need not necessarilybe used in the description. 5. The noetic quality, as named by William James, is afeeling of insight or illumination that is felt on an intuitive,non-rational level and has a tremendous force of certainty andreality. This knowledge is not an increase in facts, but is again of insight about such things as philosophy of life or senseof values. 6. Paradoxicality refers to the logical contradictionsthat become apparent if descriptions are strictly analyzed. Aperson may realize that he is experiencing, for example, an "identityof opposites," yet it seems to make sense at the time, andeven afterwards. 7. Alleged ineffability means that the experience is feltto be beyond words, non-verbal, impossible to describe, yet mostpersons who insist on the ineffability do in fact make elaborateattempts to communicate the experience. 8. Transiency means that the psychedelic peak does notlast in its full intensity, but instead passes into an afterglowand remains as a memory. 9. Persisting positive changes in attitudes and behaviorare toward self, others, life and the experience itself. The reasons for the great variety of psychedelic experiences (characterizedhere under five headings) have provided a fascinating researchproblem and are now generally recognized to be caused by dosageand the extra-drug variables of set and setting. Of course, mostsessions do not contain just one kind of experience. In fact itis not uncommon for all five types to be present in a single psychedelicexperience, though in varying proportions. Dosage appears to be a crucial variable. Each individual has hisown range of tolerance and response to any drug, and no absolutefigures can be quoted. In the low dose range, for most people,below 200 mcg of LSD, the probability is great for the emergenceof aesthetic, cognitive and psychodynamic experience. At somewherebetween 200 mcg and 400 mcg of LSD, there appears to be a criticallevel beyond which psychedelic mystical experience becomes possible,which can be compared to the minimal amount of thrust needed fora rocket to launch itself into orbit. Psychotic experiences arepossible at any dosage level, but are much more probable at thehigher doses. The presence of the drug at a certain dosage is a necessary butnot sufficient condition, because the extra-drug variables ofset and setting play a crucial role in determining the kind ofdrug response. Psychological set is here defined as factors withinthe subject, such as personality, life history, expectation, preparation,mood prior to the session and, perhaps most important of all,the ability to trust, to let go, to be open to whatever comes.The setting is here defined as factors outside the individual,such as the physical environment in which the drug is taken, thepsychological and emotional atmosphere to which the subject isexposed, how he is treated by those around him and what the experimenterexpects the drug reaction to be. A person who has taken a psychedelicdrug seems to be much more sensitive to non-verbal cues, perhapsbecause of an increase in suggestibility, but the exact role ofsuggestibility is a problem that needs to be further investigated. It seems clear that the drug is only a trigger, a catalyst orfacilitating agent. The kind of psychedelic reaction is largelydependent upon extra-drug variables. Also, at the present stateof knowledge, the exact content is impossible to predict withcertainty. Psychotic reactions are the easiest to produce; mysticalexperiences are the hardest, certainly not automatic, even underoptimal conditions. Much more needs to be learned. We turn now to an examination of the evidence that psychedelicmystical experiences actually occur. Most researchers who haveworked with LSD in either a therapeutic or a supportive settinghave reported the occurrence of mystical experiences in varyingdegrees of frequency. Some workers, especially most of the Europeanpsycholytic therapists, have not been very much interested insuch experiences and, in fact, have tried to discourage theiroccurrence as an unwanted distraction. The frequency with thatkind of set and setting is much less, but, even so, these experiencesare still reported. As time has gone on, some of the Europeanpsychiatrists who have heard about the work done in Canada andthe United States have become more interested (Arendsen-Hein,1967; Johnsen, 1967). Dr. Arnold Ludwig, of the Mendota State Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin,has purposely programmed his LSD sessions to focus on psychodynamicissues and has definitely not encouraged mystical experiences,as he has informed me personally. Interestingly enough, this kindof experience has occurred anyway in some patients, who then oftensought out the hospital chaplain for discussions of religiousissues. Houston and Masters (Masters and Houston, 1966) report a seriesof 206 subjects with whom they have worked, but of whom littlemore than 3% were considered to have had true mystical experiences.Such figures need to be interpreted cautiously unless a carefuldefinition with some kind of method for quantifying the experienceis established. A questionnaire has been developed that is based on the nine characteristicsof spontaneous mystical experiences outlined above (Pahnke, inunpublished thesis). For any subject the percentage of the maximumpossible score for each category can be determined. Varying degreesof completeness are possible, but to be counted as a mysticalexperience it was decided that both the total score and the scorein each separate category must be at least 60% to 70%. This questionnairehas been used in two studies that I have conducted. The first was carried out on Good Friday in 1962 to test the hypothesisthat persons who were given psilocybin would have experiencessimilar to those reported by spontaneous mystics. Twenty theologicalstudents from relatively similar religious and socio-economicbackgrounds, after medical and psychiatric screening, were carefullyprepared in groups of four with two leaders for each group. Allthirty participants listened over loud-speakers to a meditativeGood Friday service in a private basement chapel while the actualservice was in progress in the church above. The experiment wasso designed that half of the subjects received 30 mg of psilocybinand the rest, who became the control group, got as an active placebo200 mg of nicotinic acid, which causes no psychic effects, onlywarmth and tingling of the skin. From our preparation all thesubjects knew that psilocybin caused autonomic changes. Thosewho got nicotinic acid thought that they had received psilocybin,and suggestion was thus maximized for the control group. The drugswere administered double-blind, so that neither the experimenternor the participants knew the specific contents of any capsule.Data were collected by tape recording, written account, the mystical-experiencequestionnaire and personal interview. When all the data were analyzed,the scores of psilocybin subjects were higher to a statisticallysignificant degree in all categories than those of the controlsubjects. In regard to degree of completeness, only three or fourof the ten psilocybin subjects reached the 60% to 70% level ofcompleteness, whereas none of the control subjects did. The second series of experiments was performed at the MassachusettsMental Health Center during 1965 and 1966, an account of whichis now being prepared. Forty carefully screened normal volunteerswere selected. Most of the subjects were over thirty and heldresponsible positions in the community as professional people.The sensational publicity about LSD in the popular press addeddifficulties to our recruitment. We rejected more than 50% ofour volunteers on the basis of medical and psychiatric history,physical examination, psychological testing and psychiatric interview.After three hours of preparation, psilocybin was administeredto four subjects at a time in a carefully prepared room with cutflowers, pictures of nature scenes, candlelight and a place foreach subject to recline and relax. Silence was maintained duringa six-hour program of classical music. The setting was supportive,and there were no interruptions for testing during the session.We encouraged the subjects to relax and to let the music carrythem. At the present time, the data are not completely analyzed,and all that can be reported are some preliminary impressions.First, the procedure seemed safe for carefully screened normals.No one suffered physical or psychological harm even after a oneyear follow-up. Second, 20% to 40% of the subjects had a mysticalexperience, depending on the level of completeness desired. Third,95% of the subjects said that they would be willing to take thedrug again, perhaps sometime in the future, but not too many wereeager to do so right away. Having had such powerful experiences,they expressed a desire for time to integrate what had been learned. In comparison to the 3% of mystical experiences reported by Houstonand Masters, and the 20% to 40% in our two studies, some 75% ofover 100 patients from the alcoholism project at the Spring GroveState Hospital in Baltimore have had intense mystical experiencesduring their first session with LSD. It should be remembered thatof these patients each had between twelve and twenty hours ofindividual therapy before his session, which was run individually.In our sessions we had only three hours of preparations, and thesessions were run in groups of four. Individual monitoring seemsto help guide someone toward a positive experience. At SpringGrove everything is done to ensure optimal conditions (Kurland,Unger, Shaffer and Savage, 1967). An important consideration iswhether or not such mystical experiences are religious. A simpleidentification of religious experience with mystical experiencefails to take into account the many definitions of religion. Religionsvary in their emphasis upon mysticism, although there is a tendencyto make the mystical element the most important characteristicof religion, especially among psychologists of religion who havebeen interested in the dramatic phenomena of the mystical experience.William James reflected this attitude by his preference for religionthat is an "acute fever" rather than a "dull habit."Not all religious experience is necessarily mystical in the senseof our definition of mystical experience given below. Pratt, forexample, divides religion into four kinds or aspects, of whichthe mystical is only one, the other three being the traditional,the rational and the practical or moral (Pratt, 1921). Even whenquite emotionally meaningful, participation in a particular religionby observing religious laws, through intellectual belief in acertain creed or theology or in institutional membership and attendanceat rites and rituals may not result in or be the product of mysticalexperience. On the other hand, all mystical experience is not necessarilyreligious. Again much depends upon how one chooses to define religion.If one makes the concept of a "personal God" centralto the definition of religion, many forms of mystical experiencecould not be considered religious. The phenomena of mystical experiencemay occur outside the framework of any formal religion with noreference to an articulated theology. The problem is by-passed or merely indicated, rather than solved,by broadening the definition of religion to include any experiencethat would qualify as mystical by our criteria. Tillich, for example,considers an experience religious when it gives ultimate meaning,structure and direction to human experience, or when one is concerned"ultimately" (Tillich, 1951). Better, perhaps, is HustonSmith's definition in an unpublished address. He has defined asa religious experience one that elicits from the experiencer acentered response from the core of his being. Since his beingincludes feelings, thoughts and will, a religious experience triggersin the experiencer a triple movement—a movement of the emotionsin awe, of the mind in belief and of the will in obedience. Herewe return to the important ninth characteristic of mystical experience.What changes are there in the person's life? What does he do aboutit in terms of some religious discipline? If we accept Smith'sdefinition of religious experience and compare it with the ninecharacteristics, we can perhaps say that such a psychologicaldefinition of mystical experience has at least something religiousabout it. Whether or not mystical experience is religious dependsupon one's definition of religion. Rather than labor the point, the following examples of actualexperimental mystical experiences may help the reader to decidewhether such experiences would fit his personal definition ofreligion. The first is the experience of a Christian ministerialstudent who took a compound from the psilocybin series in a carefullycontrolled experiment that was conducted in a German researchinstitute under the supervision of an experimenter who was notparticularly interested in mystical experiences. I hesitate to attempt a summary of my drug experience as I amacutely aware of the inability of linguistic symbols to contain,or even accurately reflect, the dynamics of 'mystic' consciousness.In the words of the Russian poet Tyutchev, I feel as though 'Athought that's spoken is a lie'. To seek to condense any of myexperiences into words is to distort them, rendering them finiteand impure. In so acknowledging the profound ineffability of myexperience, I am not trying to write poetry— although in thefinal analysis this may well be the only possible means of verbalexpression—but intend only to convey the feelings of frustrationand futility with which I begin this report. Now, four days after the experience itself, I continue to feela deep sense of awe and reverence, being simultaneously intoxicatedwith an ecstatic joy. This euphoric feeling . . . includes elementsof profound peace and steadfastness, surging like a spring froma depth of my being which has rarely, if ever, been tapped priorto the drug experience. The spasmodic nature of my prayer lifehas ceased, and I have yielded to a need to spend time each dayin meditation which, though essentially open and wordless, isimpregnated by feelings of thanksgiving and trust. This increasedneed to be alone is balanced by what I believe to be a greatersensitivity to the authentic problems of others and a correspondingwillingness to enter freely into genuine friendships. I possessa renewed and increased sense of personal integration and am morecontent simply to 'be myself' than previously. . . . Relatively soon after receiving the drug, I transcendedmy usual level of consciousness and became aware of fantasticdimensions of being, all of which possessed a profound sense ofreality. . . . It would seem more accurate to say that I existed 'in' thesedimensions of being as I had not only transcended my ego, butalso the dichotomy between subject and object. It is meaningful to say that I ceased to exist, becoming immersedin the ground of Being, in Brahman, in God, in 'Nothingness,'in Ultimate Reality or in some similar religious symbol for Oneness.... The feelings I experienced could best be described as cosmic tenderness,infinite love, penetrating peace, eternal blessing and unconditionalacceptance on one hand, and on the other, as unspeakable awe,overflowing joy, primeval humility, inexpressible gratitude andboundless devotion. Yet all of these words are hopelessly inadequateand can do little more than meekly point towards the genuine,inexpressible feelings actually experienced. It is misleading even to use the words 'I experienced,' sinceduring the peak of the experience (which must have lasted at leastan hour) there was no duality between myself and what I experienced.Rather, I was these feelings, or ceased to be in them and feltno loss at the cessation. This was especially evident when, afterhaving reached the mystic peak, a recording of Bach's 'Fantasiaand Fugue in G Minor' was played. At this time it seemed as thoughI was not M. R. listening to a recording, but paradoxically wasthe music itself. Especially at one climax in the Fantasia, the'love' I was experiencing became so overwhelming as to becomeunbearable or even painful. The tears I shed at this moment werein no sense those of fear, but ones of uncontainable joy. . . . During the height of the experience, I had no consciousnessof time or space in the ordinary sense. I felt as though I wasbeyond seconds, minutes, hours, and also beyond past, present,and future. In religious language, I was in 'eternity . . . Let me affirm that even with my acquaintance with mysticliterature of both east and west, coupled with the profound appreciationof natural and artistic beauty I have always enjoyed, I know Icould never have understood this experience, had I not lived itmyself. The dimensions of being I entered surpassed the wildestfantasies of my imagination and, as I have said, leave me witha profound sense of awe.... In no sense have I an urge to formulatephilosophical or theological dogmas about my experience. Onlymy silence can retain its purity and genuineness. It may be objected that a divinity student would obviously havesuch an experience because of his familiarity with mysticism andreligious language. In the Good Friday experiment, however, thecontrol subjects with the same amount of suggestion did not havemystical experiences. Also the next several examples were writtenby chronic, hospitalized alcoholics who had received LSD treatmentand who did not have the same interest in religion and mysticism.The accounts are perhaps even more vivid in their simple straightforwardness.Following are excerpts of accounts from four different patients(Unger, 1965). I found myself drifting into another world and saw that I wasat the bottom of a set of stairs. At the very top of these stairswas a gleaming light like a star or jewel of exceptional brilliance.I ascended these stairs and upon reaching the top, I saw a gleaming,blinding light with a brilliance no man has ever known. It hadno shape nor form, but I knew that I was looking at God himself.The magnificence, splendor, and grandeur of this experience cannotbe put into words. Neither can my innermost feelings, but it shallremain in my heart, soul, and mind forever. I never felt so cleaninside in all my life. All the trash and garbage seemed to bewashed out of my mind. In my heart, my mind, my soul, and my body,it seemed as if I were born all over again. A feeling of great peace and contentment seemed to flow throughmy entire body. All sounds ceased and I seemed to be floatingin a great, very very still void or hemisphere. It is impossibleto describe the overpowering feeling of peace, contentment, andbeing a part of goodness itself that I felt. I could feel my bodydissolving and actually becoming a part of the goodness and peacethat was all around me. Words can't describe this. I feel an aweand wonder that such a feeling could have occurred to me. At the peak or climax of my experience, I realized a great scenewas about to unfold within myself. I actually shook and shudderedat what I felt. A tremendous earthquake feeling was building upin me. There was a tremendous force, and I came and saw a gloriousbeauty of space unfold before me, of light, color, and of songand music, and not only of one thing good and beautiful, but ofa oneness in fellowship, a wanting to belong to this greatnessof beauty and goodness that unfolded before my eyes, and thatI felt. Suddenly, I could see my family handing me great love. It seemedto be pouring out of their hearts. I cried, not bitter tears,but tears of beauty and joy. A beautiful organ was playing inthe background, and it seemed as if angels were singing. All ofa sudden I was back in eternity. There was music and beauty. Peaceand happiness, tranquillity—could not possibly describe my feelings.My heart was filled with joy that was overwhelming. Just a beautyand peace that I have never known. At this point, I felt thattime was thousands of years ago, thousands of years from now,and now. The profound emotional impact that these experiences have on peoplecan be sensed. The promising possibility that such positive experiencesmay have therapeutic value is one implication. Another is theusefulness of such a tool for investigating profound mysticalexperiences that heretofore have been hard to study scientificallybecause of their rarity. The basic psychological experience goes beyond any particularframework, but does lend itself to many possible interpretationsafterwards, since the rational mind inevitably goes to work andtries to understand. For example, the mystical experience of unionor fusion with its concomitant characteristics has been interpretedin many ways: fading or melting into the universal pool, boundlessbeing, the void, satori, nirvana, samadhi,the atman-Brahman identity; the awareness of a "Beyond,""More" or pure "Self;" or union with God.Yet in spite of the particular interpretation, the psychologicalexperience itself is the basis. This experience of encounter with what is felt to be a divinedimension deep within a person is not new. It has been reportedthroughout the centuries in the history of man's spiritual quest.It should be remembered that there are psychotic states of mindin which people also speak in religious metaphors, such as, ofmeeting God or of being God. The similarities and differencesbetween psychosis and mysticism form an interesting area thatneeds much more serious study and analysis, for the answers areby no means worked out as yet. One objection sometimes raised against calling these drug-facilitatedexperiences mystical or religious is that the accomplishment ofsomething usually considered so rare and unattainable except byextraordinary effort or great merit now seems too easy. What seemslike a short-cut causes a feeling of uneasiness. Perhaps the Puritanethic, so pervasive in our culture, is the psychological explanation.Pleasure is supposed to be earned through hard work and painfulstruggle. Indications are, however, that what one does with a psychedelicexperience may be more important than merely having it.Without integration into the on-going life of the individual,the experience may be only an irrelevant memory, no matter howbeautiful. Much work is needed to integrate the insights fromLSD when used as a part of psychotherapy. The analogy might bedrawn of a trip to a new country. If the traveler knew nothingabout the history and culture of this country, he might have aninteresting trip, but only a fast-fading memory would remain.If, on the other hand, before he departed, he learned as muchas possible about the country, its language and customs, talkedwith people who had been there before him and prepared himselffully, he would probably not only enjoy the experience more, butcould utilize it to enrich his life afterwards by thinking, readingand talking about it with others who had made such an experiencean integral part of their lives. At the present time there is a growing ferment of excitement andalarm caused by the religious movement that has been inspiredby psychedelic drugs. Already there are four major psychedelicchurches, which have been founded by persons who are convincedthat their psychedelic experiences have religious implications.These four churches are The League for Spiritual Discovery, TheNeo-American Church, The Native American Church and The Churchof the Awakening. The League for Spiritual Discovery, or L.S.D., is the most recent,having been founded by Timothy Leary in September of 1966, andit already claims from three hundred to five hundred members.The psychedelic celebrations that have been performed in somemajor cities throughout the country have received considerablepublicity. These "light shows" have attempted to portraysome psychedelic phenomena, but people who have actually had anLSD experience seem to agree that only a crude facsimile is produced.Leary has used these occasions to give psychedelic sermons abouthis church. The central message has been summarized as "Turnon, tune in and drop out." In essence, the message is ofwithdrawal, but not from everything, not from all social life,with nothing in its place. The withdrawal is from the meaninglessgames in which we are involved, to allow full-time commitmentto spiritual exploration, which Leary feels is the most importantreason for living. An attempt is made to criticize modern Americanculture. The Neo-American Church was founded in 1964 by a psychologist,Arthur Kleps, who calls himself Chief Boo-Hoo, the Patriarch ofthe East. Kleps states that the purpose of this title is to remindhim not to take himself too seriously. Membership now allegedlynumbers over six hundred. LSD is their sacrament, and one of theirmain beliefs is that alteration of consciousness with LSD is areligious right of any citizen. The Neo-American Church should not be confused with the NativeAmerican Church, which has deep historical roots going back tothe religious practices of the Aztecs in Mexico before the timeof Christ. When the Spaniards came, they tried to stamp out theuse of peyote, but the custom persisted underground. Sometimebetween 1700 and 1880, the religious use of peyote spread acrossthe Rio Grande River into the southwestern United States and fromthere to the Plains and then all the way into Canada and as fareast as Wisconsin and Michigan. The church has been legally incorporatedin Oklahoma since 1918. At present membership has been estimatedat anywhere from 50,000 to 250,000 Indians, with only a few whitemembers. Peyote is used in a religious ceremony as their sacrament,which they feel is essential to their church. Some important features of the ceremony are constant among differentgroups. The rite is an all-night affair extending from about 8:00p.m. on Saturday until about 8:00 a.m. on Sunday. It usually takesplace around a central fire in a teepee and is led by four orfive Indian officials. The ritual begins with prayer, followedby the singing of songs by each participant in turn accompaniedby the water drum, ingestion of the sacramental peyote and contemplation.Although the contents of the individual prayers and songs arespontaneous, the ritual as a whole follows a definite pattern.At midnight there is a water-drinking ceremony, and at dawn parchedcorn in sweetened water, fruit and dried sweetened meat are eaten.[For a detailed description of the ritual with diagrams of thearrangement of participants, see Omar C. Stewart's Washo-NorthernPaiute Peyotism, Volume XL, Number 3 of the Publications inAmerican Archaeology & Ethnology of the University of California(1944); and compare to Weston La Barre's The Peyote Cult,Number 19 of Yale University Publications in Anthropology, anenlarged edition of which was published in 1964 by The Shoe StringPress of Hamden, Connecticut.]. Because the ceremony is regarded as very sacred by the Indians,preparation for the rite is taken seriously. Proper preparationincludes being physically clean, spiritually pure, psychologicallyhumble and in a mood for concentrated meditation (Slotkin, 1956).The participants feel that peyote aids contemplation by increasingtheir powers of introspection, sensitizing their consciences andproducing visions of great meaning. Throughout the ceremony theparticipants conduct themselves with due solemnity. White menwho have attended these worship services as observers or as participantshave taken peyote with the Indians in a receptive manner and havebeen impressed by the serious and sacred nature of the ceremony(Osmond, 1961; Schultes, 1963; Slotkin, 1961). The Church of the Awakening was founded in 1958 by two marriedphysicians, John and Louisa Aiken from New Mexico. The churchhas grown slowly but steadily and has at present about 350 members.Only people who have demonstrated a serious interest in spiritualawakening have been encouraged to join. The members claim thattheir spiritual lives have been deepened because of participationin psychedelic ceremonies using their sacrament peyote. The useof the sacrament is restricted to once every three months, ifeven that often. The major emphasis seems to be on integrationof spiritual insights into the on-going life of the individualmember. There are certain legal problems posed by the existence of psychedelicchurches. Both natural products, like peyote, cactus buttons,mushrooms or morning glory seeds, and synthetic chemicals, likeLSD, psilocybin or mescaline, are considered drugs by the lawwhen taken into the human body and thus requiring medical supervision.Because this is the way our society has defined things, thereis really no legal mechanism or social sanction for a church touse these substances for spiritual exploration. Unwillingnessto accommodate to this fact has caused legal difficulties forTimothy Leary, Arthur Kleps and some of their followers. But theissue becomes clouded because the religious use of peyote in theNative American Church has been permitted by the Food and DrugAdministration and by the Supreme Court of California. The matterbecomes even more complex when Dr. John Aiken, a licensed physician,seeks to administer peyote for what he considers bona fidereligious purposes. If he is not allowed to do so, and the Indiansare, does this constitute discrimination against white people?Undoubtedly, religious freedom and related issues will receivemuch publicity in the years ahead as test cases reach the courts.If the matter is decided by outlawing all religious use of psychedelicsubstances, even by the Native American Church, it may turn intoanother sorry example of the white man's disregarding the sensitivitiesand cultural heritage of the American Indian. In the meantime there is an increasing need for organized religionto consider the impact of the psychedelic religious movement.If instead of the collapse of a fad, as some predict, there iscontinued interest, growth and enthusiasm, what might be the effecton religion in America? Persons having had powerful psychedelicmystical experiences may well feel that organized religion, incontrast, is moribund and irrelevant to their needs. Such a trendcould be perceived as a threat, and the churches might feel aneed to encourage suppression of psychedelic drugs. On the otherhand, it can be speculated that with an imaginative and creativeapproach to an increasing amount of mystical experience, revitalizationof religious life in the churches could occur. The churches couldhelp people to integrate such profound experiences with the aidof meaningful and appropriate religious symbols. Such people dotend to talk about their drug experiences in religious terms.In our experimental work with divinity students and ministers,those who had a meaningful religious framework were much helpedin using positive psychedelic experiences to understand theirfaith more existentially. Some definite dangers, however, are posed by the growing use,religious and otherwise, of psychedelic drugs. The possible dangersto the individual have been fully discussed at this conference.It should be emphasized that unsupervised and unskilled use willinevitably lead to psychiatric casualties in a certain, as yetunknown, percentage of cases. The most obvious reasons are lackof screening, inadequate preparation, unskilled handling duringthe drug reaction, and little or no help with useful integrationafter the experience. The dangers to society have also been mentioned.If more and more people drop out and withdraw, can society continueto function? If psychedelic drugs really can change people's goals, values,motivations and needs for achievement, the impact could be considerableon our society, in which there is so much stress on money, powerand status. Less emphasis on these traditional goals, coupledwith the availability of more leisure time, could alter our styleof life. Some argue that such changes in moderation might be healthy,yet it is possible that widespread adoption of a radical changein outlook might be disastrous to a society that wants mainlyto multiply its Gross National Product and to compete successfully.Such issues need realistic and sensitive consideration. There has been too much heat and perhaps not enough light propagatedby the psychedelic drugs. Because of mass-media coverage, certainlyeveryone today has heard of LSD. Interestingly enough, almosteveryone has a definite opinion, no matter how little or how muchhe knows about the field. These opinions, pro or con, usuallyhave a deep emotional basis. Certainly the reason is more thanjust an abhorrence of drug taking, because other drugs such astranquilizers, sleeping pills and alcohol are taken freely withno such emotional reaction. The dangers of negative consequencessuch as psychological breakdown appear to be a logical reason,but since most drug experiences are positive, there must be anadditional explanation. A deeper reason may lie in the natureof the profound emotional experiences, often considered religious,which seem to have the power to change a person's values and togenerate enthusiasm and inspiration in a direction perhaps notshared by society in general. Such consequences may be seen asa threat when considered logically, but felt even more powerfullyto be so at a subliminal or non-rational level. Our society is faced with the fact that the use of psychedelicdrugs is spreading rapidly. Do we have the capacity and wisdomto deal constructively with this problem, or will we seek a solutionby restrictive legislation and police force? In this instance,suppression has much less a chance of succeeding than in the illegaluse of narcotics, which has not been stopped. Throughout historywhen enough people have really wanted something, no restrictivemeasures have worked. Laws did not stop the introduction of coffeeinto Europe, nor the consumption of alcohol in the United Statesduring Prohibition. What will undoubtedly result, however, from a rigid suppressionof psychedelic drugs is a severe inhibition of research in thisarea. The more laws that are passed, the more the public identifiesthe drugs with something negative. People in power, in both thepublic and academic realms, are influenced by public reactionand the mass media, and when research is proposed, there is hesitationand lack of support. The decline of research with psychedelicdrugs has already occurred. Dr. Harold Abramson, one of the earlypioneers in LSD research, has commented that an interested laymancan use LSD more easily in our society today than can a doctorwho wants to do legitimate research. The joint committee now setup by the N.I.M.H. and the F.D.A. to screen proposals will possiblyenable more research to begin in the near future. Research is especially important in regard to the individual andthe societal problems caused by the growing use of psychedelicdrugs. Education rather than suppression would seem a more effectivesolution, and more research is needed to learn the unknown factsabout many aspects of these drugs. We need more knowledge abouttheir biological and psychological mechanisms of action, theirtherapeutic possibilities, dangers and long-term effects. Validstatistics about chance of harm would be useful in calculatinga realistic pleasure-to-risk ratio. An important area for more research is the effect of psychedelicdrugs on relatively stable, well-adjusted persons. Many of thepeople who have taken LSD and upon whom some of the conclusionsabout its dangers are based were already drop-outs before encounteringthe drug. For purposes of education and guidance it is importantthat we base our facts on drug effects in normals rather thanon retrospective analysis of drop-outs. No one knows how manysuccessful people who did not drop out or withdraw fromtheir place in society have found that psychedelic experiencecan be an enriching part of their total lives, without eclipsingother interests and responsibilities. There are many questions that can only be answered by carefuland well controlled research. For example, what are the exactconditions responsible for the production of aesthetic, cognitiveor mystical experiences? All the extra-drug variables of set andsetting need to be studied intensively. An interesting projectwould be to follow a group of persons who would have LSD sessionsat regular intervals for three to five years, or to do a longitudinalstudy on a group of persons who had only a few sessions and thenwere followed over a period of time. In a small group who mighttake LSD together, other phenomena such as the effect on groupdiscussion, group interaction and group cohesion could be measured. The sociology of religion has an extraordinary opportunity forresearch in the psychedelic religious movement. Here is a chanceto study the formation and growth of what may become an importantform of religion in the United States. The small cult-like groups,the evangelistic ferment, the utopian ideals, the struggle forsurvival—all these elements can be studied for better understanding of what has gone on when other religious movements emergedin the past. Dr. R. Blum (Blum et al., 1964) has made astart in this area, but other points of view would also be helpful.Participant-observers, who would be more in rapport with thosein the movement, might add valuable additional data to the field. With regard to the future, psychedelic drugs seem to be here tostay as a fact of our present existence. The experiences are muchtoo powerful and have too many implications to be dismissed asa passing fad. Indications are that the use will increase ratherthan decrease and may have more influence on American life thanwe now imagine. Certainly researchers with LSD even ten yearsago would not have predicted what has happened. More surprisesmay be in store for us. Work needs to be done with these drugswithout delay in a disciplined scientific way rather than permittinga black-market underground to undertake experiments by default. If these drugs are ever going to be used legitimately, trainingcenters will have to be established, because specialized trainingunder supervision is needed to insure maximal safety. The workthus far at the Spring Grove State Hospital has indicated thateven very unstable people can be treated with LSD in relativesafety if specific procedures are employed. These centers canbe used for the training not only of psychiatrists, but also ofpsychologists, social workers, ministers or any one else who mighthave a role in treatment with these drugs. Some day it may evenbe possible to establish places where interested, serious peoplecould go to take LSD in maximal safety under the supervision oftrained personnel. Such a suggestion is utopian at present andmay take a long time in being developed, but it is possible inthe future. Some people, however, and especially students, are not contentto wait and are asking themselves the existential question "ShouldI take LSD now, on my own?" It is obvious that anyone whoreally wants to obtain the drug and take it can do so. No amountof admonition to the contrary from college administrators canreally stop anyone. It remains a personal decision, but anyonecontemplating such a course of action would be wise to considersome basic facts. First, there is a definite risk, which is certainly greater inuncontrolled than in controlled conditions. The work at SpringGrove and elsewhere has demonstrated that with skilled handlingthe risk is minimal. Psychedelic drugs are like other powerfultools in that the risk is greatly dependent upon the way theyare used. For example, for eye surgery a skilled surgeon is needed,not a watchmaker, no matter how skilled he might be in the useof fine instruments. The use of psychedelic drugs also requiresspecialized training for maximal safety. At the Spring Grove Hospital,three to six months, or longer, are needed to train a therapist.The fact that safe procedures have been worked out, however, isnot much help at present to someone who would like to take a psychedelicdrug under supervision, because at present no authorized researchin the United States is being done with normal persons. Another thing to consider is the time of life. Many persons incollege are going through an identity crisis and are trying todecide where they are really going with their lives. Because apsychedelic drug experience may affect judgment, it is probablynot a good idea to make a major life decision within three monthsafter a drug session. People undergoing intensive psychotherapyor psychoanalysis are given the same advice. Decisions made atsuch a time may turn out to be regretted later, especially whenno guidance is available during and after the drug session. Peoplewho have a psychedelic experience when they are older and havesuccessfully settled some of the crucial issues of their livesprobably have a better chance for an enriching experience. Itwould seem that the more life experience a person has had, thebetter, just as the program fed to a computer is the basis uponwhich the results are produced. It is a misconception to imagine that LSD is the magic answerto anything. Hard work is needed to utilize the experience, andfollow-up therapy with the therapist who guided the drug sessioncan be very helpful. Persons who take a psychedelic drug to "workout their own problems" not only may be disappointed butalso may unearth additional conflicts. More than a few peoplehave been unpleasantly surprised by what emerged with great forcefrom the unconscious. In spite of the very real dangers in self-experimentation, anyonewith a serious and scientific interest in this fascinating areaof research would not be discouraged about the prospects of legitimateresearch. There is much work to be done, and people of the highestcaliber will be needed in the near future if we are to gain newknowledge about these drugs and their possible applications. Ideally,an interdisciplinary approach should be used involving the jointefforts of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, clergymen,theologians and philosophers. Anyone interested in this field should get the best possible trainingin the discipline of his choice. It has been said: "Turnon, tune in and drop out." This can be paraphrased a bitas follows: Turn on your motivation in the most concentrated waypossible; tune in to everything that's relevant to equip yourselfin the way of training for the work you want to do in the field;and then, instead of dropping out, you will be ready to drop intoa worthwhile and interesting career, one that may be full of greatsatisfactions and a sense of accomplishment, because this is anexciting area. A striking example of a future psychedelic research possibilityis the work with terminal-cancer patients. This area is relevantto a discussion of religion and LSD, because the experience ofdeath has a crucial place in almost all religions. In spite ofmuch talk and concern, and perhaps guilt about the way terminalpatients are treated, not much has really changed in this anxiety-riddensituation in our culture. Many times there is a growing isolationfrom meaningful interpersonal involvement, as all efforts arebent toward making the patient "comfortable." Psychedelic therapy may have a role to play to make life morelivable for terminal patients. LSD was first tried for its analgesiceffect, which was found to be considerable (Blum et al.,1964; Kast, 1963; Kast, 1964a; Kast, 1964b). More important, perhaps,was the finding that fear, anxiety and apprehension were lessenedin some cases (Kast, 1966). By working with patients and theirfamilies, the opportunity for an increase in interpersonal closenesswas afforded, especially in the wake of a powerful psychedelicexperience (Cohen, 1965). Current research to explore these initialleads is only in the pilot stage, but it appears to be a promisingapproach to help ease the agony and isolation of death, both forthose who will be left behind and for the one who must face theend of his life. In conclusion, let us ponder the wide influence that the accidentaldiscovery of LSD in a Swiss pharmaceutical laboratory has exercisedthroughout the world. There have been far-reaching effects inall kinds of research, especially in biochemistry, pharmacology,psychiatry, psychology, sociology, philosophy and religion. Theinterdisciplinary implications seem broad indeed. In spite ofthe dangers that are certainly potential in the use of this powerfultool, it has always been man's destiny to push ahead in orderto increase his knowledge. This area is no exception, but thosewho undertake such research bear a heavy responsibility. See also the Discussion which followed the presentation of Dr. Pahnke's paper. REFERENCES Abramson, H. A.

From LSD, Man & Society, DeBold and Leaf, editors.©Wesleyan University, 1967. The following discussion between the participants and audienceattending the Wesleyan University symposium is illustrative ofthe mood of the times: On the one side we see authoritariansagitating for maximal control of the psychedelic drugs with criminalpenalties for those who would contravene the regulations; on theother the more rational voices which, as so often happens, arelittle heard and less considered in times when a rush to judgment,inspired by panic, rules the day. Of particular note are the figures showingthe radically diminishing funding and licensing provided by the government:If rational decisions and legislation were to be effected, one would think thatgreatly expanded research would have been in the general interest. A List of participants followsthe discussion. �pw The moderator: The psychedelic drugs have often been referredto as an instrument for conversion, with use centered on the collegecampuses. Many articles about LSD seem to stress the college campuses.Of course, Greenwich Village is essentially in the watershed ofNew York University and other universities there, and the Berkeleyscene is close to the Berkeley campus. On the other hand, it hasbeen suggested that the spread of LSD is an autonomous phenomenon,not related to the college community. I would like to ask themembers of the panel to speak to this. Is the LSD phenomenon inour culture today a college-bound phenomenon or is it, in fact,independent and autonomous? Dr. Pahnke: I would say that Dr. Louria's figures fromthis afternoon would dispute that, because he showed that it wasused by people with all kinds of occupations, not only by students.I think that 15% were students. I'm not sure that use was everconfined to colleges. Dr. Louria: The Blum studies show us the same thing exactly,but far more precisely than the few data from our hospital. A member of the audience: I have a suggestion to make,and I'd like to ask both Mr. Joffe and Dr. Pahnke whether it'sfeasible. Everybody is agreed that more research is needed. Theproblem seems to be that today and tomorrow and the next few weeksa lot of kids and others are going to be turning on, and a small,yet unknown proportion of these are going to be harmed. I wouldlike to suggest that perhaps the people from Spring Grove couldget together with the people from the government to the extentthat they have techniques worked out, to the extent that any bitof information that could be provided to the community at largeto help people use whatever research there has been and to preventpeople from harming themselves. I think that this might be useful.So that the proportion, whether it is one in a thousand or onein ten thousand, goes down. And that something be done relativelysoon to try to alleviate the problem as it exists. Mr. Joffe: Dr. Louria has already given you the answerthis afternoon. He said don't use it; it's a dangerous drug. Same member of the audience: But people are not listening,though it is a dangerous drug, because of the kinds of evidencereferred to today. People think that they can use it, taking theproper precautions themselves; and these people are trying todecide for themselves whether they can handle it. Mr. Joffe: Do you suggest that each individual who wouldlike to try the drug furnish a complete medical history, includingelectroencephalograms and psychiatric interview, which is theonly way I know of to be reasonably sure that the individual willnot have a bad reaction? Same member of the audience: I think that there appearsa general principle for dealing with the LSD experience that seemsto be implied in what Dr. Pahnke said, and I am asking whethersuch things couldn't be made available to the public, becausesome segment of the public is going to experiment regardless ofwhat anyone says. The moderator: I'm not clear on just what you're proposing.It sounds to me as though you're proposing something that we thoughtwe were getting at when we set up this symposium, that is, providingdefinitive information on which people can base their decisions.This is one thing, but I think that there is inherent in whatyou are saying a second suggestion, which is that there be setup essentially some instrument for providing a mechanism of screening.I don't know what that would be. Same member of the audience: I am talking about proceduresfor guiding people on trips. To the extent that such procedures�and Dr. Pahnke stressed the importance of this�seem to be theprime determinant as to whether a person has or has not a favorableexperience. Dr. Pahnke: Let me comment. Such procedures have been workedout at Spring Grove and are continuing to be. They will be publishedin the scientific literature, but that will take time, at leasta couple of years. If what you want actually happened, if youdid have the information now, and it was disseminated, I don'tthink it would help too much because other researchers couldn't,perhaps, get the permission to use the drug anyway. You want itfor the lay people. In a handbook? Same member of the audience: For the people whom Dr. Louriais worried about. Dr. Pahnke: But you see, they wouldn't be using it undermedical guidance, which is the essential point. Dr. Louria: I think we're in a real dilemma. You see, thewhole thing is that there are several levels involved. On theone hand, there's the research problem, and during the eveningI was just figuring out from the Congressional hearings what theresearch situation is. And here is what it is, if my figures areat all accurate. In 1964 there were about seventy licensed investigators;in 1965, thirty-nine; in 1966, thirty-one; and currently, onlysixteen. As to N.I.M.H. funds, there was available in 1964 1.5million dollars; in 1965, 1.49 million dollars; in 1966, 927,000dollars, a decrease of over one-third in one year; and currentlythere is still less available. It is abundantly clear that researchhas been markedly reduced; and you can prove this fact with thegovernment's own figures. Now, that's one level, research thatwe desperately want to increase. And I don't think that thereis any excuse for the N.I.M.H. not to increase it. Then, there's the second level, which is the kind of researchthat you are doing, Dr. Kurland, absolutely well controlled andunder medical aegis. We all want that increased. That has to beincreased. That's very important research. And there's the thirdlevel, research in a broader context, in a community that maybe in your semi-utopian future under some control. And there'sthe fourth level, the level that you're talking about, namely,having people take the drug, young people, unprepared, on theirown. That level is the one that bothers me. I am not botheredby the other three levels. There is no way of disseminating informationnow to that fourth group and to prevent their having adverse reactions.That group, young, unprepared, under uncontrolled conditions,that group is the one that we are desperately trying to educatenot to take the drug in any circumstances, because it is not onein a thousand or one in ten thousand. At the very minimum it isseveral per cent. Now, the derivative problem is that of thatseveral per cent who do get into trouble, certain ones are goingto do very dramatic things. They are going to jump out windowsor walk in front of cars, enough to get front-page headlines.In New York City 1 % of heroin addicts die every year of an overdose. This fact almost never gets headlines, because it isn't very dramatic.They shoot the stuff into their veins, and they drop dead. Theyare taken to the coroner's office. We whisk them off to the grave,and nobody cares. But let somebody jump out a window under LSD,the way the newspapers are now, and that's front-page across thecountry. In doing that, what you do is to arouse not the people who areinterested in LSD, a very small segment of the population, butwhat Leary has called the middle-class, middle-aged monolith thatruns our country. I'm not derogating that, for I'm rather fortheir running the country. This relatively stable group then transmitsits fears and angers and anxieties to legislatures, which aredependent on this middle-aged monolith for their maintenance inoffice, and you know what happens. So the only way by which youcan avoid more restrictive laws, which make the whole situationworse, is by getting the fourth group off its LSD kick. I thinkthat we have to have some laws, both federal and state, to helpus in that endeavor; because if you don't, then you will destroythe other three levels� from animal research to human researchto community research, all of which could be of enormous valueto all of us in the future. The moderator: Are there any questions from the floor? A member of the audience: It seems to me that a lot ofpeople have forgotten the fact that the reason people are droppingout is because their society wants them to drop out. Dr. Pahnke,what do you think that the possibilities are that at some timein the future, people won't drop out, but will work to changethe aspects of society that tend to drive them out? Dr. Pahnke: I think that would be fine. I am a little concernedas to what happens to these people who do drop out. Who is reallyhelping them? I know what happens to some of the people who dropout, because we get them as patients in our out-patient clinic.These are people who before they took LSD had, perhaps, some problemsand were told that they needed psychotherapy, but they would havenone of it. They felt that they were quite healthy and that theiradvisers were just talking through their hats. They took LSD,got very shaken up and perhaps dropped out of school. But thenthey come to the clinic seeking therapy, and, paradoxically enough,these people are then quite eager to work in therapy. This isa danger that has a paradoxical, perhaps good, effect, but I certainlywould not recommend it as a way of getting into therapy. A member of the audience: There was an earlier questionconcerning black-market impurities and the dangers of them. WouldMr. Joffe discuss this? Mr. Joffe: I'm afraid I can't tell you what the impuritiesmight be. There is some black-market material that is of exceedinglygood quality. I don't mean to say that everything that is notlegitimate is of poor quality. We do know, however, that a simpleanalysis of a cube will show perhaps 30% of LSD; it will alsoshow on an ultraviolet spectrum many peaks that you know are notLSD and do not occur in the pure product. Therefore they are impuritiesof one sort or another. It has not seemed too important to ouractivities to find out what is wrong with this product or thatproduct, because they are all illegal. I don't see what good itwill do us to run the analyses of the home-made products so thatsomeone will know that there is bad in his product. Dr. Pahnke: Unless he were getting heroin or somethingelse. That should be publicized, I think. It might deter somepeople from taking it. I've heard of that happening. Amphetamines,barbiturates and heroin do get mixed in with LSD. I think thiscould have very bad effects in terms of persons' becoming addicted. Mr. Joffe: These are recognizable peaks on an ultravioletabsorption spectrum. Dr. Pahnke: Yes, but if you're not making an analysis,how would you know that? Mr. Joffe: You run the curve, and you see that here isthe peak that we know is LSD. . . Dr. Pahnke: Yes, that's fine, if you're doing them, butyou said that you're not doing them. Mr. Joffe: No, I said we're not running the peak down tofind out what the impurity is. Dr. Pahnke: Well, say the impurity was heroin? Somebodyhad added . . . Mr. Joffe: Heroin has a recognizable peak. Dr. Pahnke: One that is easily recognized? Mr. Joffe: Yes. Dr. Pahnke: Do you find that? Mr. Joffe: I don't know. I have not myself heard of it. The moderator: I'm afraid that some of you couldn't hearthe discussion that went on at the table. Let me try to paraphraseit quickly for you. Dr. Pahnke asked the question if it wasn'ta social responsibility of the F.D.A. to check out the actualnature of impurities to forestall possibly the use of drugs suchas heroin as additives to sugar cubes and therefore make thispublic knowledge in order to warn people who might use them. A member of the audience: I am not satisfied with a previousanswer. LSD appeals to young people, and what's to prevent theirusing it? You agree that something should be done to stop freeusage by young people. You refuse to recognize any valid reasonfor using LSD regardless of whether the user be a young studentor a middle-aged person. I think there is a responsibility amongall groups, doctors, psychiatrists and legal people, to recognizethat there is going to be a lot of illegal LSD usage. In lightof the circumstances, what can be done to keep the number of badtrips down? This is a problem. The refusal to offer any kind ofguidance to users is bad. The moderator: As I understand the question, it says, asa banner did over the Sather Gate at the University of Californiarecently, "Never trust anybody over thirty." We arebeing accused, I guess, of evading the issue that has been broughtbefore us, which is that there is a large population of peoplewho fall into category four, as defined earlier by Dr. Louria,those who use LSD on their own in situations in which there isno guidance. The panel is asked to comment on possible ways ofminimizing bad trips, psychotic episodes and hospital admissionsfor this category. Mr. Chayet: I think that this is one of the basic defensesfor the existing laws. As I understand these gentlemen who arecertainly the professionals in dealing with LSD, there is no wayto give out information on a mass scale to tell you how to takeLSD on your own. Even Mr. Leary has suggested that there be licensingof individuals. He wants, of course, to reduce the criteria forgetting a license to work with LSD; and he certainly doesn't believein the medical profession's having exclusive control. But evenMr. Leary says that there should be some control and some guidance;and as I understand it, there is just no way of preparing a brochureso that you can do it yourself and be successful at it, thoughI would be interested to hear if this is a possibility. Mr. Joffe: I think that the question ultimately boils downto the fact that the gentleman says that there will be the useof this drug whether we authorize it or not. There will also bebank robberies, murders and other crimes whether we have lawsor not. What you are asking us to do is to show you the best wayto evade the law. You want the government to furnish the safecrackerwith tools to make his job easier. We can't do this. It is nota province of a regulatory agency to show people how to evadethe law. Aside from the fact that there is no cookbook sort ofthing for this. Dr. Pahnke: Well, actually, there are some manuals. Mr. Joffe: But not for the ordinary individual. Dr. Pahnke: Well, yes. Mr. Joffe: One off the street? Dr. Pahnke: Yes. Actually, this is what Leary proposedwhen he founded IF-IF. He was going to write a number of manuals.He wrote two, and The Psychedelic Experience has nearly a chapterdescribing how to run a session. The trouble is that you cannotlearn this from a book. What you need is specialized training,in which you work under someone or watch someone run sessions,as it is possible at Spring Grove, where there is a closed-circuittelevision system. But this is not yet set up to train a lot ofpeople, though it might be possible sometime in the future. Thisis what I suggested, having training centers, but we're a longway from that. So for the present time I can't offer you any advice.These manuals may be somewhat helpful, but I certainly don't thinkthat that's the way to learn how to use LSD. Same member of the audience: My question asked for therecognition that there is going to be a lot of usage by the layman.Instead of saying merely that this is something to be outlawed,leaving it at that and limiting research to laboratory settings,you are asked to shift from your concern with developing a definiteset of rules and direct your attention toward existing problems.Perhaps there's something that should be outlawed. But users ofLSD have a right to be considered themselves. The moderator: I will say that I believe many people inour culture, in our nation and in the western nations whom I knowand have talked to are very concerned about this. As I understandthe question, we are being asked to increase at least the amountof attention that we are paying to that group, group four, peoplewho are taking LSD on their own, and to share our attention withthem, the same attention that animal research receives. I thinkthat's what you are asking us to do. Dr. Pahnke: I would just like to say in addition that ittakes three to six months to train adequately an LSD therapist,to have him learn how to deal with all possible contingencies,so that he can really guide people with safety. It's no thingthat you can learn easily just from a few rules. Some people havegone ahead on their own and had experiences, and there have beena lot of bad experiences. These people of the lay public havelearned by experience, and some have had some very bad trips.But I don't think that's the ideal way to do it. And you're right,it is a problem. Some people feel that we just suppress the problemby passing a law against it and assuming that this law will takecare of it. I don't feel that it will, and I think that it willtake time to work this out. If LSD does continue to spread, andmore and more people do continue to take it, there will eventuallybe pressure to change the laws or to make some provision for this,but that also will take time. I know that this solution probablywon't satisfy you. You want something right now. The reality isthat it probably is not practical. A member of the audience: Well, I see some sense of understandingamong certain members of the panel who have spoken today, andI wonder whether the more legalistically oriented members of thepanel are sitting with points of view that might be expressedby the statement "Well, we'll let the sympathetic peoplespeak, but we've got the say, because we make the laws, we enforcethem, we regulate them." Or whether, in fact, there is asense of cooperation and understanding among the people who aregathered here to speak to us on the issue? The moderator: But that precisely is the reason why we'redoing it. Same member of the audience: Yes, I know. I understand.My question, though, is whether in the process there are formulationsgoing on? Mr. Joffe: I am working for the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control,which you may call legalistically oriented, if you wish, but Iam not a lawyer. I am not an enforcement agent. I am a pharmacologist.The reason that I am working for this agency is because it offersme a chance to get some scientific work done, and I am interestedin the scientific aspects of this problem. But that the supporthappens to be in a bureau that has as well the responsibilityfor enforcement does not deter me. I am not going to try to changethe rules of enforcement. This is something else. But I have joinedthem, because they give me an opportunity to do the scientificwork that I want to see done. This is my personal approach toit. I can't speak for anyone else. We have the authority not onlyto do in-house research but also to have contract research done.When I say support for research, I don't mean that someone hasto build me a ten-million-dollar laboratory. I have the authorityto solicit or to receive unsolicited proposals from those individualswho would like to do work on drug abuse of a scientific naturethat I am capable of supporting. The moderator: I think that we have slipped away from thequestion, and rather than see this thread followed, I'd like thequestion to get the attention that I think it really deserves.I wasn't kidding when I said that one of the shocking signs ofmy life was the sign over the Sather Gate, which appeared in allthe papers, saying "Never trust anybody over thirty."You know, that really gets at me. I don't know why. I need a lotof love, I guess, and I want people who are under thirty to believesomehow that even if I am not a part of their culture and don'tunderstand them, I do want to understand them, and I think thatthis feeling is shared by many people who are my age and older.We are trying very hard to understand, and in addition to tryingto understand we are trying to act in good faith. Now, in yourquestion, as you phrased it, there was an implication that I hearvery frequently�"Yes, you pay lip service to understanding,but actually you want to pass regulations and hold us down. You'reafraid of us. We are coming up. We're new and we're different,and we threaten you." In a sense, that's true. It is thebusiness of the young to displace the old. That's the story oflife, but I would defend the people here today, all of us, thepeople who have been most militant in their expressions and thosewho seem most permissive, from the charge of insincerity. I don'tthink that these people are, and I certainly know that I am not,insincere. Mr. Chayet: I would like to comment. I am under thirty,so I don't know where that really puts me. I'm also probably nota very good representative of the law-enforcement profession,because I don't like these laws. I think, however, that they arean absolute necessity. For example, the law regarding marijuana.I have grave doubt that anybody who is carrying around marijuana seed oughtto get thirty years in prison. That bothers me very much, becauseit doesn't seem to me that the danger is there. I've heard fromso many that alcohol is much more dangerous than marijuana, butthis may be subject to rebuttal by those who know more about marijuana.It seems to me that when you talk about psilocybin and LSD, thedanger is very great, and therefore we do need laws to protectpeople from themselves. I think that if the danger weren't there,that the laws would be bad and unnecessary. It's the danger thatreally necessitates the legislation. As soon as we have some controland some training centers, or anything else, I would be the firstto want to see the laws go. Dr. Louria: Well, I think that you really said what I wasgoing to say, Mr. Chayet. I'm not sympathetic with the questioner'spoint of view. I think that we have shown you beyond peradventurethat this drug, taken under those conditions that you want totake it under, is a dangerous drug. There's no question aboutthat. You can't show me evidence that taken under your circumstancesthis gives you anything other than a kick. You can't show me thatit gives you any lasting benefit, though it may. But that willcome from the kind of research that Dr. Kurland is doing and Dr.Pahnke is doing and others will do if we can get more researchon a broader level. Not from your going out with a do-it-yourselfkit and taking LSD. Our medical view is simple. If you take itunder those circumstances, you can't show anybody that it doesyou any good; and a certain percentage of you are going to endup in hospitals with acute or chronic psychoses; and some of you,infrequently, but some of you, are going to end up dead. We knowthat now. So what we're telling you is very simple. We do notunder any conditions condone the concept or understand the conceptor agree with any part of the concept that you ought to be ableto take drugs like LSD�not marijuana�under these conditionsand have us give to you a pamphlet that tells you how to do itbetter. As far as I'm concerned, if you're going to do it, knowingwhat the dangers are, you damn well take the risk; and if youget into trouble, what we will do in the medical profession isto publicize the adverse effects that you have in the hope thatother people won't get into that trouble until the time when wedo have the knowledge that it can be given to people, such asyou, on an outpatient basis, relatively safely. Mr. Barron: Well, I don't think that Dr. Louria's responseanswers the question, the intent of the question, as it was put.Also, I wish that Dr. Louria would speak for himself and not say"we." It seems you said, "We have shown you beyonda peradventure of a doubt." There has been a lack of imaginativeor constructive attempts to find other means, other solutions,new institutions to meet what has been an expressed need on thepart of a lot of people. I don't think that what one should dois to give advice on how to break the law. I think it's just whathas to be built up as a body of opinion, reflecting pressure tocreate forms that will meet new social needs. It is not a matterjust of restrictive laws. Dr. Pahnke: At the end, Dr. Louria, you said if there wasenough evidence accumulated showing that it was safe to give LSDon an out-patient basis, you would be for it. Now, what wouldthat evidence consist of for you? How much evidence would youneed? I think that there is some evidence already, but how muchmore do you need? Dr. Louria: Under whose aegis? Dr. Pahnke: I think that what they are doing at SpringGrove has shown that very sick patients can be given LSD withoutserious consequences, so far anyway, with almost two hundred patients. Dr. Kurland: I think that the safety question is in everybody'smind, and the safety record established in research at SpringGrove didn't happen by chance. There were years of pilot workdone by experts, by professionals in these drug studies; and beforewe initiated these control studies, there were pilot studies thatwent on a year or longer. The thing that I oppose is to let unsophisticatedpeople, who don't have the longitudinal experience, who don'thave all the things that one needs from the standpoint of physiologicaland behavioral background, to plunge into these areas and carryon research. The point is that without the necessary tools youcan't even document what you are doing. You can't put this downin some kind of systematic way so that it can be replicated. Theway that our studies started, the history of prior research inour area had to be studied in order to work out a plan. We didn'tjust plunge into this. We gathered the reports that came fromthe different investigators, and we formulated the usefulnessof treatment of alcoholics. These were very full reports. We startedout by attempting to replicate these things, and this is our pointfor beginning to learn. For people who say that they can get somethingaccomplished in uncontrolled studies, who think that they aregoing to get a lot of new information and insight, I would justbring back to your attention the fact that we first had to learnsomething about what goes on in group psychotherapy, where therearen't many complicating conditions. So, with all due respectto the younger people, it is very, very important to learn therules before you get involved; certainly they would refuse toallow anybody to get into the field of radioactivity without havinga license indicating technical competency. Mr. Barron: Let me make it quite clear that I am not, byany means, advocating usage of any of these substances that areillegal. What I was saying is that I think that the intent ormotive of the question was misinterpreted and that what is essentiallythreatening is some kind of feeling that the present laws andpresent social institutions are not adequate to a deeply feltneed on the part of some people. It's this, I think, that shouldbe taken seriously, as a feeling, and that if we use all of it,we will work as best we can and create whatever kinds of institutionsare necessary, if indeed it's true that this is no passing fadand represents something that is important to the general movementof mind over the past fifty years. The moderator: Let me say that it was my feeling that inyour paper, Mr. Barron, you tried to provide an historical analysisfor this anomie toward which the question was directed. I feltthat that was a matter of record today, and I was including youamong those of us who feel sincerely concerned about these problems. A member of the audience: Well, I hope that the idea thatyou don't trust anybody under thirty doesn't emerge. The moderator: Let me just make that comment over the speaker,for the people in the back, an important point, sometimes overlookedin this controversy. One of the audience expressed the hope thatas the reaction to "You can't trust anyone over thirty,"there wouldn't develop a backlash movement that would be expressed"You can't trust anybody under thirty." Same member of the audience: I was prompted to say thatwhen you said that you can't prove to us that you're not takingit just for kicks. This discussion is supposed to be about LSDin society, and the legal justification for regulating the drugsseems to be based on a pleasure-to-risk ratio, which was unfortunatelydemonstrated today, what you call a high risk. But nobody hastalked about the other thing that you should substitute for pleasure�althoughpleasure may be applicable in a majority of the cases�the utility-to-riskratio. Nobody has investigated the fantastic possibilities thatLSD brings out, so that the utility could be very, very high,which would balance off, to some extent, the risks. And there'sone other orientation in this symposium that bothers me, whichI think bothered the writer of the recent letter in our collegepaper, which is the very scientific cast of the symposium speakers.And I would be the last one to go against science, because it'sproved to be very, very successful; but it is strange that thereare no artists involved in this, no philosophers, no theologians. The moderator: Dr. Pahnke does have a degree in religion,I am informed. Same member of the audience: All right, but at least, say,somebody artistic, who would use this in support of his art. Thishasn't really been brought out. Mr. Barron said that the responseto this explosion of knowledge and ideas prompts the response�and McLuhan might be relevant here�to try other types ofintegrating knowledge and intellect in these things. I think LSDmight be useful in exploring these areas. This has not been broughtout, though it goes right to the thing of the tremendous utilityof LSD. So I was wondering if the government and Dr. Louria hadconsidered the possible utility that might balance off some ofthe risk? Maybe this isn't a very practical question either, aswe know that there are a lot of artists who are racked by opiumand other drugs who do produce very profound and good poetry.You know, it's hard to tell whether it is worth it or not. Butthere are laws restricting the use of LSD, and we could be losinga lot. I don't think that this problem has been addressed. The moderator: The member of the audience has asked ifwe have paid enough attention to the possibility that LSD hasa high utility, which, if legislated against, would be lost tothe culture. Mr. Chayet: On the question of utility and risk, I thinkthat this is a very realistic suggestion, and I would like tosay that the law of the country is based very much on utilityand risk. What the Supreme Court of the United States says inits earth-shaking decisions, which are often five to four�fivejurists thinking one way and four equally learned jurists thinkingthe other way�is based on a careful balancing of what they thinkis useful and what they think is the social necessity. The examplewas brought up today of the automobile�there's a terrific amountof carnage, but we allow it; we don't outlaw it, because of itsutility. Now everybody who drives an automobile gets somewhere,and if you could show me that everybody who takes LSD gets somewherethat is useful in a constructive sense, then I would say let'sget rid of the laws. Let's allow it. But if you have one personwho takes it and really gets somewhere and many hundreds who getnowhere and who go out windows, then I say there's a real question.While I think that your suggestion is a good one, I just don'tthink that we have reached the point where there is the utility-to-riskratio that would allow change in legislation. Member of the audience: You were all here when Dr. Kurlandread his case studies, and you also heard Dr. Pahnke's case studies.It seems to me that one thing that all these people had in common�andthey admitted it�was that they were all dead before they tookthe drug, dead in some sense. These drugs were given to somebody�thattwenty-three-year-old girl with the illegitimate child, the Negrowho was a drinker�and gave them something very real. And this,this introducing of pleasure, just because they and you are supposedto wait for the other� what I really want to say is that itwould be a tragedy to wait until seventy years of age, wait fiftyyears, until science comes up with some kind of result, then takethe drugs and find out, by God, I've been missing it all along. The moderator: As I understand the member of the audience,he has suggested that the protocols presented from the patientsindicated a gain in personal phenomenological experience, andthe member of the audience felt that if one waited until he wasa seventy-year-old person without having had those experiences,it would be a great loss. I shall ask Dr. Kurland to speak tothis, if he will. Dr. Kurland: The issue here is one of�one of the issues,anyway, is, in plain English, impatience. Nobody will realizethe impatience and frustrations of the researchers who are activelyinvolved in something like this, who see all the possibilities,yet are aware that society demands that they be responsible tothe public trust. Many times we have the very, very frustratingbusiness of going into our proposals and looking for advance research,and then having our peers turn the proposals down, because theysay that there is something missing in the specifications, thatis, the plans are not well done. So we go back to the drawingboard again and again. We don't get everything we ask for. Oneof the things that we have learned is that our peers sitting inthe committees that make judgments have not been wrong most ofthe time. Most of the time we've been wrong if they haven't approvedof something. We have gone back and redesigned our plans so thatthey can meet the objections, and we have been able to go ahead.For example, when you are dealing with human life and have theresponsibility of working in an unknown area, you have to takeevery precaution to make sure that you are doing everything tomake things work out properly. We feel that it is the most importantrule in these areas to document what we are doing, so that theway will be clear for the next men to follow through. If our researchcan't be replicated in Russia or in Australia or in South America,it means that we have not done the job right. We see things inour work that we would like to measure. What we realize is thatit may take six months or a year to set up a program so it canbe done with safety and consideration for all the elements involved.You can't rush good research. Good research takes a long time,and that is why there are few places that we are able to get thekind of balance needed. For example, with alcoholics, we startedin 1960, really 1958, and began following these people. So, wehad opportunities of comparing and maintaining balance. But ina behavioral science, when one works with men, when one dealswith such complex issues, when one is taking psychotherapy andadding research to it�and you heard how complex this job is�totry to accomplish something, it is frustrating that some feelthat they can rush in and get the answers. Maybe we'll have perfectedtechniques in ten, twenty, thirty years from now. We have computerstoday, which we didn't have several years ago, and some of ourpresent experiments are not even possible without computers. Dr. Pahnke: I detect in both the last two questions a feelingthat the panel here has not really taken seriously the possibilitiesof the drugs, positive possibilities for enriching lives. Suchwas not the intent of my remarks. I take these possibilities veryseriously. I think that there is promise in the experiments, butI do not think that we know enough yet to make statements. Weneed more research in these very areas, research to determinethe utility, but such research and planning for it will take time. Member of the audience: Generally, I think, everyone herewould really have to agree with Dr. Louria's position that scientistsare trying to help in understanding these problems as well asin control and prevention of abuse. But let me suggest two othercomplications; and maybe Dr. Louria or someone on the panel willcomment on these. One is that people are obviously continuingto use LSD, the so-called lay people, some of whom do know howto use this drug and have knowledge of therapy. It seems to bea fact. Why do people do this as often as they do? I think thatthere must be some utility here, and it just can't be dismissedout of hand if enough people are taking it. Too, I think thatDr. Louria's position on the measures that need to be taken tocontrol this drug in the colleges could produce a number of problemsthat might, in themselves, prove worse than the problem of cure.Fortunately, there are times when the government gets itself intoa position of not being able to take a really utilitarian standand say that the law should stop this problem. We all know thatthis law will create an environment in which these other probabilitiesexist. And so we should not permit this law to stand, in orderto avoid creating this evil environment. The evidence of heroinabuse suggests that there was a bad environment, which might serveas an example, a situation where there is a black market, andpeople in the underworld make a fortune on it by smuggling heroinand starting people off on a terrible habit. So that has to beconsidered. I mean, if you look at this and you look at the answersthat a lot of people are giving to these questions, you realizethat youth is a bit distrustful. I don't think that there is areally considered opinion that exists in, let's say, the visionalpeople nowadays, which allows the use of LSD some respectability,or in their criticism of existing statutes about the use of LSD. The moderator: I think that your comments could be summedup as a plea for more open-mindedness in enacting legislationand in implementing programs. I'm not a member of the medicalprofession, but I think I can say a word or two that will perhapshelp you in understanding the feeling of the medical professionabout things like this. There was once a motion picture in which a man fought againsta dictator in one of the Latin American countries. He fought,and he fought, and he did everything that he could to reject theconcept of help from the establishment, so to speak. Then, accidentally,he became the dictator himself and immediately found himself inpolitical trouble. In what was probably the best punch-line inthe movie, he turns to the cabinet of men whom he has been rejectingand says "Help me! Help me!" I think that that is the feeling that the medical profession has,for in its clinical work they regularly see people who are appealingto them, and they constantly have a feeling of helplessness inthe face of certain of these problems. Therefore, their focustends toward avoidance of these terribly painful situations inwhich they have to deal somehow with situations that they don'tunderstand, nor know what to do about. And I think that you seestrength of expression and a focusing on the negative side. Dr. Kurland: Actually, there are several issues involvedhere. One is that it isn't too difficult to do research in thisarea if you submit a protocol. It's first a question of submittingan experimental design that will be accepted; and the other issueis that of financing. Many studies are accepted, but there justaren't funds available to carry them out. For example, we hadthe experience of this dying-patient study, which had earlierbeen submitted on two occasions, and it had been rejected on twooccasions. If you have studies that you want to pursue, I'm prettysure that if they meet the judgment of your scientific peers,they will be approved. Whether it will be funded is another matter,because there are priorities in these matters. One must be awarethat there are only certain amounts of money available to go intoprograms. We have heard that the funds for LSD research have beendecreasing for various reasons, which may not be relevant to theresearch program itself, but to other factors that have no relationshipto these programs. If you're really interested in something andgo to the extent of submitting it to a scientific body for approval,and if they reject it, there are most probably deficiencies inthat design that should be corrected. This has been our experience.Not everything that we submit is approved. Some are rejected,and we go back to try to work them out. And things that are calledto our attention are rejected. Sometimes we realize that we werebiased in a certain way and that this was a good decision. Inthe LSD area, despite all the restrictions, you still can do researchif you are willing to undertake the effort to have your plan approved.As you heard, the members of the panel are attempting now to workthis thing out. There's a very complex administrative procedurebecause of the unique situation with this compound. When severalagencies are involved, it becomes a very complicated manoeuver.Most of the time the rejected designs were rejected because therewas a lack of some kind in them.

PAHNKE Introduction THIS Spring I received a long distance telephone call fromDean Samuel Miller, who invited me to give this year's IngersollLecture on human immortality. Three days later, Dean Miller wasdead. When I heard the sad news, I, as many of you no doubt,began to think about the way he had influenced me, especiallyduring my theological training here at Harvard Divinity School.One of my most vivid memories was a point which he emphasized inhis class on Religion and Literature. Sam Miller felt stronglythat in our modern 20th century two of the most profound andimportant experiences of human life are becoming more and moreinsulated from everyday existence. These two experiences, birthand death, have the potential for affecting the character andquality of the rest of life. But in each instance, they arefalling victim to modern technological efficiency and adding tothe process of dehumanization rather than counteracting it. How many mothers these days are awake and activelyparticipating when giving birth to their babies? And much morerare, how many fathers even are given the opportunity to bepresent with their wives at the moment of birth? Certainly thereare times when medical emergencies make the presence of thefather an encumbrance and anesthesia to the point ofunconsciousness a necessity for the mother. But from my ownexperience delivering babies as a general practitioner in awilderness community in Alaska, most of the time an alert,participating mother and father make human birth much more thanjust another medical procedure to be mechanically processed. Ihave also been in the role of the father at the birth of my ownthree children. Although I am a physician, it was neverthelessdifficult to find a hospital which would allow me to be presentin the delivery room. But I am tremendously glad that I was.Delivering someone else's baby cannot compare to witnessing thebirth of your own. This event made a profound impact on me inregard to reverence for life. If we turn now to the other end of human life, my experiencehas taught me that a creative emotional impact is possible in theevents surrounding death in spite of the tragedy and sadness.Unfortunately, we have become so "civilized" thatdeath, too, can be robbed of its function in revitalizing andenergizing the rest of life for those still alive. What usually happens in our culture when someone isterminally ill? First of all, the fact of death, althoughuppermost in everyone's mind, is usually avoided. Talk in generalis diversionary, for example, about getting well or aboutsuperficial news in an attempt to prevent any serious discussionof more profound issues. As the dying patient's conditionworsens, he may be subjected to a barrage of heroic treatmentmeasures which many times can prolong physical life, but alsomake meaningful interpersonal contact difficult or impossible.The patient is rarely given a chance to express his feelingsabout how or where he would like to die, e.g., at home or in thehospital. How could he, when the whole issue of death is somehowavoided? Then, as the moment of death approaches and the patientis put on the danger list, family members can stay with himoutside of usual visiting hours, but many times this is subtlydiscouraged because it can interfere with hospital routine.Sometimes frantic last minute efforts to "revive" thepatient are carried out behind drawn white curtains with thefamily excluded. When death finally and inevitably comes, whetherat home or in the hospital, the body is quickly removed by theundertaker, who then proceeds to make the corpse look "aslifelike" as possible. Our costly and elaborate funeralprocedures seem intent on disguising the fact of death andsomehow insulating the survivors from its impact. In contrast, consider what happened in other days before oursociety became so removed from these primary experiences of birthand death. Most babies were born and most people died in theirown homes. In the case of death, this meant the preparation ofthe body for burial—the tasks of bathing, dressing, andgrooming—was done by members of the family. Thispsychological experience was inescapable and profound. Although Ibelieve that a return to more participation in the process ofbirth is important and can be done in the desirable safety of ahospital setting, I am not suggesting that the elimination ofmorticians is either desirable or necessary. But perhaps moreattention to the events preceding and surrounding the moment ofdeath would add dignity and meaning to this potentially powerfulexperience. The Situation of the Terminal Cancer Patient I do not know how many of you here today have had a primaryexposure to someone whom you knew well and intimately who wasdying of cancer, but at best this is a grim situation. What do weusually find happening? In my work with such patients I havebecome keenly aware of the fear, depression, anxiety, loneliness,and suffering which are usually present. There is a certain degree of underlying fear on the part ofeveryone involved—not only the patient himself, but also hisfamily and friends, the nurses, and even the doctors. This fearmanifests itself in many ways, both consciously andunconsciously, and is basically a fear of the unknown. No matterhow much we have been told about death, its implications forlife, or what might follow afterwards, down deep we all know thatsome day each one of us must face this experience as anindividual at the end of his own life. This is a very personalthing, and one that can stir deep emotions in any person who isinvolved even as an observer. Thus, it is not surprising thatfrequently in this situation the fear is expressed by anavoidance of the issue in many ways, some subtle and some not sosubtle. There is hesitation to tell the dying person the gravityof the condition, especially if his diagnosis is cancer. Doctorsmany times advise the distraught family not to tell. Theimplication is that the patient psychologically could not takesuch ominous news and would disintegrate under the stress. Acommon rationalization is that hope would be taken away and thepatient plunged into a deep depression. The assumption is madefor the patient that if he knew the truth, a bad situation wouldautomatically be made worse. By this line of reasoning, any showof powerful emotions, even though genuine, is to be avoided atall costs because the patient cannot take it. But what the familyreally means is that they themselves are afraid to face the factof death. Undoubtedly, such a course of action, though admittedlydishonest, seems justified by the situation "for thepatient's own good" and is many times the easiest thing todo at first. The patient's direct questions, if any, are parriedwith cheerful reassurance or adroitly avoided by changing thesubject or avowing ignorance. Nurses can do the same or, ifcornered, can refer the patient to his doctor, who can fill thetime spent with the patient during medical rounds with questionsabout details of bowel function, appetite, and pain control. But what does the patient think and feel about thesehappenings? At first he may believe everything he is told,especially because it is what he would like to think, but as hiscondition worsens into a progressively downhill course, he mayrealize more and more that something more serious is occurring.In spite of the natural defense of denial, which can sustain somepatients for a while, he will begin to wonder if he is being toldthe truth. If the pretense is continued, and sometimes at thispoint it is even intensified, the patient will be getting apowerful nonverbal message to avoid the issue. The fears of thefamily will also be communicated and will reinforce the patient'sown private anxiety. Picking up the emotional turmoil of thefamily in spite of attempts to hide it, the patient wonders whatthey really know, but out of concern for them chooses not tobring up issues which they are obviously avoiding. Each side thenattempts the heroic posture of protecting the other from what isimagined to be too difficult to bear. The more this dishonesty is perpetuated, the more difficultit is to face the issues, and the more desperate the situationbecomes. Family members wonder what the patient will think ofthem if he finally finds out that such vital information has beenwithheld. It is almost as if the participants really believedthat not talking about something unpleasant would make itmagically disappear. Perhaps the most devastating effect of such deception, evenwhen done with the honest intention of trying to make thepatient's burden lighter, is to increase the patient'spsychological isolation. At the very time when the welfare andsupport of those closest to him could help him the most he feelscut off at a basic level because his trust is undermined. Hecannot even talk about the things which concern him deeply. Inactuality the emotional pressure is increased for both patientand family at this deadly game of pretense is played out. It is no wonder that under such circumstances most patientsbecome depressed. With cancer patients the usual downhill coursealso involves an increase in pain and suffering. When this istreated with increasing doses of narcotic pain-killing drugs,there is increased clouding of consciousness. Aldous Huxley inhis last novel, Island, describes the all too commonsituation for the dying cancer patient as increasing pain,increasing anxiety, increasing morphine, increasing addiction,increasing demandingness, with the ultimate disintegration ofpersonality and loss of the opportunity to die with dignity. (1) To this list Iwould add psychological isolation, withdrawal, and depression. The LSD research in which I have engaged for the last fewyears has been an attempt to alter this dehumanization in thecourse of events prior to death. How, you may ask, can the use ofLSD, a powerful and sometimes dangerous psychoactive drug, be ofany value to a person who may soon be dead? Don't these poorpatients have enough drugs already—anti-cancer medicines,pain-killing narcotics, tranquilizers, and anti-depressants, tomention only a few? Review of Some Basic Facts About LSD and Psychedelic Experiences In order to discuss these questions in perspective, thepsychological phenomena which can occur when LSD is administeredto human beings needs to be kept in mind. Five kinds of potentialpsychedelic experiences have been described in detail withexamples elsewhere. (2,3)Let me briefly review these. First is the psychotic psychedelic experiencecharacterized by the intense negative experience of fear to thepoint of panic, paranoid delusions of suspicion or grandeur,total confusion, impairment of abstract reasoning, remorse,depression, isolation, and/or somatic discomfort; all of thesecan be of very powerful magnitude. Second is the pschodynamic psychedelic experiencecharacterized by a dramatic emergence into consciousness ofmaterial that has previously been unconscious or preconscious.Abreaction and catharsis are elements of what subjectively isexperienced as an actual reliving of incidents from the past or asymbolic portrayal of important conflicts. Third is the cognitive psychedelic experience,characterized by astonishing lucid thought. Problems can be seenfrom a novel perspective, and the inner relationships of manylevels or dimensions can be seen all at once. The creativeexperience may have something in common with this kind ofpsychedelic experience, but such a possibility must await theresults of future investigation. Fourth is the aesthetic psychedelic experience,characterized by a change and intensification of all sensorymodalities. Fascinating changes in sensations and perception canoccur: synesthesia in which sounds can be "seen,"objects such as flowers or stones that appear to pulsate andbecome "alive," ordinary things that seem imbued withgreat beauty, music that takes on an incredible emotional power,and visions of beautiful colors, intricate geometric patterns,architectural forms, landscapes, and almost anything imaginable. The fifth and last type of psychedelic experience mayultimately prove to be the most valuable and is the focus inregard to treatment of the dying patient. This experience hasbeen called by various names: psychedelic-peak; cosmic,transcendental, or mystical. Nine universalpsychological characteristics were derived from a study of theliterature of spontaneous mystical experience reported throughoutworld history from almost all cultures and religions. Whensubjected to a scientific experiment, these characteristicsproved to be identical for spontaneous and psychedelic mysticalexperiences. (4,5) 1. Unity is a sense of cosmic oneness achieved throughpositive ego transcendence. Although the usual sense of identity,or ego, fades away, consciousness and memory are not lost;instead, the person becomes very much aware of being part of adimension much vaster and greater than himself. In addition tothe route of the "inner world" where external senseimpressions are left behind, unity can also be experiencedthrough the external world, so that a person reports that hefeels a part of everything that is (for example, objects, otherpeople, or the universe), or more simply, that "all isOne." 2. Transcendence of Time and Space means that thesubject feels beyond past, present, and future, and beyondordinary three-dimension space in a realm of eternity orinfinity. 3. Deeply Felt Positive Mood contains the elements ofjoy, blessedness, peace and love to an overwhelming degree ofintensity, often accompanied by tears. 4. Sense of Sacredness is a nonrational, intuitive,hushed, palpitant response of awe and wonder in the presence ofinspiring Reality. The main elements are awe, humility, andreverence, but the terms of traditional theology or religion neednot necessarily be used in the description. 5. The Noetic Quality, as named by William James, (6) is a feeling ofinsight or illumination that, on an intuitive, nonrational leveland with a tremendous force of certainty, subjectively has thestatus of Ultimate Reality. This knowledge is not an increase offacts but is a gain in psychological, philosophical, ortheological insight. 6. Paradoxicality refers to the logical contradictionsthat become apparent if descriptions are strictly analyzed. Aperson may realize that he is experiencing, for example, an"identity of opposites," yet it seems to make sense atthe time, and also afterwards. 7. Alleged ineffability means that the experience isfelt to be beyond words, non-verbal, and impossible to describe;yet most persons who insist on the ineffability do in fact makeelaborate attempts to communicate the experience. 8. Transiency means that the psychedelic peak does notlast in its full intensity, but instead passes into an afterglowand remains only as a memory. 9. Persisting Positive Changes in Attitudes and Behaviorare toward self, others, life, and the experience itself. All the research I have done with psychedelic drugs for thepast six years supports the hypothesis that the kind ofexperience is strongly dependent upon the necessary drug dosage,but only as a trigger or facilitating agent, and upon the crucialextra-drug variables of set and setting. Psychological set refersto factors within the subject, such as personality, life history,expectation, preparation, mood prior to the session, and, perhapsmost important of all the ability to trust, to let go, and to beopen to whatever comes. The setting refers to factors outside theindividual, such as the physical environment in which the drug istaken, the psychological and emotional atmosphere to which thesubject is exposed, how he is treated by those around him, andwhat the experimenter expects the drug reaction will be. Elements of all these kinds of psychedelic experiences mayappear in any one psychedelic session, but the psychedelicmystical experience is the most rare, being achieved by only 25to 50 per cent of subjects, even under the most optimalconditions of set and setting. The more control that is gainedover these variables, the more predictable is the chance ofobtaining the psychedelic mystical experience, but it is by nomeans automatic. Yet when such an event is experienced and thenadequately integrated, it can provide the fulcrum fortransformations of attitude and behavior. The Procedure of Psychedelic Psychotherapy in our Current Research with the Dying Patient At the Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. we have beenassessing the impact of psychedelic psychotherapy utilizing LSD,in the management of terminal cancer patients. (7) An LSD session is imbedded within thematrix of brief intensive psychotherapy. Every effort is made tomaximize the possibility for the psychedelic mystical experienceto occur. After a patient is referred for the special treatment, he isscreened both by psychiatric interviews and by psychologicaltests. Then an informed consent is obtained in writing from boththe patient and his closest relative. By informed consent, I meanthat the nature and aim of the research are explained, includingthe possible risks and benefits. Because of the sensationalism inthe mass media about the dangers of LSD, most patients do notsuffer from lack of information about risks. In fact, theirexaggerated ideas make a positive preparation more difficult, andsome patients who might benefit greatly refuse to participate inthe research because of fear. Most patients are surprised tolearn that the safety record of LSD when given by trainedpersonnel under medically controlled conditions is comparable tothat of other commonly used psychiatric procedures. (8) Patients are told that LSD will not cure their physicalillness, hut may give them more emotional strength to cope withwhat lies ahead. Usually control of pain is one of the presentingproblems. Although most of our patients have some degree ofphysical pain, we try to emphasize that the analgesic effect ofLSD cannot he guaranteed and is not the main reason for thetreatment. After consent is obtained, preparation for the LSD sessionbegins in the form of intensive individual psychotherapy for 8 to10 hours. The aim is to get to know the person in as much depthas possible by reviewing his life story and his important pastand current interpersonal relationships. Into this discussioninevitably come his philosophy of life, religious experiences,and hopes for the future. No attempt is made to force adiscussion of diagnosis or prognosis: but any indication of adesire to explore these areas is sensitively dealt with in a wayappropriate to each individual. Above all the development of deeprapport and trust is essential before LSD can he safely given. Family members, too, are drawn into the therapy bothindividually and in groups, with and without the patient. Some ofthe issues discussed are positive and negative feelings, thequality of interpersonal relationships, communication with thepatient, fear of death, and concern about the future. Theirquestions and fears about LSD also must be aired. Finally, after days of preparations when the patient isdeemed ready, LSD is administered in a private hospital room,decorated with flowers and objects which have meaning for thepatient. The therapist who has worked with the patient and atrained psychiatric nurse are in constant attendance throughoutthe 10 - to 12-hour session. For most of the day, the patientlistens to classical music through stereophonic high fidelityearphones. The purpose of the music is to help him let go of hisusual ego controls and experience the unusual emotional awarenesswhich is possible under these conditions of altered brainphysiology. In the evening, when the LSD effects have waned, the closestfamily members visit the patient. These times can be anopportunity for a gratifying emotional interchange. In the daysafter the session, the patient is helped to integrate newexperiences, feelings, and insights. Results of our Research With this procedure thus far, we have treated only 17patients in a pilot study with no control group. (9) While not much weight can be given toour tentative findings in any scientific sense some results canbe mentioned to stimulate our thinking in regard to our subjecthere today—man's approach to death and what may lie beyond. Bearing in mind the inconclusiveness of our impressions, whathave we seen following the combined procedure of LSD plusassociated psychotherapy when measured against the situationencountered at the beginning of treatment? First, no patientsseemed to have been harmed, even those who were physically quiteill. In general, about one-third of the patients were notparticularly helped, one-third w ere helped somewhat, andone-third were helped dramatically. Let us look at the direction of the change, especially inthose patients who were helped the most. The LSD session seemedto provide the focus around which a new situation could evolve inthe milieu provided by the psychotherapy. The most dramaticeffects came in the wake of psychedelic mystical experience.There was a decrease in fear, anxiety, worry, and depression.Sometimes the need for pain medications was lessened, but mainlybecause the patient was able to tolerate what pain he had moreeasily. There was an increase in serenity, peace, and calmness.Most striking was a decrease in the fear of death. It seem as ifthe mystical experience, by opening the patient to usuallyuntapped ranges of human consciousness, can provide a sense ofsecurity that transcends even death. Once the patient is able torelease all the psychic energy which he has tied to the fear ofdeath and worry about the future, he seems able to live moremeaningfully in the present. He can turn his attention to thethings which have the most significance in the here and now. Thischange of attitude has an effect on all the people around him.The depth and intensity of interpersonal closeness can beincreased so that honesty and courage emerge in a jointconfrontation and acceptance of the total situation. Let me illustrate some of the things I have seen bydescribing an actual case. A 49-year- old woman with inoperablecancer of the pancreas was brought to the hospital by her husbandand daughter when they could no longer tolerate her increasingagony because of the intractable pain that was not satisfactorilycontrolled by narcotic drugs. At this point, she was more like awhimpering animal than a human being. In my work with the familyit soon became apparent that they were not only at the end oftheir rope in regard to physical management of the patient butwere becoming increasingly concerned lest the patient discoverthe true nature of her "tumor" and become even moredepressed than she already was. After I had gained hisconfidence, the husband one day asked me directly if I did notthink that "mercy killing" was the most humane solutionin such cases. After the usual period of screening and preparation, thepatient was given an LSD session that was filled with religioussymbolism and during which the patient reviewed many events ofher life. During part of the day the patient strongly felt thepresence of God and, through this experience, a sense of releasefrom guilt feelings about certain of her past actions. Althoughthe patient did not have a complete psychedelic mysticalexperience, she carried a definite degree of psychedelicafterglow into the evening fleeting with her family. Her mood wasbrighter, and they noticed increased relaxation and peace ofmind. Her pain although still present, was controlled withnarcotic drugs and did not have the same disabling quality asbefore admission to the hospital. A few days after her LSD session, as I was sitting by herbedside, the patient asked me directly, "Doctor, I have beenwondering what really is the matter with me. Do I havecancer?" In this particular case the patient's personalphysician had advised me that neither he nor the family had feltit wise to discuss the diagnosis. I asked the patient if she haddiscussed the matter with her doctor. "I have triedto," she said, "but everyone avoids my questions. Ithink I do have cancer, because if I didn't they would say sodirectly." I then proceeded to explore with the patient themeaning of such a diagnosis for her if it were, indeed true.Discussing the question posed in this half-hypothetical manner,the patient indicated that if she did have cancer, she would haveto learn to live with it and accept it as a fact of her life. Atthat very moment we heard the voice of the patient's physician inthe hallway. The patient asked me to get him. After I had advisedhim of the nature of the preceding discussion, we entered theroom together. Without too much hesitation, the patient posed forhim the same question she had asked me, "Is this tumor thatI have a cancer?" He answered, "Well, it'scancerous." "But is it a cancer?" she insistentlyasked. When he indicated that it was, she gave a sigh and said:"Well, it's a relief to know what I really have, even thoughit isn't good news." Then she asked with some concern:"Do my family know and have they known all along?" Henodded, and she sank back on the bed half in amusement and halfin disgust, saying, "And they wouldn't even tell me." In talking with the husband and daughter that afternoon, Iinformed them what had happened. The news upset them even whenthey learned that the patient had taken it calmly. They feltunmasked and wondered how they could face the patient. They couldnot quite believe that she could have accepted it so well andfelt that there would be an emotional "scene." Afterdiscussing their feeling about the issue, I suggested that we goand see the patient together. As we neared the room, the daughterbecame visibly upset and at the doorway refused to go in. Aftermore discussion she reluctantly agreed, and we entered the roomtogether. As soon as the patient saw her husband, she smiled and said:"Well, I guess you know now that I'm going to die."With this the husband broke down and began to sob uncontrollably.The patient stretched out her arms inviting him to come to herbedside. She took him in her arms and consoled him,explaining that we all have to die sometime, that she wasgrateful for what life had given her, and that she was sure theywould all get through this together. A sense of relief andintense interpersonal closeness pervaded the room. Before the patient left the hospital she had a second LSDsession. This time one of the major concerns that she exploredwas the way she would explain to her young grandchildren what washappening to her and what the ultimate outcome would be. This wasan issue which the daughter had also discussed with me. Shewondered whether she should even let the children see theirgrandmother, who was becoming progressively emaciated. During theLSD session the patient had a vision of all her grandchildrenstanding by her beside. She had a very intense experience ofpositive emotional feelings of love which she had for thesechildren and yet was able to come to a resolution of what shecould share with them in the days ahead. After discharge from the hospital, the patient's husband anddaughter were able to care for her satisfactorily at home duringthe month before she died. Her pain was now adequately controlledwith the aid of narcotics, but the daughter remarked on how muchbetter her mother seemed to be able to bear the pain thanpreviously. The patient was able to see her grandchildren forsome time each day, and they understood what was happening as shegot progressively weaker. They took this opportunity to discusswith her some of their own questions about death, andparticularly her own death. Discussion At this point let us turn our attention to the question ofwhy the psychedelic mystical experience seems to help thesepatients. I suggest that this experience has the potential foropening up the channels of positive feeling which may have beenpreviously closed or clogged. Our experiments have indicated thatdeep within every human being there are vast usually untappedresources of love, joy, and peace. One aspect of the psychedelicmystical experience is a release of these positive feelings withsubsequent decrease in negative feelings of depression, despair,and anxiety. But this shift in mood is not enough to account forour most dramatic finding—loss of the fear of death. Infact, the experience of deeply felt positive mood may be more theresult than the cause of this change in attitude toward death.Our data show that these feelings are released most fully whenthere is complete surrender to the ego-loss experience ofpositive ego transcendence, which is often experienced as amoment of death and rebirth. At this point, unless the patientpreviously had experienced mystical consciousness spontaneously,he becomes intensely aware of completely new dimensions ofexperience which he might never before have imagined possible.From his own personal experience, he now knows that there is moreto the potential range of human consciousness than we ordinarilyrealize. This profound and awe-inspiring insight sometimes isexperienced as if a veil had been lifted and can transformattitude and behavior. Once a person has had this vision, lifeand death can be looked at from a new perspective. Patients seemable to meet the unknown with a new sense of self-confidence andsecurity. Logical arguments that human experience must be limitedto the narrow range of ordinary human consciousness never canhave the same force again. One patient, after his LSD experience,wondered how he could have been so worried about death, which nowseemed to be just another step in the life process. Othersfrankly and calmly stated that they would be "ready togo" when the time to die came. This degree of acceptance andwillingness to face the unknown ahead was in strong contrast tothe atmosphere of fear among the family and patient beforepsychedelic psychotherapy was started. Before discussing the relevance of the psychedelic mysticalexperience to immortality it would be well to review what WilliamJames said in his Ingersoll Lecture 70 years ago. (10) In his view thebrain is a filter of consciousness which transmits part of theVaster Consciousness of Reality, like a partially opaque glassallowing through a few rays of a super solar blaze. The"degree of opacity" or threshold of brain activity canvary so that under certain conditions "more light" oran awareness of a wider and more intense range of consciousnessis possible. According to this hypothesis, the physical brain isnecessary only as a means to transmit a part of this LargerConsciousness into the dimension of ordinary reality perceived byindividual normal waking consciousness. If an individual brain isdamaged, disintegrates, or dies, this Larger Consciousness doesnot cease. The interesting thing is that our LSD patients who have hadthe psychedelic mystical experience and who previously knewnothing of this transmission theory are supplying data whichprecisely fit this hypothesis. Their threshold seems to belowered so that they directly experience this VasterConsciousness in an Eternal Now, beyond time and space. Again andagain we are told that this experience subjectively occurs"out of the body." But what is the relationship of individual self-consciousnessof the abiding presence of this Vaster Consciousness? WilliamJames did not settle this question nor can I, but again thepsychedelic mystical experience may provide some clues. Duringthe mystical experience when the experiencer has lostindividuality and become a part of a Reality Greater-than-self,paradoxically, something of the self remains to record theexperience in memory. One of the greatest fears about human deathis that personal individual existence and memory will be goneforever. Yet having passed through psychological ego death in themystical experience, a person still preserves enoughself-consciousness so that at least part of individual memory isnot lost. In comparison, the loss of other attributes ofindividuality such as bodily sensations and personal egoaccomplishments do not appear too important. It is at leastsuggestive that persons experiencing mystical consciousness donot feel that they have "lost" anything crucial—infact, a common report is that they have "come home" andregained proper perspective. By now I hope it is clear that LSD used in conjunction withpsychedelic psychotherapy is not another chemo-therapeutic methodto achieve a euphoric death, such as increasing doses ofpainkillers which have a dulling effect on consciousness. Withsuch narcotics an escape is provided from harsh and painfulreality, but such cherished human experiences as love andinterpersonal closeness are not particularly enhanced. If thefear surrounding death is dealt with at all, it is by sedatingthe patient so much that he may be unaware of what is reallyhappening. In contrast, when LSD is judiciously used, the mind becomesmore active and alert. Problems concerning death can be dealtwith rather than escaped from. Positive emotions can be releasedin the service of deepened interpersonal relationships. Animportant distinction is that LSD is not used on a continuingbasis. The purpose is not to keep the patient continuously underthe effect of LSD. One treatment is sometimes enough to make alasting difference. Even repeated treatments are spaced to allowtime for meaningful integration of the experience. Our data thusfar have indicated that the earlier LSD is given in the course ofthe disease, the better chance there is for the patient toutilize any insights gained. Although the treatment may prepare apatient for death, the quality of living in the days before deathcan be also affected. Let me illustrate: one of our patients with metastatic breastcancer had a son in his early twenties. His first bitter reactionwhen the possibility of LSD treatment was mentioned was,"What do you want to do, make my mother die with a smile onher face?" Much to his surprise, the most important effectof the treatment was to establish their somewhat rupturedrelationship on a new creative level. Now, five months after heronly treatment, this patient is still working on the implicationsof this positive change in her family situation . Does this treatment threaten to manipulate the human mind inan unethical and dehumanizing manner? If by manipulation we meanthat human begins are used for purposes to which they neitherconsent nor understand, the answer is no. Just the opposite istrue. The goal is to help the patient become more fully human andable to use the last days of his life in a meaningful way—infact, a way which highlights the very things most basic andimportant: human love, sharing, closeness, and thoughtfulreflection about the meaning and events of human life. As one ofour patients put it: "You get a clear picture of what isimportant and what isn't. All the rushing around and the worryabout keeping my house neat was so unimportant compared to theexpression of feelings toward my family. I now fully realize thatthe core of life is love." In an ethical consideration of any new experimentalprocedure, the proportionate degree of risk compared to thepotential benefit must be considered. From what we have seen inour research so far, the benefits in human terms have beenimpressive, the risks minimal. The danger of LSD depends on howit is used. As Dr. Albert Kurland, who is responsible for all theLSD projects at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, hasindicated, the role of LSD in therapy is like that of a scalpelin surgical intervention: the scalpel is helpful, but without theskilled surgeon it is merely a dangerous instrument. (11) One consequence of the mystical experience is the inevitableattempt to make intellectual sense of it. The primarypsychological experience must be interpreted. While some personsuse such symbols as a More, a Beyond, or the Ground of Being,other speak of the presence of God as the most adequatereflection of what was encountered. The fact that this experiencewas triggered or facilitated with a drug may cause some to feeluneasy. The troublesome implication seems to be that God can thusbe controlled, limited, or manipulated. Yet the psychedelicmystical experience is by no means automatic, and there are manyunexplained factors. All chemical substances, including LSD, arepart of God's creation. Man, of course, has the freedom to misuseor abuse them, but the use of LSD to give comfort to the dyingpatient hardly seems an abuse. For man to decide that God cannotwork through any part of his creation would be to limit thefreedom and omnipotence of God. (12) That such profound experiences are possible with the aid of adrug may seem on first impression to be an easy and somewhatsacrilegious means of "instant salvation." On thecontrary, much intensive preparation is needed for thepsychedelic mystical experience to occur at all. Then, perhapseven more importantly, the work of follow-up integration isnecessary for the experience to be therapeutically useful ratherthan only a pleasant memory. Yet, subjectively, there is also aprofound feeling of gratitude because such an experience seemsundeserved. The concept of gratuitous grace as another example ofGod's freedom is appropriate here. The mystical experience itself by emphasizing an immediateperception of the Divine dimension has historically metopposition from the church. Mysticism has also always beenaccused of pantheism. Yet the indwelling of the Spirit is asdeeply rooted in Christian tradition as the absolutetranscendence of God. Implications What implications would there be if further researchsubstantiates the promise that psychedelic psychotherapy hasshown in the treatment of the dying patient? In my own work Ihave welcomed the collaboration of religious professionals, partof whose job is ministering to the dying. In our modern age thistask has become increasingly difficult because of the growingdissatisfaction with traditional formulations and beliefs. Thepsychedelic mystical experience has the potential for opening upnew ways of thinking and feeling. Patients are eager to discussthe meaning of these new insights, many of which are imbedded inreligious symbolism. Ministers, priests, and rabbis, if they havesome understanding of the use of psychedelic drugs, can be oftremendous help in integrating these experiences. In the future it might be possible to establish centers wheredying patients could be sent to have a psychedelic experience inthe most optimal setting. The staff of such a place would includepsychiatrists, psychologists, and religious professionals. Thissuggestion is not as utopian as it might sound. Dr. CecilySaunders in England has already pioneered a successful centerwhere medical treatment is given to keep dying patients ascomfortable as possible in their last days. (13) LSD has not been tried there, butadequate doses of alcohol and heroin are used to combatdepression and pain. Our preliminary results suggest thatpsychedelic drugs might accomplish much more. Certainly thishypothesis can be tested experimentally . If the use of psychedelic psychotherapy for the dying patientever should become widespread in our society, there wouldprobably be a change in our whole approach toward death. Theremight be less fear and more acceptance of this part of the lifeprocess. Certainly more honesty and less pretense would be ahealthy change for our culture. Conclusion Although the question of human immortality may always remaina tantalizing enigma. the psychedelic mystical experience atleast teaches that there is more to the range of humanconsciousness than we might ordinarily assume. Because the answercannot be definitely proved either way, there is certainly nocause for pessimistic despair. Perhaps it is not so unfortunatethat each person must ultimately find out for himself. Thepsychedelic mystical experience can prepare one to face thatmoment with a sense of open adventure. FOOTNOTES 1 Aldous HUXLEY, Island (NewYork: Harper & Row 1962) . (back) 2 WALTER N.

(back) 8 In the several large-scale researchprojects which have been approved by the U.S. Government in thelast few years, permanent adverse effects have been quite rare.At the Spring Grove State Hospital, for example, over 300patients have been treated with LSD without a single case oflong-term psychological or physical harm directly attributable tothe treatment, although there have been two transient post-LSDdisturbances which have subsequently responded well toconventional treatment. (back) 9 The fact that there was no controlgroup against which to measure these results immediately raisesthe possibility that our findings were due to powerful suggestionimplemented by the intensive psychotherapy rather than anythingto do with the administration of LSD. It might be argued that aplacebo control group would attain the same results, but otherexperimental evidence concerning the occurrence of psychedelicmystical experience tends to cast some doubt on this argument. Intwo previous series of psychedelic drug experiments that I havehelped to plan and supervise, double blind control groups wereutilized. In each instance the psychedelic mystical experienceoccurred to a statistically significant degree in those personswho received a high dose of psilocybin when compared to controlgroups which had exactly the same preparation, expectation, andsuggestion, but received only a placebo or control substance withactive physiological effects. (W. N. PAHNKE, thesis, op. cit.;and W. N. PAHNKE, LSD and Religious Experience, op. cit.) Consideration of the powerful placebo effect is certainlyimportant. Recent research has demonstrated that giving LSDmainly as a chemotherapy without adequate preparation andsuggestion does not provide any advantage over psychotherapyalone in the treatment of alcoholism. (A LUDWIG, J. LEVINE, andL. STARK, A Clinical Evaluation of LSD Treatment in Alcoholism,Paper presented to the American Psychiatric Association meetingin Boston, Massachusetts, May 15, 1968.) This finding underlines the importance of utilizingsuggestion to the maximum in combination with LSD as has been ourpractice. For example, at the Spring Grove State Hospital inBaltimore, the double blind control study of psychedelic peaktherapy utilizing LSD has demonstrated that one out of fouralcoholics who received 450 micrograms of LSD had a profoundmystical experience compared to one out of ten who received only50 micrograms (total N = 122). Both groups received exactly thesame amount of pre-LSD psychotherapy and identical preparationfor the LSD session. In this particular study the results interms of clinical outcome are not yet completely evaluated, butearly trends in the data show that those patients who had aprofound psychedelic peak experience achieved greater clinicalimprovement. (A. KURLAND, S. UNGER, C. SAVAGE, J. OLSSON, W.PAHNKE, Psychedelic Therapy Utilizing LSD in the Treatment of theAlcoholic Patient: A Progress Report paper presented to theAmerican Psychiatric Association meeting in Boston,Massachusetts, May 15, 1968.) Thus, in the research with cancer patients there is reason tosuppose that the beneficial results observed are not due toeither the psycho-pharmacological effects of LSD or the placeboeffect (suggestion and preparation) alone, but rather acombination of set, setting, and drug. For the best results itseems essential that the placebo effect be utilized to the utmostin conjunction with the psychedelic drug which is then seen to bea necessary, but not sufficient, condition.

(back) 12 Those who have lived fully anddeeply know that suffering can have a redemptive value in termsof personal growth and understanding. Yet in my medicalexperience the slow and tortuous devastation to the human spiritcaused by the usual course of terminal cancer is mostly on thenegative side. Reflecting my bias as a physician dedicated to thealleviation of suffering, I do not feel that this kind ofemotional and physical torment serves much useful purpose. Forthis reason, I feel that the addition of psychedelic drugs to themedical armamentarium against human suffering cannot be objectedto on the grounds that man has no right to interfere with anelement of human life which may serve a useful purpose in God'splan for man's development. Such an argument is too similar tothe theological objections raised against the introduction ofsmallpox vaccination or the invention of rapid transportation.

Vaughan Little controlled research has been done with psychedelics.But my own experience, coupled with my observation of hundreds ofclients, students, and acquaintances who have used LSD in bothcontrolled and uncontrolled settings, has convinced me that wehave much to learn from appropriate investigation of thispowerful mind-altering chemical. The dearth of research has notlessened the impact of psychedelic experiences on people's livesand on the culture at large. Psychology in general has failed tokeep pace with personal explorations in altered states ofconsciousness, many of them induced by LSD or similar psychedelicsubstances. In the past decade, transpersonal psychology has emerged asthat branch of psychology specifically concerned with the studyof human consciousness. It attempts to expand the field ofpsychological inquiry to include such human experiences as thoseinduced by psychedelics, as well as similar states attainedthrough the practice of meditation or other disciplines. As atranspersonal psychologist, I have been particularly interestedin the study of consciousness as it pertains to psychologicalhealth and wellbeing. My clinical practice is devoted tofacilitating human growth and development, often on the borderbetween psychological and spiritual domains . My personal introduction to LSD occurred under optimumconditions. In his book, LSD Psychotherapy,(1) Dr.Stanislav Grof observes that normal people benefit most whenparticipating in a supervised psychedelic program, and that theexperience can move them in the direction of selfactualization.My own experience supports this view. As a subject in early LSDresearch, I was thoroughly screened and well prepared. I had alsohad an opportunity to talk with other subjects who felt they hadbenefited. My first session was a profound and overwhelmingmystical experience. Subsequent sessions seemed less important,but served as reminders of insights gained in the initial one. A most striking feature of my psychedelic experience was thenoetic quality of consciousness as it expanded from its usualperceptual range to a vast contextual awareness that recognizedthe relativity of all perception in space/time. I find the term re-cognizeparticularly appropriate, since the knowledge that was suddenlyrevealed to me under LSD seemed to be remembered rather thanlearned. I was awed by the vast range of consciousness, yet feltthat I was simply uncovering what I had always known, i.e. thetruth which had previously been hidden behind a veil of relativeunconsciousness. As the illusory, changeable nature of ordinaryreality became increasingly clear, I also realized how a normallyconstricted perceptual framework permits one to see only afraction of reality, inevitably distorted to suit personalprojections and presuppositions. During the experience, I felt I understood what mysticsthroughout the ages have claimed to be the universal truth ofexistence. I had an academic background in philosophy andcomparative religion, but I realized that mystical teachings hadnow taken on an added dimension. My perception seemed to haveshifted from a flat, two-dimensional intellectual understandingof the literature, to a three-dimensional sense of immersion inthe mystical reality. The perennial philosophy and the esoteric teachings of alltime suddenly made sense. I understood why spiritual seekers wereinstructed to look within, and the unconscious was revealed to benot just a useful concept, but an infinite reservoir of creativepotential. I felt I had been afforded a glimpse into the natureof reality and the human potential within that reality, togetherwith a direct experience of being myself, free of illusoryidentifications and constrictions of consciousness. Myunderstanding of mystical teachings, both Eastern and Western,Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Sufi alike, took a quantum leap.I became aware of the transcendental unity at the core of all thegreat religions, and understood for the first time the meaning ofecstatic states. I now felt I had had some direct experience of the ineffablerealms of union with God, and I discovered that mydissatisfaction with conventional religion was not due to thedeath of God, as some theologians proclaimed, but rather to theimpoverished concepts of God currently in vogue. Whether onespoke of God, the Void, or the Self, Being, Bliss, orConsciousness, did not matter, for the words were so far removedfrom the experience that they were only fingers pointing to themoon; they bore little resemblance to the depth of realizationthat became available when I let go of my preconceptions aboutthe nature of the universe. As far as I knew, such insights intothe nature of consciousness had only been attained by rareindividuals, many of them advanced practitioners of spiritualdisciplines . The world view that made most sense of this experience wasclearly a mystical one. Neither the subjective nor the objectivepole of experience could encompass the totality. The possibilityof transcending boundaries between self and other, the illusorynature of ego, the interdependence of opposites, the relativenature of dualism and the resolution of paradox in transcendencebecame clear. All mental content was simply the play or the danceof life, and what could be known about consciousness became thefocus of my attention. Psychodynamic material that came intoawareness seemed irrelevant. My own personal drama was no moresignificant than light playing on a movie screen. Even feelingsof joy, ecstasy, and liberation in letting go of attachments wereless important than the insight and sense of knowing, orremembering, inexpressible truth. "Know the truth, and thetruth shall make you free" were the words that seemed bestto capture the nature of my experience. I felt free to be exactlywho I was, free of fear and social constraints, and filled withlove and compassion for all beings. Although many of the insights that flooded my awareness wereforgotten, many remained to influence my life. I felt I could seehow much human suffering is self-imposed, how our beliefs shapeour reality, and what it means to awaken to the realization thatlife is a dream of our own making. The dreamlike quality ofexistence, the unreality of past memories and future fantasies,and the acceptance of the interrelatedness of all things wereinsights subsequently confirmed as I learned more of theperennial teachings of both Eastern and Western contemplativetraditions. I also gained a new appreciation for the Christian teaching offorgiveness. I saw how our own condemnation injures us, and howour difficulty in forgiving ourselves for imagined imperfectionscontributes to neurotic guilt and anxiety. Not only did I feelforgiven for being just as I was, I saw that in reality there wasnothing to forgive. This seemed to remove the obstacles to theexperience of love and I felt an extension of love andforgiveness to all beings everywhere. The subjective nature of time also became starkly apparent. MyNewtonian world view was sufficiently shaken to make itrelatively easy for me to accept some of the more apparentlynonsensical propositions of the new subatomic physics, when theylater came to my attention. Likewise, parapsychological phenomenano longer seemed incomprehensible. The fact that we could notexplain part of our human experience in the existing paradigmseemed to indicate that the paradigm needed re-examination ratherthan to justify dismissal of the evidence. For the first time, I understood the meaning of"ineffable." There seemed to be no possibility ofconveying in words the subjective truth of my experience. A veilhad been lifted from my inner vision, and I felt able to see, notjust images or forms, but the nature of truth itself. The doorsof perception were so cleansed, they seemed to vanish altogether,and there was only infinite being. Krishnamurti'scharacterization of truth as a pathless land seemed anappropriate description of this domain. I felt that I had now experienced the grace of God. Truly Ihad been given a gift of infinite worth. I could understand whyhuman beings throughout history have relentlessly pursued truthand sought enlightenment. I knew now why some felt impelled tosit in caves for years trying to become enlightened, why somewere willing to die for ideals, and why suffering was endured. Ifasceticism was perceived as a means of attaining this state ofoneness, I could understand why a person might choose it. Iunderstood that the essence of my being was identical with thetimeless essence of every living thing, that formlessness was theessence of form, that the whole universe was reflected in everypsyche, and that my separateness was only an illusion, a dreamfrom which I had, in this moment, fully awakened. As I faced old fears and watched the tricks of my mind, Ibecame increasingly aware of my ability to choose my subjectivestate. Consciousness seemed infinitely plastic. I could choose tofocus the lens of attention on anything. Barriers and resistanceshad dissolved, and fears had disappeared along with them. In thatmoment I knew that I had nothing to fear. Only the creations ofmy own mind and my own thoughtforms could threaten me, and Icould see them as if in a lucid dream, parading through the fieldof awareness. I was free to either attend to them or let thempass, choosing instead to experience more fully the bliss of purebeing, just being present to my experience of the moment, with noadded fantasy or distraction. The affective tone of my experience was pure love. After thebarriers dissolved, I could feel the depth of my love for lifeitself, and for my husband and children. They seemed perfect justas they were, yet I did not need them and therefore felt no fearor possessiveness. Life itself was enough. I too, was completeand acceptable just as I was. Old feelings of inadequacy anduncertainty had vanished. My aesthetic sensibilities were profoundly enhanced, not onlyduring the few hours of the session, but afterwards as well. Thiseffect has lasted over a period of 15 years. My appreciation ofmusic, art, nature, and human beings has continued to grow sincethat time. I remember being particularly struck by the joy ofhearing music as I never had heard it before. I could laugh at myold self-image, which included "not being musical. " Iwas deeply moved by each piece of music that was played. As Ilistened without distraction, each one evoked a different aspectof my psyche, and at the center of each was the perfect stillpoint of pure being where one could experience union with God. I gained a new appreciation of my own capacity for choice andthe role of consciousness in creating experience. For the firsttime I saw the possibility of taking responsibility for my ownexperience. I also felt I was truly participating fully in theuniversal human condition. All of my experience, including theexperience of separateness and aloneness, was something I had incommon with all human beings. Although my personal history andthe events of my life were unique, the underlying unity of lifebecame starkly evident. The forms of expression and experiencewere diverse, but the underlying qualities of being wereuniversal. I also felt a reduction in nonspecific anxiety, and a greatlydiminished fear of death. As the illusory nature of many of myworries and fears became apparent, I became more trusting andaccepting of myself, and more willing to enter into unfamiliarsituations and take risks in exploring new creative endeavors. AsI was released from feelings of neurotic guilt and inadequacy, myincreased ability to relax also contributed to enhanced sexualenjoyment. My appreciation of life itself and of the simple tasksof everyday living was also profoundly enhanced. I found myselfmore open in my intimate relationships, and better able to giveand receive love without fear. I also became aware of a desire to be of service in the world,to make some contribution to humanity through my work. At thesame time I felt more able to tolerate paradox and ambiguity. Therecognition of the interdependence of opposites has since becomea useful therapeutic tool in my practice; I often think ofpsychological growth as a balance and synthesis of opposites. Inworking with others to heal internal splits and conflicts,enabling them to take increasing responsibility for their ownlives and wellbeing, I have had many opportunities to appreciatethe importance of this capacity. The effects of this experience seemed to me equivalent to whatI might have expected from several years of insight therapy. Ihad been able to see through and let go of many constrictingpatterns of thought and behavior that previously seemed automaticand beyond conscious control. Some of the far-reaching effectsappeared immediately in my personal life. For several monthsafter this experience I remained in a semi-euphoric state inwhich I experienced being in love all the time. Everything in mylife seemed to be exactly as it was supposed to be. Everythingwas all right. None of the small things I used to get upset aboutseemed to matter any more. I was experiencing a state of innerpeace and serenity that allowed me to cope more effectively witheverything I needed to do, while I felt in touch with a sense ofdivinity within. This period of my life coincided with what seemed to be a timeof new hope for humankind. The flower children in San Franciscowere happily rebelling against the old order, and a better futureseemed within reach. A sense of euphoria was in the air; the moresordid side of psychedelia became apparent only as time went by.My interest in understanding the experience led me to graduateschool to study psychology, but I soon found that Westernpsychological models could not accommodate it. Yet I knew I wasnot unique. Many other people were reporting similar experiences.Eastern consciousness disciplines seemed to offer the best mapsof this inner world, and they also offered instruction forattaining such states without the use of chemicals. Now I couldhear, as if for the first time, the depth of the wisdom in theirteachings and in the mystical doctrines of all ages and allcultures. As I sought for words to express my own ineffableexperience I gained a new appreciation for those individuals whohad attempted to communicate their own insights in writing orart. I also became interested in understanding intuitive ways ofknowing; many years later I wrote a book about the development ofintuition, entitled Awakening Intuition.(2) My intellect was eager to incorporate what I had learned intoworking psychological models. I saw a need to formulate newpsychological theories that could encompass such experiences.Among Western psychologists, only Carl Jung had addressedtranspersonal experiences. He wrote, " . . . The fact isthat the approach to the numinous is the real therapy andinasmuch as you attain to the numinous experience you arereleased from the curse of pathology."(3) That wasapparently true of my experience, but it later became clear thata psychedelic experience in and of itself was not necessarilytherapeutic. The popularity of psychedelics increased greatly,but few of their users achieved the therapeutic benefits I hadexperienced. In his extensive research on LSD psychotherapy, Stanislav Grofnoted that transpersonal experiences occur only rarely in earlysessions of psychedelic therapy, but are quite common in advancedsessions. (1,4) Grof has provided a detailed map of thedeath/rebirth experience which he found to be therapeutic formany of his subjects. The experience of ego-death may beliberating and ecstatic, as it was for me, but it may also beterrifying to a person who is unprepared. However, underappropriate, carefully controlled conditions, a subject may beenabled to surmount the difficulties encountered in letting go oflimiting self-identifications. Phenomenologically, personal accounts of drug-induced mysticalexperiences may be indistinguishable from spontaneously occurringmystical experiences. In either case, the effects may or may notlast. The glimpse of a larger reality that such experienceaffords may change a person's life if he or she chooses tointegrate it. If, however, the experience is repressed, denied,or invalidated, it may only contribute to exacerbatingexistential guilt and anxiety. When a person is not able tostabilize such glimpses into transcendent reality and incorporatethem into existing belief systems, they can certainly disrupt theordinary adjustment of everyday life. Transpersonal psychology (5,6,7) has attempted to formulate aconceptual framework for such experiences, since they obviouslyare not going to go away. Although psychedelics have beenrestricted, the public continues to experiment, and researchcontinues to lag far behind. Moreover, the striking parallelsbetween such experiences and those described by mystics raisemany questions for mental health professionals. In thetranspersonal domain, where psychological and spiritual growthare one, psychedelics appear to be powerful tools for theinvestigation of consciousness; they could enable us to expandour understanding of the human mind and the nature of creativeconsciousness. A willingness to question our assumptions and tokeep an open mind with respect to potential benefits andpotential hazards is essential. For the past 10 years I have been practicing transpersonalpsychotherapy and training therapists to work in this area. Thelack of serious study in the field of psychedelic drugs hasunfortunately restricted their use to uncontrolled personalexperimentation. The dearth of research is clearly a drawbackwhen therapists are so often called upon to handle situationswhere clients have been involved in uncontrolled experimentation.Although many people in our culture have taken psychedelics, fewtherapists are capable of assessing, evaluating, and integratingpsychedelic experiences in a useful way. Psychedelics, like anypowerful tool, may be used skillfully for the benefit ofhumanity, or unskillfully to the detriment of those whoseignorance leads to abuse. As we search for ways of understanding the possibly infiniteresources of human consciousness, I suggest that the potential ofpsychedelics as tools for learning should not be ignored. Today,when the survival of our planet is at stake, there is an urgentneed to work responsibly in every facet of human endeavor. Byrefusing to tread where fools rushed in, we may be turning awayfrom significant learning about human experience and how the mindworks. People of differing views and persuasions must jointogether in exploration of the universals of psychological healthand wellbeing and work to find ways of facilitating experiencesthat foster growth toward wholeness for everyone.

Bakalar, editors copyright Human Sciences Press, 1983 In their letter soliciting contributions to this book, theeditors wrote, "we came to the conclusion that psychedelicdrugs have influenced both the lives of individual users andsociety in general more than is usuallyacknowledged—sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically." I was delighted to receive their invitation, since thesewords almost exactly expressed my own conclusions after 8 yearsof psychiatric clinical and research work. For 5 of those 8 yearsI have worked in areas such as the nature of psychologicalwell-being, non-Western psychologies and religions,consciousness, and the effects of meditation. I have alsoundertaken a personal study of meditative and non- Westerntraditions, and I thus have had the opportunity of meeting,interviewing, and studying with a wide range of people in theserelated disciplines. Whenever I came to know these people closely, the same storywould emerge: that although they rarely acknowledged it inpublic, the psychedelics had played an important role inintroducing them to and facilitating their passage through thesedisciplines. It occurred to me that this might well be a case ofwhat social scientists call "plurality ignorance:" asituation in which each individual thinks he or she is the onlyone doing something, although in fact the practice is widespread.In this case, what seemed to be widely unrecognized was thatlarge numbers of people appear to have derived, at least fromtheir own point of view, significant benefits from psychedelics,despite popular media accounts of their devastating dangers . This suspicion was deepened by an encounter with the editor ofa prominent psychological journal. In an extensive review ofvarious Western and non-Western psychologies, I discussed thedata on psychedelics and concluded that there was evidencesuggesting that in some cases people might find them beneficial.The journal editor was willing to accept the paper provided Iremoved any reference to positive effects of psychedelics; hethought that the journal could not afford to be associated withsuch statements. I am familiar with this particular editor's workand know that he is exceptionally open-minded. It appears that wehave in our culture, even in the scientific and professionalliterature, a bias towards reporting only the negative effects ofpsychedelics. How, then, can we get a picture of the effects of psychedelicswhen they are used for personal exploration and psychologicalgrowth? One approach suggested by Abraham Maslow, but as yetapparently untried in the area of psychedelics, is to ask peoplewho are exceptionally healthy and use them as bioassayers.Maslow's technique was to identify those individuals who seemedto be most fully actualizing their potential; he called themself-actualizers. (1) He listed 13 characteristics, such as adeep involvement in work, peak experiences, and a good sense ofhumor, which identify individuals who have attained exceptionalpsychological well-being. While this approach has manyadvantages, it is not without its drawbacks and limitations. Theconcept and criteria of self-actualization are by no means clear,and they are largely lacking in research data and support;individuals are chosen subjectively, with all the possible biaseswhich that entails. (2) However, in the absence of good empiricaltests of high level well-being, we are left for the present withsubjective judgments. My research has given me the extraordinary gift of meetingsome very remarkable people: mental health professionals,advanced meditators, teachers, gurus, holy people of both Eastand West who have devoted a large part of their lives to mentaltraining and psychological growth. I have spent considerable timewith some of them, interviewing and being interviewed, receivinginstruction on various meditative practices, listening to theirtalks, and socializing. As might be expected, there is a widerange of personalities and psychological maturity. I was able tointerview in depth five of the very healthiest Westerners who fitMaslow's criteria and are also successful and eminent in theirdisciplines. These four men and one woman range in age from theirmid-thirties to their forties. All have university degrees; threeare psychologists, and the other two are highly sophisticatedpsychologically. Four are teachers, either of psychology or ofone of the consciousness disciplines such as meditation orBuddhism. All have strong national reputations, and most haveinternational reputations; all have published at least one book.I included the criterion of professional eminence in order toinsure that the people were competent and would not be dismissedas irresponsible or as dropouts of any sort. Personal Experience Each of these five people has had multiple psychedelicexperiences. For three of them the psychedelic experience wascrucial in arousing their interest in the consciousnessdisciplines and directing their professional careers. A fourthreceived LSD for the first time as part of a legitimate researchexperiment during the sixties, had a deep religious experiencewhich affirmed and deepened previously dormant interests andvalues, and subsequently returned to school to pursue thoseinterests further. All five report that the psychedelics havebeen important in their own growth and that they continue to findthem useful in the context of their own discipline. On theaverage, they continue to use them two to three times per year,but all have gone for extended periods without use. General Principles On the basis of their own personal experiences and what theyhad learned from working with many people involved in variouspsychological and consciousness disciplines, they suggested thefollowing general principles, advantages, and disadvantages ofpsychedelics. All agreed that they are very powerful tools and that theeffects depend very much on the person who uses them and theskill with which they are used. They took it as self-evident thatthere are many people who should not take psychedelics,especially anyone with significant psychological disturbances.However, they agreed that used skillfully by a mature person,they could indeed be helpful. This meant an appropriate setting,at least at the start, preferably under the guidance of someonewho is psychologically mature and psychedelically experienced; anappropriate mental set and expectations, including a precedingperiod of quiet and/or meditation; and most important,involvement in a psychological or consciousness discipline aimedat deep mental training. Possible Benefits The first benefit was the simple recognition that there arerealms of experience, modes of self, and states of consciousnessfar beyond the ken of our day-to-day experience or ourtraditional cultural and psychological models. These experienceswere often said to produce expanded belief systems, making peopleless dogmatic and more open to as yet unexperienced or undreamtrealms of being. One common report was that each experiencetended to elicit a deeper realm and a more expanded sense ofconsciousness and self, so that the previously expanded beliefsystem continued opening and widening. For all five of the subjects mentioned here, and many of theirstudents, psychedelic experience produced a new interest in depthpsychology, religion, spirituality, and consciousness, as well asrelated disciplines and practices such as meditation. All thesubjects believed that their psychedelic experiences had enhancedtheir ability to understand these consciousness disciplines. Inparticular, the esoteric core of the great religious andspiritual traditions could be seen as roadmaps to higher statesof consciousness, and some of the most profound material in thesetraditions became especially clear and meaningful duringpsychedelic sessions. Several of the subjects reported that theyoften put time aside during psychedelic sessions to listen totapes or readings from these traditions; they found theseexperiences particularly important. This is compatible with theEastern claim that "Religion is a learning in which a basicrequirement is 'First change your consciousness'." (3) Most of the subjects felt that the psychedelic experiencecould sometimes supply a guiding vision which provided directionand meaning for one's life thereafter. They mentioned intenseemotions such as love, compassion, or empathy, and therecognition that the mind can be and should be highly trained.Three subjects mentioned another residual benefit. Someone whohas had a deep positive insight may be able to recall thatinsight subsequently and use it to guide himself or herselfthrough a situation where it lends an additional usefulperspective, even though it is no longer directly available. There was unanimous agreement that under appropriateconditions the psychedelics could considerably speed andfacilitate the process of working through psychological blocks.In some cases this involved material which was already beingworked on in an ordinary state of awareness, or could be. Inother cases, material inaccessible in an ordinary state could bebrought into awareness, sometimes producing dramatictransformations including death/rebirth experiences andalleviation of symptoms. Reviews of the therapeutic effects ofpsychedelics have not shown clear-cut results, but of course itis very difficult to detect experimentally significant effects ofa single intervention. For some of the subjects the occasional use of psychedelicsprovided a continuously deepening marker of their progress. Nomatter how much mental training and psychological explorationthey had done, further realms of experience could be revealed bythe psychedelics. With each major advance in their mentaltraining, a new realm would open to them. An especially commonevent was to experience something in a psychedelic drug sessionwhich would recur months or years later in the context of amental training discipline and then spontaneously during dailylife. All five subjects believed that both psychedelics and theirmental disciplines suggested that the range of experiences whichoccurred in daily living represented only a small slice of avast, perhaps unlimited, spectrum. Traps and Complications Although they themselves have had few serious problems withthe psychedelics, all five subjects thought that there were anumber of potential traps and complications. They viewed themajor protection against such difficulties as consisting in acommitment to a mental training discipline and the availabilityof an advanced teacher for consultation about both thepsychedelic experiences and the discipline. Not one of the fivesubjects saw the psychedelics as constituting in and ofthemselves a path which could lead to deep levels ofpsychological-spiritual growth or true enlightenment. Interestingly, the subjects did not see acute painfulreactions, such as anxiety attacks or fear of losing control, asnecessarily adverse. Rather, they held that with appropriateexpectations, previous work, and guidance, such reactions couldlead to deep and valuable insights. This is contrary to thetraditional psychiatric and emergency room perspective which seessuch reactions as purely pathological and requiring medication. Hedonism was mentioned as one of the traps associated withpsychedelics. Using these chemicals for trivial sensorystimulation was seen not as wrong, but as unskillful andunfulfilling. The subjects also noted that it was possible tobecome attached to the more pleasant experiences, marring latersessions by inappropriate expectations and calculated attempts torecreate those experiences. Since psychedelic experiences can be extraordinarily intense,there is some danger of not recognizing a fantasy for what it is.As one subject noted, it is not always easy to discern whichexperiences are valid, especially for people who areintellectually and psychologically sophisticated. Again, the bestremedy was seen as a commitment to open-mindedness, ongoingmental training, and the instruction of an advanced teacher . The same remedy was suggested for the tendency to overestimatethe profundity and long-term impact of insights which may bemistaken for profound awakenings. This tendency was seen asdecreasing with further experience of either the psychedelics ora mental training discipline. It was felt that deep explorationof either would produce many insights, each one adding a smallpiece to the gigantic jigsaw puzzle which is the mind. An inadequate cognitive framework or context was alsomentioned as a limiting factor. Sometimes extremely deep insightsdid occur under psychedelics, and in at least two cases there mayhave been a transient enlightenment experience. In one of thesubjects it produced a prolonged period of confusion and partialdisorientation which in turn led to meditation training. Thissubject experienced a deep level of enlightenment again afterseveral years' practice and this time found the experienceunderstandable and beneficial. One subject thought that the main disadvantage of psychedelicsis the tendency to underestimate one's own role in creating theresultant experiences. People have too little appreciation oftheir own power and see themselves as passive victims of drugeffects rather than as active creators of experience . One trap for people with limited experience, the subjectssaid, is a failure to appreciate the enormous range of potentialexperiences and the tendency to assume that all sessions will belike the first. Many people have made pronouncements about thenature of psychedelic effects after limited exposure andtherefore have failed to appreciate the extent of differencesbetween individuals or between one session and another in thesame individual. According to reports by these subjects, as wellas Stanislav Grof (4,5) and others, repeated exposure produces agradual unfolding and deepening sequence of experiences. Summary Here then are comments on the pros and cons of psychedelicsfrom five of the very healthiest individuals I have met in thecourse of my research and personal investigations of variouspsychological and consciousness disciplines. In each of theseindividuals the psychedelics played an important yet unpublicizedrole in their life orientations and professions. Taken inconjunction with the similar findings which they have noticed intheir students and colleagues, these reports make it clear thatthe psychedelics can sometimes have long-lasting beneficialimpact. While the five subjects discussed here do not seepsychedelics as constituting a pathway in themselves, they do seethem as potential facilitators of development for some peopleengaged in a mental training program or a psychological orconsciousness discipline. The experiences and traps associatedwith psychedelic drugs are not seen as unique but rather asfeatures of any mental training program, although the drugsusually produce them more rapidly and intensely. Needless to say,the capacity to benefit from an accelerated experience depends onthe maturity and skill of the individual; all five subjects tookit as self-evident that psychedelics should not be usedindiscriminately but should be respected as the powerful toolsthey are.

Bakalar copyright Human Sciences Press, 1983. "Thomas B. Roberts is Associate Professor in theDepartment of Learning and Development at Northern IllinoisUniversity. He is coauthor of The Second Centering Bookand Transpersonal Psychology in Education, and has editedthe anthology Four Psychologies Applied to Education:Freudian, Behavioral, Humanistic, Transpersonal." —PsychedelicReflections It didn't make sense. Their speech was clear, their thoughtslogical, and their ideas and descriptions coherent. We werefellow graduate students in a Stanford seminar on the humanpotential. They were describing their first LSD trip, taken theprevious Saturday. And it didn't make sense—to me—then.Like almost everyone else in the late 1960's, I had learned thatLSD was a dangerous, mind-altering drug, one that sensible peopledidn't take; but they seemed sensible both before and after. Ihad learned that LSD alienated people and ruined relationships;but this young, married, graduate-student couple had shared adeep and meaningful experience that brought them closer together.They talked of increased love for each other and for humanity. Ihad learned that LSD makes people suicidal, jumping out of highwindows and that sort of thing; yet they seemed well-grounded anddown to earth. I had learned that LSD makes people hysterical andpsychotic; but they seemed relaxed, rational, andreality-oriented. I learned that LSD puts one into a nightmarishhell, full of terrifying hallucinations and Goya-esque agonies;they described a feeling of overwhelming awe for the beautysurrounding them. They said things felt "more sacred, moreintense, and indescribably wonder-filled." I had learnedthat LSD drives one mad, yet they seemed saner than ever. I hadlearned that LSD was an escape into unreality; yet their livesseemed to be enriched somehow. A few others in the class noddedunderstandingly, and exchanged words and smiles of warmrecognition—even a sort of congratulation! This didn't makesense. We weren't a class of long-haired freaks. We were hard-working, high-achieving, graduate students from engineering, thesocial sciences, humanities, and assorted professional schools.This didn't make sense at all. It does now. LSD helps people experience all these things,good and bad, and many more. Like most people in the late 1960sand early 1970s, I "learned" about LSD from TV,newspapers, and magazines. I "learned" that doctors,psychiatrists, and psychologists were treating many patients whowere suffering from "LSD psychosis." I"learned" that LSD was responsible for changes insocial mores, sexual openness, political activism, and a wholecultural shift. Since then, however, through my own experiences withpsychedelics and subsequent readings stimulated by thoseexperiences, I've learned it is easier to learn an erroneousopinion than to correct it. The popular news media prefer tofocus public attention on the spectacular, bizarre, andfrightening. Mental and physical health professionals see onlythose who have problems; sick people are their clientele. Aperson who took LSD with beneficial effects would hardly belikely to take the time and money to go to a doctor and reportthat he is well. Finally, some of the experiences one commonlyhas during psychedelic sessions run directly contrary to thedominant intellectual positions of the 1960s, which assumed thatany deviation from our ordinary state of consciousness,especially a mystical state, is error or sickness. Today'ssciences and psychologies are accommodating additional views, butin the sixties and early seventies such positions wereintellectually heretical. I followed the academic orthodoxies of the time. A son ofeducators, reared on the campus of a New England university,member of a highly rational Congregational church, undergraduatedevotee of behavioral psychology at Hamilton College, I became adoctoral student who planned to study educational tests andmeasurements and computer-assisted instruction while picking upan MBA on the side. To me mind was limited to intellect, andintellect implied reason, cognition, and their verbal expression.Who would expect such a person to advocate the development ofnonverbal, nonrational, and noncognitive mental abilities? Icertainly wouldn't; but I certainly do. This widened definitionof mind marks a major effect of my own LSD experiences. LSD hasstimulated a new interest for me in examining human learning,experience, thinking, and behavior in terms of states ofconsciousness (SOCs). This essay exemplifies the fun of thinkingin a consciousness way. (1) NOTE TO MY STUDENTS: From my experiences and through reading, I have become increasingly respectful of the power of LSD. Like any powerful thing, it can be either destructive or constructive depending on how skillfully it is used. Among other things, it can concentrate your attention on the most vulnerable, most unpleasant parts of your mind. These should be explored only under the guidance of a qualified therapist, one who has had extensive psychedelic training. If you need help, most currently-trained mental health professionals are unlikely to be able to help you; in fact, because of their mistraining, they are likely to worsen your state. Furthermore, street dosages are of unknown strength and questionable purity. Until the time you can explore your mind using LSD of known strength and purity under qualified guidance within the law, I urge you to limit yourself to studying the literature and to working within professional and other organizations for the resumption of legal, scientific research. Perception-extender Like a microscope, LSD magnifies. Instead of magnifyingthings outside the body, it magnifies inner experiences.Memories, ideas, fantasies, perceptions, thoughts, emotions,fears, hopes, sensations, bodily processes, any one of these canin effect come to occupy a person's whole attention. Thisamplification, like that of a microscope, allows the experiencerto investigate parts of his or her mind with increased attentionto the enlarged details. But, again like a microscope, it narrowsthe field of perception, often temporarily distorting therelationships among the parts. As with slide views through amicroscope, an LSD researcher must assemble a collage of close-upfragments to obtain an overall view of his or her own mentalexperience, and still more pieces for an overall map of the humanmind. This essay neither describes these fragments nor composes acollage. That has already been excellently done (e.g., Masters& Houston, 1966; Grof, 1975); and the research is surveyed byGrinspoon and Bakalar (1979). My purpose is to look at theinfluence of psychedelic experiences on myself and to speculateabout the implications of these experiences for the world oflearning. The essay assumes that studies done to date will beconfirmed by additional research. If past experiences is anyguide, some will be and others won't. The sooner we are clearabout which ones, the better off we will be. One thing is clear: LSD (I am using "LSD" asshorthand for the whole class of psychedelic drugs) raisesexciting and important questions. As an amateur psychologist, Iam interested in what LSD indicates about the mind. As aneducational psychologist, I am curious about the implications forlearning and development. As a human being and a citizen of mycountry and my planet, I wonder what insights it provides forculture and society. This essay is an attempt to think aboutthese issues rather than to solve them; to bring them forward foropen, intelligent discussion rather than to keep them buried inan intellectual underground- to encourage additional careful,legal research and its open communication rather thanclandestine, illegal research and word-of-mouth rumor. Althoughthis essay is based on my own experiences, it reflects more thanmy individual case. Most of the ideas are common currency amongmy consciousness colleagues. The essay is more collection thancreation. Learning I've titled this essay "New Learning" for severalreasons. As an educational psychologist, I'm interested in theimplications of LSD research for the study of human learning andfor further human development. Through LSD experiences I havelearned to look at myself and society in a new way. Theseexperiences have been, in effect, an additional higher educationfor me, equal in impact, effort, knowledge, beauty, and scope toobtaining a doctorate at Stanford. I value both sets ofexperiences highly. To me, the LSD-Stanford comparison shinesbrightly in both directions. Besides, this is a book writtenlargely by and for educators and others who want to increaselearning. Finally, I use the gerund to connote a continuingprocess. The educational topics, philosophical issues,intellectual questions, and personal insights which evolved frommy LSD experiences and subsequent investigations are a continuingsource of growth. They have piqued my curiosity about areas ofliterature, religion, anthropology, and philosophy that Iunderrated before. The sciences, social sciences, and arts havetaken on additional coloration and deeper meanings. In a veryreal sense, LSD experiences resemble a liberal education. ISSUES, TOPICS, AND QUESTIONS I developed an interest in this essay's ideas directlythrough my psychedelic experiences and indirectly through readinglargely stimulated by these experiences. This is not to say thatLSD is the only road to such ideas. Clearly, it isn't. But in myexperience and in the experiences of some of my friends andcolleagues, LSD was our road. MINDMAP, MYSTICISM, MORALITY, AND METHODOLOGY Redrawing the Mindmap Stanislav Grof may well be the living Western psychologistwith the widest and deepest sample of human psychologicalbehavior. He, his patients, and co-experimenters have crossed andrecrossed the mental terrain. Their combined observations havestrength not only because of their own diversity (other mapmakershave used diverse populations) but primarily because they havesystematically mapped previously excluded regions. From a sampleof approximately 4,000 LSD sessions with a wide range ofpsychotics, neurotics, and normals, he describes a four-levelmindcollage in Realms of the Human Unconscious. Theshallowest level consists of current thoughts and perceptions,the "Abstract and Aesthetic Level," as Grof calls it.The second level consists of experiences and fantasies of theperson's life. Most therapies focus on this level, and Grof callsthis the "Psychodynamic or Freudian Level." Below thisis the "Perinatal Level," having to do with experiencesat or around birth; this level is associated with the work ofOtto Rank. These three levels all have to do with experiences ofthe person. Beyond this is a region where personal identity,time, and space become variables. This is the "TranspersonalLevel." If Grof's map served only in therapy and simply as aphenomenological record of LSD experiences, it would be a usefulcuriosity, but otherwise unimportant for the world of learning.But the map is also congruent with the mindmaps of powerfulthinkers from several fields, notably the humanities, who draw onmany cultures for their evidence. (2) This convergence of disciplines presents aview of the human mind in agreement with current views in someparticulars, but at variance in others. Experimental Humanities? The disciplinary regularities described by these authors andthe general worldview they present were derived from large-scalesurveys of their fields. Grof's LSD research goes beyond this toexperimental verification which confirms their findings.Humanistic studies in turn help to corroborate psychedelicobservations. Psychedelic research's roomy additions to the houseof intellect make it possible to found new disciplinaryspecialties that hybridize science and the humanities, forexample, experimental symbolism and "experientialphilosophy." All the books mentioned in Figure 1 explicitly derive their ideas fromaltered states of consciousness, yet our academic community ispredominantly consciousness-naive. Studies of human nature andthe human mind which omit non-ordinary states are clearlyincomplete. Mysticism and Mysticism A decade ago I, too, had learned the standard scientificorthodoxy on mysticism: I despised and caricatured mysticism as aview that the world is basically unknowable and that reason andobservation are useless, probably confusing. What would I, as arational human being, have to do with this holdover from the DarkAges? What good was a psychology that valued such trash? After experiencing mystical states several times and readinga bit about them, I now realize that I failed to make animportant distinction. Mysticism as a philosophical standon what can be known and how it can be known differs greatly fromthe study of mystical events as psychological experiences.My rejection of philosophical mysticism had led me blindly toreject the psychological study of mystical experiences. Several current psychotechnologies, including LSD, increasethe likelihood of mystical experiences. Now that we can stimulatethem, we can begin to bring to bear scientific experimentation.Richards' dissertation, Counseling, Peak Experiences and theHuman Encounter with Death: An Empirical Study of the Efficacy ofDPT-assisted Counseling in Enhancing the Quality of Life ofPersons with Terminal Cancer and Their Closest Family Members(1975), illustrates the scientific study of mystical states. Hiswork includes a survey of the literature on experimentalmysticism, repeatable treatment, standardized observations, andconfirmable/disconfirmable hypotheses and conclusions. The studyis replicable. A Science Growth-Spur When science expands, education follows. With consciousnesspioneers opening access to new territories, whole ranges of humanabilities are already beginning to be developed. For example, inthe 1960s I was taught that people could not voluntarily controlthe autonomic nervous system— the "vegetative nervoussystem," as my biology text pejoratively called it. In 1980we teach that one can learn to control this system bybiofeedback, meditation, yoga, and various uses of imagery. Aswith biofeedback learned states of consciousness, the study ofpsychedelic-stimulated SOCs is, in principle, not opposed toscience and reason. On the contrary, the refusal to study them isboth unreasonable and antiscientific. The Therapeutic Effect of Mystical Experiences What did Richards and others discover across the Appalachiansof the Mind? When the travelers returned, had they been drivencrazy? Neurotic? Psychotic? Were they out of touch with reality?Did they withdraw from family, friends, and loved ones?"Yes," said the stay-at- homes, clutching theirpsychoanalytic maps. "Beyond these mountains live fearfulbeasts. Let no one enter there." The travelers and their guides, however, told differentstories. Some alcoholics and addicts dropped their dependencies.Suicidal patients discovered a love of life. Some who departedneurotic and psychotic returned improved, although many neededseveral additional trips. Patients with terminal diseases feltless fear of death, and their general anxiety was lowered. Mostof all, they related honestly, lovingly, and openly with theirfamilies and closest friends (Grof, 1975, 1981; Grof &Halifax, 1978; Richards, 1975; summarized in Grinspoon &Bakalar, 1979). If mystical experiences are integrated into the personality,they are highly therapeutic. Single-state scholars andtheoreticians are hard-pressed to explain this therapeutic value.Denial is easier. But if an enlarged map of reality includesaltered states of consciousness, then experiencing such stateslogically leads to a fuller view of reality, and therapists tellus that a fuller view of reality is therapeutic. Moral Development: A Second Path? Bits of observation may fall together in unexpected ways whena new methodology presents a new data or a new way of thinkingreorganizes existing observations. Looked at from a consciousnessperspective, some issues surrounding moral development combine ina startling way. Four bits of information are linked together: First, mystical experiences, or peak experiences, are bytheir nature non-ego states, i.e., transpersonal states. It isnot surprising that people who experience this state report adecrease in such ego needs as the neurotic accumulation of wealthor power. In Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences,Maslow reports this value-shift during peak experiences (1964),and Huxley claims it is part of most major philosophicaltraditions (1944). Second, during peak or mystical experiences, people directlyexperience what Maslow calls "being values, " and whatKohlberg calls "universal moral principles. " Theseinclude such things as the sanctity of life and compassion. Third, these qualities then act as goals or motivations forfuture actions. Personal compassion, social responsibility,global awareness, and a cosmic perspective grow. Fourth, LSD, the new therapies, and other psychotechnologiescan trigger, or at least facilitate, peak or mysticalexperiences. Putting these four together we have a sequence from the newtherapies to mystical experiences to "being values" tomoral action. Have we unintentionally, blindly, and unknowinglystumbled onto another path of moral improvement? Have wediscovered rapid, even chemically- induced moral development? Myemotional reaction is an indignant "No, it can't be!"Yet, that is what some of the evidence suggests. In any case, therelationship between mystical states and morality is mynomination as the most-needed piece of consciousness research. Because it is based on the study of many states ofconsciousness, the psychology of consciousness includes a greaternumber and wider variety of observations than a single-statepsychology. It offers a source of hypotheses and researchdesigns. However, we should remember that many early findings areprobably inaccurate. Great contributions and great mistakes aretwins of new paradigms. Because of the newness of consciousnessresearch, some variables are probably still hidden. This speedsup the frequency of disconfirmations, and slows confirmations. Anorganized research agenda, regular dissemination channels,research conferences, and so forth are now appropriate for thisfield and will help separate false hopes from hot leads. Methodology—Down the Mind Mine The greatest advances in civilization, science, and learningoften result from new ways of doing things, new methodologies. Inmy judgment the most important thing about psychedelics is thatthey give us a powerful and broadly applicable researchmethodology. (3) The typical Western approach to studying the mind is to lookat its activities and products and to infer its structure andfunctions from them. Studying the great religions, philosophies,and psychologies of the world, what similarities do we find? Whatdo language and literature indicate about the human mind? This isthe research method of many of the authors in Figure 1. One minorbenefit of psychedelic research is that it adds a few novelboulders to the mountain of human experience. A largercontribution is that psychedelic insights offer ways tocategorize some of these observations and ways to specifyrelationships among them. The second major Western way to study the mind is to look atabnormal behavior to see what it indicates. Here, too, theevidence is largely descriptive, although current therapeuticinterventions add some clinical and experimental notes.Psychedelic and psycholytic therapies add to the knowledge wereceive via this route. Because psychedelics were developed andused in recent history for therapy rather than for intellectualresearch, a misleading connotation of mental illness as theironly appropriate domain blinds people to their researchpotentials elsewhere. Instead of inferring the structure of themind from its surface geography and from occasionalinterventions, psychedelic methodology provides direct access tothe underground veins and strata, the deep structures andprocesses where thoughts, feelings, and motivation originate. Fortunately for researchers, sometimes in these states it ispossible to alternate between deep mental experience and aclose-to-normal state. They can even happen simultaneously. Forexample, once toward the end of a psychedelic session Iremembered a group of childhood nightmares. At the time they hadthe quality of immediate experience rather than memory. Every fewminutes, I got up from bed to make notes on these experiences,then returned again to re-experience them. The period ofalternating states lasted about 20 minutes, and I was able torecall and record "childhood nightmares" which includedthe name of a playmate whom I hadn't thought of for over aquarter of a century. Some of these dreams came from very earlychildhood and perhaps infancy. From this experience, Ihypothesized that some early childhood nightmares are birthmemories. This was not a new idea, but it was newly credible tome. As I look at my colleagues' professional contributions, Ifind, rightly or wrongly, that I evaluate most highly the ideasof those who are experienced in various states of consciousnessor who are at least familiar with the research from reading.Within the consciousness group, I trust the theories andhypotheses of psychedelic researchers more than those ofLSD-naive researchers. Researchers with knowledge of severalstates have an even greater advantage. This is not to say thatall good research is psychedelic nor that all psychedelicresearch is good research. Obviously, this isn't the case. But asa general rule, it is preferable to generalize from diverseobservations rather than from a narrower field. I predict that bythe end of this decade, psychologists, philosophers, andeducators, as well as mental and physical health practitionerswho are unfamiliar with consciousness research will be asout-of-date as they would be today if they were unfamiliar withFreud, Skinner, or Piaget. Professional Creativity Thework of Harman et al. (1966) indicates that psychedelics maybe a useful methodology in the incubation and illumination stagesof creative problem-solving. Most of the engineers, physicists,mathematicians, architects, and designers in his samples reportedvaluable solutions to their professional problems frompsychedelic acceleration of creativity. Thissynthesis-facilitating use of psychedelics is different from themind-research mentioned above. We need more systematic researchon how to do psychedelic research. An unfortunate side-effect ofpsychedelics' illegality is that the publication and sharing ofthe methods and findings is discouraged. EDUCATIONAL FUTURES IN A CONSCIOUSNESS CONTEXT Consciousness Roots of Mental Fruit When consciousness (the overall pattern of mentalfunctioning) is seen as a group of variables, cognition,perception, affect, and so on, are seen as psychologicalprocesses embedded in SOCs with each other and with otherpsychological processes. All our cognitive structures and mentalprocesses seem to vary from one state of overall psychologicalfunctioning to another. How much variation in thinking is therefrom state to state? What alternate forms of thinking exist inalternate patterns of mental functioning? What, if any, usesmight they have for humanity? Failure to Recognize the Primacy of States of Consciousness Is the Major Intellectual Error of our Times Present ideas of the mind are almost wholly derived from ourordinary state's experience and cognition and are for use withinit. Although contributions to them may well have been aided byreverie or other nearby SOCs, we ignore these origins. We are largely hunter-gatherers of the mind. Its civilizationhas just begun. We trim and prune here and there. We espalierdiverse facts with convenient theories. From a consciousnessperspective, increased harvests depend on acknowledging thought'sdeep roots in other SOCs. A mind cultivator not only weeds thesurface ideas, but also tends the conceptual and preconceptualsoils. The idea that such inner-directed attention is narcissisticis a peculiar one. While they may be stimulated by externalevents, aesthetic creation and awareness, problem-finding andproblem-solving, judgments of quality, spiritual experiences,intellectual and other mental processes are all internal events,processes happening "inside the head." Callinginner-directed attention "narcissistic" or"me-oriented" is inaccurate, anti-intellectual, andjust plain ignorant. Cognition and Consciousness Can one intentionally improve inner processes? Someimprovement comes from better ideas, that is, more accurate,useful, and varied concepts. Focusing on better cognitivestrategies to process or manipulate the content, cognitivepsychology asks a higher, second-level question: whether thereare more efficient ways of thinking. Consciousness studies ask athird-level question: How do cognitive strategies and cognitionvary from state to state? From a cognitive perspective, differentstates of consciousness are, among other things, radicalreorganizations of information processing systems and strategies.Different states of consciousness also provide different"strategies" of perception, abilities, memory, emotion,etc. At each level, the degree of mental freedom increases. It isno accident that mystical experiences are associated with anopen-minded tolerance for ambiguity (Thomas & Cooper, 1980).This kind of tolerance is also correlated with abstract thought,creativity, decreased prejudice, and low authoritarianism. From aconsciousness perspective, the first pair are associated withhigher stages of mental development, the latter pair withdecreased ego involvement. The two occur together. Consciousness Education Before LSD drew my attention to state of consciousness as avariable, I accepted the usual cognitive goals of education:knowing more facts and learning to think better, avoidingfallacies, moving up Piaget's stages of intellectual development,finding more useful concepts and theories, matching theory withobservations, and so forth. While I still value these aims, I nowsee them in a different context. The items below are discussed more thoroughly in Consciousness,Psychology, and Education (Roberts, 1980a). First, education has focused almost entirely on developingthe cognitive skills of our ordinary state. I am not suggestingthat we change this, at least not yet. But we should be awarethat this is a policy decision, not a necessary"given." What forms does cognition take in otherstates? Second, human abilities and disabilities depend on variousbroader patterns of overall mental functioning, states ofconsciousness. As SOC's change, certain skills are enhanced andothers are diminished. Previously rare or unusual abilities, suchas parapsychological abilities and the placebo ability, may belearnable by providing access to the states of consciousnesswhere they reside. Many human physical and mental disabilitiesseem to be best treated in unusual states of consciousness suchas hypnosis, meditation, and psychedelic therapy. So-called"spontaneous remission," "miraculous" cures,and "therapeutic touch" all seem to be associated withchanges in SOC. In institutions other than schools (and perhapssome day in schools) people may want to explore and develop thecapacities manifested in these states of consciousness. Third, abstract formal operations do not necessarilyrepresent the highest type of intellectual development. That maybe true for our ordinary state (including suggested stages beyondPiaget's); but other (perhaps more advanced) forms ofintellectual development with stages of their own may await us inother states. Fourth, educators and psychologists need not defineintelligence solely in ordinary-state ways. Intelligence may alsobe seen as the general ability to use a large number of mentalpatterns (states of consciousness), as the ability to select andenter the most appropriate SOC for the task at hand, or as theoptimum use of each specific SOC. In this last sense the meaningof "intelligence" varies from state to state (Roberts,1980b). Fifth, there is a contextual broadening best described from apsychoanalytic perspective. This view sees secondary processthinking (rational, adult thinking) as optimal. It now seems tome that there is at least tertiary thinking, which consists ofselecting one's overall pattern of mental functioning. This is ahigher ability than learning to use any specific pattern or oneof its resident abilities. Sixth, education in our usual state and all the research anddevelopment surrounding it become additionally important viewedin this context. Current educational goals, objectives, methods,curricula, tests and measurements, developmental stages,taxonomies, philosophies, and practices may all have analogues inother states. How do we adapt our ideas about our current SOC andits education to other SOCs? Liberal Education As its name indicates, liberal education is an education forfreedom: freedom from the accidents of locale, group, time,class, and so on. It offers the freedom to develop one's mindfully. Consistent with these objectives, consciousness educationadds the great states of consciousness to the great ideas andgreat thinkers. The historic role of SOCs in the humanities,arts, and sciences is neglected in current education, even ascontent, despite an occasional titillating exception such as KublaKhan, bacchanalia, or a maligned saint's misconstruedecstasy. These are used more to enliven classes than to teachabout the further reaches of mind. A truly liberal educationshould teach students about this part of themselves and ourcivilizations, and should also give them rudimentary experiencewith selected states and their resident capacities. Enriched by aconsciousness perspective, liberal education can extend freedomand mental refinement far beyond the parochialism of single-statelearning. Placebo Ability We use a misnomer when we speak of "the placeboeffect." "Effect" attributes improvement tospurious treatments which are selected precisely because of theirlack of effect. The label is not only a logical inconsistencywhich explains nothing, but a barrier to research. If "placebo-ing" is seen as something we do, ratherthan something that happens to us, it becomes an ability like anyother human ability, one which might be learned and practiced.Regimens such as prayer, visualization, deep relaxation, and anassortment of religious and psychological practices make good"placeboing" sense. Physical educators should helptheir students learn to assist their own natural immunemechanisms, which are part of the placebo ability. Wellness andillness are largely long-term physical performances. We know theycan be learned and unlearned, but we do not yet know the extentof this learning. Consciousness Studies, a New Discipline What makes a discipline and differentiates it from otherdisciplines? At least the following: separate theories andconcepts, specific problems addressed, explanations ofobservations not otherwise explained, applications to life, adistinctive research methodology, a separate literature, and anidentifiable group of people who share interests, professionalorganizations, publications, and a system of information flow. Bythese criteria, Consciousness Studies will soon deserve its ownplace in the academic world. Consciousness methodologies include traditional and new waysof altering consciousness. Accepting both outside, objectiveevidence and inner, subjective evidence, it offers a larger database than either of these alone. Correlating the two is animportant type of research. Training in subjective researchmethods, for example through meditation or LSD, is as cognitivelydemanding as traditional statistics, research design, andinstrumentation. As Needleman (1975) says: In our modern world it has always been assumed . . . that in order to observe oneself all that is required is for a person to "look within. " No one even imagines that self- observation may be a highly disciplined skill which requires longer training than any other skill we know....The...bad reputation of "introspection" ...results from the particular notion that all by himself. . . a man can come to accurate and unmixed observations of his own thought and perception .... the heart of the psychological disciplines in the East and the ancient Western world consists of training at self-study. Consciousness Studies form its related fields. Parts of thescientific community have difficulty accepting data from otherSOCs, just as our ancestors found it hard to accept observationsfrom the telescope and microscope. If it is done properly,consciousness research can meet the requirements of scientificmethod: observation, free communication, replicability,theorizing, and confirmation/disconfirmation (Tart, 1975). By providing a more accurate and complete view of ourpsychological apparatus, our mind, consciousness research can aidother disciplines too. As Kubie (1954) points out: A discipline comes of age and a student of that discipline reaches maturity when it becomes possible to recognize, estimate, and allow for the errors of their tools....Yet there is one instrument which every discipline uses without checking its errors, tacitly assuming that the instrument is error-free. This, of course, is the human psychological apparatus . Like statistical methods, consciousness methods, as well asthe particular findings themselves, may help other researcherssophisticate their procedures and analyses. A final reason to consider Consciousness Studies a separatediscipline is the subjective feelings of those in the field.Consciousness colleagues in a variety of universities,departments, and nonacademic occupations feel as much akin to oneanother as to their departmental colleagues, if not more so. Thisfeeling of shared interests and perspectives is a powerfuluniting force which undercuts disciplinary differences. Althoughthere is little institutional structure reflecting these sharedideas and values, the trust, common interests, and enjoyment forman invisible Department of Consciousness Studies. Mindmagicians Mindpower is more fascinating than machine power. Such booksas the Carlos Castenada series and works by Tart, Ornstein, andGrof surprised their publishers by selling well in a hithertounseen market. Best sellers such as Drawing on the Right Side ofthe Brain (Edwards, 1979) are introducing consciousness educationto teachers and parents. Anatomy of an Illness (Cousins, 1979)illustrates this interest in (holistic) health and wellness. Idon't want to make my case seem stronger than it is; I'm notsatying that consciousness culture is now dominant, only that itwill be if current trends continue. For the present, it is aclear cultural leitmotiv. Want Ads What new organizations and industries may evolve? Prophecy isnot my line, but enough is clear now to spot a few needs. EDUCATION Introduction of consciousness teaching in classrooms, as content as well as practice. Rewriting textbooks and curricula to include consciousness ideas. Adding consciousness teaching techniques in colleges of education. Research institutes to study consciousness on both applied and basic levels, a consciousness think- tank. Foundations, institutes, and professional organizations to develop these possibilities. HEALTH AND THERAPY Research institutes to examine the relationships of SOCs to mental and physical health. Consciousness treatment and development centers, to apply what is found in research, e.g., psychedelic treatment centers and mind development centers. Professional training institutes to teach this new specialty and to retrain existing professionals. Certification and licensure, standards, boards, agencies, and professional standards committees. Holistic health centers. Many are already thriving. New centers and/or programs to train consciousness counselors and therapists . Rewriting and republishing of therapy books to include consciousness. INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS Biofeedback instruments, e.g., Kirlian biofeedback devices need to be invented. Centers to teach executives, engineers, etc., to use their consciousness capacities . Consciousness exploration as motivation, transcendence as a need beyond self-actualization in Maslow's hierarchy. Long-range planning seminars and institutes. GOVERNMENT The use of consciousness as a criterion for laws, regulations, licenses. Accreditation standards. Recognition of a consciousness constituency. Funding of research on consciousness and possible benefits, and on problems coming from its development. What role does LSD play in this? As the most powerful of manyconsciousness techniques, it dramatically draws attention tothese needs. As it has been officially neglected andmisunderstood, it points to our neglect and misunderstanding ofthe whole consciousness area. As a stimulator of consciousnessresearch in the academic and mental health communities, it islikely to encourage development throughout our culture. Peace We think of peace as a political and social phenomenon,seldom recognizing that these surface experiences interact withdeep layers of the mind. Experienced LSD researchers come intouch with deep internal responses through the drug'smagnification of external events. Conversely, experiencing acluster of internal feelings/memories/fantasies/thoughts colorsthe external world. At the perinatal level there are two clusters(BPMs) which respond strongly to outside stimulation andcontribute to warlike feelings. Basic Perinatal Matrix IIinvolves feelings of constriction and helplessness; it isappropriately called "No Exit Hell."BPM III representsenormous energy, natural and man-made cataclysms, especiallyviolence and wars; it is appropriately called "TitanicStruggle . " The wrong set of social and economic circumstances bringsthese BPM's to the fore. For example, Grof noticed remarkabledetailed similarities between the memories of Nazi concentrationcamp survivors and the unconscious fantasies of people who hadlived more ordinary lives (Grof, 1977). He hypothesizes that thesituation within the camps, especially toward the end of the war,activated BPM's II and III, stimulating the camp guards to enactviolent and sadistic urges that inhabit these clusters. War activates these BPM's and strengthens them, just as theirpower is called on to justify war. As countries wind themselvesup to go to war, their leaders use perinatal symbols to marshalpublic opinion, not consciously, but because the war-instigatingsymbols feel right; and they feel right because of thisconnection. Hitler used the BPM sequence to manipulate hispeople: (1) BPM I, the "Good Womb," was symbolized bytales of the past golden age of the Germanic peoples; (2) BPM II,"No Exit Hell, " was the present, constricted byexternal and internal enemies, intensified by economic disaster;the need to get out was expressed symbolically as the desire forexpansion, lebensraum; (3) the way out was titanicstruggle (BPM III), and (4) the birth of a 1,000 year Reich (BPMIV). De Mause found this imagery to be typical in nations whichare preparing for war intentionally or merely blundering towardit (cited in Grof, 1977). While the informed public recognizes shallowpsychodynamic-level appeals to sexual interest, power, status,and so forth in advertising and propaganda, we are not so awareof manipulation on the perinatal level. Until we recognize this,humanity will have a short war fuse which can easily be lit bymany social, economic, political, and cultural situations. Othersituations can transform this destructive energy into creative,constructive, socially-beneficial actions. What are the perinatalconsequences of social conditions? What are the socialconsequences of perinatal conditions? As we come to understand the human mind more completely, wewill naturally see its roles in war and peace more completely.The observations, speculations, and questions above suggest howwar and peace studies can be enriched by a fuller understandingof mind and consciousness. This is merely one illustration of thepossibilities of consciousness analysis in the social sciences. Freedom of the Mind Who has the right to control your mind? To explore it? To useit? With the invention of consciousness techniques, a new kind offreedom faces a new kind of control. People want to explore anddevelop their minds, and psychedelics are an efficient way to doso. This desire is part of human nature, but law and socialignorance block the way. I propose that we recognize a generalhuman right: the right to explore, control, and develop one'smind. Other people or society at large can limit this right onlyto the degree they are affected. It will not be so easy todelimit this limitation . The High Cost of Bad Law When comparing the scientific and medical writings on LSDwith sensational newspaper, popular press, and TV accounts, astartling observation leads to a startling conclusion. In thescientific and medical research reports, psychological damage isalmost missing; in the popular news it is featured. During legalresearch the patient or client is carefully screened andexpensively prepared for the experience. The dosage and itspurity are known. The setting, which is a major influence, ischosen to maximize safety and minimize danger. And a qualifiedprofessional is on hand to assist. In cases that make the popularpress, on the other hand, consciousness adventurers are neitherscreened nor prepared. The dosage and purity are unknown. Thesetting is random and often unpleasant. Professional help isabsent. These different conditions account for the rarity ofserious problems in the scientific reports and the presence offrequent tragedy in the popular reports. All the specific unfavorable conditions derive from onelarger situation: LSD is illegal. In the legal situation, theLSD-taker can be prepared and high-risk people screened out; thedosage and its purity are assured; setting can be planned foroptimum benefit. All this is difficult in illegal situations.Under present laws, it is illegal for a professional toadminister LSD; and fear of police and public exposure increasepsychological stress at a time when the person is mostvulnerable. Given LSD's magnifying property, this fear can becomepsychologically overwhelming. In an unstable person it could befatal. By driving LSD use underground, we multiply its dangerswhile minimizing its benefits. Policy Given the consistent failure of anti-LSD legislation to stopuse since the mid-sixties, what is the most responsible coursefor public polity? Over-the-counter purchase and prescription byuntrained professionals are both risky. I propose centers toscreen and prepare those who need or wish to take psychedelics.We need to provide a place to administer doses of known purityand strength under qualified, specially-trained guidance and withoptimal set and setting. Each state and most large cities coulduse several psychedelic centers. Major universities, medicalschools, and research institutes would also benefit from thesecenters. A professional staff training program would have toprecede the establishment of such institutions. After incubating for a quarter of a century, after beingrepressed by governmental and professional restraints for adecade and a half, after struggling for recognition andacceptance, psychedelic research is finally breaking through tothe clear light of evidence and reason. Intellectual curiosity,civic duty, professional obligation, humanitarian values, andmoral responsibility provide grounds for further research. For me (and I assume for some of my coauthors) my mostintensely intellectually stimulating, short-term experiences havebeen psychedelic sessions. Psychedelics open wide the doors oflearning. Where will those mind-doors lead? Only when we doadditional research will we know. Most of all, psychedelics are just one group among manyconsciousness methodologies. There are also certain aspects ofbiofeedback, meditation, hypnosis, prayer and other spiritualpractices, other mind-drugs, yoga and other movement disciplines,nutrition, t'ai chi and the consciousness martial arts,sex and exercise routines, training in intuition, relaxation andvisualization.... The list could go on for hundreds of trainings,spiritual paths, and esoteric fields. Research might be done incooperation with groups which practice these. What insights, ifany, might they have about the human mind? Only when we do moreresearch will we learn. For a wandering, directionless culture the full developmentof our minds is a project equal in scale to pioneering west ofthe Appalachians or exploring outer space. A new cultural mythicideal is emerging: the myth of the fully developed mind. It is aneminently democratic ideal. Only some can become adventurers onland or in space, but in mind exploration, everyone is at thefrontier. Note to My Colleagues "The rejection of any source of evidence isalways treason to that ultimate rationalism which urges forward science and philosophy alike." —Alfred North Whitehead I write this, not expecting you to believe what you read herejust because I say so, but hoping this essay will interest youenough to examine LSD research yourself. If you apply the sameresearch standards and spirit of open intellectual inquiry tothis body of research as you apply to your own work and to thereports you read, you'll find that psychedelic research raises asmany exciting questions for you, your students, and your field ofexpertise as it does for me and mine. For 2 decades reason;science, and philosophy have been betrayed because of ourirrational rejection of psychedelic evidence. It is aprofessional duty to help redress this error. When you read theevidence, I think you'll see it that way, too. NOTES (1) My apologies to grammarians offendedby the noun "consciousness" used as an adjective. I dothis because "conscious" has misleading common usages.Avoiding grammatically correct but lengthy phrases such as"the psychology of states of consciousness," or"education which takes states of consciousness intoaccount," I opt for a simple, useful, and ungrammaticalbarbarism by stipulating my adjectival use of"consciousness" to mean "pertaining to states ofconsciousness . " (back) (2) In contradistinction to writings onthe psychedelics which are occupied with experiences the mind canhare, the concern here is with evidence they afford as to whatthe mind is. Judged both by quantity of data encompassed and bythe explanatory power of the hypotheses that make sense of thisdata, it is the most formidable evidence the psychedelics havethus far produced. The evidence to which we refer is that whichhas emerged through the work of Stanislav Grof. (Huston Smith,Forgotten Truth. The Primordial Tradition, p. 156).

Bakalar Copyright Human Sciences Press, 1983 While we are talking about the uses of psychedelic drugs, itis appropriate to discuss their dangers. The psychedelic voyagedoes produce some casualties; the question is how many and howserious they are, what causes them, and how to prevent them. Thishas been a matter of controversy since the 1960s. Drug userssometimes would not confess that they had any problems, becausedoubts and regrets were supposed to be a sign of rigidity orrepression or some other inadmissible personal problem. Anti-drugcrusaders sometimes would not admit that there was such a thingas a good trip or an insight to be derived from psychedelicdrugs. The most common adverse effect is the bad trip, which takesmany forms, from anxiety or panic to a (rare) psychotic state.The worst kind is a fixed intense emotion or distorted thoughtthat can seem like an eternity of hell; for example, remorse,suspicion, delusions of persecution or of being irreversiblyinsane. Bad trips do not outlast the immediate effect of thedrug, and recovery is usually complete. They are not adverse drugreactions in the narrow sense of something completely unintendedand unexpected. Even the best trips may have moments of anxietyor depression, and every psychedelic drug user knows thateventually he may have a trip dominated by painful or frighteningfeelings: they are hardly more avoidable than fear when climbinga mountain or pain when running a marathon. Bad trips aresometimes regarded as more valuable than good ones, on the groundthat they teach the drug taker more about himself; the sufferinghas the virtue of not seeming meaningless. In one study of LSDusers, 24 percent of the subjects had had what they consideredbad trips, and 50 percent considered the bad trips beneficial(McGlothlin & Arnold, 1971, p. 47). Prolonged adverse reactions to psychedelic drugs are just asvaried in form as bad trips, and defy diagnostic classificationjust as much. In fact, one way of looking at them is asprolonged, more or less attenuated, or more or less intermittentbad trips. As the defenses of the ego are altered, repressedfeelings and memories rise into consciousness, and they maycreate enough anxiety to disrupt the organization of the mind.Almost always, the defenses are reconstituted when the drug'sinfluence wears off; but if the drug user's personality isunstable or the situation unsuitable—if the set and settingare wrong—the disorganization may persist or return understress, as a kind of continuation of the unfinished psychedelicexperience. The result is a great variety of altered mentalstates, from a mild recurrence of some drug-induced perceptualchange to depersonalization or outright psychosis. By far the most common of these altered states is thespontaneous recurrence or flashback. By the broadest definition,a flashback is the transitory recurrence of emotions andperceptions originally experienced while under the influence of apsychedelic drug. It can last seconds or hours; it can mimic anyof the myriad aspects of a trip; and it can be blissful,interesting, annoying, or frightening. Ordinarily they are onlyslightly disturbing, especially since the drug user usuallyrecognizes them for what they are; they may even be regardedlightheartedly as "free trips. " Occasionally they lastlonger, and in a small minority of cases they turn into repeatedfrightening images or thoughts. Usually they quickly decrease innumber and intensity. Flashbacks are most likely to occur underemotional stress or at a time of altered ego functioning; theyare often induced by conditions like fatigue, drunkenness,marihuana intoxication, and even meditative states. Marihuanasmoking is probably the most common single source of flashbacks. On a broad definition, flashbacks are very common. Accordingto some studies, as many as a quarter of psychedelic drug usershave experienced some form of flashback; about half consider themfrightening and half consider them pleasant (Naditch &Fenwick, 1977). If the term is defined more narrowly for clinicalpurposes as "repeated intrusions of frightening images inspite of volitional efforts to avoid them, " it seems thatabout 5 percent of habitual psychedelic drug users haveexperienced them (McGlothlin, 1974, p. 27). Other prolonged adverse reactions are much rarer. They havebeen classified as chronic anxiety reactions, depressivereactions, and psychoses. One study describes 16 hospitalizedpatients who suffered from "philosophical delusions,"intense visual hallucinations, and what the authors call astriking variety of affective and neurotic symptoms, often theyhad at least partial insight into the nature of their problems.Many of them received electroconvulsive therapy, and the averagehospital stay was five and one-half weeks (Dewhurst &Hatrick, 1972). The following is an example of a chronic anxiety stateproduced by LSD: After much persuasion by his friends a twenty-year-old university student took 150 micrograms of LSD It was an "interesting but disturbing time. " Thereafter it became very difficult for him to study or concentrate, and he decided to drop out of school. He was unable to continue his part- time job as a stock clerk. There were strong feelings of the meaninglessness of life and he said that he was "philosophically confused." Some days he felt normal again for a few hours, but then the strange, moving, compressing walls and time standing still made him fear he was going crazy. He had occasional thoughts of self-destruction. He would become very upset and panicky, break out into a sweat and sometimes freeze in terror. With considerable support, strong reassurance and tranquilizer therapy, the condition subsided six months after the LSD session (Cohen, 1970 [1965], p. 92). Because of inadequate reporting and problems in interpretingsymptoms and causes, it is hard to tell how common adversereactions are. At Bellevue Hospital in New York from early 1965to 1967, 200 patients appeared with complaints related toLSD—mostly panic reactions and flashbacks (Frosch, 1969). By1969 Bellevue was seeing only one LSD reaction every 2 weeks, andmost of these were thought to be borderline schizophrenics inwhom the drug had precipitated a psychosis (Stern & Robbins,1969). A 1971 Canadian government survey of the hospital recordsof 22,885 psychiatric patients found 67 cases (0.3 percent) whereLSD was mentioned as a factor in the primary diagnosis; most ofthese patients had used many drugs, and the precise influence ofLSD was often unclear (Final Report, 1973, p. 378). A questionnaire survey by J. Thomas Ungerleider and hiscolleagues suggests a much larger number of adverse reactions.The period covered was July 1, 1966 to January 1, 1968, and thequestionnaire was sent to 2,700 physicians, psychiatrists,psychologists, and other health professionals in Los AngelesCounty. Of the 1,584 who replied, 27 percent (including 47percent of the psychiatrists) had seen adverse reactions to LSD;the total number of adverse reactions was 8,958 (Ungerleider etal., 1968). Unfortunately, the definition of adverse reaction wasleft to the respondents, and the effect, the authors suggest, wasprobably to define anything that made a drug user seekprofessional help as an adverse reaction. The prevailing socialattitudes have to be taken into account; for example, it issuspicious that in the same survey 1,887 adverse reactions tomarihuana were reported. Many of the "adversereactions" may have been nothing more than difficult momentsduring drug trips that were mentioned in psychiatric interviewsbecause they seemed relevant to the problem under discussion;some may have been simply drug-induced insights that made peoplebelieve they needed help. Serious adverse reactions to psychedelic drugs are rare today,partly because they are being used more carefully and at smallerdoses than in the first flush of psychedelic enthusiasm, andpartly because LSD is no longer being unofficially promoted as asolution for emotional crises in the lives of seriously disturbedpeople. The most likely candidate for adverse reactions areschizoid and pre-psychotic personalities with a barely stable egobalance and a great deal of anxiety, who cannot cope with theperceptual changes, body-image distortions, and symbolicunconscious material produced by the drug. Murray Naditch hasfound through questionnaires that adverse reactions to LSD andmarihuana (defined essentially as bad trips—strongunpleasant feelings, panic, fear of insanity or death, thoughtsof suicide) are associated with high scores on psychological testscales representing schizophrenic tendencies, socialmaladjustment, and regression (Naditch, 1975). L.J. Hekimian andSamuel Gershon examined 47 patients admitted to Bellevue Hospitalbetween January and July 1967 after using a psychedelic drug inthe preceding 48 hours . In 31 cases psychotic conditions alreadypresent were intensified. Ultimately 32 were diagnosed asschizophrenic, 4 as schizoid, 6 as sociopaths, and 5 asdepressive or neurotic. The authors were struck by the frequencyof pre-existing schizophrenia (Hekimian & Gershon, 1968). It is certainly impossible to assume that anyone who suffersfrom psychosis, depression, or chronic anxiety after using apsychedelic drug would always have had the same problems in anycase, but it is also wrong to suppose that these problems arelikely to descend suddenly at any moment on a reasonably stableperson who takes a psychedelic drug in a reasonably protectedsetting. The best analogy for adverse psychedelic drug reactionsis psychosis precipitated by cannabis. The egos of a few peopleare so fragile that they can be precipitated into psychosis byany severe stress or alteration in consciousness, includingsurgery, an automobile accident, or alcohol intoxication; it isthey who will suffer the rare psychotic reactions to cannabis.LSD and drugs like it are much more powerful mind-modifiers, andmore people are vulnerable to their disruptive effects, includinga few with no strong previous signs of emotional disturbance.Psychedelic drugs are capable of magnifying and bringing intoconsciousness almost any internal conflict, so there is notypical prolonged adverse reaction to LSD in the sense in whichthere is, say, a typical amphetamine psychosis (always paranoid).Instead, as many different affective, neurotic, and psychoticsymptoms may appear as there are individual forms ofvulnerability. This makes it hard to distinguish between LSDreactions and unrelated pathology, especially when some timepasses between the drug trip and the onset of the disturbance. The best treatment for a bad trip is reassurance and"talking down" in a quiet, friendly setting; that isthe way thousands have been handled with or without interventionby psychiatrists. Sometimes this reassurance may take the form ofurging the drug user to go with it, give up resistance and allowloss of control, dissolution of the ego, and a catharticresolution. Interpreting, judging, discussing, and being"objective" are disastrous; asking questions almostalways exacerbates the problem by making impossible demands onthe drug taker. Anything that might cause suspicion and paranoia,like superfluous movements or conversations, should be avoided.Use of a tranquilizer or sedative should be only a last resort,after talking down fails; diazepam (Valium) is better thananti-psychotic drugs like chlorpromazine (Thorazine), which acttoo abruptly and intensely. The appropriate treatment forprolonged reactions to psychedelic drugs is the same as thetreatment for similar symptoms not produced by drugs:psychotherapy and drugs where necessary. The most important fact about chronic or long-term psychedelicdrug use is that there is very little of it. Psychedelic drugsproduce no psychological compulsion or craving and certainly nophysical addiction. A drug that takes people into a differentstretch of unfamiliar mental territory for 8 hours every timethey use it is not for every day or even every weekend. Drugusers soon come to understand that psychedelic trips are not tobe embarked on lightly, and they tend to stop using LSD or cutdown their consumption greatly after a short time. Nevertheless, for a few people in the late sixties and earlyseventies, LSD use became what H.S. Becker has called a"master trait." This kind of chronic user was known asan acidhead or acid freak, and a not very flattering compositeportrait can be drawn from journalism, psychiatric papers, andother sources. He speaks softly and his manner is meek; he ispassive and unwilling to take initiative. He talks a great dealabout love but fears genuine intimacy and often feels emotionallylifeless. He is easily shattered by aggression or argument, findsthe "hassles" of daily life an ordeal, and prefers tolive in a world of drug-induced fantasy. He finds it difficult tofollow an argument or concentrate on a thought; he is given tosuperstitious beliefs and magical practices. He does not workregularly or go to school; he rejects the accepted social formsand proselytized for LSD as a means of liberation from thestandard "ego games" that constitute most people'slives, he blames society for his troubles and tends to seehimself as a martyr. On the other hand, he is often at leastsuperficially open, friendly, warm, relaxed, and uncompetitive;he is childlike as well as childish, and people often like himand feel protective toward him. But he may express aggressionindirectly through his unconventional dress and manner, byabsent- minded inconsiderateness, or by resentment of challengesto his unjustified conviction of superior awareness and moralinsight. Even if no one fits this stereotype perfectly and mostpsychedelic drug users do not fit it at all, it does seem to havesome basis in reality. K.H. Blacker and his colleagues, using acontrol group for comparison, studied 21 volunteer subjects whohad used LSD 15 to 300 times (average 65 times), and found someof the features of the stereotypical acidhead: openness andrelaxation, likeableness, passivity and introversion, occult andmagical beliefs, hippie dress and hair styles. Four said they hadmemory blanks and sometimes found it difficult to organizethoughts and form sentences. On the electroencephelogram (EEG), which records brain waves,they did not have an unusually high rate of abnormalities; butthey did show significantly more energy in all frequency bandsthan normal control subjects and psychiatric patients, and thissuggested lower than usual levels of anxiety. On tests ofintellectual capacity and auditory evoked response (both usuallysensitive to the disorganization produced by schizophrenia) theLSD users were normal. But they were extraordinarily sensitive tovisual stimuli of low intensity, which confirmed their opinionthat they could observe gestures, postures, and shades of colorbetter than most people. They also seemed to modulate andorganize sensory stimuli in an unusual way, since there was norelationship between their evoked visual responses and theirsubjective tactile ones. The authors describe these subjects aseccentric or childlike but not schizophrenic or otherwisepathologically impaired. They emphasize that it was hard toseparate the effects of the drug from those of personality andsocial climate. Psychedelic drug users have also been tested for organic braindamage. William McGlothlin and his colleagues (McGlothlin et al.,1969) compared 16 subjects who had taken LSD 20 times or more(the range was 20 to 1,100, the median was 75 times) with 16controls; they examined the subjects clinically and alsoadministered the Halstead-Reitan test battery. There were noclinical organic symptoms, and no scores on theneuropsychological tests that suggested brain damage; but on atest measuring capacity for nonverbal abstraction the LSD usersscored lower. As in the case of Tucker's Rorschach results, theamount of LSD was not related to the score. Nevertheless, theauthors conclude that continual heavy use may cause minor organicbrain pathology: six of the LSD subjects, including the threeheaviest users, were regarded as "moderatelysuspicious" in this respect. In another study, Morgan Wrightand Terrence P. Hogan (1972) found no difference between subjectswho had used LSD an average of 29 times and controls (matched forage, sex, education, and IO) on a variety of neuropsychologicaltests, including the ones used by McGlothlin. At most, thesestudies confirm the existence of an eccentric acidheadpersonality; they do not clearly imply mental illness or braindamage. In considering long-term psychedelic drug use, even more thanin assessing acute reactions, it is hard to extricate thepharmacological contribution from the complex web of associationstying it to personality and social setting. The limitations ofretrospective studies are notorious, but that is all we have. Howmany long-term psychedelic drug users ever were really acidheads,and how permanent is the condition? How often is psychopathologyassociated with psychedelic drug use, and when it is, is the drugcause, symptom, or attempted cure? In this case there is also apotential for cultural bias that creates further complications.When are eccentric beliefs and behavior pathological, and whenare they simply a hippie way of life? Now that some of the socialviews and personal styles of the drug culture of the 1960s havebecome more popular, we know that they never implied adrug-induced personality change. Obviously many heavy drug users are seriously disturbedpeople, but the drug use is usually a symptom more than a causeof the trouble. If emotional problems were always a cause and notan effect of chronic psychedelic drug use, the status of acidheadwould be nothing but a refuge or role-disguise for certainschizoid or inadequate personalities. But sometimes drug abuseitself, whatever the original reasons for it, becomes the centralproblem, notoriously so when the drug is addictive, like alcoholor heroin. The same thing may happen with LSD, but that has beenrare since the 1960s and was not common even then . The bestmodel for understanding the changes in behavior that occur afterpsychedelic drug use is not a drug-induced personality change ormodification of the brain but the changes in one's views of selfand world after a voyage to a strange country . A note on genetic damage and birth defects has to be added,because misconceptions about this subject still exist. Chromosomedamage from LSD was first reported by Maimon Cohen and hiscolleagues in Science in 1967 (Cohen & Marmilli, 1967). Theyfound a higher than normal proportion of chromosome breaks in aparanoid schizophrenic patient who had been treated with LSD 15times, as well as with chlorpromazine and other drugs; they alsofound that LSD caused chromosome breaks in leukocytes (whiteblood cells) artificially cultured in the laboratory. In therather overheated atmosphere of 1967, this paper gained animmediate celebrity and became the basis for a sensationalisticpropaganda campaign featuring pictures of deformed children. SomeLSD users switched to what they thought was mescaline orpsilocybin and in fact was almost always mislabeled LSD orphencyclidine (PCP). Many other studies of this subject have appeared and continueto appear; it would be impossible and pointless to review themall. The literature review published in Science by Norman I.Dishotsky and his colleagues in 1971 established the reassuringconclusions that are now generally accepted. Examining nearly ahundred papers, they found that LSD was a weak mutagen, effectiveonly at very high doses. It was not carcinogenic and did notcause chromosome damage in human beings at normal doses. Onestudy showed that it caused no more chromosome breaks inLaboratory-cultured cells than aspirin. Illicit drug users oftenhad more damaged chromosomes than control subjects; this wasattributable not to LSD but to malnutrition, infectious disease,and general ill health as well as possible impurities in streetdrugs. The few available prospective studies, mostly ofpsychiatric patients before and after LSD use, showed nochromosome damage. There was no evidence of a high rate of birthdefects in children of LSD users (Dishotsky et al., 1971). Thispaper is well known and adequately covers the research up to1971; later studies have allayed persisting doubts. There is alsono clear evidence that LSD or any other psychedelic drug causesbirth defects in the child when it is taken by a pregnant woman.Nevertheless, pregnant women should avoid all drugs, especiallyin the first three months. To sum up, then, bad trips and mild flashbacks are common andeven expected, but usually considered a nuisance—andoccasionally even an opportunity—rather than a danger. Moreserious but relatively rare problems are recurrent frighteningflashbacks, prolonged reactions (usually a few days but sometimesweeks or longer), suicides, and accidents. Thought and perceptionchanges occur in some chronic users, but it is hard to say whenthese are immediate drug effects and when they are the result ofreflection on the experience; in any case, they are rarelypathological and and almost never irreversible. There is no goodevidence of organic brain damage or genetic alterations. Thedangers are greatest for unstable personalities and inunsupervised settings. The most important limitation on the abuseof these drugs is the absence of a reliable euphoria, which meansthat people rarely go on using them, as they often go on usingstimulants and sedatives, in spite of repeated disasters. Badtrips usually become deterrents before they become dangerous. REFERENCES Cohen, S. Drugs of Hallucination. St. Albans, England:Paladin, 1970 (orig. 1965). Cohen, M.M., & Marmillo, M.J.

A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE: FACT OR FANTASY ? ALAN WATTS Since at least 1500 B.C. men have, from time totime, held the view that our normal vision of the world is ahallucination-a dream, a figment of the mind, or, to use theHindu word which means both art and illusion, a maya. Theimplication is that, if this is so, life need never be takenseriously. It is a fantasy, a play, a drama to be enjoyed. Itdoes not really matter, for one day (perhaps in the momentof death) the illusion will dissolve, and each one of us willawaken to discover that he himself is what there is and allthat there is-the very root and ground of the universe, or theultimate and eternal space in which things and events come andgo. This is not simply an idea which someone"thought up," like science fiction or a philosophicaltheory. It is the attempt to express an experience in whichconsciousness itself, the basic sensation of being "I,"undergoes a remarkable change. We do not know much about theseexperiences. They are relatively common, and arise in every partof the world. They occur to both children and adults. They maylast for a few seconds and come once in a lifetime, or they mayhappen repeatedly and constitute a permanent change ofconsciousness. With baffling impartiality they may descend uponthose who never heard of them, as upon those who have spent yearstrying to cultivate them by some type of discipline. They havebeen regarded, equally, as a disease of consciousness withsymptoms everywhere the same, like measles, and as a vision ofhigher reality such as comes in moments of scientific orpsychological insight. They may turn people into monsters andmegalomaniacs, or transform them into saints and sages. Whilethere is no sure way of inducing these experiences, a favorableatmosphere may be created by intense concentration, by fasting,by sensory deprivation, by hyper-oxygenation, by prolongedemotional stress, by profound relaxation, or by the use ofcertain drugs. Experiences of this kind underlie some of the greatworld religions-Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism in particular, and,to a much lesser extent, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Asexpressed in the doctrines of these religions, they purport to bean account of "the way things are" and therefore invitecomparison with descriptions of the universe and of man given byphysicists and biologists. They contradict common sense soviolently and are accompanied with such a powerful sense ofauthenticity and reality (more real than reality is acommon description) that men have always wondered whether theyare divine revelations or insidious delusions. This problem becomes all the more urgent now thatthe general public has become aware that experiences of this typeare available, with relative ease, through the use of suchchemicals as the so-called psychedelic drugs-LSD-25, mescaline,psilocybin, hashish, and marijuana, to name only the betterknown. The reality status of the modes of consciousness inducedby these chemicals becomes, then, a matter of most seriousconcern for the guardians of our mental health, for psychiatristsand psychologists, philosophers and ministers, for everyscientific investigator of the nature of consciousness, and,above all, for a large section of the general public curious andeager to get "the experience" for reasons of all kinds. A proper study of the question runs, at the verybeginning, into two obstacles. The first is that we know verylittle indeed about the structure and chemistry of the brain. Wedo not know enough of the ways in which it gleans informationabout the outside world and about itself to know whether thesechemicals help it (as lenses help the eyes) or confuse it. Thesecond is that the nature and use of these chemicals issurrounded with an immense semantic fog, whose density isincreased by people who ought to know better. I meanpsychiatrists. What we know, positively and scientifically, aboutpsychedelic chemicals is that they bring about certainalterations of sense perception, of emotional level and tone, ofidentity feeling, of the interpretation of sense data, and of thesensations of time and space. The nature of these alterationsdepends on three variables: the chemical itself (type anddosage), the psycho-physiological state of the subject, and thesocial and aesthetic context of the experiment. Theirphysiological side effects are minimal, though there areconditions (e.g., disease of the liver) in which some of them maybe harmful. They are not physiologically habit- forming in thesame way as alcohol and tobacco, though some individuals may cometo depend upon them for other (i.e., "neurotic")reasons. Their results are not easily predictable since theydepend so largely upon such imponderables as the setting, and theattitudes and expectations of both the supervisor and thesubject. The (enormous) scientific literature on the subjectindicates that a majority of people have pleasant reactions, alargish minority have unpleasant but instructive and helpfulreactions, while a very small minority have psychotic reactionslasting from hours to months. It has never been definitelyestablished that they have led directly to a suicide. (I amreferring specifically here to LSD-25, mescaline, the mushroomderivative psilocybin, and the various forms of cannabis,such as hashish and marijuana.) Thus what we know for certain implies that thesechemicals cannot be used without caution. But this appliesequally to antibiotics, whiskey, household ammonia, theautomobile, the kitchen knife, electricity, and matches. Noworthwhile life can be lived without risks, despite currentAmerican superstitions to the contrary-as that passing laws canprevent people from being immoral and that technological powercan be made foolproof. The question is therefore whether therisks involved in using these chemicals are worthwhile, and itseems to me that what is worthwhile should be judged not only interms of useful known edge or therapeutic effect, but also interms of simple pleasure. (I have heard addiction to musicdescribed in just the same vocabulary as addiction to drugs.) Ifit turns out that psychedelics offer valid ways of exploringman's "inner world," the hidden ways of the mind andbrain, we should surely admit that new knowledge of this inmostfrontier may be worth quite serious risks. Psychoses andcompulsive delusions are, after all, no more dangerous than theIndians and the mountain ranges that stood in the way of thefirst settlers of the American West. Psychiatrists often wonder why colleagues in otherbranches of medicine and specialists in other fields of sciencedo not take them quite seriously. A typical reason may be foundin their haste to define the nature and effects of thesechemicals in terms which are simply prejudicial, and which boildown to nothing more than gobbledygook with an authoritativerumble. For example, the chemicals in question are commonlyclassified as "hallucinogenics" or"psychotomimetics." The first word means that theygenerate hallucinations, and the second that their effectsresemble, or mimic, certain forms of psychosis or insanity. Onlyrarely do they give the impression of events in the externalworld which are not actually happening (i.e., hallucinations) andthe ten-year-old notion that they induce "modelpsychoses" such as temporary schizophrenia has long beenabandoned by those who are still in active research. But even ifthese findings were to be contested, the words"hallucination" and "psychosis" are loaded:they designate bad states of mind, whereas a cleanscientific language should say only that these chemicals inducedifferent and unusual states of mind. It is almost a standard joke that psychiatry haspejorative or "put-down" words for every human emotion,as "euphoric" for happy, "fixated" forinterested, and "compulsive" for determined. Thediscussion of psychedelic chemicals, both in the scientificliterature and the public press, is thoroughly swamped withquestion-begging language of this kind in articles that purportto be impartial and authoritative. Right from the start the veryword "drug," when used in this connection, evokes thesocially reprehensible image of people who are"drugged" or "doped"-glassy-eyed, staggering,or recumbent wrecks of humanity, withdrawn from reality into adiabolical paradise of bizarre or lascivious dreams. The image ofthe Fu Manchu opium den, with screaming meemies at the end of theline. Thus it is most common to find the action ofpsychedelics called "toxic" (i.e., poisonous), and thesensory and emotional changes induced referred to as"distortions," "delusive mechanisms,""dissociations," and "regressions," or as"loss of ego structure" and "abnormal perceptionof body image." This is the language of pathology. Usedwithout explicit qualification, it implies that a consciousnessso changed is sick. Likewise, when-in the context of a scientificarticle-the writer reports, "Subjects experienced religiousexaltation, and some described sensations of being one withGod," and leaves it at that, the implication is plainly thatthey went crazy. For in our own culture, to feel that you are Godis insanity almost by definition. But, in Hindu culture, whensomeone says, "I have just found out that I am God,"they say, "Congratulations! You at last got the point."Obviously, the word "God" does not mean the same thingin both cultures. Yet psychiatrists toss off such utterly damningremarks without scruple, and feel free to use their diagnosticjargon of mental pathology for states of consciousness which manyof them have never even bothered to experience. For they expectto get accurate information about these states from subjectsuntrained in scientific description, fearing that if theythemselves entered into any new mode of consciousness it wouldimpair their scientific objectivity. This is pure scholasticism,as when the theologians said to Galileo, "We will not lookthrough your telescope because we already know how the universeis ordered. If your telescope were to show us anything different,it would be an instrument of the devil." Similarly, so many practitioners of the inexactsciences (e.g., psychology, anthropology, sociology) let it beknown most clearly that they already know what reality is, andtherefore what sanity is. For these poor drudges reality is theworld of non-party: it is the reduction of the physical universeto the most banal and desiccated terms conceivable, in accordancewith the great Western myth that all nature outside the humanskin is a stupid and unfeeling mechanism. There is a sort of"official psychiatry" of the army, state mentalhospital, and of what, in California, they call"correctional facility" (i.e., prison), which defendsthis impoverished reality with a strange passion. To come, then, to any effective evaluation of thesechemicals and the changed states of consciousness and perceptionwhich they induce, we must begin with a highly detailed andaccurate description of what they do, both from the standpoint ofthe subject and of the neutral observer, despite the fact that inexperiments of this kind it becomes startlingly obvious that theobserver cannot be neutral, and that the posture of"objectivity" is itself one of the determinants of theoutcome. As the physicist well knows, to observe a process is tochange it. But the importance of careful description is that itmay help us to understand the kind or level of reality upon whichthese changes in consciousness are taking place. For undoubtedly they are happening. The dancing,kaleidoscopic arabesques which appear before closed eyes aresurely an observation of some reality, though not,perhaps, in the physical world outside the skin. But are theyrearranged memories? Structures in the nervous system? Archetypesof the collective unconscious? Electronic patterns such as oftendance on the TV screen? What, too, are the fern-like structureswhich are so often seen-the infinitude of branches upon branchesupon branches, or analogous shapes? Are these a glimpse of somekind of analytical process in the brain, similar to the wiringpatterns in a computer? We really have no idea, but the morecarefully observers can record verbal descriptions and visualpictures of these phenomena, the more likely that neurologists orphysicists or even mathematicians will turn up the physicalprocesses to which they correspond. The point is that thesevisions are not mere imagination, as if there had ever beenanything mere about imagination The human mind does not justperversely invent utterly useless images out of nowhere at all.Every image tells us something about the mind or the brain or theorganism in which it is found. The effects of the psychedelics vary so much fromperson to person and from situation to situation that it is wellnigh impossible to say with any exactitude that they createcertain particular and invariable changes of consciousness. Iwould not go so far as to say that the chemical effects aresimply featureless, providing no more than a vivid mirror toreflect the fantasies and unconscious dispositions of theindividuals involved. For there are certain types of change whichare usual enough to be considered characteristic of psychedelics:the sense of slowed or arrested time, and the alteration of"ego boundary"-that is, of the sensation of one's ownidentity. The feeling that time has relaxed its pace may, tosome extent, be the result of having set aside the better part ofa day just to observe one's own consciousness, and to watch forinteresting changes in one's perception of such ordinary thingsas reflected sunlight on the floor, the grain in wood, thetexture of linen, or the sound of voices across the street. Myown experience has never been of a distortion of theseperceptions, as in looking at oneself in a concave mirror. It israther that every perception becomes-to use a metaphor-moreresonant. The chemical seems to provide consciousness with asounding box, or its equivalent, for all the senses, so thatsight, touch, taste, smell, and imagination are intensified likethe voice of someone singing in the bathtub. The change of ego boundary sometimes begins fromthis very resonance of the senses. The intensification and"deepening" of color, sound and texture lends them apeculiar transparency. One seems to be aware of them more thanever as vibration, electronic and luminous. As this feelingdevelops it appears that these vibrations are continuous withone's own consciousness and that the external world is in someodd way inside the mindbrain. It appears, too, with overwhelmingobviousness, that the inside and the outside do not exclude oneanother and are not actually separate. They go together; theyimply one another, like front and back, in such a way that theybecome polarized. As, therefore, the poles of a magnet are theextremities of a single body, it appears that the inside and theoutside, the subject and the object, the self and the world, thevoluntary and the involuntary, are the poles of a single processwhich is my real and hitherto unknown self. This new self has nolocation. It is not something like a traditional soul, using thebody as a temporary house. To ask where it is, is likeasking where the universe is. Things in space have a where, butthe thing that space is in doesn't need to be anywhere. It issimply what there is, just plain basic isness! How easily, then, an unsophisticated person mightexclaim, "I have just discovered that I am God!" Yetif, during such an experience, one retains any critical facultiesat all, it will be clear that anyone else in the same state ofconsciousness will also be God. It will be clear, too, that the"God" in question is not the God of popular theology,the Master Technician who controls, creates, and understandseverything in the universe. Were it so, a person in this stateshould be able to give correct answers to all questions of fact.He would know the exact height of Mount Whitney in millimeters.On the other hand, this awareness of a deeper and universal selfwould correspond exactly with that other type of God whichmystics have called the "divine ground" of theuniverse, a sort of intelligent and superconscious spacecontaining the whole cosmos as a mirror contains images . . .though the analogy fails in so far as it suggests somethingimmense: we cannot picture sizelessness. Anyone moving into completely unfamiliar territorymay at first misunderstand and misinterpret what he sees, as isso evident from the first impressions of visitors to foreignlands where patterns of culture differ radically from their own.When Europeans depicted their first impressions of China, theymade the roofs of houses exaggeratedly curly and people's eyesslanted at least 45 degrees from the horizontal. Contrariwise,the Japanese saw all Europeans as red-haired, sunken-eyed goblinswith immensely long noses. But the unfamiliarities of foreigncultures are nothing to those of one's own inner workings. Whatis there in the experience of clear blue sky to suggest thestructure of the optical nerves? Comparably, what is there in thesound of a human voice on the radio to suggest the formations oftubes and transistors? I raise this question because it isobvious that any chemically induced alteration of the nervoussystem must draw the attention of that system to itself. I am notnormally aware that the sensation of blue sky is a state of theeyes and brain, but if I see wandering spots that are neitherbirds nor flying saucers, I know that these are an abnormalitywithin the optical system itself. In other words, I am enabled,by virtue of this abnormality, to become conscious of one of theinstruments of consciousness. But this is most unfamiliarterritory. Ordinarily, we remain quite unaware of the factthat the whole field of vision with its vast multiplicity ofcolors and shapes is a state of affairs inside our heads. Onlyeyes within a nervous system within a whole biological organismcan translate the particles and/or waves of the physical worldinto light, color, and form, just as only the skin of a drum canmake a moving hand go "Boom!" Psychedelics inducesubtle alterations of perception which make the nervous systemaware of itself, and the individual suddenly and unaccustomedlybecomes conscious of the external world as a state of his ownbody. He may even go so far as to feel a confusion between whatother people and things are doing, on the one hand, and his ownvolition, on the other. The particular feeling, or"cue," attached to thoughts and actions normallyunderstood to be voluntary may then be attached to what isordinarily classified as involuntary. (Similarly, in deja vuor "hasn't-this-happened-before?" experiences,perceptions of the immediate here and now come through with thecue or signal usually attached to memories.) Under such circumstances the naive observer mightwell take these impressions so literally as to feel that theuniverse and his own body are in fact one and the same,that he is willing everything that happens, and that he is indeedthe God of populartheology. If that were all, the psychedelicsmight certainly be dismissed as hallucinogens. We might concludethat they merely confuse the "wiring" of the nervoussystem in such a way that volition or "I-am-doing-this" signals get mixed up with messages about the externalworld. Yet the problem cannot be set aside so simply. Letus suppose that a biologist wants to make a very detailed andaccurate description of the behavior of some particular organism,perhaps of a sea bird feeding on the beach. He will be unable todescribe the behavior of the bird without also describing thebehavior of the water, of the sandworms or shellfish which thebird is eating, of seasonal changes of tide, temperature, andweather, all of which go together with the behavior of the bird.He cannot describe the behavior of the organism without alsodescribing the behavior of its environment. We used to attributethis to the fact that organisms are always reacting to thingsthat happen in their environments, and are even determined bytheir environments in all that they do. But this is to speak asif things were a collection of perfectly separate billiard ballsbanging against one another. Today, however, the scientist tendsmore and more to speak of the behavior of the organism and thebehavior of the environment as the behavior of a single"field," somewhat awkwardly named the"organism/environment." Instead of talking aboutactions and reactions between different things and events, heprefers to speak of transactions. In the transaction of buyingand selling, there is no selling unless there is simultaneouslybuying, and vice versa. The relation of organism toenvironment is also considered a transaction, because it has beenfound that living creatures exist only in a balanced relationshipto one another. The present natural state of this planet"goes with" the existence of human beings, just asbuying goes with selling. In any radically different environment,man could survive only by becoming a different type of being. The implications of this organism/environmentrelationship are somewhat startling, for what is really beingsaid is this: The entity we are describing is not an organism inan environment; it is a unified field or process, because it ismore simple and more convenient to think of what the organismdoes and what the environment does as a single"behavior." Now substitute for "entity we aredescribing" the idea of the self. I myself am not just whatis bounded by my skin. I myself (the organism) am what my wholeenvironmental field (the universe) is doing. It is, then, simplya convention, a fashion, an arbitrary social institution, toconfine the self to some center of decision and energy locatedwithin this bag of skin. This is no more than the rule of aparticular social game of cops and robbers, that is, of who shallwe praise and reward, and who shall we blame and punish? To playthis game, we pretend that the origin of actions is somethinginside each human skin. But only force of long ingrained habitmakes it hard to realize that we could define and actually feelourselves to be the total pattern of the cosmos as focussed orexpressed here. This would be a sense of our identityconsistent with the scientific description of man and otherorganisms. It would involve, too, the sensation that the externalworld is continuous with and one with our own bodies-a sensationvery seriously needed in a civilization where men are destroyingtheir environment by misapplied technology. This is thetechnology of man's conquest of nature, as if the externalworld were his enemy and not the very matrix in which he isbrought forth and sustained. This is the technology of the dustbowls, of polluted air, poisoned streams, chemical chickens,pseudo- vegetables, foam-rubber bread, and the total LosAngelization of man. Yet how is this long-ingrained sense of insularidentity to be overcome? How is twentieth-century man to gain afeeling of his existence consistent with twentieth-centuryknowledge? We need very urgently to know that we are notstrangers and aliens in the physical universe. We were notdropped here by divine whim or mechanical fluke out of some otheruniverse altogether. We did not arrive, like birds on barrenbranches; we grew out of this world, like leaves and fruit. Ouruniverse "humans" just as a rosebush"flowers." We are living in a world where men all overthe planet are linked by an immense network of communications,and where science has made us theoretically aware of ourinterdependence with the entire domain of organic and inorganicnature. But our ego-feeling, our style of personal identity, ismore appropriate to men living in fortified castles. There seems to me a strong possibility that thepsychedelics (as a medicine rather than a diet) may help us to"trigger" a new sense of identity, providing theinitial boost to get us out of the habit of restricting"I" to a vague center within the skin. That they makeus aware that our whole knowledge of the external world is astate of our own bodies is not a merely technical and trivialdiscovery. It is the obverse of the fact that our own bodies arefunctions, or behaviors, of the whole external world. This- atfirst-weird and mystical sensation of "unity with thecosmos" has been objectively verified. The mystic'ssubjective experience of his identity with "the All" isthe scientist's objective description of ecological relationship,of the organism/environment as a unified field. Our general failure (over the past three thousandyears of human history) to notice the inseparability of things,and to be aware of our own basic unity with the external world,is the result of specializing in a particular kind ofconsciousness. For we have very largely based culture andcivilization on concentrated attention, on using the mind as aspotlight rather than a floodlight, and by this means analyzingthe world into separate bits. Concentrated attention is drummedinto us in schools; it is essential to the three R's; it is thefoundation of all careful thought and detailed description, allhigh artistic technique and intellectual discipline. But theprice we pay for this vision of the world in vivid detail, bit bybit, is that we lose sight of the relationships and unitiesbetween the bits. Furthermore, a form of attention which looks atthe world bit by bit doesn't have time to examine all possiblebits; it has to be programmed (or prejudiced) to look only at significantbits, at things and events which are relevant to certainpreselected ends-survival, social or financial advancement, andother fixed goals which exclude the possibility of being open tosurprises, and to those delights which are extra special becausethey come without being sought. In my own experience, which is shared by very manyothers, the psychedelics expand attention. They make thespotlight of consciousness a floodlight which not only exposesignored relationships and unities but also brings to lightunsuspected details-details normally ignored because of theirlack of significance, or their irrelevance to some prejudice ofwhat ought to be. (For example, the tiniest hairs on people'sfaces and blotchy variations of skin color, not really supposedto be there, become marvelously visible.) There is thus goodreason to believe that the psychedelics are the opposite ofhallucinogens insofar as they decrease the selectivity of thesenses and expose consciousness to events beyond those that aresupposed to deserve notice. Time after time, this unprogrammed mode ofattention, looking at things without looking forthings, reveals the unbelievable beauty of the everyday world.Under the influence of programmed attention, our vision of theworld tends to be somewhat dusty and drab. This is for the samereason that staring at things makes them blurred, and thattrying to get the utmost out of a particular pleasure makes itsomething of a disappointment. Intense beauty and intensepleasure are always gratuitous, and are revealed only to sensesthat are not seeking and straining. For our nerves are notmuscles; to push them is to reduce their efficiency. What, finally, of the strong impression deliveredboth by the psychedelics and by many forms of mystical experiencethat the world is in some way an illusion? A difficulty here isthat the word "illusion" is currently usedpejoratively, as the negative of everything real, serious,important, valuable, and worthwhile. Is this because moralistsand metaphysicians are apt to be personality types lacking thelight touch? Illusion is related etymologically to the Latin ludere,to play, and thus is distinguished from reality as the drama isdistinguished from "real life." In Hindu philosophy,the world is seen as a drama in which all the parts-each person,animal, flower, stone, and star-are roles or masks of the onesupreme Self, which plays the lila or game of hide andseek with itself for ever and ever, dismembering itself as theMany and remembering itself as the One through endless cycles oftime, in the spirit of a child tossing stones into a pond througha long afternoon in summer. The sudden awakening of the mysticalexperience is therefore the one Self remembering itself as thereal foundation of the seemingly individual and separateorganism. Thus the Hindu maya, or world illusion, isnot necessarily something bad. Maya is a complex word signifyingthe art, skill, dexterity, and cunning of the supreme Self in theexercise of its playful, magical, and creative power. The powerof an actor so superb that he is taken in by his own performance.The Godhead amazing itself, getting lost in a maze. Classical illustrations of maya include theapparently continuous circle of fire made by a whirling torch,and of the continuity of time and moving events by the whirringsuccession of Asana, or atomic instants. Physicists use similarmetaphors in trying to explain how vibrating wavicles produce theillusion of solid material. The impenetrability of granite, theysay, is something like the apparently solid disk made by theblades of an electric fan: it is an intensely rapid motion of thesame minute orbits of light that constitute our fingers. Physicsand optics have also much to say about the fact that all reality,all existence is a matter of relationship and transaction.Consider the formula a b = Rainbow c where a is the sun, b is moisture inthe atmosphere, and c is an observer, all three being atthe same time in a certain angular relationship. Deduct any oneterm, a, b or c, or arrange them in positionsoutside the correct angular relationship, and the phenomenon"rainbow" will not exist. In other words, the actualexistence of rainbows depends as much upon creatures with eyes asit depends upon the sun and moisture in the atmosphere. Commonsense accepts this in respect to diaphanous things like rainbowswhich back off into the distance when we try to reach them. Butit has great difficulty in accepting the fact that chunky thingslike apartment buildings and basic things like time and spaceexist in just the same way-only in relation to certainstructures known as organisms with nervous systems. Our difficulty in accepting for ourselves soimportant a part in the actual creation or manifestation of theworld comes, of course, from this thorough habituation to thefeeling that we are strangers in the universe-that humanconsciousness is a fluke of nature, that the world is an externalobject which we confront, that its immense size reduces us topitiful unimportance, or that geological and astronomicalstructures are somehow more real (hard and solid?) thanorganisms. But these are actually mythological images of thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries-ideas which, for awhile, seemed extremely plausible, mostly for the reason thatthey appeared to be hard-boiled, down to earth and tough-minded,a currently fashionable posture for the scientist. Despite thelag between advanced scientific ideas and the common sense ofeven the educated public, the mythology of man as a hapless fluketrapped in a mindless mechanism is breaking down. The end of thiscentury may find us, at last, thoroughly at home in our ownworld, swimming in the ocean of relativity as joyously asdolphins in the water.

Bakalar Copyright Human Sciences Press 1983 One of the people we asked to write for this book repliedthat after long thought he had to decline, because he feared theeffect on his ability to support himself and his family if hesaid what he really thought about psychedelic drugs. This may bean unusually strong expression of a feeling that is more commonin milder forms. Anyone, whatever his views on the drugsthemselves, ought to recognize that it is an unhealthy situationin a free society. Even if this kind of fear is notcommon—even if it is not justified— the fact that itexists at all suggests something seriously wrong in our socialresponse to psychedelic drugs. They were once regarded by some asthe great liberating force of our time, the destined sacrament ofthe Aquarian Age, and by others as a threat to sanity andcivilized society. In the last 10 years, since the end of thepsychedelic craze, they have been neglected almost entirely. Allthese attitudes, as the essays in this anthology suggest, arewrong, but apparently they can still affect people's actions tothe point of self-censorship. It is hard to achieve balance in our thinking aboutpsychedelic drugs because the response to them is intimatelybound up with a whole set of attitudes about everything fromdrugs in general to mysticism in general. As a drug abuseproblem, LSD and its relatives are no longer a very seriousissue. There has probably been a moderate decline in illicit useof psychedelic drugs, and there has certainly been a substantialdecline in publicity about it. We are not ever likely to face anepidemic of psychedelic drug abuse again. The question now is nothow to get these drugs off the streets—which is probablyimpossible anyway—but how to get them back intolaboratories, hospitals, and other supervised settings. The ironybecomes obvious in rereading the public debates of the sixties.The most determined opponents of the drug culture and advocatesof restrictive legislation continually warn against allowing theconcern about abuse of psychedelic drugs to prevent legitimateresearch. But that is in effect what we have done. Uncontrolleduse continues, probably at the same level it would have reachedeven without the laws, while controlled legal use has becomeimpossible. We should arrange ways for people to take psychedelicdrugs responsibly under appropriate guidance within the law, anda way for those who want to administer them to volunteers fortherapeutic and general research to do so. This is not the placeto go into details about informed consent and selection,preparation, and training of subjects and guides. But it isimportant to keep in mind that from 1950 to 1962, when LSD andmescaline were more freely available within the law than they areever likely to be again, there were very few reports of adversereactions. To discuss how to handle the problem of psychedelic drugswithin the present system of rules and institutions, however, isto suggest what a restricted and historically peculiar system itis. LSD and its relatives are treated for research purposes verymuch like a new antibiotic, as medicines to be tested forspecific, concrete, limited efficacy and safety and accepted orrejected on that basis. In other words, the model is Westernphysical medicine of the last 50 years. Compare the great varietyof more or less successful alternatives: Huichol peyoteceremonies, Mazatec curing rites vision quests, psycholytictherapy sessions, the Native American Church. These are thearrangements that arise naturally in any culture where the drugsare not suppressed, and analogues of them were developing amongus even when the LSD abuse problem was at its height. They stillexist, but they have been driven underground, and we haveeffectively foreclosed our choices. For us anything called a drugmust be either a simple medicine or a "drug of abuse."Evaluating psychedelic drugs in the same way that we evaluateaspirin will always be enormously to their disadvantage, sincethey do not bring guaranteed relief for any simply definedproblem. The Mexican Indian who said, "Aspirin is a drug,peyote is sacred," was making a distinction that our laws donot permit. Using different analogies makes the anomalies in our laws andattitudes obvious. For example, as a voyage and an adventure,taking LSD might be compared to flying a plane or climbing amountain. Psychedelic drug use as a form of spiritual orpsychological exploration might be compared with methods likekundalina yoga, Tantra, or the more emotionally intense forms ofpsychotherapy, all of which induce drastic changes inconsciousness that may occasionally endanger emotional stabilityfor the sake of some alleged insight, awakening, or realization.Even psychoanalysis can produce psychotic reactions. Yet no oneconsiders outlawing any of these practices. To many peoplefamiliar with psychedelic drugs, such comparisons seem moreappropriate than an analogy with antibiotics or aspirin, or evenwith drugs used mainly for pleasure or because of addiction . Consider another analogy. Imagine that no one has everremembered his dreams before, except a few widely ignoredmystics, primitives, and madmen. Then someone invents anelectrical gadget that permits them to be recalled. At first,dreams come as a revelation. People who use the machine areoverwhelmed by their depth of emotion and symbolic significance.They rush out to look up the obscure literature about thisneglected state of awareness. Psychologists discover that dreamsare the royal road to the unconscious. Others examine them forprophecies, philosophies, and religions, clues to personalsalvation and social revolution. Meanwhile, there are the manywho have never remembered their dreams and do not understand whyanyone considers them important or useful; they declare it allmental illness and social decadence, and demand that the machinesbe outlawed. Ultimately the dreamers too become somewhatdisillusioned. Remembering and interpreting dreams provides nosure cure for any illness and no obvious alternative view of theworld. Their meaning for art, philosophy, and religion isambiguous. Many dreams are unpleasant or frightening. Peoplesometimes act foolishly in following the commands of theirdreams. Some dream interpretation is superstitious, some of thepopular dream interpreters are of dubious character, and some ofthe dream cults have repellent practices. Dreams are not theanswer. One possible outcome is that we decide to record and studydreams, relate them to other states of consciousness and toneurophysiology, find out their possible scientific, therapeutic,and creative uses, and so on, while cautioning againstovervaluation of them. Another possibility is withdrawing infear, declaring that we were meant to forget our dreams and thatremembering them is pathological and socially debilitating, andfinally suppressing the means by which they are remembered. Wehave removed a source of disturbance, at the price of denyingpart of our own potential. Psychedelic drugs resemble thisimaginary machine. They sometimes allow people to see thingsabout themselves that they did not know before, without tellingthem how to interpret and act on what they see. We have thechoice of ignoring and suppressing this knowledge or finding waysto make use of it. One of the main problems is that we have no appropriateclassification for psychedelic drugs. We cannot regard them asdivine: should we then treat them like aspirin or heroin? Arethey outlawed because we fear drugs, or because we fear thesocial effects of altered states of awareness, religiousintensity, and mysticism? LSD use may be conceived as part of adrug problem that also includes something as utterly different asheroin addiction; it may also be seen as part of a social trendtoward irrationalist religious enthusiasm combined with scorn forgainful labor and political participation; and these fears are inpractice inextricably entangled. In modern society we are uneasy about experiences we cannotquickly classify. We are unwilling to tolerate much ambiguity,for example, about whether an activity is religious ritual,medicinal, or recreation, and our legal arrangements depend onthese classifications. Use of psychoactive drugs in general andof psychedelic drugs in particular crosses these lines andmuddies these distinctions, and that appears as a threat tocontrol and rationality, a problem for the law and society. Wehave chosen, in effect, to divide psychoactive drugs into threecategories: first, medicines, second, drugs that may be used forpleasure (alcohol is the main example) and third, so-called drugsof abuse, a few of which also have medical uses. Psychedelicdrugs have been classified as drugs of abuse without medicaluses, and our legal and social attitudes toward them follow fromthat. Some of the hostility to psychedelic drugs, especiallyamong people who are unsophisticated about them, is based on theassumption that they are just another exotic vice providingenviable but dangerous thrills, which like all such stereotypicalvices can also drive the user into addiction, madness, anddespair . But at a deeper level the social response to psychedelicdrugs is also connected with their users' tendency to revert toreligious language and interpretations in talking about them. Theidea of drug use as a religious practice—in fact, of anyconnection between drugs and religion—is one we are willingto indulge in preindustrial cultures but violently reject forourselves. Orthodox religion in the West long ago abandoned thesacramental use of drugs, so during the psychedelic era thisfield was appropriated by sects, eclectic or syncretic, whichchallenged the hegemony of established medical and police rules.The "LSD priest" (Timothy Leary's term) who led a"drug cult" was in effect a rival of the physician inimporting and applying expertise on drugs. The old calling ofpriesthood or shamanism invaded territory claimed by modernmedical professionals. Modern medicine was even likened to astate religion, with imposing organized strength, anintellectually powerful ideology, an ability to create andsustain faith, and the all-important support of civil authority;it was said to treat unorthodox healing practices as heresy orpagan superstition to be eliminated by a mixture of officialcoercion and missionary activity. A religious war in whichmedicine served as the ideological arm of cultural orthodoxy wassaid to be disguised by scientific terminology and talk abouthealth hazards. These quasi-religious disputes suggest that our attitudestoward psychedelic drugs involve response to certain kinds ofexperience as well as certain substances. We have a mysticismproblem as well as a drug problem, and its historical causes areolder and more complicated than the causes of the drugcontroversy. Mystical, messianic, and shamanistic religion alwayscomes into conflict with established authority after socialevolution has reached the stage of hierarchical state systems.Any contact with divinity not subject to priestly mediation andformulation in terms of traditional doctrines appears as a threatto the political and social order, and may be classified asmadness or vice. It is feared that all accepted standards will beabandoned in a frenzied search for some individual or communalself-realization. The potential challenge to social order in all forms ofreligious intoxication, drug-induced or not, is augmented byspecial characteristics of modern Western society. Max Weberdiscovered a cultural foundation of modernity in the Protestantethic of inner-worldly asceticism, which developed at about thesame time as the scientific revolution. The Protestant ethicdemands the attainment of salvation by work and activityaccording to rational norms within this world. In identifyingreligious duty with rule-governed mastery of everyday life, itopposes all forms of otherworldliness in religion, including theother-worldly asceticism of desert saints; it also opposes allmysticism, for in mysticism the highest virtue is to be possessedrather than active, a vessel rather than an instrument ofdivinity. Both conservatives and radicals in a society devoted tothe extension of rule-governed control over the external worldare likely to see great dangers in mystical and messianicreligion, either because it is too passive and socially quietist,or simply because it may tend to devaluate everyday life andeconomic activity. This mistrust of religious virtuosity, whether it takes thegeneric or the specifically modern form, should not be regardedas mere cowardice, intellectual rigidity, or defense ofestablished privilege. As the sadder aspects of hippie cultureshowed, all standards of truth and social responsibility may beabandoned in the search for spiritual revitalization by means ofmagic, myth, and mystery. Mysticism claiming ineffability is acommon form of rebellion in rationalistic ages like our own; itcan be useful in moderating the excessive pretensions ofintellect, but the danger is that it will turn into a mere pleaof impotence: a denial of reason and an admission of incapacityto cope with social problems that takes the form of quietism ormessianic fanaticism So the belief that psychedelic religiosity may cause abreakdown of social order (as conservatives fear) or abandonmentof the struggle for social change (as radicals fear) is no moreand no less reasonable than the fear of a breakdown of individualmental stability during a drug trip; in some circumstances itcould be justified. But for the most part these circumstances donot now exist. As the essays in this book prove, the visionachieved in ecstatic states usually depends for its socialcontent on the intellectual set that is brought to it; once itrecedes it can serve as a backdrop for action as well aspassivity, and for moderate as well as extreme action. If the self-image of modern Western society cannot easilyaccommodate virtuoso religion and mysticism, it also precludesthe suppression of virtuoso religion and mysticism. Liberalprinciples demand free speech, freedom of worship, and the rightof privacy. The government does not claim to know what sorts ofexperiences and thoughts its subjects should and should notcultivate. But drugs are a special case. We do not admit, even toourselves, that outlawing psychedelic drugs could be in part anattempt to eliminate certain kinds of experience and thinking. Byregarding them as merely exotic vice, dangerous instruments, orpoisonous substances, we avoid the issue. Therefore, in the caseof drugs, the liberal principles that prevent expression of thetypical modern distrust of enthusiastic and mystical religion bylegally suppressing it do not operate. Psychedelic drugs are a borderline case in manyways—therapeutically, intellectually, and socially. Thecomponents of research, therapy, religion, and recreation intheir use are hard to separate (the awkward term"consciousness-expansion" is an attempt to define arole for them by avoiding all these familiar categories). Sincewe do not know where to place them, they become an easy targetfor confused fears about drugs in general or matters unrelated todrugs. For example, the idea has been suggested that centersshould be established where people could go to take psychedelicdrugs in a safe environment. But are these centers conceived asanalogous to resorts, amusement parks, psychiatric clinics,religious retreats, Outward Bound expeditions, or scientificresearch institutions? Without any further examination, the veryambiguity of purpose is enough to create hostility and suspicion.And in this field liberal governments feel justified in assertingthemselves with the kind of confidence that only despoticgovernments display with respect to other social questions. Our legal and political institutions, like our naturalscience and psychiatry, are failing to supply the complexresponse these complex drugs demand. We should show moreconfidence in our capacity to tolerate and make use of them. Thatdemands, first, a more consistent application of liberalprinciples. We need to produce a suitable balance betweenindividual choice and protective authority, and in doing this itis probably useless to try to find replacements for the existinginadequate conceptual categories. We simply have to tolerate someopenly recognized ambiguity in dealing with psychedelic drugs.The old forms of religious justification, for example, areobviously no longer plausible. Except for a few isolatedindividuals and groups like the peyote church, intoxication canno longer be sacred in the primitive and ancient sense, no matterhow intensely religious it may seem as pure experience. Too muchhas been changed by the intellectual and social revolutions ofthe modern age; there is no point in mourning the loss, if it isone. But we have something to learn from religious forms of druguse, especially about the protective and assimilative function ofceremony. Preindustrial societies might also have something toteach us about the proper balance between democracy and authorityin managing psychedelic drugs. When primary religious experienceis no longer restricted to specially qualified charismaticindividuals, the resulting democratization presents specialdangers and opportunities. The danger is that everyone will thinkhimself qualified to start his own religion, as Timothy Learyonce half-facetiously recommended, and some sort of authority andtradition is needed to avoid this parody of liberalindividualism. For example, in his last novel, Island, Aldous Huxleytried to salvage a communal significance for the drug experienceby imagining a utopia in which psychedelic drugs play an integralpart. On his fictitious island in the Indian Ocean, adecentralized political system and a Western science andtechnology stripped of their excesses are guided by a Buddhistphilosophical/religious tradition, with the help of a psychedelicdrug called moksha medicine that is used on carefully definedoccasions, especially by the dying and in initiation rites.Huxley's utopia avoids the danger of excessive individualism byan emphasis on community, discipline, and tradition in the use ofpsychedelic drugs. The usefulness of the drug depends on thequality of the social system and not the other way around. Healso avoids the cultural limitations of primitive mythologies andcommunities by incorporating the most tolerant and ecumenical ofthe great world religions and the most universally applicablebody of human intellectual achievement. Unfortunately, Huxley is pessimistic about his own solution,at least for the short run. His utopia survives only because itis an island that has been fortunately isolated for generationsfrom the malevolent forces of the modern world. In the moving andhorrifying final chapter, it is destroyed in a coup d'etat by aneighboring ruler who represents Oil, Progress, Spiritual Values(Huxley's ironic capital letters), military force, lyingpropaganda, and demagogic tyranny in a combination with all theworst features of capitalism, communism, and third-worldnationalism. If the fate of Huxley's island turns out to be thefate of the world, there will certainly be no place in it forpsychedelic drugs. Whatever their dangers and potential forabuse, they are worse than useless to a modern despotism. UnlikeHuxley's earlier invention,soma, they do not reconcile theuser to a routine or keep the fires of the intellect and passionburning low. On the other hand, the hippie idea of druggingourselves into individual and social salvation is obviouslyillusory, and Huxley certainly did not mean to promote thatillusion. Something in the nature of our society and of the drug tripitself tends to make us fall into attitudes of worshipful awe orfrightened contempt when thinking about psychedelic drugs. It isas though they had to be either absolutely central or beyond theperiphery of normal human experience. But in primitive shamanismthat is not what happens; instead, at least ideally, "theotherwise unfettered power of the world beyond human society isharnessed purposefully and applied to minister to the needs ofthe community." (Lewis, 1971, p. 189). That is just whattechnology, including drug technology, is supposed to do in oursociety. We should find a modest role for psychedelic drugs, notdeifying or demonizing or ignoring them, and distinguishingrational from irrational fears. The metaphysical hunger thatprovides one reason for the interest in these drugs is apermanent human condition, not an aberration that is created bythe drugs nor one that can be eliminated by suppressing them.Huxley's Island expresses not faith in psychedelic drugs,which would be a form of idolatry, but hope for mankind. Itdramatizes the conviction that the drugs can be used, rather thancondemned and neglected, and that finding a way to use them wellis a test for humanity. We should use our resources ofintelligence, imagination, and moral discernment to face thattest. REFERENCES Clark, W., Lieff, J., Lieff, C., & Sussman, R.Psychedelic research: Obstacles and values .

YES, WE ARE ZOMBIES, BUT WE CAN BECOME CONSCIOUS! Charles T. Tart Introduction by Peter Webster In seeking to explore the elusive nature of consciousness, philosophers have sometimes resorted to "thought experiments," much as physicists do when thinking about the enigmas of relativity. Todd C. Moody, associate professor in philosophy at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, recently contributed a paper to The Journal of Consciousness Studies in which he proposed such a thought experiment. Professor Moody's ideas sparked a lively debate in the on-line discussion forum of the Journal, and led to a published Symposium on the subject of his paper which was entitled, "Conversations with Zombies". (JCS, 1, (2), pp. 196-200, available at http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint) Moody's thought experiment was an attempt to understand whether, and perhaps how, consciousness might be a phenomenon independent from or non-essential to the processes of the nervous system and associated behavior. Would it be possible that a computer, or some hypothetical being, might have all the behavioral attributes and powers of a conscious human yet lack the self-awareness, and awareness of awareness that we call consciousness? In sum, Moody proposed at least the theoretical and philosophical existence of "zombies," beings behaviorally identical to humans, yet lacking consciousness. One of the contributors to the Symposium, Charles T. Tart, submitted a short commentary inspired by ideas often expressed in Sufism, Zen, or other Eastern philosophies: that most human beings are, most of the time, not at all fully conscious, and require techniques such as meditation to awaken them from that functional but often profoundly unsatisfying state of normal everyday awareness. Professor Tart has written extensively on such subjects as meditation, hypnosis, dreams, and the use of psychedelics in the production of Altered States of Consciousness, (the title of one of his books). His contribution to The Journal of Consciousness Studies Symposium is reproduced here with the permission of the publisher, Keith Sutherland (Imprint Academic). Journal of Consciousness Studies, 2 (4), 1995, pp.361-5 YES, WE ARE ZOMBIES, BUT WE CAN BECOME CONSCIOUS! Observations on Moody's 'Conversations with Zombies' Charles T. Tart Institute of Transpersonal Psychology 744 San Antonio Road, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA. E-mail: cttart@ucdavis.edu Moody (1994) ends his provocative article on 'Conversationswith zombies' by raising the possibility that 'We might, afterall, be zombies'. By zombies he means creatures who appear to actintelligently, like us, but who have no internal experience ofconsciousness. My basic point in this brief commentary will be tonote as a basic observation that we are indeed, as a matter ofverifiable fact, like zombies most of the time but we havea possibility of becoming conscious. The consequences of thisobservable and testable reality are of enormous importance forthe development of a fuller understanding of consciousness andits possibilities. The approach I take here is empirical andscientific, rather than philosophical. By 'science' I mean anapproach to understanding all of reality that putsabsolute and primary emphasis on observables, whether theseobservables are external or internal to the observer, andsecondary emphasis on conceptual understanding. That is, creatingan elegant and logical understanding of something, a theory, isfine, but if that understanding does not account for allof the relevant observations, both postdictively andpredictively, that's too bad for the theory, not theobservations. My understanding of scientific method, and someimportant aspects of its application to the investigation ofaltered states of consciousness, has been described in detailelsewhere (Tart, 1972). This approach is hardly unique to me:except for the observation of how many 'scientists' there seem tobe who subrate or refuse to look at data which does not accordwith their theoretical convictions, I had always thought this wasthe generally agreed-upon definition of what constituted science. To illustrate this primacy of observation: atthe beginning of my career, as a graduate student, I beganextensive research on the effects of post-hypnotic suggestions onnocturnal dreaming (Tart, 1962; 1963). In the course of reviewingthe literature, I came across a monograph by a philosopher(Malcolm, 1959) which logically and conclusively proved thatthere were no such things as dreams: I had nightmares about itall that night! Since then I have come to realize that one canprobably build a convincing and 'logical' case for almostanything, especially if the conclusions appeal to one's hiddenprejudices. Thus I seldom pay much attention to arguments aboutconsciousness unless they work intimately and usefully with the fullrange of relevant observables. Zombies Moody notes that Zombies are, in relation to us, in the same predicament that most of us are in relation to those mystics who report back to us their experiences of what is sometimes called superconsciousness. We can ape what they say if we want to, but we don't really know what we are talking about. This difficulty is sometimes referred to in the mystical literature as 'ineffability', but the mystics understand each other, just as human non-zombies do. (p. 200.) I would describe myself as an empiricist andscientist and a very practical person, not the kind of person wepopularly associate with the term 'mystic'. I do not feel I am insome special relation to a Higher Power or God, am not subject tosudden states of ecstasy, and do not have any special, 'holy'doctrine to defend. But as a result of more than 30 years ofobservations, both external and internal, I would like to reportthat: • Ordinary, 'normal' consciousness is indeed a zombie-like state of greatly constricted and distorted, if not absent, 'consciousness'. I have given such ordinary consciousness the technical name of 'consensus consciousness' in the purely descriptive sense and 'consensus trance' when focusing on it as a restricted state (Tart, 1975, 1986, 1994). • I know from personal experience that there is a transient and perhaps permanent 'awakening' from consensus trance/consciousness, a clarification or lucidity, that is rewarding and adaptive in itself, as well as vividly illustrating the zombie-like qualities of ordinary consciousness. Although it is hard to describe this condition or state (it's more process than concrete state), for this paper we will refer to it as the 'expanded consciousness state'. The term Moody used, 'superconsciousness', is too grandiose for the experiences I speak of from direct knowledge. Such experiences also exist, but need not concern us in this paper. • People in this expanded consciousness state or process seem indeed to understand each other fairly well, even though what they communicate may sometimes seem ineffable to those in ordinary, zombie-like consciousness. Here I must make a vital point: the above threeobservations are of quite limited value and possibly misleadingif one only thinks about them. But they can be understood andverified through training and experience. Such experientialunderstanding need not be limited to strange and unusual people,such as the connotations of terms like 'mystics' bear. To illustrate: In the early 1970s, I took anumber of classes on meditation from a Tibetan lama, TarthangTulku, living in Berkeley. One of the practice instructions hefrequently referred to was to look for the 'space betweenthoughts'. I found the concept of the space between thoughtsfascinating. For one thing, it was of great theoreticalsignificance if thoughts were discrete entities with a gapbetween them, rather than continuous, as I had previouslyexperienced them. It also made sense that if one could find sucha space, it could produce a sort of liberation from the tyrannythat thoughts often produced as they captured one's attention. Ihad many interesting and exciting thoughts during my attempts atmeditation about what this space between thoughts would be likeand its possibilities. But I never experienced any gap or spacebetween my thoughts. I have always tried to be as honest as possiblewith myself, as well as with others, as both an essential part ofmy scientific activity and as a guideline for living. EventuallyI had to admit to myself that I was fascinated by the conceptof a space between thoughts but that, for all practical purposes,there was no observable space between my thoughts. While Ihad fantasies about what such an experience would be like, I hadno real knowledge of it at all. Expanded Consciousness State Twenty years later I can report that I have now experiencedthe space between thoughts many times, that I can often produceand prolong that expanded consciousness state, to variousdegrees, at will, and that from within that kind of`spaciousness', it is clear that my ordinary consciousness, whereI live 99+% of my life, is indeed zombie-like. Yet in this stateof zombie consciousness, which is `normal' for our civilization,I am generally considered an intelligent, articulate andsuccessful person. I am, in not quite the way I believe heintended it, a living illustration of Moody's point aboutzombies, viz. 'They engage in complex behaviours, very similar toours, but these behaviours are not accompanied by consciousexperience of any sort.' These behaviours can, unfortunately,include talking and writing about 'awakening' and 'higherconsciousness', i.e. actually being in this more conscious stateis a quite distinct thing from conceptualizing about it. That is,it is easier to have fantasies about being in a state of expandedconsciousness rather than actually living it. To be more precise, I am ordinarily consciousin consensus trance by normal, social standards of consciousness:internal experiences accompany most of my behaviour, oftenincluding the intellectual knowledge that I am having specificsorts of experiences — what we usually callself-consciousness. I think, I plan, I remember, I experiencesensations, I experience pleasure and pain, hope and fear. So Iam not a zombie in Moody's particular use of the term. But fromthe perspective of the (usually fleeting but sometimes longer)state of the gap between thoughts, of 'awakening' in Gurdjieff'ssense (Ouspensky, 1949; Tart, 1986, 1994), my ordinary state ofconsciousness is zombie-like in the general pejorative sense ofthe term. These zombie qualities include: (a) a greatly reducedsense of aliveness and vitality; (b) a great narrowing ofperspective and perception; (c) a consuming psychologicalidentification with some small subset of my full potential; (d)reduced intelligence stemming from this narrow perspective andidentification; and (e) a selfishness, a self-centredness ascompared to a more open and compassionate attention to the restof reality. The Dream Analogy To try to further communicate some of the differences betweenthe more 'awakened' state and ordinary consciousness, let me usethe traditional analogy drawn in Eastern enlightenment traditionsbetween nocturnal dreaming and ordinary waking. During a dream, we almost always take what ishappening as real. We are a real self having experiences within areal world. When the dream situation is pleasant, fine, when itis unpleasant, we suffer. When we wake up to ordinary wakingconsciousness, however, we realize that the dream state was aquite inferior state of consciousness in that (a) we did not knowour true condition, viz. dreaming; (b) we were not our usual`real' self; (c) capacities we take for granted in the wakingstate, such as ability to reason and draw up relevant memoriesand skills were absent or distorted; and (d) our dream sufferingand problems were pseudo-suffering and pseudo-problems, and werecured not on their own terms but by waking up to our realidentity and situation in the waking world. Similarly, in moments or periods of that 'spacebetween thoughts' or expanded consciousness, I feel that I havebeen unconscious (a) of my true condition (lost in the limited)and of (b) my real identity (a non-verbalizable, non-concretesense of openness and process, rather than thingness); (c)deprived of a clear perception and straightforward responsivenessto the world; and (d) often suffering over 'problems' that werenot real, that only existed by virtue of my constricted mentalcondition. Observational Status of these Points I shall make no attempt to argue or reason in support of theabove statements. Part of the understanding I have come to in mythree decades of research on consciousness is that reasoning andlogic (following rules, given a priori assumptions), while veryuseful in a multitude of ways, are only a part of thetotality of conscious functioning and this part cannot reduce thewhole of consciousness to its terms. So, in the spirit ofscience, the above are offered as observations that the readercan potentially validate for herself if she is interested indoing so. Space limitations here do not allow discussions ofmethods, but the literature of the slowly growing field oftranspersonal psychology has many such discussions, as does thetraditional mystical literature. The methods that have workedwell for me are described in two books (Tart, 1986, 1994). I havealso found these methods for enhancing mindfulness in everydaylife quite teachable to selected graduate students. Excellentintroductions to mindfulness meditation, an important aspect ofmethod, are (Goldstein, 1987, 1994; Goldstein & Kornfield,1987; Kabat-Zinn, 1990; 1994; Kornfield, 1993; LeShan, 1975;Salzberg, 1995). Will our Study of Consciousness go beyond ConsciousnessZ? In his final paragraph, Moody speculates: Consider the possibility that a few zombies might discover a discipline that, after considerable practice, turns them into non-zombies like us. It would presumably be difficult to convince other zombies that such a discipline has any point, and it would be quite easy for the zombies to dismiss the phenomenon as marginal or pathological. The zombie scenario does not prove the `validity' of mystical experience, whatever that might mean, but it does entail that such experience cannot be dismissed on the grounds of its radical unfamiliarity to the rest of us. We might, after all, be zombies. (p. 200.) The interested reader is invited to experimentwith 'awakening', with finding the spaciousness between thoughts(not to be confused with a suppression of thought or simpleblankness) that gives a much wider scope to our understanding ofconsciousness. I believe everyone has had at least fleetingmoments of expanded consciousness, even if largely forgotten inthe hectic rush of zombie lifeZ, and this commentaryis to remind you of them and their importance. If we do notdevelop this wider perspective, we shall, in Moody's terms, justhave our zombie science of consciousnessZ, thoughtZ,feelingZ, hopeZ, fearZ, lifeZand deathZ. Speaking from my occasional experiences ofexpanded consciousness, that would be sad indeed. References Goldstein, J.

Watts An excerpt from In My Own Way An Autobiography, 1915—1965 �1972 by Alan Watts. Pantheon Books On returning to America [in 1958] I wasintroduced to psychiatric adventures of a very different order,for Aldous Huxley had recently published Doors of Perceptionabout his experiment with mescaline, and had by this time gone onto explore the mysteries of LSD. Gerald Heard had joined him inthese investigations, and in my conversations with them I noticeda marked change of spiritual attitude. To put it briefly, theyhad ceased to be Manicheans. Their vision of the divine nowincluded nature, and they had become more relaxed and humane, sothat I found myself talking to men of my own persuasion. Yet itstruck me as highly improbable that a true spiritual experiencecould follow from ingesting a particular chemical. Visions andecstasies, yes. A taste of the mystical, like swimming withwaterwings, perhaps. And perhaps a reawakening for someone whohad made the journey before, or an insight for a person wellpracticed in something like Yoga or Zen. Nevertheless, on these "inner planes" Iam of an adventurous nature, and am willing to give most things atry. Both Aldous and my former student at the Academy,mathematician John Whittelsey, were in touch with Keith Ditman,psychiatrist in charge of LSD research at the UCLA department ofneuropsychiatry. John was working with him as statistician in aproject designed both to test the effect of the drug onalcoholics and to make a map of its effects on the humanorganism. So many of their subjects had reported states ofconsciousness that read like accounts of mystical experience thatthey were interested in trying it out on "experts" inthis field, even though a mystic is never really expert in thesame way as a neurologist or a philologist, for his work is not acataloguing of objects. But I qualified as an expert insofar as Ihad also a considerable intellectual knowledge of the psychologyand philosophy of religion: a knowledge that subsequentlyprotected me from the more dangerous aspects of this adventure,giving me a compass and something of a map for this wildterritory. Furthermore, I trusted Keith Ditman. He wasn't scared,like so many Jungians, of the unconscious. Nor was he foolhardy,but seemed level-headed, cautious, tentative in opinion, yetlively, bright-eyed, and intensely interested in his work. We made, then, an initial experiment at Keith'soffice in Beverly Hills in which I was joined by Edwin Halsey,formerly private secretary to Ananda Coomaraswamy, and thenteaching comparative religions at Claremont. We each took onehundred micrograms of d-lysergic acid diethylamide-25, courtesyof the Sandoz Company, and set out on an eight-hour exploration.For me the journey was hilariously beautiful—as if I and allmy perceptions had been transformed into a marvelous arabesque ormultidimensional maze in which everything became transparent,translucent, and reverberant with double and triple meanings.Every detail of perception became vivid and important, even umsand ers and throat-clearing when someone read poetry, and timeslowed down in such a way that people going about their businessoutside seemed demented in failing to see that the destination oflife is this eternal moment. We walked across the street to awhite, Spanish-style church, surrounded with olive trees andgleaming in the sun against a sky of absolute, primordial blue,and saw the grass and the plants as inexplicably geometrized inevery detail so as to suggest that nothing in nature wasdisordered. We went back and looked at a volume of Chinese andJapanese sumi, or black-ink paintings, all of which seemedto be perfectly accurate photographs. There were even highlightsand shadows on Mu-ch'i's persimmons that were certainly notintended by the artist. At one time Edwin felt somewhatoverwhelmed and remarked, "I just can't wait until I'mlittle old me again, sitting in a bar." In the meantime hewas looking like an incarnation of Apollo in a supernaturalnecktie, contemplatively holding an orange lily. (1) All in all my first experience was aesthetic ratherthan mystical, and then and there—which is, alas, rathercharacteristic of me—I made a tape for broadcast saying thatI had looked into this phenomenon and found it most interesting,but hardly what I would call mystical. This tape was heard by twopsychiatrists at the Langley-Porter Clinic in San Francisco,Sterling Bunnell and Michael Agron, who thought I shouldreconsider my views. After all, I had made only one experimentand there was something of an art to getting it really working.It was thus that Bunnell set me off on a series of experimentswhich I have recorded in The Joyous Cosmology, and in thecourse of which I was reluctantly compelled to admit that—atleast in my own case—LSD had brought me into an undeniablymystical state of consciousness. But oddly, considering myabsorption in Zen at the time, the flavor of these experienceswas Hindu rather than Chinese. Somehow the atmosphere of Hindumythology and imagery slid into them, suggesting at the same timethat Hindu philosophy was a local form of a sort of undercoverwisdom, inconceivably ancient, which everyone knows in the backof his mind but will not admit. This wisdom was simultaneouslyholy and disreputable, and therefore necessarily esoteric, and itcame in the dress of a totally logical, obvious, and basic commonsense. In sum I would say that LSD, and such otherpsychedelic substances as mescaline, psilocybin, and hashish,confer polar vision; by which I mean that the basic pairs ofopposites, the positive and the negative, are seen as thedifferent poles of a single magnet or circuit. This knowledge isrepressed in any culture that accentuates the positive, and isthus a strict taboo. It carries Gestalt psychology, which insistson the mutual interdependence of figure and background, to itslogical conclusion in every aspect of life and thought; so thatthe voluntary and the involuntary, knowing and the known, birthand decay, good and evil, outline and inline, self and other,solid and space, motion and rest, light and darkness, are seen asaspects of a single and completely perfect process. Theimplication of this may be that there is nothing in life to begained or attained that is not already here and now, animplication thoroughly disturbing to any philosophy or culturewhich is seriously playing the game which I have called White MustWin. Polar vision is thus undoubtedly dangerous—butso is electricity, so are knives, and so is language. When animmature person experiences the identity of the voluntary and theinvoluntary, he may feel, on the one hand, utterly powerless, oron the other, equal to the Hebrew-Christian God. If the former,he may panic from the sense that no one is in charge of things.If the latter, he may contract offensive megalomania.Nevertheless, he has had immediate experience of the fact thateach one of us is an organism-environment field, of which the twoaspects, individual and world, can be separated only for purposesof discussion. If such a person sees thus clearly the mutualityof good and evil, he may jump to the conclusion that ethicalprinciples are so relative as to be without validity—whichmight be utterly demoralizing for any repressed adolescent.Fortunately for me, my God was not so much the Hebrew-Christianautocrat as the Chinese Tao, "which loves and nourishes allthings, but does not lord it over them." I hesitated a long time before writing TheJoyous Cosmology, considering the dangers of letting thegeneral public be further aware of this potent alchemy. But sinceAldous had already let the cat out of the bag in Doors ofPerception and Heaven and Hell, and the subject wasalready under discussion both in psychiatric journals and in thepublic press, I decided that more needed to be said, mainly tosoothe public alarm and to do what I could to forestall thedisasters that would follow from legal repression. For I wasseriously alarmed at the psychedelic equivalents of bathtub gin,and of the prospect of these chemicals, uncontrolled in dosageand content, being bootlegged for use in inappropriate settingswithout any competent supervision whatsoever. I maintained that,for lack of any better solution, they should be restricted forpsychiatric prescription. But the state and federal governmentswere as stupid as I had feared, and by passing unenforceable lawsagainst LSD not only drove it underground but prevented properresearch. Such laws are unenforceable because any competentchemist can manufacture LSD, or a close equivalent, and thesubstance can be disguised as anything from aspirin toblotting-paper. It has been painted on the thin pages of a smallBible, and eaten sheet by sheet. But as a result of this terror,the injudicious use of LSD (often mixed with strychnine orbelladonna or quite dangerous psychedelics) has afflicteduncounted young people with paranoid, megalomanic, and schizoidsymptoms. I see this disaster in the larger context ofAmerican prohibitionism, which has done more than anything elseto corrupt the police and foster disrespect for law, and whichour economic pressure has, in the special problem of drug abuse,spread to the rest of the world. Although my views on this mattermay be considered extreme, I feel that in any society where thepowers of Church and State are separate, the State is withouteither right or wisdom in enforcing sumptuary laws against crimeswhich have no complaining victims. When the police are asked tobe armed clergymen enforcing ecclesiastical codes of morality,all the proscribed sins of the flesh, of lust and luxury,become—since we are legislating against humannature—exceedingly profitable ventures for criminalorganizations which can pay both the police and the politiciansto stay out of trouble. Those who cannot pay constitute aboutone-third of the population of our overcrowded and hopelesslymismanaged prisons, and the business of their trial by dueprocess delays and over taxes the courts beyond all reason. Theseare nomogenic crimes, caused by bad laws, just as iatrogenicdiseases are caused by bad doctoring. The offenders seldom feelguilty but often positively righteous in their opposition to thislegal hypocrisy, and so emerge from prison loathing and despisingthe social order more than ever. I speak with passion on this problem because I haveoften served as a consultant to the staffs of state institutionsfor mental and moral deviants, such as the institutional hellswhich the State of California maintains at San Quentin,Vacaville, Atascadero, and Napa—to mention only those I havevisited, and knowing that they are considerably worse in otherparts of the country, and most especially in those statesafflicted with religious fanaticism. Relative to our own times,the prosecution of sumptuary laws is as tyrannical as any of theexcesses of the Holy Inquisition or the Star Chamber. My retrospective attitude to LSD is that when onehas received the message, one hangs up the phone. I think I havelearned from it as much as I can, and, for my own sake, would notbe sorry if I could never use it again. But it is not, I believe,generally known that very many of those who had constructiveexperiences with LSD, or other psychedelics, have turned fromdrugs to spiritual disciplines—abandoning their water-wingsand learning to swim. Without the catalytic experience of thedrug they might never have come to this point, and thus myfeeling about psychedelic chemicals, as about most other drugs(despite the vague sense of the word), is that they should serveas medicine rather than diet. It was again through Aldous that I first heard of aDr. Leary of Harvard University who was doing experimental workwith the drug psilocybin, derived from a mushroom that had longbeen used for religious purposes by some of the Indians ofMexico. From the detached and scholarly flavor of Aldous'saccount of this work I was expecting Timothy Leary to be aformidable pandit, but the man I first met in a New Yorkrestaurant was an extremely charming Irishman who wore ahearing-aid as stylishly as if it had been a monocle. Nothingcould then have told me that anyone so friendly and intelligentwould become one of the most outlawed people in the world, afugitive from justice charged with the sin of Socrates, and allupon the legal pretext of possessing trivial amounts ofmarijuana. It so happened that Timothy was working under adepartment of the University that had long been of interest tome, the Department of Social Relations, which had beenestablished by Henry Murray. On several occasions I had visitedMurray's domain, at 7 Divinity Avenue, and been entertained atluncheons where, as host, he showed a special genius for arousingintelligent conversation and for making other people appear attheir best. In his company there would turn up—it mightbe— I. A. Richards, Mircea Eliade, Clyde Kluckhon, or JeromeBruner for such civilized intellectual discourse as is all toorarely heard in academic circles, where it now seems a point ofhonor to keep off one's subject and discuss the trivia ofdepartmental politics. But these gentlemen were ashamed neitherof their scholarship nor their personalities, and on oneoccasion—over an old-fashioned before lunch—Idistinctly heard Richards remarking, "Well, as a matter ofcourse, I always regard myself as the perfect human being."I was so delighted with Murray's milieu that, with the assistanceof a wealthy friend, I managed to get myself a two-yearfellowship for travel and study under his and the University'sdispensation—a breather which gave me time to compile TheTwo Hands of God and to write Beyond Theology. The time I could actually spend at Harvard was alltoo brief, for this is a university so assured of itsintellectual reputation that its faculty can afford to beadventurous. But—even at Harvard—you must draw the linesomewhere, and Timothy did not know just where that was. WheneverI was in Cambridge I kept closely in touch with him and with hisassociates Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner, for—quite asidefrom the particular fascinations of chemical mysticism—thesewere the most lively and imaginative people in the departmentother than Murray himself, who watched their doings with deep andconstructively critical interest even after his officialretirement. I was also interested in the work of B. F. Skinner,wondering how so absolute a determinist could write a utopia, WaldenTwo, and digging into his beautifully reasoned writings untilI discovered the flaw in his system. This I explained in alecture which Skinner, though I had forewarned him in person, didnot attend.(2) I saw that his reasoning was still haunted by theghost of man as a something—presumably a consciousego—determined by environmental and other forces, for itmakes no sense to speak of a determinism unless there is somepassive object which is determined. But his own reasoning made itclear, not so much that human behavior was determined by otherforces, but rather that it could not be described apart fromthose forces and was, indeed, inseparable from them. It did notseem to have occurred to him that "cause" and"effect" are simply two phases of, or two ways oflooking at, one and the same event. It is not, then, that effects(in this case human behaviors) are determined by their causes.The point is that when events are fully and properly describedthey will be found to involve and contain processes which were atfirst thought separate from them, and were thus called causes asdistinct from effects. Taken to his logical conclusion, Skinneris not saying that man is determined by nature, as somethingexternal to him: he is actually saying that man is nature, and isdescribing a process which is neither determined nor determining.He simply provides reason for the essentially mystical view thatman and universe are inseparable. Such problems were involved in my attempts to workout an intellectual structure for what Timothy and his friendswere experiencing in their psychedelic states of consciousness.For I saw that their enthusiasm for these states was leading themfurther and further away from the ideals of rational objectivityto which the department and the University were committed;especially as the department had recently acquired a computer andwas going overboard for the statistical approach to psychology.On the one hand, I was trying to persuade Timothy's clan to keepcommand of intellectual rigor, and to express their experiencesin terms that people bending over backward to be scientific wouldunderstand. On the other hand, I was trying to get suchconservatives as David McClelland, Murray's successor, andSkinner to see that the so-called "transactional"description of man as an organism-environment field was atheoretical description of what the nature-mystic experiencesimmediately, whereas most scientists continue to experiencethemselves as separate and detached observers, determined orotherwise. Their feelings lag far behind their theoretical views,for psychologists, in particular, are still under the emotionalsway of Newtonian mechanics, and their personal feelings ofidentity have not yet been modified by quantum mechanics andfield theory. But Timothy could not contain himself, and itseemed to him more and more that, in practice, the procedures ofscientific objectivity and rigor were simply an academic ritualdesigned to convince the university establishment that your workwas dull and trivial enough to be considered "sound."It so happens that psychedelic chemicals make one curiouslysensitive to pomposity. Anyone talking memorandumese, orreligious or political rhetoric, or anyone waxing enthusiasticabout a product in which he does not believe, sounds soridiculous that you cannot keep a straight face: one excellentreason why no government can tolerate a "turned-on"populace. Both Timothy and Richard Alpert began to see,furthermore, that a distinguished academic career was not allthat important, since the university was already an obsoleteinstitution representing the nineteenth-century mythology ofscientific naturalism. But when one arrives at this point of viewafter, if not because of, "taking drugs," it becomesimpossible to maintain rational discourse with the establishment,even though some of its more distinguished brains are pickled inalcohol. Thus things came to the point where Timothy and Richardwere as suspect as if they had been lobotomized or becomeJehovah's Witnesses. I was present at the dinner party where Timothyfinally agreed with David McClelland to withdraw experimentationwith drugs from his work under the department. David was makingthe point that they had become too enthusiastic about their workto preserve scientific integrity, and with this I was in partialagreement, because to be intellectually honest you must be ableto come to terms with any intelligible criticism of your ideas.When I have received inspirations during an LSD session, I havealways reviewed them subsequently in the light of cold sobriety,in which some, but by no means all, of them appear to benonsense. But David was going so far as to insist that no onewith a religious commitment could really do scientific work inpsychology, and this so amazed me that I protested, "Now,David, are you seriously saying that, for example, a very sober,honest, and devoted Quaker, well educated and straight fromPhiladelphia, could not be entrusted with scientific work?"I do not remember his reaction, but I was unaware at the timethat he himself was a concerned Quaker. What followed is now a matter of history. Timothyand Richard continued their experiments unofficially, andscandalized the University authorities by includingundergraduates in their work. Henry Murray, however, with a wiselook on his face, reminisced about the days when psychoanalysisfirst struck Harvard, and what an uproar of indignation had cometo pass when a psychoanalyzed faculty member had committedsuicide. Nevertheless, I myself began to be concerned, if mildly,at the direction of Timothy's enthusiasm, for to his own circleof friends and students he had become a charismatic religiousleader who, well trained as he was in psychology, knew verylittle about religion and mysticism and their pitfalls. Theuninstructed adventurer with psychedelics, as with Zen or yoga orany other mystical discipline, is an easy victim of what Jungcalls "inflation," of the messianic megalomania thatcomes from misunderstanding the experience of union with God. Itleads to the initial mistake of casting pearls before swine, and,as time went on, I was dismayed to see Timothy converting himselfinto a popular store-front messiah with his name in lights,advocating psychedelic experience as a new world-religion. He wasmoving to a head-on collision with the established religions ofbiblical theocracy and scientific mechanism, and simply askingfor martyrdom. Life with Timothy, as I saw it in his communes atNewton Center and Millbrook, was never dull, even though it washard to understand how people who had witnessed the splendors ofpsychedelic vision could be so aesthetically blind as to live inrelative squalor, with perpetually unmade beds, unswept floors,and hideously decrepit furnishings. It could be, I suppose, thatbeing turned-on all the time is like looking through ateleidoscope: it makes far more interesting patterns out ofmesses (such as dirty ashtrays) than out of such orderly scenesas neatly arranged books in shelves. But Timothy was the centerof a vortex which pulled in the intellectually and spirituallyadventurous from all quarters, and in his entourage studenthippies jostled with millionaires and eminent professors, whileto spend an evening with him in New York City or Los Angeles wasto be swept from one exotically sumptuous apartment to another. Through all this, Timothy himself remained anessentially humorous, kindly, lovable, and (in some directions)intellectually brilliant person, and therefore it was utterlyincongruous— however predictable—to become aware of thegrim watchfulness of police in the background. Now nothing soeasily deranges people using psychedelics as a paranoidatmosphere, so that by their intervention the police created thevery evils from which they were supposed to be protecting us. Inthe early days when LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline were used moreor less legitimately among reasonably mature people, there waslittle trouble with "bum trips," and episodes ofanxiety were usually turned into occasions for insight. But whenfederal and state authorities began their systematic persecution,the fears invoked to justify it became self-fulfillingprophecies, and there was now real reason for a paranoidatmosphere in all experiments conducted outside the sterile andclinical surroundings of psychiatric hospitals. Although Timothywon a case in the Supreme Court which technically quashed thefederal law against possessing and using (but not againstimporting) marijuana, the state laws remained in force, and hewas harassed wherever he went, until finally imprisoned withoutbail with so many technical charges against him that there wasnothing for it but to escape and seek such asylum in exile as hecould find. Richard Alpert, who in all this had played a muchquieter role, also went into exile, but in another way. Whilevisiting India he realized that he had come to the end of theidentity as a psychologist which he had thus far played, so muchso that he could not envisage any normal role or career forhimself in the United States. Furthermore, he felt as I did thathe had learned all that he could get from psychedelics, and thatwhat remained was actually to live out the life of freedom fromworldly games and anxieties. He therefore took the name of BabaRam Dass, and came back as a white-robed and bearded sannyasin,full of laughter and energy, dedicated simply to living in theeternal now. And, as might be expected, people raised theireyebrows and shook their heads, saying that the old showman wasplaying another game, or, alas, what drugs had done to such apromising young scientist, or that it was just great to be a sannyasinwith an independent income. But I felt that he had done just theright thing for himself. I spent many hours with him and sensedthat he was genuinely happy, that his intelligence was as sharpas ever, and that he was confident enough in what he was doingnot to try to persuade me to follow his example. Certainly he washaving great pleasure in the multitudes of young people who cameto listen to him, but in this respect he and I are alike, for weenjoy thinking out loud with an appreciative and intelligentaudience just as we enjoy landscape or music. But would he begoing about in a white robe if he were really sincere? Indeedyes. For in a country where a philosopher's sincerity is measuredby the ordinariness of his dress, I too will sometimes wear akimono or sarong in public, lest, like Billy Graham, I shouldattract an enormous following of dangerously serious andhumorless people. Now, in retrospect, it must be said that thePsychedelic Decade of the sixties has really begun to awakenpsychotherapists from their studiedly pedestrian and reductionistattitudes to life. Here I am using the word"psychedelic" to mean all "mind-manifesting"processes: not only chemicals, but also philosophies,neurological experiments, and spiritual disciplines. At thebeginning of the decade one felt that so many psychiatrists sawthemselves as guardians of an official reality which might bedescribed as the world seen on a bleak Monday morning. They saw agood orientation to reality as coping—as having a normalheterosexual (and preferably monogamous) sex life, a "matureadult relationship" as it was called; as being able to drivea car and hold down a nine-to-five job; as being able to recallthe product of g and 7 without hesitation; and as being able toparticipate in group activities and show qualities of initiativeand leadership. It was, as I remember, in 1959 that I was asked tospeak before a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association inLos Angeles. Learned statistical papers had dragged on and on,overtime, and my turn came when we were already late for lunch. Iabandoned my prepared remarks (being what the press calls atextual deviate) and said: "Gentlemen, this is not going to be ascientific paper because I am a simple philosopher, not apsychiatrist, and you are hungry for lunch. We philosophers arevery grateful to you for showing us the unconscious emotionalbases of some of our ideas, but the time is coming for us to showyou the unconscious intellectual assumptions behind some ofyours. Psychiatric literature is full of unexamined metaphysics.Even Jung, who is so readily repudiated for his 'mysticism,'bends over backward to avoid metaphysical considerations on thepretext that he is strictly a physician and a scientist. This isimpossible. Every human being is a metaphysician just as everyphilosopher has appetites and emotions—and by this I meanthat we all have certain basic assumptions about the good lifeand the nature of reality. Even the typical businessman whoasserts that he is a practical fellow unconcerned with higherthings declares thereby that he is a pragmatist or a positivist,and not a very thoughtful one at that. "I wonder, then, how much consideration yougive to the fact that most of your own assumptions about the goodlife and reality come directly from the scientific naturalism ofthe nineteenth century, from the strictly metaphysical hypothesisthat the universe is a mechanism obeying Newtonian laws, and thatthere is no other god beside it. Psychoanalysis, which isactually psychohydraulics following Newton's mechanics, beginsfrom the mystical assertion that the psychosexual energy of theunconscious is a blind and stupid outrush of pure lust, followingHaeckel's notion that the universe at large is a manifestation ofprimordially oafish and undiscriminating energy. It should beobvious to you that this is an opinion for which there has neverbeen the least evidence, and which, furthermore, ignores theevidence that we ourselves, supposedly making intelligentremarks, are manifestations of that same energy. "On the basis of this unexamined, derogatory,and shaky opinion as to the nature of biological and physicalenergy, some of your psychoanalytic members have this morningdubbed all the so-called mystical states of consciousness as'regressive,' as leading one back to a dissolution of theindividual intelligence in an acid bath of amniotic fluid,reducing it to featureless identity with this—your FirstCause—mess of blindly libidinous energy. Now, until you havefound some substantial evidence for your metaphysics you willhave to admit that you have no way of knowing which end of youruniverse is up, so that in the meantime you should abstain fromeasy conclusions as to which directions are progressive and whichregressive. [Laughter]" It had always seemed to me that, by and large,psychotherapists lacked the metaphysical dimension; in otherwords, that they affected the mentality of insurance clerks andlived in a world scrubbed and disinfected of all mystery, magic,color, music, and awe, with no place in the heart for the soundof a distant gong in a high and hidden valley. This is anexaggeration from which I will except most of the Jungians andsuch occasional freaks as Groddeck, Prinzhorn, G. R. Heyer,Wilhelm Reich, and others less well known. Thus, writing ofAmerican psychology in 1954, Abraham Maslow remarked that it was overpragmatic, over-Puritan, and overpurposeful.... No textbooks have chapters on fun and gaiety, on leisure and meditation, on loafing and puttering, on aimless, useless, and purposeless activity.... American psychology is busily occupying itself with only half of life to the neglect of the other—and perhaps most important—half.(3) The publication of my Psychotherapy East andWest and Joyous Cosmology early in the sixties broughtme into public and private discussion with many leading membersof the psychiatric profession, and I was astonished at whatseemed to be their actual terror of unusual states ofconsciousness. I had thought that psychiatrists should have beenas familiar with these wildernesses and unexplored territories ofthe mind as Indian guides, but as I perused something like thetwo huge volumes of The American Handbook of Psychiatry, Ifound only maps of the soul as primitive as ancient maps of theworld. There were vaguely outlined emptinesses calledSchizophrenia, Hysteria, and Catatonia, accompanied with littlemore solid information than "Here be dragons andcameleopards." At a party in New York I fell intoconversation with one of that city's most eminent analysts, andas soon as he learned that I had experimented with LSD hispersonality became surgically professional. He donned his maskand rubber gloves and addressed me as a specimen, wanting to knowall the surface details of perceptual and kinestheticalterations, which I could see him fitting into place zip, pop,and clunk with his keenly calipered mind. I took part in atelevised debate on "Open End," with David Susskindtrying to moderate between the two factions of psychedelicenthusiasts and establishment psychiatrists, and in the ensuinguproar and confusion of passions I found myself flung into theposition of moderator, telling both sides that they had no basisin evidence for their respective fanaticisms. In all these contacts I began to feel that the onlypsychiatrists who had any solid information were suchneurologists as David Rioch, of Walter Reed, and Karl Pribram, ofStanford. They could tell me things I didn't know and were thefirst to admit how little they knew, for they were realizing theodd fact that their brains were more intelligent than their mindsor, to say the least, that the human nervous system was of such ahigh order of complexity that we were only just beginning toorganize it in terms of conscious thought. I sat in on anintimate seminar with Pribram in which he explained in mostcareful detail how the brain is no mere reflector of the externalworld, but how its structure almost creates the forms andpatterns that we see, selecting them from an immeasurablespectrum of vibrations as the hands of a harpist pluck chords andmelodies from a spectrum of strings. For Karl Pribram is workingon the most delicate epistemological puzzle: how the brain evokesa world which is simultaneously the world which it is in, and towonder, therefore, whether the brain evokes the brain.(4) Put itin metaphysical terms, psychological terms, physical terms, orneurological terms: it is always the same. How can we know whatwe know without knowing knowing? This question must be answered, if it can ever beanswered, before it can make any sense at all to say that realityis material, mental, electrical, spiritual, a fact, a dream, oranything else. But always, in contemplating this conundrum, apeculiar feeling comes over me, as if I couldn't remember my ownname which is right on the tip of my tongue. It really does makeone wonder if, after all . . . if . . . Anyhow, at the end of these ten years I have theimpression that the psychiatric world has opened up to thepossibility that there are more things in heaven and earth thanwere dreamed of in its philosophy. Orthodox psychoanalysis hasappeared more and more to be a religious cult and institutionalpsychiatry a system of brainwashing. The field is giving way tomovements and techniques increasingly free from the tacitmetaphysics of nineteenth-century mechanism: HumanisticPsychology, Transpersonal Psychology, Gestalt Therapy,Transactional Psychology, Encounter Therapy, Psychosynthesis(Assagioli), Bioenergetics (Reich), and a dozen more interestingapproaches with awkward names. Historians and social commentators will try todiscover from any autobiographer how much he has influenced themovements of his time and how much they have influenced him. Ican say only that as I get older I get back into that strangechildlike feeling of not being able to draw any certain linebetween the world and my own action upon it, and I wonder if thisis also felt by people who have never been in the public eye orhad any claim to influence. A very ordinary person might have theimpression that there are millions of himself, and that all ofthem, as one, are doing just what it is in humanity—that is,in himself —to do. In this way he could perhaps feel moreimportant than someone who has taken a particular view andfollowed a lonely path. Part of the problem is that the closer I get topresent time, the harder it is to see things in perspective. Theevents of twenty, thirty, and forty years ago are clearer in mymind, and seem almost closer in time than what has happened quiterecently— in years that seem fantastically and excitinglycrowded with people and happenings. I feel that I must waitanother ten years to find out just what I was doing, in the fieldof psychotherapy, with Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, FritzPerls and Ronald Laing, Margaret Rioch and Anthony Sutich,Bernard Aaronson and Stanley Krippner, Michael Murphy and JohnLilly; in theology with Bishops James Pike and John A. T.Robinson, Dom Aelred Graham and Huston Smith; and in theformation of the mystical counterculture with Lama AnagarikaGovinda and Shunryu Suzuki, Allen Ginsberg and Theodore Roszak,Bernard Gunther and Gia-fu Feng, Ralph Metzner and ClaudioNaranjo, Norman 0. Brown and Nancy Wilson Ross, Lama ChogyamTrungpa and Ch'ung-liang Huang, Douglas Harding and G. SpencerBrown, Richard Weaver and Robert Shapiro— to mention only afew of the names and faces gathering out of the recent past totell me that I have hardly begun this story.

As promised, no attempt has been made to examine all ofthe causes of the restructuring of consciousness which is takingplace. Neither has any attempt been made to examine allthe ways in which it manifests itself. Such an effort would haveto range far beyond the rock phenomenon, the use of psychedelics,the effects of urbanization and mass media and those other fewmanifestations which have been touched upon here. The effort hasbeen rather to approach a few of these phenomena and reach forthe keys to their essential nature; to show, basically, how thedoors of perception are being unlocked. We have not yet facedthe central question: How can the new consciousness begin itsreal work of taking power out of the hands of those who are inthe process of wrecking our world? There is a very specific deadlineinvolved: the point, likely sometime in the next ten or twentyyears, where the statistical probability of extinction will havebecome a certainty. To speak of a self-structuring hierarchical jump is to speak ofa revolution, a fundamental change in the way our affairs areconducted. Without such a change, the overwhelming likelihoodis that we will kill ourselves off. No one suggests that men beput in charge of nuclear reactors who are only capable of "muddlingthrough." Yet exactly such a suggestion is made when it comesto putting people in charge of the dynamic institutions whichdeter mine the course of society. The question is not whether a revolutionis needed. The question is: How can it succeed? Where are thelines of least resistance? What are the weapons at the disposalof the new consciousness? Are these weapons being picked up? Issome sort of an apocalyptic bloodbath—the "shit storm"foreseen by Norman Mailer—inevitable? In the past, in virtually every case, it was. Is there any goodreason for believing that conditions have changed in some mysteriousway? That a true revolution can now be effected without the streetsbeing littered with bodies? First, in order to get some sort of a perspective, let us considerthe odds against a successful revolution. So long as westick to the traditional definition of a revolution, the oddsseem formidable, more formidable perhaps than they have ever beenin the past. An impression of the sheer power of the existingpower structure, particularly in America, might best be conveyedthrough the lens of personal experience: PEACE, NOW! PEACE, NOW! PEACE, NOW! It was as though the great buildings around us were hi-fi speakersin the land of the giants with the volume on full. The vibrationsbeat against the 162-ton Picasso sculpture, reverberating alongthe Cor-ten weatherproofed steel walls of the 31-storey ChicagoCivic Plaza, a sound that had several dimensions: anger, frenzy,fun, frustration, fear, surprise. It was therapeutic, as raw asthe first roar of a timid man who has discovered the heroic withinhis grasp. It was defiant and exultant because the sound was composedof ten thousand voices and each voice suggested the liberationof a ninety-pound weakling who has completed his Charles Atlascourse and is now moving with a growl down onto the bully-inhabitedbeach. And then it was also pure rooting-for-the-home-team stuff,complete with cheerleaders: What do we want? PEACE! When do we want it? NOW! And, finally, it was frightening. "PEACE, NOW! PEACE,NOW!" The sound was blurred, like the noises of waves,and it was easy to close your eyes, let go of the mood for a moment,and hear them chanting, "SIEG HEIL! SIEG HEIL!" There was that hypnotic rhythm to it, a pace close to that ofgoose-stepping hordes. This was October 15, 1969, the First MoratoriumDay. The word was already out that the United States this dayhad lurched like an elephant slammed by a hand grenade under theimpact of the biggest anti-war demonstration in history. And itwas only a month since the Woodstock music festival had gone offlike a land mine. Now the speeches were done with, the Chicago six—looking paleand if not self-conscious, at least a bit uncertain—have beenduly honored, every angle has been played except the last: timefor a moment's silence for the dead in Vietnam. Heads were bowed.Even the traffic was stilled, the crowd having become so largethe streets around the Civic Plaza were sealed off. The swellingsilence engulfed the murmuring, and soon we were as quiet as ants,a colony of ants amid a warehouse display of fridge-like buildingsand stacks of rusting canned goods; there was even an altar beforeus-the First Methodist Church, the world's tallest place of worship.The silence soon matched the height of the building. After a fewseconds, hands started fluttering up, making the V-sign of peace,a gesture by now as religious as the Catholic sign of the cross.Soon almost all the hands were raised in the V-sign, except forthose hands which were black, and all those black hands, thousands,were making the clenched-fist Black Power salute. I saw no blackfingers making the peace sign. Something had happened.... The demonstration was over. But the crowd was not quite preparedto dissolve. And now came the cry: OINK! OINK! It was the warningand battle-cry. It meant the riot cops were moving. Over the headsaround me, bobbing like bubbles in a stirred-up bathtub, I couldsee a blue tide coming—a line of robin's egg riot helmets. Thewarning, almost a wave-action, had passed through me a secondbefore, an impulse transmitted from nerve to nerve, body to body,thus flashing from one end of the plaza to the other, communicatingto nearly ten thousand of us in seconds what would have takenseveral minutes to pass on by word of mouth—a flicker of tension,excitement and fear. Briefly, my senseof isolation, of self, ofindividuality, cracked. I was a small unit in a largercreature, one spark in the total field laid down by a brain composedof ten thousand such sparks. And the brain is stupid, composedof too few parts-it has not much more going for it than an insect.(No metaphor is intended here—a crowd is a gestalt, and itscurrents work like magnetism on the ciphers of our "identities,"creating whirlpools and floodstreams where none existed before.) OINK! OINK! screamed thousands of voices. The effect of the cry was to cauterize some of the automatic fearwhich had been in the message of a few seconds before. Shout copsand the impulse, maybe nothing more than the Pavlovian reactionof children caught stealing apples, is nevertheless to run. ShoutOINK! OINK! and the impulse is to press forward to the edge ofthe trough. Good mob psychology to change the object of terrorinto an object of contempt. The movement of the crowd was like water toward a cliff. The robin'segg helmets might as well have been magnets attracting chips—butof course the police knew this, knew by now after years of riotsand demonstrations all about the psychology of mobs. It is a psychologynot so different from that of rats or very retarded children.Knowing it, the police had purpose in their movement. They weregood cowboys. The round-up began. They were pulling us into anew position, the better to control us. The round-up was underway. I tried to hang back close to the Picassosculpture, rising like a giant steel bat over the plaza. Triedto hang back. It didn't work. The surge of the crowd was too strong,and too much of its deep herd impulse had gotten into my head-likea primordial gorilla hand groping for the controls. I did notfight as hard as I might to avoid being carried forward and, firstthing I knew, I was right up against the police line. Easy to imagine that these cops gave off no odor. They were, infact, as odorless as astronauts or the hostesses at Disneylandand the Playboy Club. The cop in front of me, looking by chanceinto my eyes no more curiously than you would look into the eyesof a passing dog, seemed like a steel robot, a big one, wearinga rubber mask over a transistorized brain. His truncheon was atleast two and a half feet long. When the walkie-talkie order hitthat transistor of his, he would bash my face in as automaticallyas an electronic door opening to let customers into a supermarket. Now I could see the purpose to the movement of the police. Theyhad taken up positions at one end of the glass-walled civic plaza,and the reaction of the crowd was not, after all, so unanimous.Only a fragment—the most hopped-up elements—had been drawnout, or, more precisely, extracted. So this was a dentaloperation. The police knew now where the trouble would come from.By their carefully-drilled movements, they had isolated the militantsfrom their buffer of tax-paying citizens. These Chicago policewere a good modern army. Beyond doubt their choreographer wassitting up in one of the skyscrapers, directing the performancelike a man cutting a cake with sure strokes of his blue-edgedknife. And the crowd—the crowd was still a dull-witted gestalt. Partpuppy-dog, part wolf. But in the end, manageable, more manageablethan a baby. The police, having drawn the most dangerous partof it into position, (having snagged the fangs) now kept it onthe line like a fisherman jerking his line to make sure the hookis in place. This was done simply by moving the police line afew dozen yards to the right, a few dozen to the left. The crowdfollowed. Meanwhile, as anticipated in somebody's calculations,the majority of the original ten thousand demonstrators had dissolvedback into the rush-hour traffic, and soon there were fewer thanone thousand left chanting and singing in front of the policeline. After a while, they decided to head over to the federalbuilding, where a few hundred others, many of them young blacks,and Black Panthers, had gathered to make speeches and throw insults(nothing more) up at the courtroom where the charade of the trialof the Chicago six was in progress. The police line followed thedemonstrators. From the federal building, the movement was backtoward of the plaza, then over to Lincoln Park. All along theway, police marched silently, shoulder-to-shoulder with the demonstrators.At last we arrived at the park. It was late afternoon, and thepotent force of ten thousand had been whittled by the blue knifedown to less than a hundred. The skill in that whittling was atleast equal to the talent employed in the carving of totem poles.The police had a very effective machine going for them. Yet there, in Chicago, I was watching the functioning of a policemachine which was still only a primitive tool compared to thecomputerized techno-structured operations now coming into existence.The difference between this Chicago police machine and those modernones beginning to take shape everywhere is a matter of centuriescompressed into decades. Compare a knife to a laser beam. Youcan at least see the knife coming. Against the laser beam youhave no chance at all. Police machines, even the machines of Hitler and Stalin, wereclumsy, forced to resort to terrorism and brute force. It hasbeen shown that slave labor is poorly adapted to industrializationand adapted to post-industrialization not at all. The new machineriesof police control are as far removed, in their most highly-developedforms, from Nazi Germany as helicopters from Icarus. The efficiencyof the Chicago police on the occasion of the First Vietnam Moratoriumrevealed more about their state of development than did the policeriot during the 1968 Democratic Convention. There, while the wholeworld was watching, the police broke their ranks and the machinesputtered to a halt. Under those circumstances, had the Chicagopolice been faced by well-armed, welldrilled opponents, they wouldhave been cut to ribbons. As it was, they were chasing children,attacking journalists and bystanders, and so they seemed to havetremendous brute power. It was an illusion. In fact, at that particularmoment, the Chicago police were at their weakest. If the DemocraticConvention riots of 1968 had been the real measure of the effectivenessof the Chicago police, then the Black Panthers could be certainof victory. When the police become a mob, they are as helplessagainst precision attack as that crowd on Moratorium Day was againstprecision control. And yet the point here is that those chillingly-efficientMoratorium Day police tactics were relatively unsophisticated.The blue knife that worked so well was still not a laser beam.In the very near future, control of mobs of ten thousand willbe child's play. The mass media have communicated a false message to the youngergeneration: Look at the Democratic Convention! Look at Watts!Look at the cities that burned as funeral pyres in the wake ofMartin Luther King's assassination! Remember the night when atiny gadget near Niagara Falls broke down and all of New Yorkwas plunged into darkness? See how easy it is to throw a monkeywrench into the functionings of a modern industrial state? A bitof LSD in the water supply, a few snipers moving along the rooftops,a demonstration here, a reversal of a court decision concerningmarijuana there...so easy, so easy. Yet one has only to walk through Watts, or along West Madison,or through Harlem, to realize that probably fewer than a hundredmiles of streets out of all the millions of miles of paved roadwayin the United States actually were touched by flame the nightafter King died. And nothing has changed in New York because ofthe black-out, except that the hydro system is slightly more efficientnow. LSD breaks down in water. As for snipers—they are killed,and have about as much chance of beating the existing system asa fly has of wresting power from the man with the fly-swatter.An overturned pot law can be planted back even more firmly onits feet a few weeks later. Guerrilla warfare? One might try readingQuotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung, especially his tenprinciples of operation. In the context of modern America, itmight well have been written by George Wallace. Point One: Attackdispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strongenemy forces (universities?) later. Point Two: Take smalland medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big citieslater. Etc. It should be obvious to everyone that guerrillas canonly operate if the population supports them, and there is noadvanced industrial nation today where that basic condition exists.A mass base is completely lacking for a putsch or revolutionin the old style of the French and Russian revolutions. And evenif it weren't, in order to beat the technological and organizationalopposition, the revolutionaries would have to forge a faster,more powerful machine. To fight a revolution in an advanced industrialnation today (on its own ground, in short) one would have to becomeeven better at the game than those who currently wield the blueknife and the laser beam. The argument against revolution in an advanced industrial nation,in the old sense of a violent overthrow of the existing powerstructure through the mechanism of an armed insurrection, proceedsalong three lines: A. It's hopeless. B. It accomplishes nothing, except a changing of the guard. C. It diverts us from the real struggle, which is to attain ahigher level of consciousness, and to explore our potential (whichis still unknown). Let us deal with these in turn: A. It's hopeless. The working class of late has not shown itself to be particularlyresponsive to the rhetoric of the New Left. The evidence wouldsuggest that any insurrection at this stage in the affairs ofthe American state is more likely to come from the right. Movementssuch as Yippie!, the Black Panther Party, SDS, and so on haveproven to be shorter-lived and far less tolerated than the Minutemenor the Ku Klux Klan. This is not simply because of the raw powerof the police machine. John Galbraith has pointed out that when capital was the key toeconomic success, social conflict was between the rich and thepoor. But in recent times, education became the difference thatdivides. "Politics," he writes, "reflect the newdivision. In the United States suspicion or resentment is no longerdirected to the capitalists or the merely rich. It is the intellectualswho are eyed with misgiving and alarm. This should surprise noone. Nor should it be a matter for surprise when semi-literatemillionaires turn up leading or financing the ignorant in struggleagainst the intellectually privileged and content. This reflectsthe relevant class distinction of our time." It is a distinctionfew intellectuals are willing to accept. Humanists and socialistsalike would prefer to steer away from any position which mightopen them up to charges of elitism, yet everything points to asharp (and widening) cleavage not only between the generationsbut between the new basic classes. Students can no longer appealto the workers with much hope of being listened to (or, for thatmatter, of getting out of a union hall meeting without havingtheir heads beaten in). Add to that the fact that the very "masses" upon whomall organized revolutionaries pin their long range hopes are thepeople (in the highly industrialized states) who are the leastlikely to rise up against anybody except the revolutionaries themselves.Come the revolution, we will all be listening to Bob Hope. Theproblem in part is that only a minority of the population in anyadvanced industrialized nation is responsive to the new and acceleratedpace of change. A few, among them many of the young and many ofthe intellectually privileged and content, are in tune with thenew culture; that is, change is not something that frightens them.Mobility offers possibilities, not dread of being uprooted. The"broad masses," on the other hand, are still peekingout at the world from around the corner of their memories of theDepression and the Second World War. Few will dispute that the guns and the tanks and the bombs andthe advertising agencies and the mass media are in the hands ofthe established order. The target of any revolution cannot justbe the White House, the Pentagon, and Fort Knox. It must be, let'ssay, "the hearts and minds of the people," whether Vietnameseor American. And these, at the moment, are largely under the controlof the establishment press, the advertisers, and the politicians.So, already, the revolution must move against an enemy that commandsthe heights and is dug in everywhere, who, furthermore, has overwhelmingfirepower, with air and ground and naval support. And the oddsare not yet through being added up. The establishment also hasat its disposal a humming army of computers, an array of prototypaltechnostructures whose function is not only to anticipate trouble,pin-point likely danger spots, but, as a regular day-to-day operation,keep a closer eye on every individual citizen than could be donein any previous society. There is no one in America-or any advancedindustrial state, for that matter-whose identity is not magneticallyrecorded on a tape somewhere. So, in addition to the overwhelmingfirepower of the enemy, the revolutionary faces the dangers ofbugging, wiretapping, computerized surveillance, and so on. So far, however, we have been ticking off the obvious. We havenot really got the real strength of the enemy, which isthat, unlike a banana republic, the modern industrial state isnot run by a strongman flanked by bullyboys, a division of armoredjeeps, and financed by a clutch of businessmen with vested interestsin keeping wages down. It may indeed stem from just such a basicstructure, but in the process of its evolution it has become toocomplex, too bottomless, to be tackled as though it remainednothing more than that. The power of the industrial state is greaterby several factors, and not just in terms of physical might. Where we see progressiveness and openly liberal attitudes, wesee the technological reality refining its methods of manipulation,organization, and, ultimately, control. It gets betterat it all the time, absorbing more, spreading out in ever-wideningcircles, and turning every attack to its own advantage, simplyby accepting the attacker, swallowing him, and thus very nearlyliterally feeding on opposition. Historically, it has been hard enough to get broad masses of peopleto bite the hand that wouldn't feed them; to hope, underconditions of affluence, to get those same broad masses to bitea hand that does feed them-and feeds them very well-is a thinhope indeed. Add this stark reality to the problems already mentioned,and one begins to see that it would have to be one hell of a super-revolution,the one which could smash the technological society. Even if the odds weren't so bad, consider the state the troopsare in. What happened to the crowd in the Chicago Civic Plazaon Moratorium Day demonstrated clearly where the real organizationalmuscle was. But there is more to it. Shortly before MoratoriumDay, I was in Berkeley, at the University of California campus.Listen to one of the most radical students I talked to: "It'sready to blow, man. There's a revolution coming. It's overcrowdedhere. Construction everywhere. Bad food. Lousy accommodation.It's mean. Bad vibrations. Everybody's really uptight, only it'slow-level uptightedness. People are bugged, I mean, really bugged...the food prices, the shortage of rooms, the noise... it's gonnago, man. Wow." So there is a revolution about to erupt.But follow the conversation further. It drifts. Soon, the studentis talking about the intensity of the mescaline experience ascompared to the hashish experience. A lot of quibbling gets goingwith other students present about the virtues of hash. And fromthere the conversation proceeds directly to the issue of the bestplaces to go skiing. One place is generally conceded to be muchbetter than the others, because "dampness from the groundsoaks right up through your head and goes raining off in reverseright into the sky from your head, all those pores in your scalp,like they were sprinklers, man." This is, if you have beensmoking hash. Somehow, no contradiction is seen between the desireto have a revolution and the desire to smoke hash and go skiing.The revolutionary fever was heavily seasoned with hedonism, whichweakens it badly. And most conversations I got into on the campusseemed spiced in much the same way. A friend reports meeting tworadicals at Berkeley, whose position is simple: Everything willhave to be smashed from stem to stern; America has become thatdiseased. The conversation ends when they ask my friend if hewould like to blow a joint. Okay. They go down the street andclimb into a brand-new Thunderbird, property of the most talkativeradical and proceed to get stoned. The story may be apocryphal, but not very. Yet, through a process of nothing much more than elimination,we have arrived at a position where the vanguard of a revolutionmust be the "alienated" young. The working classhas become reactionary (labor and management may quibble overthe spoils, but none seeks to blow up the trough), the bourgeoisiemiddle class are more dominant than ever, the poor are alreadycontained in ghettoes which are concentration camps lacking onlybarbed wire. Let us look, therefore, at the picture these alienatedyoung presented as the 1960s drew to a close. Here is Barry Farrell'sdescription of the last two nights of the Woodstock festival: As night fell the scene became more dramatic still, disclosinga loud electric image of the future. From the fringes of the crowd,the stage looked like a pearl at the bottom of a pond, a circleof light fired down from towers as big as missile gantries. Justbeyond it, helicopters fluttered in and out of an LZ ringed withChristmas lights, bringing in the rock groups, evacuating casualtiesand stars. Much music was lost under the beat of their blades—anannoyance until it was perceived as a higher music than rock alone—asrock-helicopter music, space music to accompany the sound-and-lightvision of the American '70s. The speaker's expert voice purred across the breadth of the farm,reading off lists of the injured and ill, urging respect for thefences. In the newspeak of our age, he praised the crowd for beinggroovy, cautioning them not to blow the cool thing they had goingby breaking any of the rules. Then he would give way to anothergroup, and the musicians would appear, tiny forms bathed in luridlight. On the festival's last night, when the field had turned to slimeand abandoned sleeping bags lay sprawled underfoot like corpses,my feelings for the event began to darken. Everyone around mewas shivering under soaked coats and blankets. Their bonfires,fed with newspapers and milk cartons, cast up a stench that hungabove the meadow in a yellow haze. On the dark roads, unseen faceswhispered the names of drugs to passing strangers. Mescaline?Hash? At the central crossroads, anxious voices shouted the namesof lost friends. Gloria! Donald! The great stoned rock show had worked a counter-miracle, tradingon the freedom to get stoned, transforming it into a force thattamed the crowd and extracted its compliance. Not that anyoneminded, of course-the freedom to get stoned was all the freedomthey wanted. And, being stoned, everyone was content to sit inthe mud and feed on a merchandised version of the culture theycreated. In the cold acid light, the spoiled field took on theaspect of an Orwellian concentration camp stocked with drugs andmusic and staffed with charming police. The speaker's coaxingvoice only enriched the nightmare, which became complete whenI asked a trembling blue-faced boy if he was feeling all right."Groovy," he said, adding a frozen smile. The Woodstock festival has already been recorded as a victoryfor music and peace, and that is as it should be. But it shouldalso be remembered as a display of the authority of drugs overa whole generation-an authority already being merchandised, exploited,promoted. It was groovy, as the speaker kept saying, but I fearit will grow groovier in memory, when the market in madness leadson to shows we'd rather not see. As for Hair, one had only to glance at the faces in thelobby at intermission to see that these were not people aboutto take to the barricades. Flushed, excited faces, titillated.After all, hadn't they just had their jollies by becoming involvedenough to cheer all the heavy anti-draft lines, the pro-pot lines,the ecstatic lyrics about beauty and truth? They got it out ofthem, all right. Now they will go home feeling liberated, someof them so liberated they will not even worry about how tiredthey're going to feel in the morning when it comes time to goback to work for The Machine. Hair was only incidentally a piece of show biz. Its realsignificance lies in the fact that its arrival (along with theeffective total collapse of censorship, the popularity of pot,the sudden militancy of every minority group, and the rediscoveryof holism) signaled the beginning of a new stage in the affairsof the technological society. Hair was the death-knellof revolution, ringing joyously and ecstatically through the industrializedworld. Then along came Woodstock, and as Barry Farrell wrote inLife, "no one there doubted that we were crossinga cultural Rubicon." The question is: How many realized thatthey had entered the gates of the comfortable concentration camp?The trap had begun to close. The barricades, like the guillotine,were suddenly relics of the past. As that small slice of humanitywhich represents the cutting edge of our evolution rushed forwardto meet the dawn of the Age of Aquarius, they left their machine-gunsand ideologies and programs behind. Straitjackets were sheddedlike old skins. We had begun to give up. What every pessimisticmodern philosopher from Huxley to Jacques Ellul had warned usagainst was finally happening. We were losing control of our destiny,losing our minds, throwing down our weapons and surrendering indroves. We had stopped fighting. Hegel's historical man, whosespirit was in "a mighty conflict with itself," who couldadvance to higher forms only by overcoming himself, was suddenlyas obsolete and pathetic as the Priest King of Nemi, who couldsucceed to office only by slaying the incumbent, and having slainhim, retained power only until he himself was slain, with theresult that "year in year out, in summer and winter, in fairweather and in foul, he had to keep his lonely watch, (sword inhand, pacing around the tree that was his throne) and wheneverhe snatched a troubled slumber it was at the peril of his life." Revolution, whose death-convulsions had taken the form of studentrevolts in the fallopian tubes of the technological society, isfinally finished as the vehicle of human advance. And since revolutionreally means cyclic recurrence, (a vicious circle) we do not haveto bemoan, as Marcuse does, the "passing of historical forces"which seemed, at earlier stages, to represent the possibilityof change. There is no political institution left on the faceof the earth whose ideology is not basically technological, soall a revolution hitched to realpolitik can offer now is moreof the same. Revolution is giving way to liberation and short-circuitingthe vicious circle entirely. If Hair and Woodstock signalthe triumph of the technological society, they also signal theend to futile and self-perpetuating conflict. The Hair and Woodstock phenomena are complex, like theflight of Apollo 11; the question has to be asked: What is theeffect? Do these phenomena liberate or do they add a deeper dimension,a new twist, to the elaborate and subtle mechanisms of aggregatecontrol? The immediate problem with Hair is that its emergence—orthe emergence of some immensely popular show employing exactlythe same devices of protest, outrage, anger, obscenity and revolutionaryrhetoric—was anticipated as far back as the 1950s by Frenchphilosopher Jacques Ellul, who argued that the more restrictivethe social mechanism, the more exaggerated are the associatedecstatic phenomena. (Neither Hair nor Woodstock could bedescribed as other than ecstatic.) "Technique," wroteEllul, "encourages and enables the individual to expresshis ecstatic reactions in a way never before possible. He canexpress criticism of his culture, and even loathing. He is permittedto propose the maddest solutions. The great law here is that allthings are necessary to make a society and even revolt is necessaryto make a technical society." Hair, which expressesplenty of loathing and not a few mad solutions, is tolerated (alongwith pornography, obscenity, and even, to an increasing degree,pot and homosexuality) not because there is more freedom thanbefore, but because the expression of criticism allows peopleto let off steam. And having let off steam they are less likelyto get serious about changing the social order. Marcuse has a word for it: "repressive de-sublimation,"which is the "release of sexuality in modes and forms whichreduce and weaken erotic energy." (Erotic energy being thesource of real rebellion as opposed to burlesques.) In toleratinga show like Hair or a happening like Woodstock, the technocraticorder would be doing nothing less than moving into the realm of"pleasant forms of social control and cohesion." Thethrust of the argument is that pleasant forms of control workmore effectively than repression. Thus, there is the appearanceof rebellion, but no substance. As Ellul puts it: "Techniquedefuses the revolt of the few and thus appeases the need of themillions for revolt." B. It accomplishes nothing, except a changing of the guard. Leonard Cohen remarked in 1968, when asked if there was a revolutiongoing on: "Of course it's a revolution. But I want to seethe real revolution. I don't want it siphoned off by themobilization people. It's got to take place in every room. Revolutionaries,in their heart of hearts, are excited by the tyranny they wield.The lines are being drawn and people on both sides are beginningto terrorize each other. Somehow we have to break out of thisprocess, which can only lead to both sides becoming likeeach other. I'm afraid that when the Pentagon is finally stormedand taken, it will be by guys wearing uniforms very much likethose worn by the guys defending it." Many of us advance into our lives by little more than cause andeffect. That is, we take a step for a variety of reasons and,having taken this small initial step, discover the consequences.We are then forced to deal with those consequences. and we dothat by rationalizing the original act. Having rationalized it,one has then set up the crude framework of a behavioral patternwhich can now be fleshed out by further actions—proceedingin the same direction. Each new action, so long as it continuesto proceed in the same direction, becomes slightly easier thanthe one before. It's like learning to drive, acquiring reflexes.Once one is familiar with the gears it becomes largely automatic.Strong men, or men of action (such as revolutionaries must be),are therefore those whose behavior has been most effectively rationalized.They set themselves in motion automatically. Revolutionary heroesare therefore bound to a large degree to be behavioral automatons.Further, all revolutionaries are forced to accept a disciplinewhich forbids them to freely explore interpretations other thanthose which serve as the basis for the revolution. Revolutionaryzeal is one of the worst forms of tyranny, locking the individualinto a position every bit as static as that of his opposite number,the reactionary. At the extremes, in terms of individual personality,the revolutionary and the reactionary merge. For both, the doorsleading to personal growth and development of their own unrealizedpotential are closed. The man of action requires an uncluttered setting with simpleground rules in order to function. Ideally: A setting as starkas a boxing ring. Only then can the Aristotelian proposition ofeither/or be put to work. The object of the revolutionary (orreactionary) game is to reduce complex on-going processes to afixed game board involving nothing more than two players; blackvs. white, good vs. bad, freedom vs. slavery. If he is successfulin reducing multi-ordinal reality to a simple game, the revolutionaryhas then "set the stage" for an uprising. Needless tosay, in a complex highly-integrated modern industrial state, theinitial task of the revolutionary is that much more difficult. The point here is simply that the revolutionary stance is an idéefixe, monomania. Further, it is, on a grand scale, a kindof decadence—a rejection of the complex (and real) in favorof the simple (and less real). What the revolutionary offers us,finally, is one other idea about how things should be done. Hisgoal is to ram that idea down our throats, and in order to beable to do that, he must first seize power. Which brings us to the heart of the matter. Chairman Mao advisesus that "the seizure of power by armed force, the settlementof the issue by war, is the central task and the highest formof revolution." It is a power struggle first and foremost.Exactly the sort of thing for which the Priest Kings of Nemi standas the central metaphor. The revolutionary does not want change,he wants one change, the change which will bring him intopower. And then...? Why then his task is to fight off the nextwave of revolutionaries who want another change. "Everybodywants to save the world," Henry Miller once noted, "butnobody wants to help his neighbor." "The urge to manipulate others," writes George B. Leonard,"whether to 'solve' a 'problem' or build an empire, beginsin the nursery…The drive for surplus power…is born oflack and nourished by deprivation. 'Power'—the word itself—appearsonly when there are unfulfilled needs. We would never have heardthe term 'Black Power' if blacks had been treated fairly. 'WomanPower' is a statement of denial, a cry for justice. Ultimately,little will be gained if blacks, women, and others of the oppressedmerely gain dominance, thus triggering yet another cycle of deprivationand desperation....'Power' is derived from an Old French wordmeaning, 'to be able.' When we return to this definition, thereal question becomes, 'What do you want to be able to do or be,to feel or enjoy?' The past has taught us well: Playing powergames and losing is a waste of time. Playing power games and gettingexactly what you want is the ultimate despair." All political parties, whether revolutionary or established (alongwith their ideologies and systems) are built on a narrow baseof power. Some specialize in humanism, others on exploitation,yet others on inevitable conflict. In all cases, the issue ofpower remains the locus of activity. All existing political organizations(again whether revolutionary or not) remain essentially anthropomorphic.The struggle is between people and groups of people, each lockedinto a monomaniacal opposing stance. Any disinclination to acceptthe whole ideological package is a sign of betrayal—one becomesa "revisionist" or a "Commie-lover" or somethingto that effect, depending on where and what you are. Revolutionsare seen as mechanisms whereby our sickness might be cured: racism,greed, insanity, hate, fear, distrust, alienation, poverty, dictatorship.Revolution, at best, is seen as a kind of heart transplant; atworst, lobotomy. Always, of course, for the good of the patient,and always on the assumption that the operation will cure allills. "Social change" is the vehicle, the means towardthe higher end of more moral behavior, of greater brotherly love,of physical well-being, an end to hunger and deprivation And to affect these tremendous social changes, it remains absolutelynecessary to seize power. Underdog must overthrow topdog. Underdogis then the new topdog and the old topdog now has a taste of beingunderdog. The guard has been changed. There is a new man in thesaddle. Beyond that stage, what happens? The operational mode of thinking remains the trigger of all practicalchange. Today, Marxism is the mirror image of capitalism, butbasically no different. Because Communists and Socialists andCapitalists have all hitched their social wagons to the engineof technology, there can be no basic change. Exploitation of natureremains the key to wealth, whether equally distributed or not.And through the domination of nature, the men continue to dominateeach other and be dominated. Theodore Roszak puts it well: To immerse oneself in the old ideologies-with the notable exceptionof the anarchist tradition which flows from such figures as Kropotkin,Tolstoy, Thoreau—is to find oneself stifling in the stone andsteel environment of unquestionable technological necessity. Itis a literature of seriousness and grim resolve, tightly boundedby practicality, class discipline, the statistics of injustice,and the lust for retribution. To speak of the ecstasies of lifein such a somber environment is to risk folly. Here where allmen trudge, none may dance. Dancing is . . . for later. If thedemise of the old ideologies begins anywhere, it begins with thisdelaying gesture. For to postpone until 'later' considerationof the humanly essential in the name of 'being realistic' is topractise the kind of deadly practicality which now stands ourcivilization in peril of annihilation. It is to deliver us intothe hands of the dehumanized commissars, managers, and operationalanalysts—all of whom are professional experts at postponingthe essential. These are the practitioners of what C. Wright Millscalled 'crackpot realism.' Revolution is based in part on the proposition that institutionsmust be shuffled, and then the hearts of men and womencan be affected. Control—through the institutional agencies—isthe prerequisite for real change. It does not cross the revolutionarymind that institutions are the last extensions of man—that tobegin attempting to cure human ills through the agencies of institutionsis to start at the ass end. Institutions, laws, legislation andflags can be easily changed—what, we must ask, has that gotto do with individuals? Such thinking misses completely the basicpsychological insight that we cannot deliberately bring aboutchanges in ourselves or in others. Any intention toward changewill have the opposite effect. A "successful" revolutionmeans simply that we are saddled with a new set of controllers.Meanwhile, in our hearts nothing has changed. The power gamesgo on. Exploitation of nature continues. Man is still assumedto be, "realistically," the center of the universe.A king of flat-earth psychology continues to dominate our collectivebehavior. Meanwhile, the earth continues to die. C. It diverts us from the real struggle, which is to attaina higher level of consciousness, and to explore our potential(which is still unknown.) Leon Trotsky once prophesied that the final revolution in theworld would consist of a series of small and violent upheavalsgoing on everywhere, lasting perhaps for generations. This soundsdead on, yet not even Trotsky could have envisioned how "small"and how "violent." The final revolution will be takingplace in an arena no larger than my head and your head, and itwill involve a psychic and emotional violence whose measure hasnot yet been taken. So long as we are concentrating our energieson power struggles, on toppling institutions only to replace themwith others, we are channeling our energies outward; it is anexercise as futile as the trip to the moon, all part of an outwardvoyage whose aim is exploitation, whose method is manipulation,whose end is power and control. History is a stuck record, withhuman struggle caught in a single groove, the vicious circle ofcyclic recurrence. Down goes one king, and up goes another. Theday after a palace is stormed, the new bosses set up shop acrossthe street. We have not yet escaped from collective childhood,in the sense that we still need leaders, and still do not trustour own senses. (Liberals, with their tremendous fear of being"judgmental," are among the worst offenders. It is theliberals who have come closest to building systems on a fusionof man and his works, yet they have not learned that their weakness—equivocality—isalso their greatest potential source of strength.) Revolutionis seen always as the means to an end which is human liberation,freedom not only from want, but from the tyranny of the emotions,racism, hatred, murder, crime, and exploitation. "Socialchange" will lead to a change in consciousness. Yet thisis in reality a Rube Goldberg course. The possibility of movingdirectly from A to B. without having to climb to the top of thepyramid in order to get down to the bottom of it, has not evenhistorically been considered; except, of course, by theologiansand artists. The only way for the greater human being to comeinto existence is directly, giving birth to himself. No ideologyis prepared to accept the idea that the cure might precede therevolutionary operation, that perhaps the operation might onlymake the patient sicker. Change—real change, as opposed to achange of political underwear—will only come after the factof individual liberation. And since this is something that cannotbe organized or led, that does not lend itself to political orideological frames of reference, it is dismissed (by the operationalists)as being nothing at all. Yet we might with good cause demand:Revolutionary, heal thyself! The real revolution works in exactlythe opposite fashion to what has always been assumed to be thecase-changing the social institutions does no good, because thelast link in the chain, the individual, is the farthest removedfrom the locus of power. When however, the individual is the firstlink to be affected, it turns out that the seats of power arethemselves the last to be changed. Institutions and thrones areabout as far removed from the ordinary citizen as anything inthe social landscape. The aim of revolutionary types has beento organize the people to move against the thrones, to tear downthe institutions. In the process, people submit to disciplineand the need for violence, and thus become violent disciplinariansthemselves. The fact that they may be crushing an entrenched setof violent disciplinarians at this point makes no real difference.How far have they progressed in the direction of realization ofthemselves? Nowhere. They may have succeeded in brutalizing themselves,in reverting to the logic of domination and can be certain ofemerging from the bloodbath convinced that the operational pointof view is the only point of view. Other than that, there is noprogress in the critical direction—which is to explore unknownterritory, to move upward, not downward, in terms of personaland collective evolution, to acquire a keener vision, a deepeningof the senses, an enlargement of vision, to the point where wemight perceive subtler harmonies, regularities which were notnoticed before, and, finally, to bring our shattered selves backinto a working whole. The task is to complete the human being,not turn him back into a barbarian. The question arises: It's all very well to say that we must all"save ourselves," no one can do it for us, but whatabout the obvious inequalities of the present system? What aboutcorruption? Police brutality? Militarism? Murder? What good doesit do if you liberate yourself and achieve a state of "highermorality" or whatever, if, in the meantime, Vietnamese peasantscontinue to be bombed, Blacks are starving in ghettoes, Indiansare processed and reprocessed through prisons, millions are dyingof starvation, madmen have their fingers poised on the nucleartrigger, and the planet is being destroyed by parasitic corporationsand governments? Isn't 'self-liberation" at this stage aluxury we can ill afford to indulge ourselves in? There is realwork to be done, and done in a hurry if we are to survive. The short answer lies in what Gestalt therapist Fritz Perls describesas the most important phenomenon in all pathology: "self-regulationversus external regulation. The anarchy which is usually fearedby the controllers is not an anarchy which is without meaning.On the contrary, it means the organism is left alone to take careof itself, without being meddled with from outside. And I believethis is the great thing to understand: that awareness per se—byand of itself—can be curative. Because with full awarenessyou become aware of this organismic self-regulation, you can letthe organism take over without interfering, without interrupting;we can rely on the wisdom of the organism." In the sociologicalcontext, the message is clear enough: awareness is thestarting point for action which is not pre-determined by ideologicalbias; without awareness, without having gotten to the "center"of our beings, as the Gestaltists call it, without having transcendedthe operational mode of thinking which reduces our actions tolittle more than acted-out equations, without having "cured"ourselves of our refusal to let the situation dictate our actions(rather than vice-versa), there is nothing we can do with certaintywhich will not simply amount to a subtler kind of power-game,a reversal of roles, or—and this is the unavoidable trap—whichwill not amount in the long run to a projection of our own disequilibriumThis is not to suggest a "moratorium" on political activity,which in itself can be therapeutic, but it is to say that theblind have no right to be leading the blind. Only when our owneyes are open can we presume to lead. Otherwise we may rest assuredthat whatever illusions we may have about "progress"are in reality nothing more than circular gropings in the dark,with pitfalls everywhere. The answers, once one's eyes are open,can be clearly perceived. Before proceeding to look beyond the barricades (a garbage heapof antique social furniture) there is a point which needs to becleared up, since much of what has been said so far about thefutility of revolution can easily be misconstrued as a put-downof very real and just revolutions taking place not only in America,but in Canada and Vietnam and elsewhere. My argument is simplythat revolution must take the shape of its container; it definesitself in relation to the system it seeks to defy or overthrow.But I am speaking of revolution in the context of the technologicalsociety, or one-dimensional society, or the affluent society,or whatever label one chooses to describe what is mainly a whiteman's modern world. Not everyone in North America lives in thatworld. The ghettoes——-whether black ghettoes in Los Angelesor Chicago or Eskimo or Indian ghettoes in Canada and in the Arctic-aretruly another country. And the struggles that go on within theseterritories are against colonialism, imperialism, and brutal oppression.They have much in common with the struggle of the Vietnamese.The "container" in these cases is quite different fromthe kind of container in which those of us who are predominantlywhite and living in suburbs and high-rise apartments find ourselves. The Hudson Institute has calculated that within thirty years thefirst four post-industrial societies will have surfaced on theface of the planet. They will be, in this order, the United States,Canada, Japan, and Sweden. They will be characterized by the factthat per capita income will range from $4,000 to $20,000;most economic activity will have shifted from industrial productionto the service industries, research institutes and non-profitorganizations; private enterprise will no longer be a major sourceof scientific and technical development. Large-scale integrationwill be all but complete. We will be far down the path of convergencewith the Communist world. At this point, the technological societywill have clamped its iron arms around the world, bioelectronicswill have succeeded in literally plugging us into world-wide hookupsand a de facto police state will have emerged. It is inthese areas (the post-industrialized regions) that the obsolescenceof revolution will be most apparent. This is not to say that, outside the affluent sphere, revolutionwill be obsolete. The "wretched of the earth" will stillbe with us, old-style police states based on brutality and oppressionwill still exist, colonialism in a variety of forms will likelystill prevail. In these "outside regions," there isno reason to assume that armed insurrection, revolution, and violentoverthrown of corrupt and brutal administrations is in any wayunjustified or unnecessary. To draw our models for revolutionary behavior from these otherregions, however, is to refuse to recognize the qualitative differencesbetween these societies. Within a single generation, there willbe a difference between the most advanced societies and the onestrailing behind them which will not only be a matter of degreebut of kind. Those of us in the most advanced regions will beliving in a different world. A fundamental change is involved.For us to continue to assume that revolutionary programs applicablein China, India, most of South America and Africa (areas whichhave not even approached the industrialized stage) can somehowhave any relevance in our own advanced industrial context, is,at best, an unsophisticated notion; at worst, plain stupidity.Within the comfortable concentration camp, inside a system whichcan absorb and contain and feed on all forms of protest and rebellion,a whole new set of tactics must be evolved, and are beingevolved. Moreover, we have no choice in the matter, since old-stylerevolutionary activity simply will not work. We will be effectivelyblocked from indulging in the kind of uprising and overthrow whichamounts to cyclic recurrence. We will have no Bastilles left tostorm except those within our skulls, no oppressors left whomwe can get our hands on except our egos. The struggles which werealways directed outward—against tyrants and dictators-will havebeen effectively thwarted, and will be turned back on themselves.Inward will go the revolution, turning every man's head into abattlefield. The "social bottle" of those regions on planet earthwhich are furthest into the future is different, unique; by thestandards of other ages and other cultures, it is downright freaky.It has been molded into a new form—by the computer, by television,by changes in social character, by technoplanning, cybernetics,chemistry, psychology, technique. We all agree it is made fromnew materials: plastic, nuclear power, vinyl, electronic circuitry,datapoints and programming. Yet how many of us are prepared tosee that revolution, the counterpoint to all that is totalitarianand repressive (even when rationally totalitarian and repressive)must also change; it must, in fact, become as strange, as novel,as freaky as its container. And it is becoming all of that—somuch so that most of us fail to recognize it as revolution. Indrama we see, as Martin Esslin put it, "By all traditionalstandards of critical appreciation of the drama, these [modernabsurd] dramas are not only abominably bad, they do not even deservethe name of drama." Mark Gerzon goes on to say: "Manypeople have realized that nothing can be judged by traditionalstandards, for we do not live any longer in a traditional society.How many parents have said about modern music and painting thatthey do not even deserve the name? The arts have broken with traditionbecause they found the limitations on style and structure unnecessaryand artificial..." Similarly, "revolution" is inthe process of breaking from traditional style and structure. Before proceeding, it is necessary to clearly distinguish betweenthis ultimate struggle and the penultimate struggles being wagedby oppressed people living outside the perimeter of The Machine.Basically, these next-to-last struggles are efforts to break intothe area already inhabited by those of us who are affluent. Althoughour own struggle is of a different nature, we cannot ignore thoseother struggles and neither can we afford to refuse to help. Butfirst we must have some understanding of the difference.To this end, let me focus on the Black Panther Party, which isa real revolutionary force (in the old pre-technological style).

Copyright Guy Mount At this moment in American History, the practitioners ofalternative herbal medicine and religion are the most persecutedand prosecuted members of society. Peyote itself is under attackfrom oil well development companies, dry land ranchingtechniques, and an ever increasing number of consumers. There isan immediate need to 1) pass laws in each state that protect therights of all people, regardless of race or ethnic origin, topractice the peyote religion and pursue alternative healingstrategies (which may employ herbs on the "controlledsubstances" list), and 2) protect peyote by developingnature preserves in south Texas and encouraging cultivation. ThePeyote Religion and the herbal sacrament it depends on will soonbe extinct unless something radical is done to establishenvironmental protection and decriminalize cultivation. There is also a great need to provide educational curriculumthat supports a peaceful transition from an abusive "War onDrugs" to a knowledgeable use of herbal medicines. Oureducational system presently teaches children that "druguse" is crazy and criminal. There is no distinction madebetween herbs and drugs, nor are any positive images of herbalmedicines provided; so it's not surprising that Americanteenagers act crazy and commit crimes when they use herbs anddrugs---that's what they've been taught to do! Fortunately, the Native American Church and Native Americanphilosophy in general provide us with the lessons we need to growas individuals, and to improve the overall health of our society.Insofar as America learned from its native people, it hasprovided Light to the world through democracy, religious freedomand economic reciprocity. Therefore, I hope the Peyote Religionwill grow substantially in the near future to include many newpractitioners from all races, and legal Peyote Churches andgreenhouses in all states. Our world needs this medicine, thislifeline to the future. ---Guy Mount, Editor PeyoteWisdom Menu Page LSDand Psychedelics Menu Page Cliffschaffer's Home Page WT01-B35-25IA087-000628-B033-168http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/lsd/peyote.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122063641 text/html 46031HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:36:33 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 01-Jan-97 22:22:01 GMTContent-length: 45812 Peyote Night by Humphry Osmond PEYOTE NIGHT HUMPHRY OSMOND This article originally appeared in Tomorrow magazine,Spring 1961. The Native American Church is a religious movement whichoriginated among the Indians of the Southwestem United States.Its main features involve the use of peyote, a psychedelic, ormind-manifester, drug obtained from the dried tops of a cactusthat contains mescaline, in a ceremony combining Indian religiousmotifs with certain Christian themes. The drug and the ceremonyare fused together in a manner acceptable to many Indians today.My interest in this church was a professional one, springing frommy researches into psychedelics, the vision-producing drugs theIndians use in a group setting. So far as our research groupcould make out, the Indians were the first people who used thesesubstances together with certain aspects of Christianity. We hadheard about them in different ways. Religious people who wantedthis sect suppressed had published complaints in variousnewspapers. In my country, Canada, there had been questions andstatements from a Minister in the House of Commons at Ottawa. Apolice report we read suggested that peyote was both a dangerouspoison and a drug of addiction. Professor Charles Seevers of AnnArbor, one of the world's leading authorities on both peyote andmescaline, one of its active principles, has frequently statedthat it was of low toxicity and that he had no evidence of anyonebecoming addicted to it. The U. S. Public Health ServiceNarcotics Section at Fort Leavenworth have never treated a peyoteaddict. One of the clearest and kindest accounts of them and theirreligion came from the late Professor J. S. Slotkin of theUniversity of Chicago. He had visited the Canadian branches ofthe Native American Church of North America in the summer of1956. He told us they were being persecuted, not very obviously,thoroughly or determinedly, but although it was mild andintermittent, it was persecution all the same. Some of thesepersecutors did not deserve the label, for they were good peoplegenuinely concerned about the Indians, who had been misinformedabout the nature of the peyote rite. They were naturally worriedby reports that the Indians were obtaining a dangerous andaddictive substance and engaging in wild orgies. There was reasonto be concerned after the damage liquor has done to some Indiansin the past. Along with these people who had a real interest inthe Indians, there were others who never lose an opportunity tomeddle in other people's affairs. There is not too much scope forthis hobby in western Canada today, but the Indians, beinggovernment wards and a special minority group, are particularlysusceptible to this sort of interference. As the scholarlySlotkin explained to us, "Their conditions are wretched.They are demoralized. Many of them hate and despise farming. TheNative American Church is something of their own, born of theirmisfortunes and developed from their pre-Columbian traditions. Ithas grown and flourished in spite of white men, and this makes iteven more precious to the Indians." Slotkin thought we could do no harm by attending one of theirservices, and we might help. It would at least show them that allwhite men were not hostile. Their services have been described asorgies only by those who have never attended them. It is curiousthat the early Christians had much the same accusations leveledat them by the Romans, whose staid, formalized, official religionhad become little more than an annex to politics, devoid ofenthusiasm and feeling. Any young religion (Quakers in Fox's dayor the Methodists in Wesley's are examples) usually manages tooffend longer-established churches, just as young lovers aresomething of a reproach to long-wed people, for they reflect avision of love that time has more or less dimmed. Long-marriedpeople in whom time does not produce this dimming can beembarrassing to their more habituated contemporaries. We corresponded in a desultory way with the Indians of theRed Pheasant Band, from among whose members most of thecongregation of the Native American Church of Canada was drawn.The Church had been duly registered as a religious body and sowas safe from direct persecution. But the supply of peyote, theirceremonial cactus, came from the United States, and this madethem vulnerable to administrative pressure, as later events haveshown. In September 1956, we learned that Mr. Frank Takes Gun,President of the Native American Church of North America, wasplanning to come north from his home in Montana to see how hisfellow church members were faring in Canada. Shortly after this,we were invited to North Battleford. We drove north, picking upDr. Abram Hoffer in Saskatoon, armed with a tape recorder,blankets, and lots of notebooks. Two members of the SaskatoonStar Phoenix staff traveled with us. It was a glowing early fallday, and the stubble was still live enough to give the land ablond, crew-cut look. We arrived in North Battleford late in theafternoon of the sixth of October, 1956. Mr. Takes Gun and hiscompanion, Mr. Russell, came to see us in our hotel. They had hada harassing time getting the hard-pressed Red Pheasant Band toorganize the ceremony. They are poor Indians. Mr. Takes Gun hadhelped them to get permission to pitch a tepee for the meeting inthe grounds of old Fort Battleford. He was also inquiring intothe legal help the Indians were getting in Canada. The Indians'way of conducting business is still not very like that of thewhite man, and there is much misunderstanding. I was tired and a little apprehensive on at least two counts.My colleagues and I had decided that, while they would watch andrecord the ceremony, I should take part in it, and observe fromthe inside, as it were. I did not wholly enjoy the idea of takingpeyote, although I have used a variety of mind-changingsubstances in the past few years. These have included takingharmola, the seeds of Syrian rue, which has a disgusting taste;kavakava, the roots and leaves of a South Sea Island pepperplant; ololiuqui, the seeds of Rivea corymbosa, a vinelike plantfrom Mexico, once the chief and sacred narcotic of the Aztecs. Ihad also taken chemically pure mescaline, one active principle ofpeyote, and the immensely powerful Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,both derived from plants. In addition, we had worked with a newgroup of substances derived from adrenalin, whose use in thisfield had been discovered in Saskatchewan. I had, however, nevertaken peyote before. I found its dried, shriveled, and furryappearance uninviting, and reports said it frequently producednausea and vomiting. I did not relish the idea of vomiting inpublic. My second worry was a more serious one. I had muchsympathy for the Indians and wanted to assist their cause, but asan honest observer I would have to report everything thathappened. I was concerned lest the service should beill-conducted. Mr. Takes Gun was clearly worried about me. He told merepeatedly that they would have good, clean city water and thatthe cups would be personal and hygienic. The peyote, he assuredme, would not be difficult to take, but would be made soft with acoffee grinder and wrapped individually in Kleenex. He is ofmedium height and very solidly built, of that almost puremesomorphy that one finds often among the Plains Indians. Hisface might have been carved from old, oiled, highly polishedteakwood. He glistened in the afternoon sun-for he was nervous.His eyes and hair were black. He had the longest ears I have everseen. His face was impassive. This made one notice the eloquenceof his hands all the more (one finger was missing from the leftone); his gestures were as expressive as a Latin's. Mr. Takes Gun left us to make the final preparations for theceremony. We agreed to be at North Battleford a little aftersundown, and, before he left, he gave me a final reassuranceabout the purity of the water. We crossed the golden valley ofthe South Saskatchewan River and drove up the hillside to the oldfort. They had set the tepee on the short grass inside thestockade. It was small and pale, its ventilator flapping in thebreeze. The clear night sky with the stars appearing and thefaint swirl of nothern lights seemed about to engulf us. Outsidethe tepee there was a great stack of small logs. The ceremonial fire in the center of the tepee was ready forlighting. It was between the horns of the low, crescent-moonaltar shaped from molded earth. Only the fire tender occupiedthis middle space. The rest of us, eight observers, including twojournalists, and fourteen Indian worshipers, were ranged aroundthe circumference of the tepee. Apart from Mr. Takes Gun, and Mr.Russell, who had driven up from Montana, our hosts came fromSaskatchewan, mostly from the Red Pheasant Band, though a few haddriven over from Alberta. The elders of this group were Mr.Nicotine and Mr. Stone. There were several younger men and twoIndian ladies. All looked spruce and neat. They had clearly puton their best clothes for the service. I sat on Mr. Takes Gun'sleft so that I could learn about the ceremony from him. He wasthe leader, and Mr. Russell, on his right, was his drummer. In a tepee, one sits with one's back slightly bent and one'shead forward. However one places the legs, they get stiff, thelong hamstring muscles in particular. Cramping pains can be anuisance. Mr. Russell played the fire taps on his drum, and thefire tender lit the prepared wood. Sparks rose up and flutteredin the darkness above us before vanishing. The tepee was filledwith the pleasant, acrid smell of sage, thyme, and burning logs.Mr. Takes Gun put a single leaf and then a large peyote button onthe moon altar. The rest of us remained seated, and he wassilent. He consulted his watch from time to time. At eight-thirtyhe began to read a written address he had with him. He asked for"Religious freedom for the Indian form ofChristianity." He quoted the Declaration of Independencewith its inalienable rights, which include religious freedom andthe pursuit of happiness. The long Indian faces, dark in the fireglow, expressed melancholy, dolor, tragedy. "We want to belet alone to worship our God as we wish." He then addressedthe observers directly: "I trust you will tell the truth andnothing but the truth so help us God." It is no easy mattereven to observe accurately enough to be sure what the truth mightbe, and having done this, how should one convey the truth so thatit will mean something to someone else? I wondered how I would beable to communicate the solemnity of that frail tepee. It waslike being inside a lighted Japanese lantern, suspended ineternity. The smoke started the ceremony proper. The Indians aremasters of symbolism; a few eagle feathers, a pinch of sweetherbs, a little water drum, a gourd rattle, a fire, and littlemore, are all the aids they need for worship. For them,everything that is, is holy. They have no written prayers, but asamong the Quakers, everyone prays according to his conscience. Soa cigarette made from cornhusks symbolizes for them thepurification and dedication of the human spirit to a greaterspirit. The tobacco was handed around in a soft leather pouch. Itwas runny, with many small grains. I am not a smoker. I fashionedmy cigarette clumsily and the tobacco leaked out, and the resultwas rather emaciated. A glowing brand was passed around forlighting the cigarettes. Shortly after mine was lit, I choked.The fire felt very hot on my face, almost scorching, while behindI was chilly. It did not seem a good start for the evening. While Mr. Russell beat the drum, Mr. Takes Gun chanted andshook the rattle. Sometimes he used English and sometimes his owntongue. The wind noises were lost in the chanting and thedrumming. His voice rose effortlessly from a firm baritone to ahigh, clear falsetto. Dear Heavenly Father, We are representing our folks under this tepee. Dear Heavenly Father, Dear Heavenly Father Bless these men that are observers here. Dear Heavenly Father, These poor people surrendered all their lands To the Government of Canada---their conditions Are pitiful. Dear Heavenly Father---bless my people back home. Then he continued in his own tongue, which seemed made forrhetoric, for declamation, and his voice rose in searchingfalsetto. The Indians maintained a low background of song intheir three different languages. The faces of his fellowworshipers were angry, resigned, supplicating, shifting with thechanges of rhythm and the flickering fire. The chorus ceased fromtime to time and the leader continued alone, his voice cascadingand dying away, the song of a bird fluttering against a greatstorm. The fire glowed. An Indian wept. We placed our cigarettesaround the base of the moon altar. At about 9 P.M. the peyote was brought in. It was carried ina little white cloth sack, which was handed from person toperson. Mine came separately; it had been macerated in a coffeegrinder and each button wrapped in a white tissue, so courteousare the Indians. They themselves crunched the hard, dry, furrycactus tops determinedly, as one cracks nuts with one's teeth. Inibbled cautiously at my soft, damp residue. It has a sharptaste, which lingers in the mouth. It is bitter and sour on thestomach. It repeats on one. It is not as bad as ololiuqui, and ispleasant compared with the sour, oily, rancid seed of the Syrianrue. Mr. Takes Gun belched a little after swallowing his. Peyotetakers, making a virtue of necessity, sometimes allege there issomething especially valuable about the nausea it induces in somepeople. As in other religions, rationalizations are always readyto help out anything unpalatable. I was glad when I swallowed thelast bit of peyote. My apprehensions about vomiting wereunnecessary. The drumming and singing continued. The water drum is made ofblackened iron covered with hide. Seven knobs on the siderepresent the dipper stars. Behind the singing there is alwaysdrumming and rattling. The drum beat in the brain and wearied me;every drummer seemed much the same. The fire tender moved theashes into the space between the horns of the moon, so that itgradually filled up with fine wood ashes. I had respect for theceremony. It was reverent and well conducted. But I was still notof the group, even though I was among them. I scribbled away atmy note pad and often watched my observing colleagues, who wereat the other side of the tepee. At about nine-fifteen I wrote, "The young man with thesuperb face, puzzled by his fate---he has a kingly face,"and again, "if feeling gets to God, this must." By nineforty-five there was a ghost of brilliant color in my eye groundswhen I closed my lids. I felt remote and slightly depressed. Theroof flap fluttered like a lost soul. The tepee is a microcosm, atiny mirror of the universe. The fire glowed red and smokeless;the fire tender handed around a smoldering brand for those whowanted to smoke. Mr. Takes Gun recited prayers in hislanguage---as he smoked, his hands moved with extraordinarydelicacy. It was an unorgiastic orgy. The Indians sing withoutopening their mouths much, and often they hardly move their lips.They sing with their sound box and chest, while we use our lips,tongue, and sound box. I was never quite sure where the singingwas coming from, and it was sometimes almost impossible to decidewho was singing and who was not. By about ten I had become more aware of what was happening,and recognized that peyote was starting to affect me. My sightwas sharper and my hearing more acute. Looking around the tepee,it struck me that we white men, outnumbered in this tiny world,were an even smaller fraction of the larger one. I found it hardto write and did so reluctantly because, as I noted, ". . .it broke the chain of feeling." I got nothing down on my padfor the next hour and a half. Visual changes continued andincreased during this time. They never became very marked, but attimes the Indians seemed hostile. Their faces became distortedwith anger. I realized that this was probably the effect ofpeyote and so did not become panicky. I felt that I was anintruder whom the Indians did not trust-they had no specialreason to. I did not seem close to them. Peyote works slowly andsubtly. It is well suited for a gathering of this sort, wherepeople of differing temperaments, who do not necessarily share acommon language, worship together and explore reality without thecushion of words and supported mainly by ritual. A photographer took some flash pictures at about ten orfifteen minutes before midnight, and then I started writingagain. The Indians chanted, drummed, and used the gourd rattle.Only their faces were impassive. The ceremonial swept me alongwith it. At midnight, water was brought in. This was the pure citywater Mr. Takes Gun had promised me earlier. It was in a new,white enamel pail with a swan transfer on the outside. It waspassed around, and we drank from individual paper cups. It couldhave been depressingly hygienic, but the intention was a generousone to put me at ease. He then said, "Pray to God and askhim to bless the water." He explained that the Indians heldtheir services at night, while the white man sleeps, because Godwould have time to spare for his Indian friends. He urged hisfellow Indians to bring up their children to be intelligent andprogressive, adding, "We are representing our liveshere." Then he left us and, walking around the outside ofthe tepee, blew piercing blasts on an eagle's-bone whistle at thefour compass points. The sound shrilled through aeons of spaceand corridors of time. It echoed to eternity. When he came backto us, he prayed, ". . . that the Universe mayprevail." Shortly after this my fellow observers left for what musthave been twenty minutes or so, but it could have been as manycenturies. I stayed behind with the Indians, and I became part ofthe worshipers. I entered their world, where for generation upongeneration they had hunted the buffalo. They had lived with andon the buffalo. They were of one piece. They were the buffalo.Their lives were part of those shaggy lumbering herd beasts whosemyriads roamed the great plains. On these wide prairies, wheretrees and hills are almost equally scarce, sound often conveyedas much as sight. So the Indians call up their past with song,with drum, and with rattle. For them, minute alterations ofrhythm and pace evoke ever-changing images. Because we cannothear as they do, the drumming and rattling seem endlesslyrepetitive to us. The drumming was the steady running of a manwith his dog padding beside him. It was the pawing and thuddingof buffalo hooves crescendoing in thunder. It was the gentlecrumpling of dung falling or the soft plop of a calf dropping onturf, soundless, yet heard by the hunter. The gourd evoked theendlessly sifting wind, catching at scrub and grass as it passed.It was the hissing of an arrow as it leaves the bow or snakes byone's head in battle. It was the sizzling of buffalo meatgrilling on the campfire and the creak of a hide tepee as theblizzard twists and whirls around it. The drumming was life anddeath, scarlet blood spurting from a stricken buffalo or from afallen warrior. Yet it was also the first fluttering of a childinside its mother. As he sang, a young man wept, and Frank TakesGun said, "Shed tears on mother earth that the Universal Godmay take pity on him." When my friends returned, I felt that the Indians and I wereone and that, for a little time, or more accurately, a differentsort of time, I was of their world rather than that of mycolleagues, their conquerors. It was not simply that I realizedthey had a point of view I could respect, but that I felt in mybones as they felt in theirs. Looking back, I do not believe thatthis was an illusion, for I continued to be much more aware oftheir way of looking at things. But how could one prove such anopinion-without fine instruments for measuring a man's system ofvalues. The women did not drum, sing or use the gourd rattle, butthey smoked, took peyote, and played a large part in the morningceremony. They also prepared the feast for the next day. Womenonly very rarely enjoy their highest status among nomadic people. The Indians must have begun to filter down from Siberia aboutten thousand years ago, and as they reached the great centralplains they spread out in the wake of the buffalo. For somemysterious reason, horses, which had once lived in America, diedout long before man arrived. So the newcomers hunted on foot.Unlike our forebears, who were harassed and pushed west by wavesof horsemen from Central Asia, many tiny Indian societies grew upfar apart from each other, isolated by vast distances. There wereoccasionally brief, savage, and ceremonious wars on the prairies,in which little groups of men raided the enemies. In these,courage counted more than killing. Apart from this, their wholelives, their very existence, was at the heels of those heavymonsters. Pursuing them, they had endured drought and cold,furious rainstorms and blinding blizzards. For a very short time,a few generations only, they had horses, which, escaping from theSpaniards, bred splendidly on the grasslands. Few people acceptan innovation so quickly and successfully as the Indians took tothe horse. They were centaurs. The drumming told of that age ofglory when, to the beat of horses' hooves, they swept across theprairies like wildfire and hunted with a splendor neversurpassed. Then the white settlers invaded the prairies, and theunequal struggle between hunting peoples who lived in spacewithout time, and the season-bound rapacity of the cultivators ofthe soil, began. The hunting grounds were eroded. Finally thebuffalo were slaughtered wantonly by the million. With thatholocaust, their traditions, their way of life, their world,their universe collapsed, and the veil of their souls was rent.Braves became bums, for there was nothing manly left to do. Theirwomen mourned for them. I was drenched in that world of sound, of singing, drumming,and the subtly changing rhythms of drum, rattle, and voice. Weare a more visual people than the Indians, and this is perhapswhy they seem impassive to us. We watch, in particular, forchanges in facial expression and do not notice the auditorysignals with which the Indians communicate their feelings. Thoselong silences during which they let the unspoken flow betweenpeople simply make us tense, embarrassed, uneasy, and ready toburst into nervous chattering. The blue-shirted young man who had been weeping said,"Frank, can I have some more medicine?" and the littlesack was passed along to him. He crunched two more buttons andbegan to sing and use the gourd rattle while his companiondrummed. His song rose above the drumming, was drowned by it, androse again and again, faltering but struggling still. It was anagony. The drumbeats were strides of fate. Life must go on, painor no pain. There could be no concessions. The young man wept andsang for himself, for his people, for every human being who hasever quailed before the harshness of life. After singing, he waseasier, and the rhythm of his drumming reflected this. There wasin it a little of that cosmic beat of Tchaikowsky's great SecondMovement of the Fifth Symphony, when, for a brief while, he heardand transcribed what must surely be the pulsing of the galaxies.I watched the young man, and I think I experienced some of thequeasiness that peyote induced in him. Like most young men, helonged for a life that meant something-a life of action, danger,pain, defeat, torture, and death at the hands of his enemies ifnecessary. A life like that of his ancestors who lived on theprairies for centuries before. Anything rather than thehumiliating meaninglessness of the present. But the drumming toldhim, "You cannot go back. You can go forward. It will berough, but it can be done." It is sad to be a warrior fromgenerations of warriors with nothing warlike to do-an Achilleswithout Troy, staying at home among his mother's spinning women. The fire tender kept the hearth meticulously, and the moonaltar, which had started as a thin crescent, filled up steadily.When a singer had sung his song, the Indians sat in silence andabsorbed it. They applauded with a low guttural noise that mightbe a hum. They were polite, sensitive, and seemed very courteousand alert toward each other and to their guests. By now it wasalmost three in the morning, and most of the observers wereasleep; one snored loudly and had to be prodded by his neighbor.The visual imagery I usually experience with psychedelicsubstances was much reduced in this setting, and the auditoryimagery very much increased. I responded to every nuance of theirdrumming. They use a tiny range of sound with which to expressthemselves, and this is saturated with emotion. The sparks spangled the upper darkness of the tepee everytime the fire was stoked. The tepee was the universe. It had notincreased in size nor changed its shape, but the sound hadexpanded it beyond thought. The young man still cannot bear hisfate. All the warrior in him is assailed by it and revoltsagainst it. But he must listen to the voice of the music, whichis greater than man. He sings again, this time in high falsetto.There is a note of triumph in it, and perhaps peyote hasdissolved the aching in his heart---for a little while. The tepee smelled of wood and wood smoke, burning herbs,sweat. I noticed the tanginess of the smoke, like in a kipperingroom. It clung to my hair and clothes for days afterward. TheIndians are creatures of sound and smell, with auditory symbolismpredominating. We are creatures of sight and sound, with visualimagery predominating. Every drum tap has a meaning for them. Through the small hours they sang of fleet horses andtireless riders, of unwearying runners and faithful dogs paddingbeside them. The stories are woven into the drum rhythms. Theyfanned themselves with a few eagle's feathers, evoking arrow, warbonnet, and battle club-endless parleys, powwows, and ceremonialmeetings. They had few songs of war, and they returned always tothe death of the buffalo, their banishment from the prairies, andso their unmanning and loss of their warrior status. The buffalohoofbeats are in them as the sound of the sea is in me fromgenerations of seafarers. The Indians may be poor and defeated,but they are not contemptible. They reveal themselves to eachother with peyote in humility, but also in pride. For althoughthey revere the Universal Spirit, they do not cringe. They arenot ashamed of being men, for so they were created. They do notascribe their misfortunes to sin, and are thus saved from muchfutile self-blame. Mr. Russell's drumming was splendid. Frank sang of the longwinter nights and their hopes of endless buffalo herds. He sang,too, of that brief time when they tamed horses, moldinglong-maned and long-tailed wildings to their will. This remindedme that the Trojan hero Hector, tamer of horses, was exercizingwith his chariots on the windy plain of Ilium when theirancestors were hunting the buffalo on foot, over these sameprairies. The service was very simple and drew the participantsinto it. Once I lost my fear and unsureness, the Indians acceptedme with dignity, as an equal. I was impressed by their economy ofgesture, the faultless taste of their religious art; like a verydry sherry, it is not for every palate. The prairies have moldedthem over the centuries---they are a people of the open spaces;their God is an open one of the wide earth and the limitlesssky---not a shadowy, hidden god of the forests and thickets.Their Universal Spirit is mysterious in its immensity andomnipresence. Man's problem is not to find God, for it isimpossible not to be aware of Him, but to relate oneself to Himin the best possible way. By four-thirty I was becoming more aware of my hosts asindividuals. We had experienced something together that cannot becontained in language. Poetry or music would come closer, but Iam not a poet or a composer. The wind fretted around the tepee.The singing was like voices calling in the dark, calling for dawnto come, for winter to go, for the buffalo to return, for a childto be born. Mr. Russell had the black drum passed to him. He sucked alittle water from it, tautened the hide, and smoothed it with acaress. Frank Takes Gun explained the next part of the ceremony."You have only seen three last night-the leader, thedrummer, and the fireman. Now you will see the fourth. Thank Godwe have lived to see another day. We represent our lives: wedon't imitate anything. The foundations of human life rest withour mothers who delivered us into this world." The Motherstepped into the tepee through the door flap, announced by theshrilling of the eagle's-bone whistle. She sat down by the whiteenamel waterpot. The tepee was dim, the fire was low, but somewisps of smoke rising from it seemed to surround her. She had ared blanket around her shoulders, a blue dress, smooth blackhair, and her face seemed very broad. She was greeted by a songof welcome with voices, drum, and rattle. With the singing, shebecame superb mother earth, mother prairie, grass, cow buffalo,mare, and doe, the epitome of motherhood. The drum beating wasnot restful or sleep inducing. It was the fecund pulsing of sex,passion, generation, and death, sung without guilt and withoutself-consciousness. The mother was weary, patient, tender, butenduring. She stood behind all the men---drummer, fire tender,leader. In front of her were the waters of life and death. Frank addressed her in the highest falsetto, a tearing,almost noiseless scream, the cry of the tiniest baby or of an oldman breathing his last. It was unbearable. The mother could havebeen any age---maid, mother, or crone, from sixteen to a hundredsixteen. "You have been good to us while we were here. You workedhard and made this possible. God knows we worship Him. God knowswe respect the mothers of our children." Mr. Dave Stone, the oldest man present, spoke to the motherin his high, light voice. His voice was very clear and wouldcarry over great distances. The wind had risen, and the day wasbeing born with a storm. The old man called upon the mother andsprinkled dried Sage on the fire, sweetening the air in herhonor. She took a cigarette and lit it from the fire tender'sbrand. The smoke she exhales is the life she gives. Above herhead, the dawn lightened the tepee flap. The fire was low. Shedrew on a cigarette. Its glowing tip was as evanescent as a man'slife, almost aflame one moment, out the next. She prayed andsmoked. This is the mother who bears the baby, who nurses and cossetsthe infant, who rears the child and watches him grow into a youngwarrior, drummer, fire tender, or leader, who is possessed by himand who laments him when he dies. She is indomitable. Warriorsdie, but the mother, slave or matriarch, she is always there. Hervoice was low and clear. She dominated the tepee---the mother whobears and the mother who buries her children. Her prayers werefollowed by rumbles of agreement. She reaffirmed the will toendure, to live on. The worshipers were deeply moved. Frankwhispered to me, "That is how much they respect theirmothers." But it was more than respect. It was awe. Sheconveyed the sorrow of a woman's lot in a destitute people. Thedawn caught the pointed top of the tepee, but below where we weresitting, the fire was so low that I could hardly see to write. Mr. Russell whispered to me, "Praying with thesmoke---something good---something lasting forever." ThePlains Indians were a Dionysian, an apocalyptic people, frugalbut generous; no middle way existed for them---conquerors orconquered, no in-between, no compromise. The smoke breath wascaught up with the warm air over the fire and twisted up intodawnlight. It struck me that with another turn of the wheel ofhistory we Caucasians who, by means of gunpowder and printing,have gained so much authority in the world, might find ourselvessubject to peoples who possess skills we do not have. No one whohad been with the Indians as I had been could feel superior tothem. The blue-shirted warrior is almost reconciled to living anunheroic, undionysiac life. It is against his whole being. Butthe drumming, the singing, and peyote have worked their magic.The buffalo are no more; the dawn is coming; there is a life toface now. The observed were awake and alert, the observers mostlysleeping. At six, dawn came to us as the tepee flap was opened.We had wrestled with the angel. We had grappled with the HeavenlyFather. Water was poured into the hygienic cups again, and a littlemore was put into the drum. I was asked to say a few words, thestranger whom they had made welcome and allowed to enter intotheir mystery. I thanked them for their kindness to me and toldthem that I would do my best to tell people about their worshipclearly and honestly. I also said that it would be no easy matterto convey to those who had not shared our experience and who donot have the Indian sense of oneness with life. A child had come into the world again. Dawn lit the stockade,and the wind was chilly. Life had begun again and must be faced.The voice of the singers rose clear and high---a child's cry ofdelight at buffalo hooves thundering far away. The fire flared alittle as if trying to hold back the morning, but it failed. Thecenter of the tent floor was covered by a great, grayish-whitehalf-moon of charred wood ashes. The mother left us. The barrierof everyday life began to return. Aftermath The sun was just coming up when we left them at about halfpast six. We felt that our Indian hosts would be easier if theycould have their morning feast without us. There were handshakesand promises that we would do our best to tell our people abouttheir religion. As I left the tent, I took a last look at thewhitish-gray expanse of the moon altar: the three young men,including blue-shirt, were singing and drumming together by thedoor flap. They were very blithe. Outside, Mr. Nicotine and Mr.Stone stood by the mother and waved to us as we left. The tepeeseemed too small and frail to have contained so much, but thedrumbeats surged out of it as evidence of the extraordinary powerconcentrated there. I slept a little and thought much when Ireturned to the hotel. I felt relaxed and happy. I felt that Ihad seen the Indians, and what I had seen had cheered me. I wroteat this time, only a few hours after the ceremony, "Wecannot ape them, but we can learn from them and perhaps graduallyadapt their religion to our needs, as they have adaptedours---feel tired, at peace, an enlarging of the spirit." Alittle later, on my way back from North Battleford, I noted,"Peyote simply reveals what is the potential in all of us.The Indians, whose gifts have for so long been run down by thewhites, have found that in spite of being poor Indians, thespirit of God is still with them. This is an immense advance. Itis a new hope, a new humility, a new pride." A day later I wrote, "Indian singing is incomprehensibleto most white men simply because they have never learnt the finediscrimination of the Indian in matters of sound. Clearly apeople who have lived in an almost soundless country (and theprairies are almost soundless to the city ear even now) wouldlearn to pick up a different range of sounds and would use thesesounds in their music. Grasses, grasshoppers, dust sifting, thewavelets on little rivers splashing, the shushing of wind amonglow bushes, and wind sounds infinitely varied with the seasons.Then, in great contrast, the very loud sounds---the sounds insideone, the heart thudding, etc., particularly loud when one issurrounded by great stillness; hooves stamping or cloppingregularly; the drubbing stampede of the buffalo---againinfinitely varied by terrain and weather, and the crash ofthunder reverberating over the endless prairies. Birds few innumber compared with the space, and therefore all the morememorable. Color on the prairies in great general masses withvery small changes. The Indians would be used to the very largeand the very small. Also the effect of six months or so ofsnow." Then there was the matter of the resemblance between liquorand peyote that has been raised so often in the press. I made aspecial note about this: "Alcohol and peyote (psychedelicsgenerally) are antithetical. Alcohol produces a downwardtranscendence, peyote an upward one---the difference betweenleveling up and leveling down. Alcohol allows one to relate toothers by being more sure of one's self. This, in small doses, ismuch better than not being able to relate at all, but it is avery precarious business, and selfishness may soon end inbrawling and ill temper. Peyote acts not by emphasizing one's ownself but by expanding it into the selves of others, with adeepening empathy or in-feeling. The self is dissolved and, inbeing dissolved, enriched. It becomes aware of the nobility ofother selves and so of itself." I tried repeatedly in the next few months to organize myexperience, but it would not be organized. I carried my notesaround with me and made many drafts of papers that were nevercompleted, because they did not seem to carry out my obligationto Frank Takes Gun and my fellow worshipers of that little band.It was not until three years later, when I was quite unexpectedlyasked to give a short broadcast about the peyote ceremony, that Ibegan to see how I might be able to convey something of thatnight in the tepee to people who had not been there and who hadnever taken peyote or other psychedelics. How does it look three years later? Has the wonder and beautyof those astonishing ten and a half hours receded so that theynow seem unreal? Did my difficulty in writing about theexperience of that strange night arise from a growing feelingthat my notes were muddled and that I was as muddled as they? Ido not think so. That night in the tepee has resulted in many studies by mycolleagues and me. We have observed the effects of psychedelicsubstances on groups of people taking them together---for variousreasons, we did not use peyote. The Indians have been veryskillful in structuring their ceremony so that it best meetstheir needs. They are such masters of symbol, ceremony, andritual, that this is hardly surprising. It would be unwise andimpertinent to ape their religion, which developed from theiragony when they lost their hunting grounds at the end of thenineteenth century. Our needs are very different from theirs. Sowe must follow a different route. We have suggestive evidence that psychedelics, properly used,can increase communication and understanding between those whotake them together, and this is not simply a drug-induceddelusion. It seems to persist long after the effects of thechemical have disappeared. This has not yet been proved. Proof insuch a matter is not easy, and so for the moment we have to relyon personal opinion. We have to find some way of showing theseeffects so that they can be easily understood. But we have torecognize that we are dealing with aspects of the human mind thatare even more elusive and mysterious than the depths of space andtime. Due to the interest and generosity of Mrs. Eileen Garrett,President of the Parapsychology Foundation, several of us havetaken part in two international conferences about psychedelics.One was held in New York in November 1958 and the other in LePiol, France, in July 1959. Both these conferences were attendedby scientists of international repute. At both of them there wasgeneral agreement that these experiences induced by psychedelics,which fall into the category of what William James called"unhabitual perception," call for sustained inquiry andresearch. It was encouraging that the impetus for these meetings,which drew contributors from many countries, arose in a frailtepee raised by members of the Native American Church, mostlyfrom the Red Pheasant Band, above the South Saskatchewan Riverthree years ago. In one respect, however, we have failed, at least so far. Wehave not been able to help members of the Native American Churchof Canada to obtain peyote, which is the sacrament of theirfaith. Its importation is banned by the federal governmentdepartment concerned with these matters, by means of a legaltechnicality. So far as we know, this has never been disputed ina court of law or debated in Parliament. The attitude ofgovernment, "We are doing this for your own good; we can'texplain why because you wouldn't understand," isinfuriating, unwise, and unnecessary. Among its other objectives,we hope that this article will lead others to question seriouslysuch well-meaning but arbitrary attempts to do good. The NativeAmerican Church and the religion its members practice, far fromdemoralizing them, is likely to help them in their struggle toadapt to a very unfamiliar world. Surely we can be fair-minded enough to pay respectfulattention to this bold attempt by the Indians to develop a newway of coming closer to the source of all things. They do notwant to convert us to their ways. They do not claim that thepeyote road is the only way of reaching out toward their GreatSpirit and Heavenly Father. In Frank Takes Gun's words, "Wejust want to be let alone to worship our God as we wish."Must we obstruct and attempt to crush a new religion, which isbeautiful and has never been shown to do any harm, simply becauseit is unfamiliar and because we can't imagine that it would work?Can we not let them tread their peyote road and see whathappens---provided they conduct their services decorously andaccount properly for the peyote used? They would, I believe,welcome observers from time to time. Those observers could seeand experience for themselves the form of worship that theaboriginal inhabitants of these lands developed when their worldwas tottering. The loss of the hunting grounds and the slaughterof the buffalo was for them an even greater catastrophe than thatappalling event one early morning at Hiroshima in August 1945. I shall not forget my Indian hosts, who took me back to alife through which all mankind has passed. A harsh, fierce,dangerous, passionate life where hunter and hunted are one. Alife rich in beauty and meaning. Little more than eighty yearsago, this was their life and had been so beyond the memory ofman. In a few short, terrible years it was torn from them, andthey are still bewildered at the world in which we are clumsilytrying to find a place for them. But then perhaps we share someof that bewilderment, for our new world is unimaginably strange.Should we not join them in their prayer that ". . . theUniverse may prevail"?

Bakalar, Harvard Medical School. Copyright Human Sciences Press, 1983 My thoughts about Peyote are closely interwoven with thereligious context of the Native American Church, the Peyotereligion of the American Indian. In my experiences with thissacred plant, Indian Peyotists have been my companions. I amgrateful to them for their patience and understanding, and theirwillingness to adopt me into their church. Peyote is considered aholy medicine among members of the church; and it is used withthe utmost respect. The teachings of Peyote go beyond theconfines of the tipi; my experiences sitting by the sacredfireplace have helped guide my daily life. Peyote ceremonies havealso allowed me the opportunity of being closely associated withthe Sioux, who are quite remote psychically and geographicallyfrom the mainstream of American life—far more remote thanmany of us realize. Most Sioux Peyotists are full-bloods and traditionalists;their great-grandfathers were buffalo hunters and warriors. Theylive in the spacious beauty of a pine and prairie landscape, butby our economic standards they are distressingly poor. As late asthe early 1970s many Indians in the Pine Ridge country were stillusing kerosene lamps. They have retained their native language,Lakota, and their knowledge of English is limited. Lakota isspoken throughout the Peyote ceremony. At ceremonies someone hasoften interpreted in English for me, but through the years I havecome to understand much of what is said; and much requires nowords. I attended my first Peyote ceremony in 1964. That eventfulnight in a tipi at Wounded Knee was the first of many meetingsand the beginning of my acculturation to the Indian way of life.Although I was thirty-one in 1964, I was a child in the Peyotereligion. The Sioux have patiently watched me grow up in thePeyote way, and in their eyes I am now a teenager of sixteen.They liken their religion to a school; one peyotist has said:"You learn in here just like at school; it is graded andbecomes easier the farther along you go. " In reference tomy learning, the same man said: "It is good that you arestarting now; you can always learn more from Peyote, but you willnever learn it all." Peyotists at Pine Ridge constitute less than 2 percent of thepopulation (about 15,000 in 1980). The church membership isgrowing from within because of an increase of children in Peyotefamilies, but the number of new members from outside thesefamilies is negligible. The Peyote religion at Pine Ridge is likea large family: almost everyone knows everyone else. Otherreservations have a much higher percentage of Peyotists: amongthe Navajo of the Southwest, about 50 percent. Despite the SiouxPeyotists' small numbers, they are famous among Peyotists ofother tribes, especially for their songs. Since the Peyotereligion is pan-Indian, members often attend meetings with othertribes. At one meeting I attended, seven tribes were represented.Thus for an Indian visiting the reservation of a tribe not hisown, the Native American Church is a home away from home. Although the Peyote religion is definitely Indian, it includessome vital Christian elements. Christianity has influenced thepre-Columbian Peyote religion since the early sixteenth century,when Spanish friars came to the New World. Peyotists know andaccept the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus; at Peyotemeetings participants often recite the Lord's Prayer, sometimesin English. Considerable time during ceremonies is devoted toprayers. Indians are an intensely religious people; their prayersto God and Jesus come to them easily and naturally. My prayersare still a little awkward, although as a member of the NativeAmerican Church I have had ample practice. Next to the prayers, Peyote songs are the most important partof the ceremony. As each person receives the prayer staff andmusical gourd (rattle), he holds the staff in his left hand andshakes the gourd with his right. The drummer and otherparticipants often sing along. These chants, sung withcompassion, create a marvelous world of sound and meaning forPeyotists like myself, engendering visions, hope, and peace. Somepeyote songs are prayer chants which praise the name of Jesus.Peyote is often referred to as a sacrament; it is considered amediator between God-Jesus and Man. At Pine Ridge there are two contrasting ceremonial rituals andorganizations of the Native American Church: the traditionalHalf-moon ritual and a more Christian version known as theCross-fire. The Half-moon ritual is much older and commonlyoccurs inter-tribally in the United States; the Cross-fire occurschiefly among the Sioux of South Dakota and the Winnebago ofNebraska and Wisconsin. The leaders (roadmen) of the Cross-firegroup are bona fide ordained clergy who have been appointed bythe High Priest of the organization in the State of South Dakota.As ordained clergy they are qualified to perform baptisms andmarriages. In the Half-moon ceremony each participant rolls a prayercigarette, which is a surrogate for the peace pipe; sometimes theBull Durham tobacco is rolled in a corn shuck. In the Cross- fireritual prayer cigarettes are not used; the Bible, which is setnext to the Peyote sacrament and holy altar, replaces the smoke.At certain times during the Cross-fire ceremony the roadman readsaloud from the Bible and interprets readings to the congregation. Another difference between the two fireplaces is that, atHalf-moon meetings, each participant is allowed to help himselfto the sacrament (generally four spoons of Peyote) each time itis passed clockwise around the tipi; at Cross-fire meetings a manstands in front of the participants and hands each of them fourspoons at least the first time the sacrament is sent around. Theroadman decides how many times Peyote should be passed around,usually three or four. It is sometimes used in powdered form, butmore often as a gravy; an infusion of Peyote tea is also passed.Although individual members usually attend meetings (ceremonies)with their own group, they also freely attend the other group'smeetings. Each group has its own cemetery. I like both rituals,but I have been raised in the Half-moon and prefer it. The Native American Church is decidedly nationalistic.Military veterans are granted special honor. Since I am aveteran, I have the privilege of folding the flag at ceremonies.The official colors of the church are red, white, and blue,colors which also appear in the beadwork of religiousparaphernalia; veterans have beadwork designs of the nationalflag. At almost all locations where meetings take place there isa flagpole; the flag is raised on Veterans Day and Memorial Dayand for the funeral or memorial of a member who was a veteran.The nationalism of the church is partly attributable to itspan-Indian organization; it also reflects the fact that thegovernment recognizes the Peyote religion and allows the Indiansto practice it freely. But the military character of the NativeAmerican Church may also be a continuation of the old warriorsociety, which retains high prestige among the Indians. Women were formerly excluded from the ceremony, except forPeyote Woman, the roadman's wife. She came into the tipi in themorning, bringing morning food and water over which she prayed asa symbol of Mother Earth. It was not until the 1950s that womenin general started attending Peyote ceremonies at Pine Ridge. Onereason for their original exclusion was the Indian taboo againstallowing women near any medicine during their menses. It is stillconsidered dangerous to the health and life of anyone takingIndian medicine, such as Peyote, to be in proximity to a womanwho is menstruating or has just given birth; thus, women duringthese times respectfully stay away from meetings. Recently, awoman who had just had a child ignored warnings and entered aPeyote meeting; all the men at the meeting became violently ill,and many of them vomited. Aside from these two prohibitions, Sioux women today not onlyfreely attend meetings, but sit next to their spouses andsometimes even sing Peyote songs. Indian women of other tribesalso attend meetings, but they tend to sit together, and they donot sing. Sioux women are liberated women compared with theirsisters of other tribes. Yet the Peyote ceremony still remains aman's world; the political organization and the ceremonial arerun by men, and men predominate in numbers. Children accompanytheir parents to Peyote ceremonies; the family worship ishealthy. Children begin to take medicine ritually when theybecome teenagers. There is no single reason that a person is drawn to the Peyotereligion. Some take refuge in the church as a last resort to curea sickness after the white man's medicine fails. Some startattending meetings out of sheer curiosity, and some want toescape the monotony of reservation life. Many come because theyhave heard that the Native American Church is a place where onecan talk to God and feel His presence. They have heard thatPeyote can change minds, habits, and lives for the better, orthat Peyote can bring happiness to man in this life. The actions,words, and morals of Peyotists themselves have been positiveliving examples to the Indian people. Another attraction is theclose fellowship of Peyote meetings. Members of the Native American Church do not proselytize, nordo they criticize other churches or beliefs; they prefer to liveunnoticed. But some Indians object to Peyote, the ceremony, andthe people connected with it. A few of these critics aretraditionalists who follow the old peace pipe religion of theirgrandfathers and see the Peyote religion as a foreign intrusionfrom Mexico. The major diffusion center of the Peyote religionwas Oklahoma, and tribes such as the Kiowa and Comanche were itsmajor disseminators. It did not arrive at Pine Ridge until sometime between 1904 and 1912. Some Sioux Peyotists participate in ancestral rituals with thepeace pipe, such as the vision quest and sun dance, but I know ofno traditional medicine man who has become a Peyotist. Indianalcoholics are especially fearful and critical of Peyote. Theysneeringly refer to Peyotists as "cactus eaters. " Onealcoholic told me, in a malignant tone of voice, that Peyote was"snake juice." One reason alcoholics tend to fearPeyote is their knowledge that Peyote conquers the alcohol in aperson's body and pushes that poison out of his system; he wouldthus suffer physically and mentally through an all-nightceremony. But the alcoholic generally refuses to admit that hisrecovery to sobriety and awareness may be the beginning of a newlife . The Peyote road is the path chosen by members of the church.In the imagery of some Peyotists, two roads diverge at ajunction. The profane road, paved and wide, with its worldlypassions and temptations, is considered to be an unholy roadwhich leads to trouble. The alternative is the Peyote road, anarrow unpaved path surrounded by a wilderness of pristinebeauty. All Peyotists travel this way, but each must journeyalone, for it is the road of one's own life and wisdom. In theChristian sense, it is the road to salvation. Ethically, it is apath of sobriety (a major step for most Indians), industry, careof the family, and brotherly love. Its symbol is a narrow grooveon top of a crescent-shaped earthen altar that encircles the westend of the fireplace. Rather than a straight and narrow path, itis a curved path all the way, but the curve on the crescent altaris constant, never-varying, and so in a sense straight. The roadhas not been easy for me, nor was it meant to be. Peyotists saythat up to the mid-mark of human life the Peyote road is uphill.This is indicated by the earthen altar, which slopes up to thecenter of the crescent, where the Peyote chief which is aspecially shaped Peyote plant placed on the altar by the leaderof the ceremony is set. To reach the downhill side of the Peyotechief one has to go through (accept) Peyote, for it is consideredimpossible to go around or over the sacred plant placed on top ofthe altar. The downhill road symbolizes the latter half of one'slife, the easier half. Those early years of my uphill journey were difficult becauseof my preoccupation with death. This morbid obsession began whenI attended my third Peyote meeting. Several people present wereill, and I feared the spread of disease by the communal sharingof the spoon to eat Peyote and the cup to drink Peyote tea. Twovoices within me began to talk about my death, one stressing itsreality and the other constantly agreeing; the voice-exchangecontinued until my awareness of death became intense. I had beenasleep to my death for thirty-one years; it now became anintimate reality. At a meeting that I attended, a wise elderlyPeyotist said, "You can see yourself in this fireplace; youcan see what kind of man you are. If you accept what you see, youwill be all right and stay in this religion; if you don't acceptwhat you see, you will never come back. " More than one manattending a meeting has thought himself attending his ownfuneral; he believed that he saw his own body being brought intothe tipi instead of the morning food—the church became forhim a funeral parlor. After such an experience, he may or may notwant to return to the Peyote religion. That night I arrived atthe junction and chose the Peyote road, which included the riskof sickness and the anguish of mental torment. Yet, in the sensethat "many are called, but few are chosen," Peyotistssay that "Peyote chooses you, you don't choose it." After that traumatic night I was aware of death every day fora period of about 3 years. It was not an absorbing fixation, butit was a daily reminder, my Dark Night of the Soul. I was oftenawakened to the image of a black whiplash across my back and thewords resounding in my ears: "You are some day going todie." At a Peyote meeting, when I told the members of myconcern about death, one of the leaders stood up and said that Iwas off to a good beginning in the Peyote way. During a meeting 3years later I simply became aware that it was useless worryingabout the inevitable. To be uneasy is the original derivation ofthe word disease; my anxiety and worry (uncertainty) about mycertain death was a disease. Perhaps there is in each of us alevel where the knowledge of our own death is so strange that itcomes as a shock. The ceremonies not only exposed me to the unknown, but allowedme an insight into Sioux psychology and culture, which is sodifferent from ours in many ways. Thanks to Peyote I have becomeacquainted with the genius of the Sioux mind; it has been apowerful catalyst in overcoming ethnocentric barriers. Peyotemagnified individual personalities and cultural differences in acomplementary manner, and showed what we all had in common ashuman beings. During their meetings, which lasted from 12 to 15hours, I respectfully followed the ceremonial rules ofconduct—the Indian way. The ingestion of Peyote helped us toendure the all- night ceremony and the socializing during thefollowing day. Alone and decidedly outnumbered, I absorbed theirculture under the aegis and power of Peyote. Although eachmeeting was a culture-shock to my nervous system, myacculturation was gradual rather than abrupt; it was a slowblood-transfusion of cultural transformation. After attending several Peyote ceremonies I started noticing achange in my mannerisms. Especially noticeable was a change in mybody movements and gestures; my way of speaking and voice qualityalso altered. My sense of humor and values became morerecognizable among the Sioux than among people of my own culture.Sometimes I found myself willingly imitating the Sioux men I mostadmired; at other times I passively observed those same strongpersonalities controlling my actions and mannerisms. More thanonce during a ceremony I suddenly felt as though I had left mybody, passing into a person sitting across from me and lookingthrough his eyes at me. I have often wondered whether that personsimultaneously had the same experience, but Peyotists rarelycomment on their visions and appear uninterested when I tell themof mine. They generally refrain from telling anyone what theyhave learned, especially their deepest mystical experiences; theysay that Peyote teaches each person differently. As the Peyote religion and the Sioux became more important inmy life, I began feeling more distant from my own culture, whichappeared increasingly shallow, meaningless, aggressivelyacquisitive, and boastfully noisy. I was more comfortable withthe Indians, who are a quiet, refined, and soft-spoken people;their slower pace of life was more restful to my mind, and theirsubtle sense of humor, especially Peyote humor, was a joy.Indians love to joke even when the joke is on them, but there isno scorn in their joking. Peyote humor is partly a play on words,especially English words which are relatively new to the Indian;they enjoy the fact that many different English words have thesame sound, and that different-sounding words have the samemeaning. At the close of a Peyote ceremony, an elderly Indian wasexplaining the difference between the southern and northernArapahoe language. He used English words for his example:"Where the southern Arapahoe would say 'match,' the northernArapahoe would say. . . ?" He couldn't think of the cognateword, so a member looked up and said "lighter." Suchhumor and laughter is encouraged after the ordeal of an all-nightceremony. Often their humorous stories have a sober message; anexample is the tale of the "monkey in the fireplace,"which warns against treating the ceremony as play. The story isas follows: "No monkey business allowed in this fireplace,but everything is in this fireplace, so the monkey must be inthere too. This engineer on the railroad had a monkey who watchedeverything he did. The engineer stopped the train and went in thedepot to get a cup of coffee. When he heard the toot-tootoutside, he ran out and saw the monkey taking this train down thetrack. Hey, this monkey was really having fun. He was driving thetrain just like a man. He was really driving that train fast. Hemissed the curve and the train went off the track, but themonkey, he jumped out of the window and grabbed hold of a treeand was saved. He watched the train go into the ditch." We both laughed; then he became serious and said: "Butall the people and children on the train were killed. That's theway the monkey is: if the man don't watch close, he will miss thecurve; the monkey, he's a monkey." Then this Indian Peyotistslowly pointed to the fireplace and said: "That monkey willkill you if you don't watch him; no monkey business allowed inthis fireplace." Symbolically, this story indicates that ifyou are careless on the curve of the Peyote road, you will fallfrom the altar and burn up in the fireplace. Through Peyote I have acquired many Indian friends and adoptedrelatives. In particular, I became quite close to my adoptedbrother, Silas, an Omaha-Ponca Indian who lived among the Siouxfor many years. He was a leader of the Peyote ceremony, anofficial of the church, and a man of great charm and spiritualpower. He was about 20 years older than I, a wiser brother.Together, we spent much time visiting and attending Peyotemeetings. He had been raised in the Peyote tradition, and hetaught me much about that tradition and about the good life. Forinstance, he taught me the need for humility before entering thetipi to pray. To attend a meeting with a know-it-all attitude,that of a "big shot," will usually cause sufferingthroughout the night. He said: "Over there are some tallweeds that are now bent by the cold. That's what Peyote can do toa man who thinks he knows everything. Peyote will bend him downand turn him inside out. " I have seen that happen since andI know that his analogy was accurate. Because of his vast experience and clear, quick mind, he wasalways several steps ahead of me. I shall never forget that whenI told him I thought Peyote was good, his answer was: "Yousay that Peyote is good; what's good about it?" No one hassatisfactorily answered his question. Once when Silas had aruptured hernia, a few Peyote boys helped him through to health.They prayed, drummed, and sang through the night, and theyspoon-fed Silas about 150 Peyote. He was well by morning; theambulance returned to the hospital without him. Silas told me of his vision when he ate that large amount ofPeyote: "Brother George, I had so much Peyote in me thatwhen I raised up from the bed the Peyote would come up my throatto my mouth. While the boys were drumming and singing I suddenlygot out of bed opened the door and went outside; a short distancefrom the house was a large hill. I walked to the hill and saw ashiny new ladder going all the way to the top. I climbed theladder to the top of the hill. I looked around, everything upthere was so beautiful. The air was clean and fresh; there wereall kinds of pretty colored flowers. When I looked back to theladder it was old and broken; many rungs were missing. Since Ihad no way of getting back down, I decided to enjoy where I was;later I looked back at the ladder and it was once again a shinynew ladder. I finally climbed down the ladder and walked back tothe house. The people in the house looked very sad. I walked upto the bed and looked down at the man lying on the bed; he hadhis eyes closed and looked rested. I saw that the man on the bedwas myself. I then lay down to rest. When I awoke my sickness wasgone. The large hill was a hill of Peyote, all those Peyoterepresented my sins. The top of the hill was paradise."Although Silas often ate large amounts of Peyote, he told me thatif a person is in the right spirit "just a taste of Peyoteon the tip of your tongue is enough. " At meetings, Silas was a strict disciplinarian. At a housemeeting in winter I fell unconscious from the lack of oxygen. Theone-room log house was sealed airtight; it was crowded andstuffy. There was no air circulation; the fireman had brought ina large pan filled with live coals which further heated analready hot room. Silas was sitting next to me. When I fellunconscious, I dropped my pheasant-feathered fan on the floor. Iwas revived about 10 minutes later. The first thing Silas said tome was, "Pick up your fan!" A few minutes later I toldSilas that I believed the reason for my passing out was that thelive coals were eating up the oxygen. He agreed, but nothing wasdone about it. Under the influence of Peyote, the loss ofconsciousness was especially meaningful. I felt as though I haddied; the darkness of unconsciousness came before I realized whatwas about to happen. I wondered whether death would be like that,quicker than conscious thought. A tall, quiet Arapahoe manrevived me; I saw him clearly before I could hear any sound, andit was about a minute before I could hear. I went outside in thebitter cold to get some fresh air. The Arapahoe man walked up tome and said: "You are doing all right in this Peyote way,but don't be in a hurry; take your time. " Several dayslater, a leader in the Peyote religion who had heard about myfainting said: "I heard that Peyote finally caught up withyou." I write of Silas in the past tense because he died in 1973.Visiting his blood relations, the Omahas of eastern Nebraska, isthe closest I can come to being with him. In their eyes I am awelcomed relative who has come home. Whenever I attend a Peyotemeeting, especially among his own people, he is close to me.Although all tribes have essentially the same Peyote ritual,there are variations which are highly important in the minds ofthe Indians. Each tribe has its language and culture; each hasits own style; each has its own genius. At my first birthdaymeeting among the Omahas, I said that since I was familiar withthe Sioux way, they could continue singing while I prayed with aprayer cigarette during the main smoke. The Omahas lookedstartled; the air seemed electrified by the culturaltransgression. After a silence which seemed to last an eternity,Henry, the leader and my adopted nephew through Silas, said:"Uncle George, we will pick up these instruments (musicalinstruments) again when you are finished with your prayer; that'sthe way we do it here, so that's the way it is going to be, UncleGeorge." Although I continued to live and work within my own culture,my heart, spirit, and mind resided with the Peyote religion andthe Indians. Thus, I lived in two worlds—physically among myown people, emotionally among the Indians. Living within anhour's drive from the reservation allowed me easy access to thesource of my emotional life. Because of the increasing ease andfrequency with which I went back and forth, my image of thereservation's entrance and exit was that of a swinging door. As Ifelt an increasing need to be on the reservation, I beganattending more meetings and visiting more often. All of usPeyotists needed emotional support as an integral part of groupsolidarity and the fellowship of a community of seekers. Thesocial group using Peyote became as important to me as the plantand its powers. Whatever their age, Peyotists are endearinglycalled " Peyote boys . " They are a brotherhood ofseekers who are youthful in spirit and attitudes, in theircuriosity and willingness to learn. As my cultural metamorphosis became less detectable to myself,it became more obvious among friends and relatives of my ownculture. Yet I could never become fully Indian. A Peyotist madethis clear to me by saying: "This way helps us to becomemore Indian and it helps you to be more like George Morgan." At first Peyote enabled me to see the Indians as I wantedto see them: in an idealizing light. But eventually I learnedfrom Peyote that their culture had its own snags andcontradictions, and my view became more balanced. In time, Peyoteaided me in understanding and respecting my own culture. Forinstance, Indians have a sharing culture; we do not. Peyotehelped me to understand the advantages and pitfalls of sharing.Of course, any discerning mind might in time come to the sameunderstandings; one does become wiser with age. With Peyote tooit takes time to learn about life and cultural differences;wisdom cannot be hurried . By reconciling the opposed cultural values in my mind, Idiminished their hypnotic influence and escaped the clutchinggrip of ethnicity. An identity crisis ended: the tenuous swingingdoor vanished; I stepped out of both cultures and took a deepbreath of fresh air in a cultural void. I could now enjoy bothcultures, and I could move freely and safely through them. Toarrive at this point along the Peyote road took me years ofrelentless effort . The Peyote religion also advanced my formal education. Onemorning as I sat by the sacred fireplace I felt an urgent desireto journey to the land where Peyote grows and study the plant'senvironment and trade channels. That impulse was prompted bysubstantial price increases for the plant and occasional supplyshortages which troubled the Indians. My university training ingeography and plant ecology had prepared me to study thebiogeography and economic history of Peyote. As there was a gapin the literature, I decided that this study would become mydoctoral dissertation, and I felt that the knowledge gained fromit would help Peyotists to secure a dependable supply in thefuture. I spent several months over a period of 2 years in theTexas brush country studying Peyote. I learned about the plant'slife cycle, habitat, growth rates, and geographic range past andpresent. I also studied the history of Peyote trade between the Peyoteros(a group of Spanish-American Peyote traders) and the Indians. I sincerely believe that Peyote guided me in this study, for Imet no obstacles in seeking information about a delicate andsomewhat secretive subject. I also believe that Peyote protectedme from harm in the rattlesnake-infested thorn brushes. Thedetails of my study are too complicated to relate here, but thethesis is of value in understanding the present problems ofPeyote supply and how they arose. If Indians make the effort, asthey surely will, there should be a dependable supply for theirneeds in the future. In a strange way I feel as if Peyoteselected me to do that study, for other Peyotists with artistictalent have been inspired through Peyote to paint religiouspaintings connected with the ceremony; others have done beautifulbeadwork. I would not casually suggest to anyone that he attend a Peyoteceremony. It is difficult to sit through an all-night ceremony.And Peyote is not easy to swallow: it is extremely bitter, evento experienced Peyotists, and occasionally nauseating, especiallyfor beginners. A person of sincere intent would be welcome: it isa church. He would find hospitality: Peyotists are courteous andrespectful. But it is well to remember that Peyote is not aplaything; Peyotists say that "if you play around withPeyote, it will turn around and start playing with you. "The Native American Church is not for the curiosity seeker: it isa serious religion. The Peyote road has shown me many wonders, and I believe it isthe same for other Peyotists. I shall continue to follow thatadventurous path, that sublime way of life.

STEWART from Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Vol 25 No 3,1982 USING ONLY THE TRADITIONAL methods of history, which heavilydepend on published or unpublished written records, orethnography, which rely on data collected by interviews withnative informants and knowledge obtained by participantobservation, would leave a very incomplete and distorted pictureof Peyotism in Nevada Notwithstanding the fact that Peyotistshave always been a small minority in the total Nevada Indianpopulation, they have become known world-wide and provideexamples of a number of the peculiar circumstances connected withthe whole history of the Peyote religion in the New World.Involved in that history is the nature of the unusual, small,spineless cactus called by the Aztecs Peyotl, Peyote bythe Spanish, Mexicans and Indians in the area of its abundantgrowth along the Rio Grande in south Texas and northern Mexico,and by botanists named Lophophora williamsii (Lemaire) Coulter.Also important is the strong American tradition whereby somecitizens try to legislate against behavior of which theydisapprove, exemplified by the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S.Constitution which prohibited use of alcohol. The history ofPeyotism in Nevada is incomprehensible if not placed in thenational context. In October of 1937 I learned of the presence of the Peyotereligion in Nevada during a conversation with Washoes BenLancaster and Sam Dick, following our participation in a Peyotemeeting in Randlett, Utah, on the Uintah and Ouray Utereservation. It was known by officials of the Bureau of IndianAffairs (BIA) that Lancaster had started to hold Peyoteceremonies among the Washo in October 1936, only a few monthsafter my first ethnographic research in the area I did my fieldresearch for a Ph.D. thesis in the fall of 1938. My ethnohistorical studies in recent years allow me toreconstruct an outline of the history of Peyote in Nevada beforethe return of Lancaster as a Peyote proselytizer. Christianmissionaries and BIA officials announced their opposition toPeyotism when it was first discovered in Oklahoma in 1886, andthey continued that opposition actively until John Collier becameIndian commissioner in 1933. Until Collier, the BIA andmissionary societies both collected data on Peyotism anddisseminated reports throughout Indian country to combat it. Theprocess of data collection itself spread knowledge. For example,the earliest documents on Peyote in Nevada were copies of threeletters sent to BIA agents in Stewart, Fallon and Owyhee in 1916.These I found in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Thetone of the inquiry suggests danger and opposition. For example,"Please let me have a report from you immediately, givingthe number of Indians addicted to its use, and the extent andfrequency of its use. Who are the leaders? Where do they gettheir supply from, and how? What is the effect on the users asshown by your own observations and from reports of employees,missionaries, and others . . . What is physical condition ofusers . . ." The letter was signed Chief Special Officer,i.e. detective, of the BIA. The next reference to Peyote in Nevada is the state statuteregulating the Sale and Use of Poison, Section 5082, paragraph 8,which added "anhalonium (peyote or mescal button)" inFebruary 1917 as a substance prohibited except on prescription. Ihave found only one hint of local Nevada influence to bring aboutthat anti-Peyote amendment. In a 1922 letter from the agent of aCrow reservation to the BIA during his campaign to have ananti-Peyote law passed in Montana, Agent C. H. Asbury wrote tothe Commissioner: "I had something to do with gettingspecial legislation against the use of certain drugs in Nevadaand I found no particular difficulty in having the proper wordsinserted in the law." Asbury had been the Indian Agent atthe Duck Valley reservation for a number of years untiltransferred in the fall of 1916. National forces against Peyotemay have been important in Nevada at that time, as they were inUtah and Colorado where Peyote was outlawed also in February1917. The next mention of Peyote in Nevada is in a report ofSpecial Agent Dorrington dated May 12-13, 1917. Surprisingly, itrefers to Jack Wilson, the Messiah and originator of the GhostDance of the 1890s. Wrote Dorrington: Use of peyote and mescal. There is absolutely no evidence indicating that either peyote or mescal is used on the reservations or that the Indians know anything about it . . . Jack Wilson resides in Mason Valley . . . He is the 'Messiah' and the originator of the 'Ghost Dance'. He appears to attract but little attention from Indians in this locality but apparently has considerable influence among distant tribes and he seemingly keeps in close touch with them; that he is corresponding with certain individuals in Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Oklahoma . . . It is further learned that even delegations have paid him a visit . . . He is also known as a 'medicine man' and practices some among his people, but most of his time is believed to be spent visiting the distant and more prosperous tribes and individuals from whom he procures large sums of money . . . Jack Wilson is a very dignified and striking Indian . . . From all accounts he has always been friendly with whites . . . A recent picture of Jack, taken by myself, is attached. It cost me the sum of one dollar, that is Jack made a 'touch' for that amount after the picture had been taken . . . After careful inquiry I am satisfied that Jack Wilson does not use peyote or mescal, nor has he encouraged its use by others . . . he is very temperate in his habits . . . he is constantly advising the Indians to abstain from the use of all drugs and intoxicants. The next important BIA document prepared and widelydisseminated nationwide was shown to me by missionaries andofficials when I was studying Washo-Northern Paiute Peyotism in1938. It was a thirty-eight page pamphlet prepared by Dr. RobertE. L. Newberne, Peyote, An Abridged Compilation from the Filesof the Bureau of Indian Affairs, published in 1922. Newbernesummarized historical information on Peyote starting with Spanishpadres, and presented anti- Peyote reports of Americanmissionaries to the Indians. He included samples of datacollected in 1919 by means of a twenty-one item questionnairesent to Indian service employees such as agents, physicians,farmers, field matrons, directors of Indian schools and sectarianmissionaries. Three hundred and two answers were received inWashington, D.C. from 116 Indian agencies, for which 87,including 6 located in Nevada, reported no use of Peyote. TheNevada Indian population was listed at 10,854 and included noknown Peyotists. From interviews with Indians in 1938 I learned of a SiouxIndian Peyote missionary, named Sam Lone Bear. Lone Bear had beenproselytizing since 1914 in Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Heconducted Peyote rituals at Fallon and Pyramid Lake duringseveral months in the summer of 1929. His success at"doctoring" attracted participants to his Peyotemeeting at Nixon, Nevada, from as far away as McDermitt, Nevada,and Bishop, California. Lone Bear made his headquarters with JoeGreen, a well-known and respected Paiute medicineman residing onthe Pyramid Lake Reservation. In 1938 Joe told me of hisconversion to Peyotism notwithstanding his being an active andconvinced Episcopalian, and also a practicing shaman. He had nodifficulties being simultaneously a leader in three religions, asituation I have found repeatedly among Indian Peyotists. In 1929 Sam Lone Bear used the name Leo Old Coyote (which Iheard as Leo O'Kio) in Nevada because he was trying to avoidbeing arrested under a federal warrant for violation of the MannAct. He was arrested in 1932, tried, and sentenced to three yearsin the federal prison at McNeil Island, Washington, but wasparoled in two years. On his way home he stopped at Fallon,Nevada, and courted Mamie Charley, the sister of a Shoshone hehad converted in 1929. Sam and Mamie were married in South Dakotaand lived on Sam's allotment on Lone Bear Creek, Pine RidgeReservation, until he died on February 5, 1937. No Nevada Indians learned how to obtain Peyote or acquiredthe equipment and knowledge to conduct Peyote ceremonies from SamLone Bear. Consequently no Peyote meetings were held in westernNevada until about 1932 when a Ute Peyotist named RalphKochampanaskin, usually called Raymond Lone Bear, married a Washoand settled in Minden. One of his followers was Sam Dick, anactive old-fashioned Washo medicine man. After an initialsuccess, Ralph lost his following because he failed to live up tothe non-drinking rule of the Peyote religion. During my interviewing in the fall of 1938 at the IndianSchool near Carson City a woman from Owyhee, Nevada, told me thatPeyotism was introduced to the Duck Valley Reservation from FortHall, Idaho, years before, but she could give me no details.Later I found a 1939 letter from Owyhee in which the Indian Agentreported that members of the tribal council agreed Peyote wasfirst used during a curing ceremony at Duck Valley in 1915.During my first field work in Fallon in 1936, my Northern Paiuteinterpreter praised the Peyote religion; I learned in 1938 thathe had been converted during a visit to Fort Hall in 1920. Sincethen he had traveled regularly to other states to attend Peyotemeetings but had not introduced the ceremonies to his people inNevada. Jim Street, a Shoshone living in Fallon, told me in 1938 thathe had been converted to Peyotism on the Gosllute reservation atIbapah, Utah, in 1932, hut had not attended any more Peyoterituals until shortly before I interviewed him. It is evident that the Indians of Nevada had gainedconsiderable experience and heard many rumors about Peyote beforeBen Lancaster firmly established the religion among the Washo andPaiute of western Nevada. It is Lancaster's ceremony whichattracted the support of about 300 of the 2257 Indians in thearea. It is now appropriate to describe the Peyote ritual ofLancaster and to summarize some of his teachings. It should besaid at the outset that the Washo- Northern Paiute rituals Iobserved in 1938 were nearly identical to the rituals I had seenamong the Ute a year earlier; these Ute rituals closelyparalleled ones observed by anthropologists in Oklahoma andelsewhere who supplied me information for a 265 item comparativetable published as part of my thesis. A canvas tipi is the most desirable place to conduct thePeyote ritual, but I attended services with the Washo and Paiutein a canvas walled "corral" and at regular residences.Before the participants assemble, a sand crescent altar aboutfour inches high and four feet long is constructed on the westside of the meeting place. A fire is laid on a protective moundor on the ground east of the altar. At dusk the congregationmeets at the entrance on the east side of the structure where theleader, called the roadman, prays to Jesus, God, Mary and Peyotefor guidance during the ritual and for health and wisdomthroughout life. When the devotees enter, they always moveclockwise to find seats. They follow the same pattern wheneverleaving or entering. Four officials direct the ceremony —the roadman, chief drummer, and cedarman, who are seated onblankets on the ground west of the altar, and the fireman ordoorman just inside the entrance. The normal equipment consistsof a water drum, bird-tail feather fans, gourd rattles, a staff,dried Peyote, or Peyote tea, Bull Durham tobacco, and alarge-size Peyote button to place on the altar. The equipment isincensed in cedar smoke at the beginning. After all pray throughBull Durham cigarette smoke, the roadman passes clockwise thesack of Peyote buttons. Each adult participant takes fourbuttons, the ceremonial number, to prayerfully eat. Then theroadman kneels and holds the three-foot staff and a fan in hisleft hand. He shakes the rattle and sings four hymns, in which heis accompanied by the chief drummer. Each male participant inturn receives the paraphernalia, and sings while accompanied onthe drum by his neighbor to the right. The singing, drumming andpraying continue until dawn except for a midnight recess andwater drinking. At dawn. a ceremonial meal of water, fruit, meat,and maize is blessed and passed clockwise; all present take fourspoonfuls of the food and four sips of the water. The water fromthe dismantled drum is poured on the sand altar and the ceremonyends. Women of the congregation prepare a ball(banquet which isusually eaten about noon, and then members return to their homes. With the Peyote plant, dried with the appearance of homedried peaches, Nevada Indians acquired beliefs and attitudesabout the bitter-tasting cactus which have been associated withit since they were recorded by early Spanish explorers in Mexicoin the 1500s. Peyote itself is sacred, they emphasize, and hasmany powers to help mankind. It is also a messenger tosupernatural powers, now usually named God and Jesus. When eatenand prayed to in the proper ritual context, Peyote helps cure alldiseases and reveals many things: the location of lost objects orpersons, future events, and proper behavior, among others. Peyoteprotects from the evil intentions of witches. It brings knowledgefor proper living, which includes avoiding alcoholic beveragesand always acting according to strict Christian ethics — tolove your wife and children and kin, be patriotic and lawabiding, and to respect authority, God and elders. When asked why they supported the Peyote religion, devoteescited the success of Peyotists in curing. In tracing the historyof Peyotism in Nevada from the mid 1930s to the mid 1970s, onediscovers the interplay of a number of individuals, first theIndians and BIA officials, then state and local authorities andthe general public. From the public emerged a few citizens whoactively opposed Peyotism and some who defended it. Christianmissionaries and their supporters disputed with Peyote religionsympathizers, such as anthropologists and members of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union. Lancaster and his rituals soon came under opposition by bothcivil and religious authorities, but of course an awareness ofPeyotism and opposition to it was present in Nevada when it wasprohibited by law in 1917. Alida C. Bowler, Superintendent of theCarson Indian Agency, reported to the BIA that she was suspiciousthat Lancaster was a dope peddler. About three months later, theReverend S. R. Dunlop, a Baptist missionary to the Washo,reported that Lancaster, in order to defend himself and Peyotism,was saying that Commissioner John Collier's son Donald hadparticipated in Peyote rituals. (Donald Collier had attended aPeyote meeting with the Kiowa in 1935.) Bowler maintained hersuspicions until she left the Nevada Indian Service at the end of1939. For three years, BIA detectives kept an intermittent watchon Lancaster, and his car was searched several times as he passedthe Nevada California state line. Samples of materials in his carwere chemically analysed for Bowler and instead of the morphineshe suspected, Lancaster was transporting ground Peyote andsagebrush. A number of Indians reacted to the Peyote religion as JoeGreen did, that is by adding it to their lives but stillmaintaining the Christian denomination they followed, andcontinuing to call on Indian medicine men from time to time. Themajority of the Indians rejected Peyotism, however. In April adelegation of Washo presented a petition to Bowler requestingthat Peyote meetings be stopped. The Indian opponents used thesame arguments as the whites — "Peyote kills"— while converts said Peyote saves. While organizing the data I accumulated at the Carson IndianAgency and trying to acquire a firmer basis to judge MissBowler's opinion that Ben Lancaster was not a proper Peyotist, Iwrote to Mack Haag, President of the Native American Church(NAC), a Cheyenne residing in Calumet, Oklahoma. He replied thathe knew Lancaster well and that "he is well qualified"to start Peyote meetings in Nevada. Inasmuch as the BIA in Washington in 1937 successfullyopposed an attempt to enact a national Peyote prohibition, andreplaced the antiPeyote pamphlet by Newberne (published in 1922)with a mimeographed report favorable to Peyote entitled"Documents on Peyote," a new and widely publicizedcampaign against the NAC which developed in Nevada in 1940 issurprising. Accounts of these efforts, which resembled some ofthose used in 1937 and 1938 which I evaluated in my Ph.D. thesis,were recovered from the National Archives. Newspaper reports fromNevada dated May 1940 contained opinions that several deaths hadoccurred because Indians took Peyote in Lancaster's rituals. Thecoroners' verdicts were that the deceased suffered from advancedstages of tuberculosis before they attended the NAC ceremonies. Opponents were not convinced and had reinserted into Nevada'snarcotics law a prohibition against Peyote in February 1941.Under provisions of the amended law, Lancaster was arrested inReno in October 1941. A full account of his arrest and the peoplewho brought it about appeared in a half-page article in,surprisingly, the New York Sunday News of November 30,1941. The item, special to the News", included a photographof Ben Lancaster and one of Dr. Charles Lee Tranter, aneurologist, with the caption "Tranter....and MalcolmEasterlin, attorney, who are leading movement to outlaw use ofpeyote, 'Sacred mushroom of the Aztecs', among Indians of theWest, asserting addiction is spreading." The articleoutlined a campaign against Peyote very reminiscent of thosewhich took place from 1914 to 1937 to support bills introduced inCongress to prohibit Peyote. The News article reported: Lancaster's arrest came at the end of a long investigation. The official finger was put on him by the Rev. Samuel R. Dunlop....Baptist missionary ...The Rev. Dunlop has been in Nevada since 1935, having come from Wisconsin where he administered to the Winnebago, who also used peyote.... While he [Lancaster] was gathering a congregation around him, the whites were observing with more and more alarm the growing use of peyote. Chief among these were Dr. Charles Lee Tranter. . .who heads the Association for Prevention of Peyotism, and Malcolm Easterlin, New York and Washington attorney. Also active is Representative Frances Bolton (R- Ohio), who is a member of the Indian Affairs Committee.... The article stated that Commissioner Collier had said thatPeyote as used in Indian ceremonies is not habit forming and notharmful. Also in 1941 an article appeared in Scribner's Commentator(Vol. 11, pp. 77-82) with the title ''Peyote — IndianProblem No. 1," I)y Malcolm Easterlin. It started with adisparaging evaluation of Commissioner Collier and then presenteda short history of Peyote; it faulted him for opposing theanti-Peyote legislation Easterlin conveyed the impression thatonly Collier had opposed laws to prohibit Peyote, whereas whilehe was in office he worked against only one bill to outlawPeyote. Eight earlier similar hills had been sponsored by the BIAfrom 1916 to 1926 hut were rejected by Congress. Easterlinpraised Dr. Tranter and accused Ben Lancaster of doping Indiansin order to get all of their money. On March 17, 1942, Judge William McKnight dismissed thecharges against Lancaster on a legal technicality — the 1941legislature had voted to amend a "repealed and non-existingformer act." But that did not stop Tranter, who was joinedby Dr. Walter Bromberg, a psychiatrist who had worked for the NewYork Criminal Courts until he moved to Reno in December 1941. InJune 1942 Bromberg and Tranter presented a paper to the WesternRegional Conference of the Home Mission Council of North Americaduring its meeting at the Indian School in Stewart, Nevada. Datapresented came from earlier publications, yet the paper waspublished in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease(Vol. 97, pp. 518-527), under the title "Peyoteintoxication: Some psychological aspects of the Peyoterite." The article was condensed and distributed at fivecents a copy by the National Fellowship of Indian Workers and waspublished in a letter of August 6, 1943. An article lessblatantly critical of Peyotism by Bromberg appeared in NatureMagazine, October 1942, entitled "Storm OverPeyote." A really scurrilous article, containing many inaccuracies,written by Charles L. Tranter, M.D., under the title "Peyote— New Dope Menace," appeared in the national scandal-mongering magazine PIC, on December 8, 1942. Included werepictures of old Indian women said to be under the influence ofPeyote, hut who actually were known to never use Peyote.Representative Frances Bolton inserted the article in a hearingof the Committee on Indian Affairs and it was printed by thegovernment without the photographs in December 1944. Nothing moreby or about the leaders of the 1941-1942 campaign against Peyotein Nevada has come to my attention. Except for a few news itemsover the years reporting that NAC members had successfullyopposed new bills submitted to the Nevada legislature to outlawPeyote, since 1944 nearly all information on the subject comingfrom Nevada has originated in anthropological research. Publications by anthropologists began in 1940 with the noticeby Jack Harris about the Shoshone at Duck Valley which ismentioned above, and the appearance in the Proceedings ofthe Sixth Pacific Science Congress, in which I published a shortpaper. This was the first report on Ben Lancaster in apublication distributed internationally. My Ph.D. thesis wasissued in print in January 1944, and a review appeared in the AmericanAnthropologist in 1946. In 1954 Warren d'Azevedo began research among the Washo andwas soon invited to participate in a Peyote meeting held byRamsey Walker at Woodfords, California He produced severalunpublished reports before he and musicologist Alan P. Merriampublished an article in the American Anthropologist (1957,Vol. 59, pp. 615-641) entitled "Washo Peyote Songs."(In 1976, I discovered a listing in a Schwann Guide to Tapesand Records an album by the same title issued as No. 4384, byFolkway Records. I have not been able to ascertain if the two arerelated. A Northern Paiute originally from McDermitt, WilburJack, recorded Peyote songs on Canyon Records, ARP 6054.) Otheranthropologists who have written on Washo Peyotism are JamesDowns and John A. Price; d'Azevedo attempted to promote a generalpublic understanding of Peyotism with a long article in the NativeNevadan, September 3, 1968, entitled "Peyote: Fact andFancy." Until his death in 1953, Ben Lancaster made annualpilgrimages to Oilton, Texas, to collect and dry a year's supplyof Peyote. By not furnishing Peyote to others he strengthened hisown role as leader. As early as 1939, I assisted some otherIndians in receiving Peyote by mail, but because the State ofNevada had passed a law against the transportation of Peyote,commercial suppliers could not send it by U.S. Mail into thestate. Others began traveling to Texas and making arrangementswith Indians in Oklahoma to transship packages of the sacredcactus. Lancaster had been active with officials of the NAC beforebecoming a Peyote proselytizer in Nevada in 1936; and althoughthe NAC organization has never attempted to control or directPeyotist missionaries, it did attempt to intercede in his behalfwith the BIA when he was being harassed by Dr. Tranter in 1941. Copies of large quantities of official NAC correspondencecame into my possession from the estate of Sidney Slotkin afterhis death in 1958. From letters in that file a clear recordemerges that others began communicating with the NAC by 1954.That year Harry Sam of Smith, Nevada, and Burton John ofGardnerville sent word to the president of the NAC that theywould attend a regional meeting at Fort Hall. By 1955 and 1956, as shown in the Bulletin of the NAC editedby anthropologist Slotkin in Chicago, and by other documents fromthe Slotkin file, Washo and Northern Paiute Peyotists numberedabout sixty in and near Gardnerville. Louise Lancaster, the widowof Ben, was one of the leaders and in 1955 contributed $115 tothe international organization of the NAC. Her financial supportprobably stimulated the international officials to appoint herthe "Regional Representative of NAC for Nevada andCalifornia" at the 1955 annual convention. Reubin Hardin of McDermitt wrote to Slotkin in 1956 tosubscribe to the NAC Bulletin, and in 1958 Hardin was put forwardas a leading Peyotist in Nevada by Peyotists in Idaho. ReubinHardin was named a "Delegate-at-Large" by NAC officialswhen he was present at the annual convention of the Peyote Churchduring its 1978 meeting in Laredo, Texas. The participation of Nevada Indians in the internationalaffairs of the NAC brought Vice-President Frank Takes Gun to thestate in 1958 so that local people would incorporate the NAC ofNevada under the laws of the state. This was completed on May 20,1958 with Washo, Paiute and Shoshone signing as incorporatorswith Crow Indian Takes Gun. In 1972, I had an opportunity to again talk with Peyotists onthe Goshute Reservation, and in Duck Valley, Pyramid Lake,Fallon, Gardnerville, Elko and McDermitt. At McDermitt I wasallowed to be a participant-observer in a Peyote meetingconducted by Grover Tom. It was remarkable that a number of circumstances I haddiscovered present among Peyotists in other states wereduplicated in Nevada. Several were exemplified by Grover Tom,roadman at McDermitt. First was the surprise I felt that he was aleader of Peyotism for the Paiute at McDermitt, yet he was aShoshone who learned to speak Paiute after he married a McDermittPaiute woman in 1950. He was thus an alien Peyote preacher tothose Paiute. Grover Tom insisted that his Peyote ritual wasdifferent from others in Nevada because he had studied withComanche in Oklahoma for extended periods from 1939 to 1942 tolearn the original ritual. But he also said he rememberedattending a meeting conducted by Sam Lone Bear for the Shoshoneon the Goshute reservation when he happened to be visitingrelatives there in 1929. He had attended meetings with Washo andwith a Sioux conducting a meeting at Fort Hall. Foreign Indians,that is, Indians from other tribes, conducted meetings for thePaiute at McDermitt. Grover named Ramsey Walker, a Washo, andRalph Turtle, an Arapaho. Stanley Smart, a McDermitt Paiute who had been fireman at themeeting I attended there named additional visiting roadmen fromFort Hall, Idaho, Wind River, Wyoming, and Oklahoma. Stanley hadattended meetings with Northern Cheyenne in Montana, with Ute inUtah, with Navajo at Aneth, Utah, and others. He has been invitedto be roadman at Healdsburg, California, Fort Hall, Idaho andGardnerville, Nevada. My most unusual discoveries in 1972 involved Sam Lone Bear,such as the instance related by Grover Tom above. Severalfamilies in Fallon remembered Sam Lone Bear, and knew that MamieCharley, a Shoshone of' that town, had married him. An oldPeyotist at Pyramid Lake recalled that Willie Hardin of McDermitthad been nearly dead and had been cured by Sam at Pyramid Lake. Most remarkable was finding a Shoshone Indian, Sam Long, onthe Te-Moak Reservation south of Elko who had as a sacred objecta carved staff that his father had received from Sam Lone Bear in1929. I visited him a second time in 1978 and learned more aboutthe new rules for conducting a Peyote ceremony he said he hadlearned directly from God through Peyote. God had told him toreverse the ceremonial direction from clockwise to counter-clockwise. He had no fire in the ritual and used a cloth altar.His following is so small it is unlikely that his special ritualwill survive him. The Native American Church of Nevada has converted a verysmall percentage of' the total Indian population in Nevada.However, cultural and social patterns connected with Peyote arefound similar to those elsewhere in the United States. Oppositionto Peyotism arrived from outside the state even before Peyoteceremonies were practiced. The Nevada NAC has had regularencouragement from outside Indians, and Nevada Peyotists since1936 have been regularly bolstered by visits with Peyotists inother states. In 1978 the vitality of Peyotism in Nevadasuggested it would continue indefinitely. In Nevada, I discovered what appeared at first to be a uniquebehavior pattern. Joe Green, an active Paiute medicineman, was atthe same time a devout Episcopalian and a devotee of Peyotism. Hebelieved in and practiced three religions at a time. Since Ibecame aware of that religious phenomenon in 1938, I have foundit many times among Peyotists throughout the United States andMexico. In time I came to realize (and then I confirmed this frompublished examples) that human beings universally appear able andwilling to add religions together and practice them alternately,yet maintaining them discrete. Except for peoples reared in orfully converted to Christianity, Islam or Judaism the ability toeasily carry on three or more religions simultaneously appears tobe the rule.

There have been about 40 to 50 such reports, mostof which were hearsay that could never be traced to a particularcase. Some have been based on a physician's belief that Navajopeople use peyote and that if a particular person became disturbedit must have been for this reason. There has been one relativelyclear-cut case of acute psychosis and four cases that are difficultto interpret. (The "acute psychosis" occurred when aNavajo man attended a peyote meeting after drinking alcohol-Ed.)Assuming that all five of our cases represent true reactions topeyote and that we hear about half of the cases occurring, theresulting probably over-estimated rate would be approximatelyone bad reaction per 70,000 ingestions...This rate is much lowerthan others that have been reported for the use of hallucinogenicagents.

We need spiritual freedom in America. The peyote religion hasbeen a lifeline from the past for native people. I believe it canbe a lifeline to the future for many others. But the truth is thePeyote Religion has been suppressed by laws which discriminateagainst followers according to their race, and by ideas whichdiscredit the Good Medicine by classifying it as a dangerousdrug. In California, for example, the rights of Native Americansseem protected because of a favorable decision by the CaliforniaSupreme Court in the 1964 "Woody Case." However therights of non-Indian peyotists are ambiguous at best since theiruse of peyote is a felony under state law despite the fact thatpeyote proves to be spiritually nourishing and medicallybeneficial regardless of ethnic ancestry, and despite the allegedconstitutional right to religious freedom for all Americans. Three states have exempted peyote from "controlledsubstance" prohibitions, and do permit the"bona-fide" sacramental use of peyote by non-Indianswho are members of an established church: these are New York,Arizona and New Mexico. The Federal District Court of New Yorkdecided in 1979 that "the use of peyote for sacramentalpurposes...is not to be restricted solely to the Native AmericanChurch." Thus a precedent has been clearly established, andunder Arizona laws the Peyote Way Church of God was licensed asperhaps the first all-race organization with appropriateauthority. A recent decision by the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates (1990) makes it clear that we do not have a constitutionalright to use any controlled substance as a religious sacrament.Instead, each state has the right to pass laws which honor thepeyote religion, or continue to suppress it. Apparently the FirstAmendment only applies to established religions. The same Peyote Way Church which is legal in Arizona hasencountered difficulties in Texas, where church members werearrested for harvesting medicine. Charges were dismissed, but theChurch filed a counter-suit against Texas for discrimination,noting that members of the Native American Church were permittedto harvest and purchase peyote from local licensed dealers. Thiswould seem to be a case of obvious racial and religiousdiscrimination on the part of Texas, but in a decision that makesa mockery of American history, the Fifth Circuit Court declaredthat "Indian Nations were sovereign entities" withspecial rights to all of the peyote in the United States.Therefore members of the Peyote Way Church, with membership opento all people regardless of ethnic ancestry, could not pick orpurchase peyote in Texas. I would think the previouslyunrecognized "Indian Nations" could now use thelanguage of this decision to sue Texas for the return of theirsovereign land and other natural resources. The Americanlegislative and judicial system conveniently recognizes SovereignIndian Nations only when that point of view perpetuates theempire. If the state of Texas really cared about Indian rights, orpreventing the depletion of the natural peyote gardens bynon-Indian peyotists, it would encourage commercial cultivationof peyote and develop a peyote nature preserve in Starr County,which had a perpetual harvest plan for providing medicine to theNative American Church. This would put many south Texas ranchersback in business, after years of recession-economics. And perhapsthe Native American Church might be more supportive of non-Indianrights, if the increasingly diminishing natural supply of peyotewere not threatened by a growing demand. --�Guy Mount, Editor PeyoteWisdom Menu Page LSDand the Psychedelics Menu Page CliffSchaffer's Home Page WT01-B35-31IA087-000628-B034-33http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/lsd/callaw.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122063835 text/html 3834HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:38:22 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 01-Jan-97 22:23:15 GMTContent-length: 3616 California Law California Law 11352.

Finding that Congress' intent to exempt the Native AmericanChurch is not meant to extend to other Churches which use peyote,the Court finds that Peyote Way's claims for violation of thefree exercise clause and establishment clause of the FirstAmendment must fail.

Alfred L. Smith et al. [No.88-1213] 494 US 872,108 L Ed 2nd 876,110 SCt 1595 Argued November 6, 1989. Decided April 17,1990. Decision: Oregon's prohibition of use of peyote inreligious ceremony held not to violate free exercise of religionclause of Federal Constitution's First Amendment. SUMMARY Two drug rehabilitation counselors, both of whom were membersof the Native American Church, were fired from their jobs with aprivate corporation in Oregon because they had ingested peyote, ahallucinogenic drug, for sacramental purposes at a ceremony ofthe Church. The counselors applied to the Employment Division ofOregon's Department of Human Resources for unemploymentcompensation, but the department's Employment Appeals Boardultimately denied their applications on the ground that thecounselors had been discharged for misconduct connected withwork. The Oregon Court of Appeals, reversing the board'sdecisions, (1) held that the denial of benefits to persons whowere discharged for engaging in a religious act constituted anunjustified burden on the right of free exercise of religion, and(2) remanded the cases to the board for further findings as tothe religious nature of the counselors' acts (75 Or App 764, 707P2d 1274, 709 P2d 246). The Supreme Court of Oregon, holding thatsuch further findings were unnecessary and that the counselorswere entitled to payment of unemployment benefits, affirmed bothjudgments as modified (301 Or 209, 221, 721 P2d 445, 451). Oncertiorari, the United States Supreme Court (1) noted that theOregon Supreme Court had not decided whether the counselors'sacramental use of peyote was in fact proscribed by Oregon'scontrolled substance law, and that this issue was a matter ofdispute between the parties, (2) determined that it would not beappropriate, given this uncertainty, for the United StatesSupreme Court to decide whether the practice was protected by theFederal Constitution, and accordingly (3) vacated the OregonSupreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for furtherproceedings (485 US 660, 99 L Ed 2nd 753, 108 S Ct 1444). Onremand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that (1) the Oregon statutemade no exception for the sacramental use of peyote, (2) thecounselors' use of peyote thus fell within the prohibition of thestatute, (3) the prohibition of the practice at issue was notvalid under the free exercise clause of the FederalConstitution's First Amendment, and (4) the counselors could notbe denied unemployment benefits for having engaged in thatpractice (307 Or 68, 763 P2d 146). On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed. Inan opinion by Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, Ch. J., and White,Stevens and Kennedy, JJ., it was held that (1) the free exerciseof religion clause permits a state to include religiouslyinspired use of peyote within the reach of the state's generalcriminal prohibition on use of that drug, where there is nocontention that the state's drug law represents an attempt toregulate religious beliefs, the communication of religiousbeliefs, or the raising of one's children in those beliefs; (2)the free exercise of religion clause thus permitted Oregon todeny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobsbecause of such religiously inspired use; and (3) generallyapplicable, religion-neutral criminal laws that have the effectof burdening a particular religious practice need not bejustified, under the free exercise of religion clause, by acompelling governmental interest. O'Connor, J., concurred in the judgment and, in an opinionjoined in part (as to points 1-3 below) by Brennan, Marshall, andBlackmun, JJ., expressed the view that (1 ) the question underthe free exercise of religion clause was properly presented inthe United States Supreme Court, (2) an individual's freeexercise of religion is burdened by neutral laws of generalapplicability that make criminal the individual's religiouslymotivated conduct, (3) the First Amendment requires at least acase-by-case determination whether such a burden on specificindividuals is constitutionally significant and whether theparticular criminal interest asserted by the government iscompelling, and (4) under such a test, (a) Oregon had acompelling interest in regulating peyote use by its citizens, (b)a selective exemption from the prohibition would unduly interferewith this interest, and therefore (c) the free exercise ofreligion clause did not require Oregon to accommodate thecounselors conduct. Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.,dissenting, expressed the view that (1 ) a state statute thatburdens the free exercise of religion may stand only if the lawin general, and the state's refusal to allow a religiousexemption in particular, are justified by a compelling interestthat cannot be served by less restrictive means, (2) Oregon'sinterest in refusing to make an exception for the religious useof peyote was not sufficiently compelling to outweigh thecounselors' right to the free exercise of their religion, andtherefore (3) Oregon could not, consistent with the free exerciseof religion clause, deny the counselors unemployment benefits.

Stewart, 1987.University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, OK. Peyotism today echoes the long-standing problem of itsopposition by the dominant population---the Spanish in Mexico andother Americans in the United States, government officials,Christian missionaries, educators, and U.S. senators andrepresentatives. Legally, peyotists today have won their fightfor religious freedom in the United States. Since 1978, with thepassage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 USC1996, P.L./ 95-341), the practice of peyotism by American Indiansis protected by law. This act orders all federal agencies to beaware of American Indian sacred sites, objects, plants,materials, etc.., and to protect them from destruction, ifpossible, and to make their use available to Indians. Peyotism isone of the several American Indian religions named as needingprotection. But there is still the possibility of harassment ofpeyotists under the Drug Abuse Control Act of 1965, whichincludes peyote among prohibited narcotics, and many state lawswhich have similar restrictions. While a test in court will clearanyone of arrest for possession of peyote if it is shown that thepeyote is for use in a ceremony of the NAC and that the possessoris a member of the NAC, the arrest and detainment can bediscouraging. NAC members are learning to be careful not to carrypeyote around with them, to carry identification of membership insome NAC congregation, and to know the law. While the efforts toenforce the Drug Control Act where it involves peyote may be anannoyance, most Peyotists are willing to conform to the law. An unusual case of harassment under the Drug Control Act tookplace in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in October, 1984, when awhite couple, Mr. and Mrs. John D. Warner, were arrested by theFBI for possessing peyote, a controlled drug. The two weremembers of the NAC of Tokio, North Dakota, and had been for anumber of years, and Mrs. Warner was custodian of the supply ofpeyote for the Tokio congregation. The FBI had learned of thepossession of peyote by the Warners from the president of the NACof NA, Emerson Jackson (Navajo), so it was he who brought them totrial. Jackson said that they were not bona fide members of theNAC because they were not Indians. He maintained that in 1982 amotion had been passed by the NAC of NA to the effect thatmembership in that organization be limited to persons withone-quarter Indian blood, thereby excluding this white couple. Ajury trial in Grand Forks Federal Court found the defendantsinnocent of breaking the law, since they were able to prove thatalthough they were not Indians, nevertheless they were members ingood standing of the local congregation of peyotists. The chargeswere dismissed. This case not only illustrates harassment under the DrugControl Act, but it also brings up the legality of non-Indians asbona fide members of the NAC. From the beginning, attendance ofnon-Indians to peyote meetings has been a somewhat personal ortribal matter. For instance, very early in Oklahoma some Caddorefused to allow non-Indians to attend any of their meetings. Butothers, such as the Kiowa and Comanche, welcomed non-Indians,black or white, as long as they were seriously interested. Withthe formation of the NAC, the same attitude has generallyprevailed, and the presence of non-Indians has been no problem.It was in the sixties when the hippie generation becameinterested in peyote and became a nuisance in the peyote gardensof Texas, bringing about the Texas law which forbids possessionof peyote by persons not having one-quarter Indian blood andproof of membership in the NAC, that race became an issue inmembership. Since then, if non-Indians wish to be allowed topossess peyote, they must show that their involvement in thepeyote religion is genuine---that it is not just a recreational,frivolous, or passing interest but a real commitment. Then, asthe case against the Warners shows, race is not an issue. Still,it is especially important for non-Indians to carryidentification of membership in the NAC if they have occasion tocarry peyote, and even so, non-Indians possessing peyote violateTexas law. The ruling of the NAC of NA that only Indians should beenrolled in the Native American Church is new and is not sharedby most peyotists. The NAC of NA does not speak for allpeyotists, much as it would like to do so. All peyotists considerthemselves members of the Native American Church, but most arenot affiliated with the NAC of NA. Each congregation makes itsown rules, just as each meeting is conducted by its own roadman. ---Omer C.

On that first visit to a Native America Church meetingin 1965, I did not realize that the process it offered was not tobe taken lightly. It took me ten years to make a return visit,but now the church has become a place of healing andenlightenment for me. To the believer, peyote constitutes a sacrament, not a drug.Peyote has absolutely no recreational aspects for the churchparticipants. You must come to peyote as to truth, in an attitudeof worship. Let me explain at the outset that in matters of the PeyoteChurch, I am a guest who has come to dinner; that does not makeme an expert on the entire family. I know what I have seen, andthere is much I don't know. I go as a fellow traveler. I don'tbring friends to observe the colorful ritual. This is a sacredtime to me and to every other participant in the service. The most spiritual place I know is the tipi of the PeyoteChurch. I used to go to synagogue on the high Jewish holidays,but I can no longer feel the presence of the spirit in a grouplarger than forty. Indians have a very different concept of where you worship.The whole Earth is the temple. Any place you stand is a church.The tipi is a nestling enclosure on the Earth Mother's breast, aplace of sharing among a small group. Here each can worship athis or her own time, as the heart directs, in his or her ownlanguage. I sing my Jewish songs in the tipi, and I wear my father'sprayer shawl, the one he wore at his bar mitzvah in Germany. MyIndian friends say that it does not matter in what language yousing; there are always at least two people who understand--- youand the Creator. The first time I sat before the coals in the tipi I sawcrematorium ashes. I do not see them as such anymore. I haveallowed myself to become liberated. I understand that I am flawedand imperfect, so it's okay to feel small and weak. I am freer ofthe domination of those fears. The more you work with the mind, the more you realize youcan't know it. The more you seek to touch your spirit, the moreyou realize that you must enter some altered state ofconsciousness to burst free of the conventional limitations offlesh and rationality. This is what the Peyote Church is about. --�Carl A.

" ---I Corinthians Nearly thirty years ago, I spent a summer in Mexico, much ofit in a small village two hours by bus up the coast fromAcapulco. As far as I know, the village had no name but wasreferred to as "the turnaround" (in Spanish, of course)because it was here that the third-class bus turned around andheaded back over the mountain to Acapulco. I had gone there onthe recommendation of a friend to escape the modern hotels andthe tourist crowd. But I was not entirely prepared for theprimitive conditions I met, or for a certain adventure that cameto me. Instead of a modern hotel room, I found myself sleeping ona cot, covered only by a light sheet, just one of seven otherrugged souls who had chosen this thatched roof dormitory over themore elegant accommodations available two hours south. We always arose at sunrise, helped fold the cots, thenstashed them away in one corner of the room. That done, we sataround and sipped coffee from crude, terra-cotta cups as wewaited for breakfast to be served by the proprietor and his wife.Eating and sleeping under these conditions, created a bondbetween strangers, in spite of the language barriers. I knewenough Spanish to ask for basic life essentials, and the others,mostly Mexican students from the City, knew enough English tomake small-talk. One afternoon I met a man on the beach who said he was atourist guide. He offered to take me up to the top of themountain---I do not think I ever heard the name of it---where hepromised to show me the most spectacular view imaginable. The feefor this jaunt was reasonable, and having nothing better to do Iagreed to go with him. The man's name was "Sen", and he was a wiry butstrong looking little man who appeared to be in his earlysixties. He wore only faded khaki pants and a red T- shirt with aflying hawk emblazoned across the chest. Underneath the bird,written in Spanish, was the name of a local beer. Sen wasdark-skinned and had long black hair that reached nearly to hisshoulders. His face had sharp Indian features, and when he smiledhe revealed two front teeth capped in gold. Just after noon, Senpacked a small knapsack with staples that he purchased from a groceriaa short ways from our camp. Then we set out on foot in the mostcasual way imaginable. He pointed to the mountain peak where wewere going. It looked to me to be miles and miles away. Heassured me, however, that it was a much shorter distance than itlooked, and I was not to worry. We traveled on foot for most of the afternoon, taking what hecalled "El Sombre"---the shaded trail on theeastern slopes of the mountain, which protected us from thetorturous rays of the afternoon sun. The trail was difficult,very steep at times, and not well maintained. I failed to keeptrack of the time, but we must have traveled for at least fourhours before we stopped. Finally Sen announced that we had arrived at our destination,and he led me to the mouth of a large cave, where we sat down torest. I would guess that the cave was approximately two thousandfeet above the sea. Less than a mile to the west, and seeminglystraight down, was the ocean. As Sen had promised me, it was a most spectacular view. Thesteep walls of the mountain amplified the sounds of the waves farbelow, giving the illusion that the sea might have been only astone's throw away. From this aerial view, somewhat magnified bya peculiar atmospheric distortion, one could watch the wavesrolling gently in upon the beautiful white beach, appearing asthey might through binoculars. I was aware of Sen squatting down on the ledge a few feet offto my left and a foot or two behind me. I turned and watched ashe took a small package from his day-pack. He had somethingwrapped up in newspapers, which he set down in front of him. He carefully unfolded the papers, smoothing the edges outover the ground. At the center of the square of newspaper weresix objects that looked like green cactus apples with flattenedtops. Each one had a feathery white tuft growing out of its top. With a small, razor-sharp, stag handled jackknife, Senremoved the tufts and sliced the cactus apples pie-like intonarrow wedges. "What is it?" I asked, in Spanish. "It is medicine for fixing your eyes," Sen said. Helooked up and grinned mischievously, making a peculiar fanninggesture with his hands around the area of his eyes. "Peyote," I said. He nodded, inviting me to sharethe peyote with him. I would have been reluctant except that back in the States, Ihad taken peyote three times. Each time had been under controlledconditions, and in the name of medical research. We had taken ourpeyote as a dried powder inside gelatin capsules. I had only seenpictures of it in its raw form. I had experienced a pleasant, mildly altered state ofconsciousness in these experiments. So, naturally, I had noparticular anxiety about taking the peyote with my guide. Sen showed me how to eat the narrow slices from the buttons.He tipped back his head, opened his mouth wide, and placed asingle slice far back on his tongue. Then he rocked his headforward and swallowed. On my first try, I failed to get thepeyote far enough back on my tongue, and the foul, earthy tastemade me wretch. Sen repeated his instructions, and this time I got it right.Together we consumed five ripe buttons in about a half an hour.Then we sat quietly, breathing slowly and deeply in a way thatSen said he had been taught to do. I recall feeling nauseous atfirst, but had no trouble with it when I followed Sen's breathinginstructions. It was late evening. The sun was setting, and the sky hadturned a deep scarlet. At the horizon, sea and sky blended as onein a symphony of reds and yellows. Spread out between the ocean and the cave where we sat, I sawa strip of tropical jungle. Here was a world of lush greens,ferns and palms in varying tone, now wearing an aura of pinkcreated by the fading sun. Blowing in from the ocean, the evening air was cool, heavywith the earthy fragrance of the jungle, of naturally compostingvegetation and moist soil, and of flowers which I could not see. "It is like I told you it would be," Sen said."Do you agree?" I nodded, agreeing that indeed it was very beautiful. Minutes passed; then Sen announced, "Darkness will becoming soon." It took a moment for these words to sink in. And then thehorror of it struck me. We had just spent the entire afternoonhiking up an extremely precipitous trail, along which weencountered many hazards. Several times I had clung to the rockface of the mountain to traverse a section of the trail washedout by storms, risking a fall of several hundred feet. Anothertime a large snake blocked the trail. Sen chased it off with astick, all the while assuring me that the snake was notpoisonous, though its bite could be harmful. The realization that I might have to go down this same trailin the darkness startled me. How could I have been so stupid! Whyhad it not occurred to me, until now, that it would be dark whenwe returned! I was furious with Sen. What sort of person would guide me tosuch a place, heedless of the threat to my well-being. Surely herealized it would be dark before we returned. I then became aware of a deep, groaning roar coming from deepwithin the cave behind me, and I leapt to my feet with visions ofbeing attacked at any moment by a wild animal whose peace we haddisturbed. I began swearing and jumping around, unable to decidewhich way to turn. I knew there was a washout less than a hundredyards down the trail, and it was already too dark to safely crossit. Sen continued to sit at the mouth of the cave, completelyunperturbed. In fact, he was wearing a toothy grin that didnothing for my sense of security. Again I heard the groaning roar within the cave. "Whatthe hell is that?" I cried. "Don't you think we shouldget out of here?" "Is it such a bad sound?" Sen asked. "I findit rather pleasant." "Pleasant!" I said, still searching for an escape."How can you sit there so calmly? Do you know what itis?" "It is a sound." "Of what?" Sen shrugged. "Who knows?" At that moment, I sensed that he knew something which Ididn't. He'd been here before. Or at least he claimed that he hadbeen. He obviously knew that the sound wasn't a threat to oursafety. Or did he? I knew nothing about the man, other than whatI saw. He had told me nothing about himself. Where had he comefrom? For all I knew he cold be a complete fool, or amadman---some sort of murderer who lured people out into thewilds where he slaughtered them. After all, who would ever findme out here? Who even knew--- or for that matter cared---whereI'd gone? "Sit down," he said sternly, pointing to the emptyboulder at the mouth of the cave where moments before I had beensitting. "Not on your life," I said. He looked at me incredulously. "No? Then, where are yougoing to go?" "I'm leaving," I said. "I'll go back down thetrail." "Surely you're joking." "I'm not joking at all," I said. "I've hadplenty of trail experience back in California. "Suit yourself," he said. "But you'll miss thebest part of the sunset. Look." He pointed over the horizon. Against my better judgment I turned to find out what hethought could possibly be so important. At the edge of thehorizon the sky was ablaze with a bright pattern of red andyellow light, twisting slowly into a shape that resembled aspiral galaxy. My breath was literally taken away by the beautyof it, and for a moment I completely forgot my plight. "Mygod, what is it?" I asked. "It is what I promised you," Sen said. "I havekept my word." In spite of myself I sat down and stared out over thehorizon. For an hour or more I watched as the spiraling colorsplayed at the end of the ocean. The galaxy of colors was huge,awesome in its proportions, and seemed to have a life of its own,twisting and turning almost playfully, as though it had anintelligence and was performing a dance with the Earth. Thensuddenly it was gone, and we were plunged into darkness. The groaning roar rose from the cave behind us, and this timeI was able to study it, to listen with a calmer mind. Rather thanlike an animal, it sounded this time like two gigantic bouldersbeing ground slowly together, emitting a voice from somewheredeep down in the earth beneath our feet. I had visions of twocontinental plates scraping against one another, their soundamplified and made more resonant by a long tunnel in the cave. "Listen," Sen said. "Listen." I did, and the sound varied, not like a voice so much as likemusic made by a gigantic instrument whose shape and mechanics Icould barely imagine. "Didn't I tell you?" Sen said excitedly."Didn't I tell you I would show you a wonderful place?" He leaned down and picked up his knapsack. Reaching inside,he produced a round object which he handed to me. It was too darkto see what it was, but from the size and texture I guessed itwas an orange. "Supper," Sen said, announcing this in a completelymatter-of-fact tone. Was he kidding? Was this really his idea of an adequatesupper after our arduous climb to this place? Without comment, Isullenly peeled and sectioned the orange, determining that Iwould eat it slowly, savoring every bite. I was aware of Sen rolling his orange between his palms, thepeeling still in place. He was doing this in a very studied, verymethodical way, and I grew curious. As I watched him, I alsobecame aware that the mountain was growing brighter and brighter,almost as though a huge spotlight was being pointed at us. Ilooked up and saw the edge of a full moon just emerging frombehind the top of the mountain, another five hundred feet aboveus. This was providing us with enough light to safely make ourway down the path, if that is what we chose to do. I looked at Sen, meaning to suggest this to him. But now hewas ripping into the orange like a starving ape, tearing offgreat chunks and burying his face in his hands as he sucked andchewed at the fruit. I was disgusted by his behavior, andwondered if he always ate like this. He finished, reached intohis knapsack for a bandanna, and wiped off his face and hands,licking his fingers now and then to get rid of the sticky juice.This done, he lay down, arranged the knapsack under his head, andappeared for all the world to be getting ready to take a nap. "Shouldn't we be getting back while we still have somelight from the moon?" I asked. "What's the hurry? Have you got an appointment with thedoctor or something?" To this he chuckled stupidly, like aman unaware of the fact that no one else thought his joke funny. "When are we going back?" "Why don't you just enjoy yourself," he said."Take it easy." I don't know whether I was more angry than anxious, but Icould see that there was no sense in trying to budge him. He hadhis own plans for us, and he was obviously not going to let me inon them. I was completely at his mercy. I leaned back and started picking at the orange that I hadsectioned so carefully. I picked up the first section and wasabout to put it in my mouth when I felt something moving acrossmy hand. I looked down at the orange section. A tiny lizard,about the length of my little finger, clung to the fruit. Igrabbed it by the tail and flung it out into space, disgusted bythe thought that had I not felt it moving in time, I would havebitten into H. and might at this very moment be spitting out itsbleeding carcass. I was careful after that, brushing off each section of fruitand inspecting it in the moonlight before popping it into mymouth. By the time I had finished eating, Sen was sound asleep.His rasping snores indicated to me that it would be no use tryingto awaken him, at least not for an hour or more. I felt restless and uneasy. From far below us I could hearwaves lapping against the beach, and this was soothing. Then,every few minutes, the cave made that peculiar groaning sound, asound to which I had now become accustomed. To pass the time, Idecided that I would try to plot how long were the silencesbetween the cave's groans, but after an hour or more I coulddetermine no apparent pattern, and eventually gave it up. The moonlight slowly faded, and again I became anxious asdarkness closed in around me. Now, every sound seemed amplified,and I became aware of live things all around me. High-pitchedwhistles from inside the cave suggested the presence of bats.Rustling in the trees suggested night birds, or perhaps nocturnalanimals. None of these things particularly disturbed me, thoughthey didn't exactly put me at ease, either. I had spent manynights under the stars back in the States, hiking in the Sierras.But I have to admit that these sounds were not familiar to me,and my inability to identify them put my nerves on edge. The sky was brilliant with stars, the Milky Way like a greatsea of light. Several times I saw meteorites trailing across thesky. In spite of my nervousness, I caught myself dozing, jerkingto attention when by body relaxed, and I almost lost the balanceof my sitting position. At last I gave into H and lay down,staring up at the sky until I fell asleep. The next thing I knew there was a shriek, and I sat boltupright, not knowing what to expect. The shriek shattered thestillness once more and I looked up, having determined that thesound had come from above and to my left. As I searched thedarkness, the shriek came again and a huge bird, with a wingspanof at least six feet, swooped down, coming right for me. I leaptbehind Sen's rock--- where he continued to sleep soundly---justas the great bird shot by. As the bird passed, less than a foot from my face, I saw itstalons extended as though for a kill. But that was not the worstof it. Just a few feet past me, it stopped in mid-flight, seemedto gather itself into a ball, and suddenly changed directions,facing me once again as thought preparing for another attack. Ishielded my face with both arms, fully expecting to feel itssharp talons dig into me at any moment. But then it stopped.Facing me directly, flapping its wings gently, hanging in the airlike a feathery helicopter, I thought I heard it make a sound. Surely I was dreaming. But I knew I wasn't. I looked directlyat the bird and saw that it had a human face. I rubbed my eyes,certain that what I was seeing couldn't possibly be true. But itwas. The bird had a human face. Moreover, it was a face Irecognized. It was Sen's face! Sen had taken the form of a giantnight-hunter. I glanced down on the ground where he had beensleeping. Indeed, he was gone. And there, as clear as the paperon which these words are printed, was the bird---Sen in the formof a bird, hovering before my eyes, flapping his wings gently,evenly, as he held his space in the air. "What are you doing?" I asked, at the moment notthinking how indescribably unbelievable it was to be talking to abird who had taken the face of my companion. "Coo! Coo! Coo!" the bird said. This was followedby laughter--- laughter that I knew was Sen's. The laughter endedand was followed by his stupid chuckling. Did he somehow expectme to share in his little joke? I didn't think it was funny. Infact, I was shaking like a leaf, still unable to give a rationalexplanation for what I'd seen. Besides, the bird was still there,still hovering within an arm's length me. I decided to treat it as an everyday occurrence. After all,maybe it was a dream. I had heard that the best way to stop aperson or situation that you don't like in a dream was to rein inyour rational self and tell it to go away. I did this, and heardthe bird reply, "Go away to where? You said yourself, itwasn't safe to go down the trail in the dark." "But you're a bird," I said. "You canfly." "Oh, right. That's right," I heard Sen say."Goo'bye, then." And with this, he disappeared. By the light of the stars Iwatched him gather his wings under him and plunge off the cliffwhere I was sitting. I watched as he circled gracefully, changeddirection, and disappeared, skimming the treetops in the junglebelow, apparently continuing his night hunt. Then, startled, I suddenly realized that I was all alone atthe mouth of the cave. Could this have actually happened? Had Senbeen transformed, somehow, into the body of a bird, a giant owlor whatever it was? In any case, it was very clear to me now thatI was left alone on the mountainside. I heard the crunch of gravel on the path a hundred feet away,off to my right. I called out, "Sen, is that you?" Much to my relief, my companion came into view, hooking uphis pants. "Where were you?" I asked. "I went to take a crap," he said. "What'swrong? Are you late for your appointment again?" This wasfollowed by his usual stupid chuckle. Then he went back over tohis rock and stretched out, arranging the knapsack under his headas before. "I've had enough of this," I said. "Stopfooling around with my head." "I'm going back to sleep," he said. "Wake mewhen the movie's over." I could not believe his audacity or his incredible coolness.Within seconds he was sound asleep again, apparently oblivious toeverything going on around him. I lay brooding, angry, thoroughlyshaken by everything I had been through that night. I wanted tograb Sen by the shoulders and shake him awake. I wanted to screamat him, to tell him how much I resented the games he was playingwith me. I didn't know how he was accomplishing what he wasdoing, and I didn't care. I just wanted it to stop. I huddled close to my rock like an animal guarding itsterritory. I myself began to feel like an animal, destined tolive out its life in the wild. I felt a warming sensationthroughout my body, a rippling of muscle. Perhaps it was due to awarm breeze emitted from the mouth of the cave. It was certainlypossible that there were hot springs somewhere below thatoccasionally emitted heat which escaped to the outer vestibules. I found myself staring steadily and angrily at the sleepingSen. I had never felt such hatred for another man. But as Istared at him I could not identify my anger. I felt a strangefear, like nothing I'd ever felt before. It was as though thisman was an intruder in my life, that he was threatening me orsomething that belonged to me. I watched him cautiously, waiting for him to make theslightest move in my direction, a move that would indicate that Iwould have to fight with him---perhaps until one or the other ofus was dead. I determined that I would be the victor. After all,I was larger, more powerful than he. Sen's snoring stopped. He took a deep breath, then suddenlybegan to tremble all over as though he was having some sort offit. The light changed and I saw a giant cat, a mountain lion ora panther standing between me and him, teeth bared. "Sen," I cried, wanting to warn him. But a strangesound came from my throat, a hissing that I could barely identifywith. Sen sat bolt upright and looked calmly past the cat. In fact,his gaze was piercing, looking right through the cat into myeyes. "Stop this nonsense right now," he said."You need your sleep. You'll be exhausted in themorning." "The cat," I said. "Don't you see it?" Atthat moment I wasn't certain of anything. I could not clearly seethe cat myself. It was too close for me to see. I was terriblyconfused. Why couldn't he see it? I was aware only of itsthreatening posture, baring its teeth, ready to pounce. "Of course I see it," Sen said. "It's yourcat. It's not going to hurt me." My cat, I thought to myself. Mine? And then Iasked, "What makes you so sure?" "I am just sure. I am just sure." He waved his handin front of my face. Suddenly I was calm. I felt spellbound."You see?" Sen said. Sen lay back down, and in seconds he was sound asleep again.I drew back away from him, toward the mouth of the cave. The catcame back into focus for me. It was just me and the cat now. Thecat turned, gazed into my face, and appeared to grin. Was all this truly my own creation? I stared back at the cat.Its face lit up, glowing, as though it had been a plastic mask;now someone had turned on a light behind the cat mask, exposingthe illusion. The body of the cat vanished and I was looking justat its face, at that backlit mask. Then the mask of the cat beganto dissolve, as though the heat of the light behind it wascausing it to melt. Soon it was nothing more than a molten blobturning in space like a star. As I watched, it began to reshapeitself into a much more geometric form. After a few moments its transformation was complete. Round,saucer-shaped, it turned slowly in the space before my eyes. Thelight still shown within it, as though it possessed its ownsource of illumination. It turned again and again, revealing itsfull configuration, thin and elliptical from the side, round andperfectly symmetrical from the front. It was a lens, like thelens from a telescope or a magnifying glass. But this lens had anorganic appearance---not unlike a living cell, translucent andsoft, definitely alive---a geometric jellyfish. I moved closer to the lens. Deep inside it I saw movement.What were these shapes? I saw many images from my childhood---mybrothers, the house where I'd lived during my high school yearsin Michigan, my parents, my first lover. I thought about howpeople often reported seeing their lives flash before their eyeswhen they were faced with death. Could this be the case? Was Inear death? I looked deeper into the lens, as though I might findthe answer there. I saw a cat, a powerful mountain lion. Therewas also a giant bird. There was a groaning cave, and a beautifulsunset over the ocean. There was a rugged trail up a mountain,and a man. I looked more closely. It was Sen. He was sleeping bythe rock, his head on his knapsack. I could not figure out wherehe was---in the lens, or beyond it, or both? The lens turned in the air. I closed my eyes, trying to blockit out, trying to see around it, or to see a clear place throughit where the world beyond would not be distorted by the imagesinside the lens. But I could not escape the lens' influence, andnow I was aware that it was turning deep in my consciousness, inthe same space out of which dream and imagination are created. Ihad never before noticed how large this mental space I calledimagination could be. It had no limits, no beginning or middle orend. It seemed to stretch out in all directions, a vast landscapewhose borders were as unlimited as space itself. At one moment I could be on the mountainside with Sen, inMexico. A second later I was back in Michigan, many years before,a boy of twelve riding his bicycle on a rain-slick asphaltstreet. A second after that I was driving across the Arizonadesert in January, with a carload of friends, all in our earlytwenties, heading back to California after a Christmas holidaywith our families in Michigan. Now I shifted to a backpackingtrip in the high Sierras, where I fished for trout on the bank ofa mountain lake. Where was the lens now? I couldn't find it. It seemed to havemerged with all the rest, lost in the jumble of everything I heldin my consciousness. I felt panic. Losing the image of the lenswas like losing a treasure I had dreamed of discovering all mylife. Then there was a long moment of perfect clarity when Irealized what had happened to the lens. I saw that it hadn'tdisappeared at all; the lens was my consciousness, not simply apiece of it. For a long time I just sat quietly and thought about this. Itseemed to me that the lens was like a vehicle for my awareness,giving me an identity separate from the rest of the world. Thiswas the image I had been seeking since I was a child. A thousandquestions and speculations that I had entertained along the waynow focused on this lens image. Having the sense of separateness which the lens providedseemed to me both exciting and frightening. It meant that I wasnot like an ant, with instincts---that is, pre-programmedresponses built in---dictating my every action. It meant that Iwas capable of creating my own program, or even of overridingwhatever biological or God-given programs might be built in. My decisions, my fears, my dreams, my acquired knowledge, allcould come into play. In my present situation, up on themountain, I could make a decision, based on my fears or on otherfactors contained in my lens, to leave my guide sleeping by themouth of the cave and make my way down the mountain trail alone.Or I could choose to trust him, and wait for morning. Regardlessof which decision I made, because of my awareness of myseparateness--- achieved through the lens---it was now very clearto me that I alone was responsible for my destiny. I was terriblyexcited about being able to see all this. This vision of the lensprovided me with a symbol for making sense of knowledge I hadn'teven been aware that I was collecting over the years. I wanted toawaken Sen and discuss it all with him. "Sen," I said. "Sen, are you asleep?" Iwent over to him and gently shook his shoulder. "What do you want?" he asked, turning his head toface me. "Have you created another cat? A bird?" I started to look for the words to explain what I was seeing.But then I backed away. I realized that Sen already knew abouteverything I had seen. To him it was common knowledge, and he hadno time for it. "Never mind," I said, deeply hurt bythe realization that I had no one with whom to share mydiscovery. "I'm sorry to disturb you." Sen mumbled something I couldn't understand and went back tosleep. I sat down and watched the world beyond the lens, and saw itall merge with memories, images, ideas and feelings that I knewbelonged only to me. As my companion slept, the shadows shortened on the ledgewhere I sat and I saw that the lens was not something new in mylife. I saw it far more clearly than ever before, and that partwas new and unfamiliar, but the subtle mergings of externalsights, sounds, sensations, all seemed normal, automatic, evenfamiliar to me. I realized that these things had alwaysoccurred---and the only difference was that now I could see them,could feel their shifts and mergings, their constantmetamorphoses from one form to another. I remembered many times in the past, all through my life,when I had also had brief glimpses into these basic truths aboutour ways of processing reality, glimpses never more substantialthan the sun's reflection from a bright chrome strip on a passingcar. I now saw why life really was not all it appeared to be.Rather, it took on meaning only as it merged with our imagesinside the lens. Later that afternoon, as we made our way back down themountain, Sen listened patiently as I related the story of whathad happened to me up on the mountain. I wanted to know if he hadexperienced any of it. Were the things I had seen a sharedreality? Had he seen any of it? Sen shrugged. He was vague and elusive. He told me that theIndians believed that the place where we spent the night was asacred spot, and that people often had visions there that changedtheir lives. I asked if he had ever had visions there. "Oh, yes," he said. "That is why I sleep whenI go there. When I sleep it does what it must do and I am notalways jumping up and down thinking I have to do something aboutit." He laughed. "Unlike you, I am a very lazyman." When I tried to get him to explain this to me, he said itwasn't important. He told me my Spanish wasn't good enough tounderstand him if he really tried to go into it. And his Englishwasn't good enough for him to even attempt it in my language. He dismissed me with that phrase the Mexicans have forstopping all further conversation on a subject: "No meimporta"---it is not important to me. "You went tothe mountain and you saw what I promised you. I am a very goodguide. I hope you will tell your friends about me." I promised him I would. When I got back to the camp where I was staying, Sendisappeared down the beach and I never saw him again. I asked theowner of the hostel about him, and he told me that Sen was anIndian, and that I was lucky to have come back from the trek atall. Sen belonged to a tribe that still lived in the mountains,and they were not known for their friendliness toward Anglos.They had no respect at all for the laws of the Government, andthey lived their lives completely cut off from the rest of theworld. I always took this warning with a grain of salt. After all,if Sen's people were so isolated from the rest of civilization,how had he learned English? He knew my language far better than Iknew his. Moreover, when I thought back on it I could not thinkof a single incident in which Sen had acted in any way that Iconsidered directly harmful. Any harm that could have come to mewould have come from my own lens distorting reality in ways thatcould have caused me to use bad judgment and perhaps bring me toharm through my own actions. The experience has stayed with me throughout my life andbecome something far more than an unusual memory. The lens hasbecome a reference point for me, a kind of metaphor over which Ihave puzzled for many years. Only in the past couple years has itbecome comfortable for me to write about it, to relate the storyto others so that I might share the revelations that have comefrom it. ---Hal Zena Bennett THE LENS OF PERCEPTION by Hal Zena Bennett, 1987.

William Blake It was in 1886 that the German pharmacologist,Louis Lewin, published the first systematic study of the cactus,to which his own name was subsequently given. Anhaloniumlewinii was new to science. To primitive religion and theIndians of Mexico and the American Southwest it was a friend ofimmemorially long standing. Indeed, it was much more than afriend. In the words of one of the early Spanish visitors to theNew World, "they eat a root which they call peyote, andwhich they venerate as though it were a deity." Why they should have venerated it as a deity becameapparent when such eminent psychologists as Jaensch, HavelockEllis and Weir Mitchell began their experiments with mescalin,the active principle of peyote. True, they stopped short at apoint well this side of idolatry; but all concurred in assigningto mescalin a position among drugs of unique distinction.Administered in suitable doses, it changes the quality ofconsciousness more profoundly and yet is less toxic than anyother substance in the pharmacologist's repertory. Mescalin research has been going on sporadicallyever since the days of Lewin and Havelock Ellis. Chemists havenot merely isolated the alkaloid; they have learned how tosynthesize it, so that the supply no longer depends on the sparseand intermittent crop of a desert cactus. Alienists have dosedthemselves with mescalin in the hope thereby of coming to abetter, a first-hand, understanding of their patients' mentalprocesses. Working unfortunately upon too few subjects within toonarrow a range of circumstances, psychologists have observed andcatalogued some of the drug's more striking effects. Neurologistsand physiologists have found out something about the mechanism ofits action upon the central nervous system. And at least oneProfessional philosopher has taken mescalin for the light it maythrow on such ancient, unsolved riddles as the place of mind innature and the relationship between brain and consciousness. There matters rested until,two or three years ago, a new and perhaps highly significant factwas observed.* Actually the fact had beenstaring everyone in the face for several decades; but nobody, asit happened, had noticed it until a Young English psychiatrist,at present working in Canada, was struck by the close similarity,in chemical composition, between mescalin and adrenalin. Furtherresearch revealed that lysergic acid, an extremely potenthallucinogen derived from ergot, has a structural biochemicalrelationship to the others. Then came the discovery thatadrenochrome, which is a product of the decomposition ofadrenalin, can produce many of the symptoms observed in mescalinintoxication. But adrenochrome probably occurs spontaneously inthe human body. In other words, each one of us may be capable ofmanufacturing a chemical, minute doses of which are known tocause Profound changes in consciousness. Certain of these changesare similar to those which occur in that most characteristicplague of the twentieth century, schizophrenia. Is the mentaldisorder due to a chemical disorder? And is the chemical disorderdue, in its turn, to psychological distresses affecting theadrenals? It would be rash and premature to affirm it. The mostwe can say is that some kind of a prima facie case hasbeen made out. Meanwhile the clue is being systematicallyfollowed, the sleuths—biochemists , psychiatrists,psychologists—are on the trail. By a series of, for me, extremely fortunatecircumstances I found myself, in the spring of 1953, squarelyathwart that trail. One of the sleuths had come on business toCalifornia. In spite of seventy years of mescalin research, thepsychological material at his disposal was still absurdlyinadequate, and he was anxious to add to it. I was on the spotand willing, indeed eager, to be a guinea pig. Thus it came aboutthat, one bright May morning, I swallowed four-tenths of a gramof mescalin dissolved in half a glass of water and sat down towait for the results. We live together, we act on, and react to, oneanother; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves.The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucifiedalone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse theirinsulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. Byits very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer andenjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights,fancies—all these are private and, except through symbolsand at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information aboutexperiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family tonation, every human group is a society of island universes. Most island universes are sufficiently like oneanother to Permit of inferential understanding or even of mutualempathy or "feeling into." Thus, remembering our ownbereavements and humiliations, we can condole with others inanalogous circumstances, can put ourselves (always, of course, ina slightly Pickwickian sense) in their places. But in certaincases communication between universes is incomplete or evennonexistent. The mind is its own place, and the Places inhabitedby the insane and the exceptionally gifted are so different fromthe places where ordinary men and women live, that there islittle or no common ground of memory to serve as a basis forunderstanding or fellow feeling. Words are uttered, but fail toenlighten. The things and events to which the symbols referbelong to mutually exclusive realms of experience. To see ourselves as others see us is a mostsalutary gift. Hardly less important is the capacity to seeothers as they see themselves. But what if these others belong toa different species and inhabit a radically alien universe? Forexample, how can the sane get to know what it actually feels liketo be mad? Or, short of being born again as a visionary, amedium, or a musical genius, how can we ever visit the worldswhich, to Blake, to Swedenborg, to Johann Sebastian Bach, werehome? And how can a man at the extreme limits of ectomorphy andcerebrotonia ever put himself in the place of one at the limitsof endomorphy and viscerotonia, or, except within certaincircumscribed areas, share the feelings of one who stands at thelimits of mesomorphy and somatotonia? To the unmitigatedbehaviorist such questions, I suppose, are meaningless. But forthose who theoretically believe what in practice they know to betrue—namely, that there is an inside to experience as wellas an outside—the problems posed are real problems, all themore grave for being, some completely insoluble, some solubleonly in exceptional circumstances and by methods not available toeveryone. Thus, it seems virtually certain that I shall neverknow what it feels like to be Sir John Falstaff or Joe Louis. Onthe other hand, it had always seemed to me possible that, throughhypnosis, for example, or auto-hypnosis, by means of systematicmeditation, or else by taking the appropriate drug, I might sochange my ordinary mode of consciousness as to be able to know,from the inside, what the visionary, the medium, even the mysticwere talking about. From what I had read of the mescalin experience Iwas convinced in advance that the drug would admit me, at leastfor a few hours, into the kind of inner world described by Blakeand AE. But what I had expected did not happen. I had expected tolie with my eyes shut, looking at visions of many-coloredgeometries, of animated architectures, rich with gems andfabulously lovely, of landscapes with heroic figures, of symbolicdramas trembling perpetually on the verge of the ultimaterevelation. But I had not reckoned, it was evident, with theidiosyncrasies of my mental make-up, the facts of my temperament,training and habits. I am and, for as long as I can remember, I havealways been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words ofpoets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visionsgreet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, thememory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event orobject. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vividimage of what happened yesterday afternoon, of how the Lungarnoused to look before the bridges were destroyed, of the BayswaterRoad when the only buses were green and tiny and drawn by agedhorses at three and a half miles an hour. But such images havelittle substance and absolutely no autonomous life of their own.They stand to real, perceived objects in the same relation asHomer's ghosts stood to the men of flesh and blood, who came tovisit them in the shades. Only when I have a high temperature domy mental images come to independent life. To those in whom thefaculty of visualization is strong my inner world must seemcuriously drab, limited and uninteresting. This was theworld—a poor thing but my own—which I expected to seetransformed into something completely unlike itself. The change which actually took place in that worldwas in no sense revolutionary. Half an hour after swallowing thedrug I became aware of a slow dance of golden lights. A littlelater there were sumptuous red surfaces swelling and expandingfrom bright nodes of energy that vibrated with a continuouslychanging, patterned life. At another time the closing of my eyesrevealed a complex of gray structures, within which pale bluishspheres kept emerging into intense solidity and, having emerged,would slide noiselessly upwards, out of sight. But at no timewere there faces or forms of men or animals. I saw no landscapes,no enormous spaces, no magical growth and metamorphosis ofbuildings, nothing remotely like a drama or a parable. The otherworld to which mescalin admitted me was not the world of visions;it existed out there, in what I could see with my eyes open. Thegreat change was in the realm of objective fact. What hadhappened to my subjective universe was relatively unimportant. I took my pill at eleven. An hour and a half later,I was sitting in my study, looking intently at a small glassvase. The vase contained only three flowers-a full-blown Belie ofPortugal rose, shell pink with a hint at every petal's base of ahotter, flamier hue; a large magenta and cream-colored carnation;and, pale purple at the end of its broken stalk, the boldheraldic blossom of an iris. Fortuitous and provisional, thelittle nosegay broke all the rules of traditional good taste. Atbreakfast that morning I had been struck by the lively dissonanceof its colors. But that was no longer the point. I was notlooking now at an unusual flower arrangement. I was seeing whatAdam had seen on the morning of his creation-the miracle, momentby moment, of naked existence. "Is it agreeable?" somebody asked.(During this Part of the experiment, all conversations wererecorded on a dictating machine, and it has been possible for meto refresh my memory of what was said.) "Neither agreeable nor disagreeable," Ianswered. "it just is." Istigkeit—wasn't that the wordMeister Eckhart liked to use? "Is-ness." The Being ofPlatonic philosophy— except that Plate seems to have madethe enormous, the grotesque mistake of separating Being frombecoming and identifying it with the mathematical abstraction ofthe Idea. He could never, poor fellow, have seen a bunch offlowers shining with their own inner light and all but quiveringunder the pressure of the significance with which they werecharged; could never have perceived that what rose and iris andcarnation so intensely signified was nothing more, and nothingless, than what they were—a transience that was yet eternallife, a perpetual perishing that was at the same time pure Being,a bundle of minute, unique particulars in which, by someunspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, was to be seen thedivine source of all existence. I continued to look at the flowers, and in theirliving light I seemed to detect the qualitative equivalent ofbreathing—but of a breathing without returns to a startingpoint, with no recurrent ebbs but only a repeated flow frombeauty to heightened beauty, from deeper to ever deeper meaning.Words like "grace" and "transfiguration" cameto my mind, and this, of course, was what, among other things,they stood for. My eyes traveled from the rose to the carnation,and from that feathery incandescence to the smooth scrolls ofsentient amethyst which were the iris. The Beatific Vision, SatChit Ananda, Being-Awareness-Bliss-for the first time Iunderstood, not on the verbal level, not by inchoate hints or ata distance, but precisely and completely what those prodigioussyllables referred to. And then I remembered a passage I had readin one of Suzuki's essays. "What is the Dharma-Body of theBuddha?" ('"the Dharma-Body of the Buddha" isanother way of saying Mind, Suchness, the Void, the Godhead.) Thequestion is asked in a Zen monastery by an earnest and bewilderednovice. And with the prompt irrelevance of one of the MarxBrothers, the Master answers, "The hedge at the bottom ofthe garden." "And the man who realizes thistruth," the novice dubiously inquires, '"what, may Iask, is he?" Groucho gives him a whack over the shoulderswith his staff and answers, "A golden-haired lion." It had been, when I read it, only a vaguelypregnant piece of nonsense. Now it was all as clear as day, asevident as Euclid. Of course the Dharma-Body of the Buddha wasthe hedge at the bottom of the garden. At the same time, and noless obviously, it was these flowers, it was anything thatI—or rather the blessed Not-I, released for a moment from mythrottling embrace—cared to look at. The books, for example,with which my study walls were lined. Like the flowers, theyglowed, when I looked at them, with brighter colors, a profoundersignificance. Red books, like rubies; emerald books; books boundin white jade; books of agate; of aquamarine, of yellow topaz;lapis lazuli books whose color was so intense, so intrinsicallymeaningful, that they seemed to be on the point of leaving theshelves to thrust themselves more insistently on my attention. "What about spatial relationships?" theinvestigator inquired, as I was looking at the books. It was difficult to answer. True, the perspectivelooked rather odd, and the walls of the room no longer seemed tomeet in right angles. But these were not the really importantfacts. The really important facts were that spatial relationshipshad ceased to matter very much and that my mind was perceivingthe world in terms of other than spatial categories. At ordinarytimes the eye concerns itself with such problems as Where?—Howfar?—How situated in relation to what? In the mescalinexperience the implied questions to which the eye responds are ofanother order. Place and distance cease to be of much interest.The mind does its Perceiving in terms of intensity of existence,profundity of significance, relationships within a pattern. I sawthe books, but was not at all concerned with their positions inspace. What I noticed, what impressed itself upon my mind was thefact that all of them glowed with living light and that in somethe glory was more manifest than in others. In this contextposition and the three dimensions were beside the point. Not, ofcourse, that the category of space had been abolished. When I gotup and walked about, I could do so quite normally, withoutmisjudging the whereabouts of objects. Space was still there; butit had lost its predominance. The mind was primarily concerned,not with measures and locations, but with being and meaning. And along with indifference to space there went aneven more complete indifference to time. "There seems to be plenty of it," was allI would answer, when the investigator asked me to say what I feltabout time. Plenty of it, but exactly how much was entirelyirrelevant. I could, of course, have looked at my watch; but mywatch, I knew, was in another universe. My actual experience hadbeen, was still, of an indefinite duration or alternatively of aperpetual present made up of one continually changing apocalypse. From the books the investigator directed myattention to the furniture. A small typing table stood in thecenter of the room; beyond it, from my point of view, was awicker chair and beyond that a desk. The three pieces formed anintricate pattern of horizontals, uprights and diagonals—apattern all the more interesting for not being interpreted interms of spatial relationships. Table, chair and desk cametogether in a composition that was like something by Braque orJuan Gris, a still life recognizably related to the objectiveworld, but rendered without depth, without any attempt atphotographic realism. I was looking at my furniture, not as theutilitarian who has to sit on chairs, to write at desks andtables, and not as the cameraman or scientific recorder, but asthe pure aesthete whose concern is only with forms and theirrelationships within the field of vision or the picture space.But as I looked, this purely aesthetic, Cubist's-eye view gaveplace to what I can only describe as the sacramental vision ofreality. I was back where I had been when I was looking at theflowers-back in a world where everything shone with the InnerLight, and was infinite in its significance. The legs, forexample, of that chair—how miraculous their tubularity, howsupernatural their polished smoothness! I spent severalminutes—or was it several centuries?—not merely gazingat those bamboo legs, but actually being them—-orrather being myself in them; or, to be still more accurate (for"I" was not involved in the case, nor in a certainsense were "they") being my Not-self in the Not-selfwhich was the chair. Reflecting on my experience, I find myself agreeingwith the eminent Cambridge philosopher, Dr. C. D. Broad,"that we should do well to consider much more seriously thanwe have hitherto been inclined to do the type of theory whichBergson put forward in connection with memory and senseperception. The suggestion is that the function of the brain andnervous system and sense organs is in the main eliminativeand not productive. Each person is at each moment capable ofremembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceivingeverything that is happening everywhere in the universe. Thefunction of the brain and nervous system is to protect us frombeing overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely uselessand irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we shouldotherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving onlythat very small and special selection which is likely to bepractically useful." According to such a theory, each one ofus is potentially Mind at Large. But in so far as we are animals,our business is at all costs to survive. To make biologicalsurvival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through thereducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out atthe other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousnesswhich will help us to stay alive on the surface of thisParticular planet. To formulate and express the contents of thisreduced awareness, man has invented and endlessly elaboratedthose symbol-systems and implicit philosophies which we calllanguages. Every individual is at once the beneficiary and thevictim of the linguistic tradition into which he has beenborn—the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access tothe accumulated records of other people's experience, the victimin so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awarenessis the only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, sothat he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his wordsfor actual things. That which, in the language of religion, iscalled "this world" is the universe of reducedawareness, expressed, and, as it were, petrified by language. Thevarious "other worlds," with which human beingserratically make contact are so many elements in the totality ofthe awareness belonging to Mind at Large. Most people, most ofthe time, know only what comes through the reducing valve and isconsecrated as genuinely real by the local language. Certainpersons, however, seem to be born with a kind of by-pass thatcircumvents the reducing valve. In others temporary by-passes maybe acquired either spontaneously, or as the result of deliberate"spiritual exercises," or through hypnosis, or by meansof drugs. Through these permanent or temporary by-passes thereflows, not indeed the perception "of everything that ishappening everywhere in the universe" (for the by-pass doesnot abolish the reducing valve, which still excludes the totalcontent of Mind at Large), but something more than, and above allsomething different from, the carefully selected utilitarianmaterial which our narrowed, individual minds regard as acomplete, or at least sufficient, picture of reality. The brain is provided with a number of enzymesystems which serve to co-ordinate its workings. Some of theseenzymes regulate the supply of glucose to the brain cells.Mescalin inhibits the production of these enzymes and thus lowersthe amount of glucose available to an organ that is in constantneed of sugar. When mescalin reduces the brain's normal ration ofsugar what happens? Too few cases have been observed, andtherefore a comprehensive answer cannot yet be given. But whathappens to the majority of the few who have taken mescalin undersupervision can be summarized as follows. (1) The ability to remember and to "thinkstraight" is little if at all reduced. (Listening to therecordings of my conversation under the influence of the drug, Icannot discover that I was then any stupider than I am atordinary times.) (2) Visual impressions are greatly intensified andthe eye recovers some of the perceptual innocence of childhood,when the sensum was not immediately and automaticallysubordinated to the concept. Interest in space is diminished andinterest in time falls almost to zero. (3) Though the intellect remains unimpaired andthough perception is enormously improved, the will suffers aprofound change for the worse. The mescalin taker sees no reasonfor doing anything in particular and finds most of the causes forwhich, at ordinary times, he was prepared to act and suffer,profoundly uninteresting. He can't be bothered with them, for thegood reason that he has better things to think about. (4) These better things may be experienced (as Iexperienced them) "out there," or "in here,"or in both worlds, the inner and the outer, simultaneously orsuccessively. That they are better seems to be self-evident toall mescalin takers who come to the drug with a sound liver andan untroubled mind. These effects of mescalin are the sort of effectsyou could expect to follow the administration of a drug havingthe power to impair the efficiency of the cerebral reducingvalve. When the brain runs out of sugar, the undernourished egogrows weak, can't be bothered to undertake the necessary chores,and loses all interest in those spatial and temporalrelationships which mean so much to an organism bent on gettingon in the world. As Mind at Large seeps past the no longerwatertight valve, all kinds of biologically useless things startto happen. In some cases there may be extra-sensory perceptions.Other persons discover a world of visionary beauty. To othersagain is revealed the glory, the infinite value andmeaningfulness of naked existence, of the given, unconceptualizedevent. In the final stage of egolessness there is an"obscure knowledge" that All is in all—that All isactually each. This is as near, I take it, as a finite mind canever come to "perceiving everything that is happeningeverywhere in the universe." In this context, how significant is the enormousheightening, under mescalin, of the perception of color! Forcertain animals it is biologically very important to be able todistinguish certain hues. But beyond the limits of theirutilitarian spectrum, most creatures are completely color blind.Bees, for example, spend most of their time "deflowering thefresh virgins of the spring"; but, as Von Frisch has shown,they can recognize only a very few colors. Man's highly developedcolor sense is a biological luxury—inestimably precious tohim as an intellectual and spiritual being, but unnecessary tohis survival as an animal. To judge by the adjectives which Homerputs into their mouths, the heroes of the Trojan War hardlyexcelled the bees in their capacity to distinguish colors. Inthis respect, at least, mankind's advance has been prodigious. Mescalin raises all colors to a higher power andmakes the percipient aware of innumerable fine shades ofdifference, to which, at ordinary times, he is completely blind.It would seem that, for Mind at Large, the so-called secondarycharacters of things are primary. Unlike Locke, it evidentlyfeels that colors are more important, better worth attending to,than masses, positions and dimensions. Like mescalin takers, manymystics perceive supernaturally brilliant colors, not only withthe inward eye, but even in the objective world around them.Similar reports are made by psychics and sensitives. There arecertain mediums to whom the mescalin taker's brief revelation isa matter, during long periods, of daily and hourly experience. From this long but indispensable excursion into therealm of theory, we may now return to the miraculousfacts—four bamboo chair legs in the middle of a room. LikeWordsworth's daffodils, they brought all manner ofwealth—the gift, beyond price, of a new direct insight intothe very Nature of Things, together with a more modest treasureof understanding in the field, especially, of the arts. A rose is a rose is a rose. But these chair legswere chair legs were St. Michael and all angels. Four or fivehours after the event, when the effects of a cerebral sugarshortage were wearing off, I was taken for a little tour of thecity, which included a visit, towards sundown, to what ismodestly claimed to be the World's Biggest Drug Store. At theback of the W.B.D.S., among the toys, the greeting cards and thecomics, stood a row, surprisingly enough, of art books. I pickedup the first volume that came to hand. It was on Van Gogh, andthe picture at which the book opened was "TheChair"—that astounding portrait of a Ding an Sich,which the mad painter saw, with a kind of adoring terror, andtried to render on his canvas. But it was a task to which thepower even of genius proved wholly inadequate. The chair Van Goghhad seen was obviously the same in essence as the chair I hadseen. But, though incomparably more real than the chairs ofordinary perception, the chair in his picture remained no morethan an unusually expressive symbol of the fact. The fact hadbeen manifested Suchness; this was only an emblem. Such emblemsare sources of true knowledge about the Nature of Things, andthis true knowledge may serve to prepare the mind which acceptsit for immediate insights on its own account. But that is all.However expressive, symbols can never be the things they standfor. It would be interesting, in this context, to make astudy of the works of art available to the great knowers ofSuchness. What sort of pictures did Eckhart look at? Whatsculptures and paintings played a part in the religiousexperience of St. John of the Cross, of Hakuin, of Hui-neng, ofWilliam Law? The questions are beyond my power to answer; but Istrongly suspect that most of the great knowers of Suchness paidvery little attention to art—some refusing to have anythingto do with it at all, others being content with what a criticaleye would regard as second-rate, or even, tenth-rate, works. (Toa person whose transfigured and transfiguring mind can see theAll in every this, the first-rateness or tenth-ratenessof even a religious painting will be a matter of the mostsovereign indifference.) Art, I suppose, is only for beginners,or else for those resolute dead-enders, who have made up theirminds to be content with the ersatz of Suchness, withsymbols rather than with what they signify, with the elegantlycomposed recipe in lieu of actual dinner. I returned the Van Gogh to its rack and picked upthe volume standing next to it. It was a book on Botticelli. Iturned the pages. "The Birth of Venus"-never one of myfavorites. "Mars and Venus," that loveliness sopassionately denounced by poor Ruskin at the height of hislong-drawn sexual tragedy. The marvelously rich and intricate"Calumny of Apelles." And then a somewhat less familiarand not very good picture, "Judith." My attention wasarrested and I gazed in fascination, not at the pale neuroticheroine or her attendant, not at the victim's hairy head or thevernal landscape in the background, but at the purplish silk ofJudith's pleated bodice and long wind-blown skirts. This was something I had seen before-seen that verymorning, between the flowers and the furniture, when I lookeddown by chance, and went on passionately staring by choice, at myown crossed legs. Those folds in the trousers—what alabyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture ofthe gray flannel—how rich, how deeply, mysteriouslysumptuous! And here they were again, in Botticelli's picture. Civilized human beings wear clothes, thereforethere can be no portraiture, no mythological or historicalstorytelling without representations of folded textiles. Butthough it may account for the origins, mere tailoring can neverexplain the luxuriant development of drapery as a major theme ofall the plastic arts. Artists, it is obvious, have always loveddrapery for its own sake—-or, rather, for their own. Whenyou paint or carve drapery, you are painting or carving formswhich, for all practical purposes, are non-representational-thekind of unconditioned forms on which artists even in the mostnaturalistic tradition like to let themselves go. In the averageMadonna or Apostle the strictly human, fully representationalelement accounts for about ten per cent of the whole. All therest consists of many colored variations on the inexhaustibletheme of crumpled wool or linen. And these non-representationalnine-tenths of a Madonna or an Apostle may be just as importantqualitatively as they are in quantity. Very often they set thetone of the whole work of art, they state the key in which thetheme is being rendered, they express the mood, the temperament,the attitude to life of the artist. Stoical serenity revealsitself in the smooth surfaces, the broad untortured folds ofPiero's draperies. Torn between fact and wish, between cynicismand idealism, Bernini tempers the all but caricaturalverisimilitude of his faces with enormous sartorial abstractions,which are the embodiment, in stone or bronze, of the everlastingcommonplaces of rhetoric—the heroism, the holiness, thesublimity to which mankind perpetually aspires, for the most partin vain. And here are El Greco's disquietingly visceral skirtsand mantles; here are the sharp, twisting, flame-like folds inwhich Cosimo Tura clothes his figures: in the first, traditionalspirituality breaks down into a nameless physiological yearning;in the second, there writhes an agonized sense of the world'sessential strangeness and hostility. Or consider Watteau; his menand women play lutes, get ready for balls and harlequinades,embark, on velvet lawns and under noble trees, for the Cythera ofevery lover's dream; their enormous melancholy and the flayed,excruciating sensibility of their creator find expression, not inthe actions recorded, not in the gestures and the facesportrayed, but in the relief and texture of their taffeta skirts,their satin capes and doublets. Not an inch of smooth surfacehere, not a moment of peace or confidence, only a silkenwilderness of countless tiny pleats and wrinkles, with anincessant modulation—inner uncertainty rendered with theperfect assurance of a master hand—of tone into tone, of oneindeterminate color into another. In life, man proposes, Goddisposes. In the plastic arts the proposing is done by thesubject matter; that which disposes is ultimately the artist'stemperament, proximately (at least in portraiture, history andgenre) the carved or painted drapery. Between them, these two maydecree that a f�te galante shall move to tears, that acrucifixion shall be serene to the point of cheerfulness, that astigmatization shall be almost intolerably sexy, that thelikeness of a prodigy of female brainlessness (I am thinking nowof Ingres' incomparable Mme. Moitessier) shall express theausterest, the most uncompromising intellectuality. But this is not the whole story. Draperies, as Ihad now discovered, are much more than devices for theintroduction of non-representational forms into naturalisticpaintings and sculptures. What the rest of us see only under theinfluence of mescalin, the artist is congenitally equipped to seeall the time. His perception is not limited to what isbiologically or socially useful. A little of the knowledgebelonging to Mind at Large oozes past the reducing valve of brainand ego, into his consciousness. It is a knowledge of theintrinsic significance of every existent. For the artist as forthe mescalin taker draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand insome peculiarly expressive way for the unfathomable mystery ofpure being. More even than the chair, though less perhaps thanthose wholly supernatural flowers, the folds of my gray flanneltrousers were charged with "is-ness." To what they owedthis privileged status, I cannot say. Is it, perhaps, because theforms of folded drapery are so strange and dramatic that theycatch the eye and in this way force the miraculous fact of sheerexistence upon the attention? Who knows? What is important isless the reason for the experience than the experience itself.Poring over Judith's skirts, there in the World's Biggest DrugStore, I knew that Botticelli—and not Botticelli alone, butmany others too-had looked at draperies with the sametransfigured and transfiguring eyes as had been mine thatmorning. They had seen the Istigkeit, the Allness andInfinity of folded cloth and had done their best to render it inpaint or stone. Necessarily, of course, without success. For theglory and the wonder of pure existence belong to another order,beyond the Power of even the highest art to express. But inJudith's skirt I could clearly see what, if I had been a painterof genius, I might have made of my old gray flannels. Not much,heaven knows, in comparison with the reality, but enough todelight generation after generation of beholders, enough to makethem understand at least a little of the true significance ofwhat, in our pathetic imbecility, we call "mere things"and disregard in favor of television. "This is how one ought to see," I keptsaying as I looked down at my trousers, or glanced at the jeweledbooks in the shelves, at the legs of my infinitely more thanVan-Goghian chair. "This is how one ought to see, how thingsreally are." And yet there were reservations. For if onealways saw like this, one would never want to do anything else.Just looking, just being the divine Not-self of flower, of book,of chair, of flannel. That would be enough. But in that case whatabout other people? What about human relations? In the recordingof that morning's conversations I find the question constantlyrepeated, "What about human relations?" How could onereconcile this timeless bliss of seeing as one ought to see withthe temporal duties of doing what one ought to do and feeling asone ought to feel? "One ought to be able," I said,"to see these trousers as infinitely important and humanbeings as still more infinitely important." One ought-but inpractice it seemed to be impossible. This participation in themanifest glory of things left no room, so to speak, for theordinary, the necessary concerns of human existence, above allfor concerns involving persons. For Persons are selves and, inone respect at least, I was now a Not-self, simultaneouslyperceiving and being the Not-self of the things around me. Tothis new-born Not-self, the behavior, the appearance, the verythought of the self it had momentarily ceased to be, and of otherselves, its one-time fellows, seemed not indeed distasteful (fordistastefulness was not one of the categories in terms of which Iwas thinking), but enormously irrelevant. Compelled by theinvestigator to analyze and report on what I was doing (and how Ilonged to be left alone with Eternity in a flower, Infinity infour chair legs and the Absolute in the folds of a pair offlannel trousers!), I realized that I was deliberately avoidingthe eyes of those who were with me in the room, deliberatelyrefraining from being too much aware of them. One was my wife,the other a man I respected and greatly liked; but both belongedto the world from which, for the moment, mescalin had deliveredme "e world of selves, of time, of moral judgments andutilitarian considerations, the world (and it was this aspect ofhuman life which I wished, above all else, to forget) ofself-assertion, of cocksureness, of overvalued words andidolatrously worshipped notions. At this stage of the proceedings I was handed alarge colored reproduction of the well-known self-portrait byC�zanne—the head and shoulders of a man in a large strawhat, red-cheeked, red-lipped, with rich black whiskers and a darkunfriendly eye. It is a magnificent painting; but it was not as apainting that I now saw it. For the head promptly took on a thirddimension and came to life as a small goblin-like man looking outthrough a window in the page before me. I started to laugh. Andwhen they asked me why, "What pretensions!" I keptrepeating. "Who on earth does he think he is?" Thequestion was not addressed to C�zanne in particular, but to thehuman species at large. Who did they all think they were? "It's like Arnold Bennett in theDolomites," I said, suddenly remembering a scene, happilyimmortalized in a snapshot, of A.B., some four or five yearsbefore his death, toddling along a wintry road at Cortinad'Ampezzo. Around him lay the virgin snow; in the background wasa more than gothic aspiration of red crags. And there was dear,kind, unhappy A.B., consciously overacting the role of hisfavorite character in fiction, himself, the Card in person. Therehe went, toddling slowly in the bright Alpine sunshine, histhumbs in the armholes of a yellow waistcoat which bulged, alittle lower down, with the graceful curve of a Regency bowwindow at Brighten—his head thrown back as though to aimsome stammered utterance, howitzer-like, at the blue dome ofheaven. What he actually said, I have forgotten; but what hiswhole manner, air and posture fairly shouted was, "I'm asgood as those damned mountains." And in some ways, ofcourse, he was infinitely better; but not, as he knew very well,in the way his favorite character in fiction liked to imagine. Successfully (whatever that may mean) orunsuccessfully, we all overact the part of our favorite characterin fiction. And the fact, the almost infinitely unlikely fact, ofactually being C�zanne makes no difference. For the consummatepainter, with his little pipeline to Mind at Large by-passing thebrain valve and ego-filter, was also and just as genuinely thiswhiskered goblin with the unfriendly eye. For relief I turned back to the folds in mytrousers. "This is how one ought to see," I repeatedyet again. And I might have added,' 'These are the sort of thingsone ought to look at." Things without pretensions, satisfiedto be merely themselves, sufficient in their Suchness, not actinga part, not trying, insanely, to go it alone, in isolation fromthe Dharma-Body, in Luciferian defiance of the grace of god. "The nearest approach to this," I said,"would be a Vermeer." Yes, a Vermeer. For that mysterious artist wastruly gifted-with the vision that perceives the Dharma-Body asthe hedge at the bottom of the garden, with the talent to renderas much of that vision as the limitations of human capacitypermit, and with the prudence to confine himself in his paintingsto the more manageable aspects of reality; for though Vermeerrepresented human beings, he was always a painter of still life.C�zanne, who told his female sitters to do their best to looklike apples, tried to paint portraits in the same spirit. But hispippin-like women are more nearly related to Plato's Ideas thanto the Dharma-Body in the hedge. They are Eternity and Infinityseen, not in sand or flower, but in the abstractions of some verysuperior brand of geometry. Vermeer never asked his girls to looklike apples. On the contrary, he insisted on their being girls tothe very limit—but always with the proviso that they refrainfrom behaving girlishly. They might sit or quietly stand butnever giggle, never display self-consciousness, never say theirprayers or pine for absent sweethearts, never gossip, never gazeenviously at other women's babies, never dirt, never love or hateor work. In the act of doing any of these things they woulddoubtless become more intensely themselves, but would cease, forthat very reason, to manifest their divine essential Not-self. InBlake's phrase, the doors of Vermeer's perception were onlypartially cleansed. A single panel had become almost perfectlytransparent; the rest of the door was still muddy. The essentialNot-self could be perceived very clearly in things and in livingcreatures on the hither side of good and evil. In human beings itwas visible only when they were in repose, their mindsuntroubled, their bodies motionless. In these circumstancesVermeer could see Suchness in all its heavenly beauty—couldsee and, in some small measure, render it—in a subtle andsumptuous still life. Vermeer is undoubtedly the greatest painterof human still lives. But there have been others, for example,Vermeer's French contemporaries, the Le Nain brothers. They setout, I suppose, to be genre painters; but what they actuallyproduced was a series of human still lives, in which theircleansed perception of the infinite significance of all things isrendered not, as with Vermeer, by subtle enrichment of color andtexture, but by a heightened clarity, an obsessive distinctnessof form, within an austere, almost monochromatic tonality. In ourown day we have had Vuillard, the painter, at his best, ofunforgettably splendid pictures of the Dharma-Body manifested ina bourgeois bedroom, of the Absolute blazing away in the midst ofsome stockbroker's family in a suburban garden, taking tea. Ce qui fait que I'ancien bandagiste renie Le comptoir dont le faste all�chait les passants, C'est son jardin d'Auteuil, o�, veufs de tout encens, Les Zinnias ont l'air d'�tre en t�le vernie. For Laurent Taillade the spectacle was merelyobscene. But if the retired rubber goods merchant had sat stillenough, Vuillard would have seen in him only the Dharma-Body,would have painted, in the zinnias, the goldfish pool, thevilla's Moorish tower and Chinese lanterns, a corner of Edenbefore the Fall. But meanwhile my question remained unanswered. Howwas this cleansed perception to be reconciled with a properconcern with human relations, with the necessary chores andduties, to say nothing of charity and practical compassion? Theage-old debate between the actives and the contemplatives wasbeing renewed—renewed, so far as I was concerned, with anunprecedented poignancy. For until this morning I had knowncontemplation only in its humbler, its more ordinaryforms—as discursive thinking; as a rapt absorption in poetryor painting or music; as a patient waiting upon thoseinspirations, without which even the prosiest writer cannot hopeto accomplish anything; as occasional glimpses, in Nature, ofWordsworth's "something far more deeply interfused"; assystematic silence leading, sometimes, to hints of an"obscure knowledge." But now I knew contemplation atits height. At its height, but not yet in its fullness. For inits fullness the way of Mary includes the way of Martha andraises it, so to speak, to its own higher power. Mescalin opensup the way of Mary, but shuts the door on that of Martha. Itgives access to contemplation—but to a contemplation that isincompatible with action and even with the will to action, thevery thought of action. In the intervals between his revelationsthe mescalin taker is apt to feel that, though in one wayeverything is supremely as it should be, in another there issomething wrong. His problem is essentially the same as thatwhich confronts the quietist, the arhat and, on another level,the landscape painter and the painter of human still lives.Mescalin can never solve that problem; it can only pose it,apocalyptically, for those to whom it had never before presenteditself. The full and final solution can be found only by thosewho are prepared to implement the right kind of Weltanschauungby means of the right kind of behavior and the right kind ofconstant and unstrained alertness. Over against the quietiststands the active-contemplative, the saint, the man who, inEckhart's phrase, is ready to come down from the seventh heavenin order to bring a cup of water to his sick brother. Overagainst the arhat, retreating from appearances into anentirely transcendental Nirvana, stands the Bodhisattva, for whomSuchness and the world of contingencies are one, and for whoseboundless compassion every one of those contingencies is anoccasion not only for transfiguring insight, but also for themost practical charity. And in the universe of art, over againstVermeer and the other Painters of human still lives, over againstthe masters of Chinese and Japanese landscape painting, overagainst Constable and Turner, against Sisley and Seurat andC�zanne, stands the all-inclusive art of Rembrandt. These areenormous names, inaccessible eminences. For myself, on thismemorable May morning, I could only be grateful for an experiencewhich had shown me, more clearly than I had ever seen it before,the true nature of the challenge and the completely liberatingresponse. Let me add, before we leave this subject, thatthere is no form of contemplation, even the most quietistic,which is without its ethical values. Half at least of allmorality is negative and consists in keeping out of mischief. TheLord's Prayer is less than fifty words long, and six of thosewords are devoted to asking God not to lead us into temptation.The one-sided contemplative leaves undone many things that heought to do; but to make up for it, he refrains from doing a hostof things he ought not to do. The sum of evil, Pascal remarked,would be much diminished if men could only learn to sit quietlyin their rooms. The contemplative whose perception has beencleansed does not have to stay in his room. He can go about hisbusiness, so completely satisfied to see and be a part of thedivine Order of Things that he will never even be tempted toindulge in what Traherne called "the dirty Devices of theworld." When we feel ourselves to be sole heirs of theuniverse, when "the sea flows in our veins ... and the starsare our jewels," when all things are perceived as infiniteand holy, what motive can we have for covetousness orself-assertion, for the pursuit of power or the drearier forms ofpleasure? Contemplatives are not likely to become gamblers, orprocurers, or drunkards; they do not as a rule preachintolerance, or make war; do not find it necessary to rob,swindle or grind the faces of the poor. And to these enormousnegative virtues we may add another which, though hard to define,is both positive and important. The arhat and the quietistmay not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if theypractice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports ofanother, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practiceit in the height, they will become conduits through which somebeneficent influence can how out of that other country into aworld of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. Meanwhile I had turned, at the investigator'srequest, from the portrait of C�zanne to what was going on,inside my head, when I shut my eyes. This time, the inscape wascuriously unrewarding. The field of vision was filled withbrightly colored, constantly changing structures that seemed tobe made of plastic or enameled tin. "Cheap," I commented. "Trivial. Likethings in a five-and-ten." And all this shoddiness existed in a closed,cramped universe. "It's as though one were below decks in aship," I said. "A five-and-ten-cent ship." And as I looked, it became very clear that thisfive-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connected with humanpretensions, with the portrait of C�zanne, with A.B. among theDolomites overacting his favorite character in fiction. Thissuffocating interior of a dime-store ship was my own personalself; these gimcrack mobiles of tin and plastic were my personalcontributions to the universe. I felt the lesson to be salutary, but was sorry,none the less, that it had had to be administered at this momentand in this form. As a rule the mescalin taker discovers an innerworld as manifestly a datum, as self-evidently "infinite andholy," as that transfigured outer world which I had seenwith my eyes open. From the first, my own case had beendifferent. Mescalin had endowed me temporarily with the power tosee things with my eyes shut; but it could not, or at least onthis occasion did not, reveal an inscape remotely comparable tomy flowers or chair or flannels "out there." What ithad allowed me to perceive inside was not the Dharma-Body, inimages, but my own mind; not Suchness, but a set ofsymbols—in other words, a homemade substitute for Suchness. Most visualizers are transformed by mescalin intovisionaries. Some of them—and they are Perhaps more numerousthan is generally supposed—require no transformation; theyare visionaries all the time. The mental species to which Blakebelonged is fairly widely distributed even in theurban-industrial societies of the present day. The poet-artist'suniqueness does not consist in the fact that (to quote from his DescriptiveCatalogue) he actually saw "those wonderfuloriginals called in the Sacred Scriptures the Cherubim." Itdoes not consist in the fact that "these wonderful originalsseen in my visions, were some of them one hundred feet in height... all containing mythological and recondite meaning." Itconsists solely in his ability to render, in words or (somewhatless successfully) in line and color, some hint at least of a notexcessively uncommon experience. The untalented visionary mayperceive an inner reality no less tremendous, beautiful andsignificant than the world beheld by Blake; but he lacksaltogether the ability to express, in literary or plasticsymbols, what he has seen. From the records of religion and the survivingmonuments of poetry and the plastic arts it is very plain that,at most times and in most places, men have attached moreimportance to the inscape than to objective existents, have feltthat what they saw with their eyes shut possessed a spirituallyhigher significance than what they saw with their eyes open. Thereason? Familiarity breeds contempt, and how to survive is aproblem ranging in urgency from the chronically tedious to theexcruciating. The outer world is what we wake up to every morningof our lives, is the place where, willy-nilly, we must try tomake our living. In the inner world there is neither work normonotony. We visit it only in dreams and musings, and itsstrangeness is such that we never find the same world on twosuccessive occasions. What wonder, then, if human beings in theirsearch for the divine have generally preferred to look within!Generally, but not always. In their art no less than in theirreligion, the Taoists and the Zen Buddhists looked beyond visionsto the Void, and through the Void at "the ten thousandthings" of objective reality. Because of their doctrine ofthe Word made flesh, Christians should have been able, from thefirst, to adopt a similar attitude towards the universe aroundthem. But because of the doctrine of the Fall, they found it veryhard to do so. As recently as three hundred years ago anexpression of thoroughgoing world denial and even worldcondemnation was both orthodox and comprehensible. "Weshould feel wonder at nothing at all in Nature except only theIncarnation of Christ." In the seventeenth century,Lallemant's phrase seemed to make sense. Today it has the ring ofmadness. In China the rise of landscape painting to the rankof a major art form took place about a thousand, in Japan aboutsix hundred and in Europe about three hundred, years ago. Theequation of Dharma-Body with hedge was made by those Zen Masters,who wedded Taoist naturalism with Buddhist transcendentalism. Itwas, therefore, only in the Far East that landscape paintersconsciously regarded their art as religious. In the Westreligious painting was a matter of portraying sacred personages,of illustrating hallowed texts. Landscape painters regardedthemselves as secularists. Today we recognize in Seurat one ofthe supreme masters of what may be called mystical landscapepainting. And yet this man who was able, more effectively thanany other, to render the One in the many, became quite indignantwhen somebody praised him for the "poetry" of his work.'1 merely apply the System," he protested. In other words hewas merely a pointilliste and, in his own eyes, nothingelse. A similar anecdote is told of John Constable. One daytowards the end of his life, Blake met Constable at Hampstead andwas shown one of the younger artist's sketches. In spite of hiscontempt for naturalistic art, the old visionary knew a goodthing when be saw it-except of course, when it was by Rubens.'This is not drawing," he cried, "this isinspiration!" "I had meant it to be drawing," wasConstable's characteristic answer. Both men were right. It wasdrawing, precise and veracious, and at the same time it wasinspiration —inspiration of an order at least as high asBlake's. The pine trees on the Heath had actually been seen asidentical with the Dharma-Body. The sketch was a rendering,necessarily imperfect but still profoundly impressive, of what acleansed perception had revealed to the open eyes of a greatpainter. From a contemplation, in the tradition of Wordsworth andWhitman, of the Dharma- Body as hedge, and from visions, such asBlake's, of the "wonderful originals" within the mind,contemporary poets have retreated into an investigation of thepersonal, as opposed to the more than personal, subconscious andto a rendering, in highly abstract terms, not of the given,objective fact, but of mere scientific and theological notions.And something similar has happened in the held of painting, wherewe have witnessed a general retreat from landscape, thepredominant art form of the nineteenth century. This retreat fromlandscape has not been into that other, inner divine Datum, withwhich most of the traditional schools of the past were concerned,that Archetypal World, where men have always found the rawmaterials of myth and religion. No, it has been a retreat fromthe outward Datum into the personal subconscious, into a mentalworld more squalid and more tightly closed than even the world ofconscious personality. These contraptions of tin and highlycolored plastic —where had I seen them before? In everypicture gallery that exhibits the latest in nonrepresentationalart. And now someone produced a phonograph and put arecord on the turntable. I listened with pleasure, butexperienced nothing comparable to my seen apocalypses of flowersor flannel. Would a naturally gifted musician hear therevelations which, for me, had been exclusively visual? It wouldbe interesting to make the experiment. Meanwhile, though nottransfigured, though retaining its normal quality and intensity,the music contributed not a little to my understanding of whathad happened to me and of the wider problems which thosehappenings had raised. Instrumental music, oddly enough, left me rathercold. Mozart's C-Minor Piano Concerto was interrupted after thefirst movement, and a recording of some madrigals by Gesualdotook its place. "These voices," I said appreciatively,"these voices— they're a kind of bridge back to thehuman world." And a bridge they remained even while singing themost startlingly chromatic of the mad prince's compositions.Through the uneven phrases of the madrigals, the music pursuedits course, never sticking to the same key for two bars together.In Gesualdo, that fantastic character out of a Webster melodrama,psychological disintegration had exaggerated, had pushed to theextreme limit, a tendency inherent in modal as opposed to fullytonal music. The resulting works sounded as though they mighthave been written by the later Schoenberg. "And yet," I felt myself constrained tosay, as I listened to these strange products of aCounter-Reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval artform, "and yet it does not matter that he's all in bits. Thewhole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order,is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevailseven in the disintegration. The totality is present even in thebroken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in acompletely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled into a senseof false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order.You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimateorder. So in a certain sense disintegration may have itsadvantages. But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous.Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos .. ." From Gesualdo's madrigals we jumped, across a gulfof three centuries, to Alban Berg and the Lyric Suite. "This" I announced in advance, "isgoing to be hell." But, as it turned out, I was wrong. Actually themusic sounded rather funny. Dredged up from the personalsubconscious, agony succeeded twelve-tone agony; but what struckme was only the essential incongruity between a psychologicaldisintegration even completer than Gesualdo's and the prodigiousresources, in talent and technique, employed in its expression. "Isn't he sorry for himself!" I commentedwith a derisive lack of sympathy. And then, "Katzenmusik—learned Katzenmusik." And finally, after a few moreminutes of the anguish, "Who cares what his feelings are?Why can't he pay attention to something else?" As a criticism of what is undoubtedly a veryremarkable work, it was unfair and inadequate-but not, I think,irrelevant. I cite it for what it is worth and because that ishow, in a state of pure contemplation, I reacted to the LyricSuite. When it was over, the investigator suggested a walkin the garden. I was willing; and though my body seemed to havedissociated itself almost completely from my mind—or, to bemore accurate, though my awareness of the transfigured outerworld was no longer accompanied by an awareness of my physicalorganism—I found myself able to get up, open the Frenchwindow and walk out with only a minimum of hesitation. It wasodd, of course, to feel that "I" was not the same asthese arms and legs "out there," as this whollyobjective trunk and neck and even head. It was odd; but one soongot used to it. And anyhow the body seemed perfectly well able tolook after itself. In reality, of course, it always does lookafter itself. All that the conscious ego can do is to formulatewishes, which are then carried out by forces which it controlsvery little and understands not at all. When it does anythingmore—when it tries too hard, for example, when it worries,when it becomes apprehensive about the future—it lowers theeffectiveness of those forces and may even cause the devitalizedbody to fall ill. In my present state, awareness was not referredto as ego; it was, so to speak, on its own. This meant that thephysiological intelligence controlling the body was also on itsown. For the moment that interfering neurotic who, in wakinghours, tries to run the show, was blessedly out of the way. From the French window I walked out under a kind ofpergola covered in part by a climbing rose tree, in part bylaths, one inch wide with half an inch of space between them. Thesun was shining and the shadows of the laths made a zebra-likepattern on the ground and across the seat and back of a gardenchair, which was standing at this end of the pergola. Thatchair—shall I ever forget it? Where the shadows fell on thecanvas upholstery, stripes of a deep but glowing indigoalternated with stripes of an incandescence so intensely brightthat it was hard to believe that they could be made of anythingbut blue fire. For what seemed an immensely long time I gazedwithout knowing, even without wishing to know, what it was thatconfronted me. At any other time I would have seen a chair barredwith alternate light and shade. Today the percept had swallowedup the concept. I was so completely absorbed in looking, sothunderstruck by what I actually saw, that I could not be awareof anything else. Garden furniture, laths, sunlight,shadow—these were no more than names and notions, mereverbalizations, for utilitarian or scientific purposes, after theevent. The event was this succession of azure furnace doorsseparated by gulfs of unfathomable gentian. It was inexpressiblywonderful, wonderful to the point, almost, of being terrifying.And suddenly I had an inkling of what it must feel like to bemad. Schizophrenia has its heavens as well as its hells andpurgatories. I remember what an old friend, dead these manyyears, told me about his mad wife. One day in the early stages ofthe disease, when she still had her lucid intervals he had goneto talk to her about their children. She listened for a time,then cut him short. How could he bear to waste his time on acouple of absent children, when all that really mattered, hereand now, was the unspeakable beauty of the patterns he made, inthis brown tweed jacket, every time he moved his arms? Alas, thisParadise of cleansed perception, of pure one-sided contemplation,was not to endure. The blissful intermissions became rarer,became briefer, until finally there were no more of them; therewas only horror. Most takers of mescalin experience only theheavenly part of schizophrenia. The drug brings hell andpurgatory only to those who have had a recent case of jaundice,or who suffer from periodical depressions or a chronic anxiety.If, like the other drugs of remotely comparable power, mescalinwere notoriously toxic, the taking of it would be enough, ofitself, to cause anxiety. But the reasonably healthy person knowsin advance that, so far as he is concerned, mescalin iscompletely innocuous, that its effects will pass off after eightor ten hours, leaving no hangover and consequently no craving fora renewal of the dose. Fortified by this knowledge, he embarksupon the experiment without fear—in other words, without anydisposition to convert an unprecedentedly strange and other thanhuman experience into something appalling, something actuallydiabolical. Confronted by a chair which looked like the LastJudgment—or, to be more accurate, by a Last Judgment which,after a long time and with considerable difficulty, I recognizedas a chair—I found myself all at once on the brink of panic.This, I suddenly felt, was going too far. Too far, even thoughthe going was into intenser beauty, deeper significance. Thefear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of being overwhelmed, ofdisintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a mind,accustomed to living most of the time in a cosy world of symbols,could possibly bear. The literature of religious experienceabounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming thosewho have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestationof the Mysterium tremendum. In theological language,this fear is due to the in- compatibility between man's egotismand the divine purity, between man's self-aggravated separatenessand the infinity of God. Following Boehme and William Law, we maysay that, by unregenerate souls, the divine Light at its fullblaze can be apprehended only as a burning, purgatorial fire. Analmost identical doctrine is to be found in The Tibetan Bookof the Dead, where the departed soul is described asshrinking in agony from the Pure Light of the Void, and even fromthe lesser, tempered Lights, in order to rush headlong into thecomforting darkness of selfhood as a reborn human being, or evenas a beast, an unhappy ghost, a denizen of hell. Anything ratherthan the burning brightness of unmitigated Reality—anything! The schizophrenic is a soul not merelyunregenerate, but desperately sick into the bargain. His sicknessconsists in the inability to take refuge from inner and outerreality (as the sane person habitually does) in the homemadeuniverse of common sense—the strictly human world of usefulnotions, shared symbols and socially acceptable conventions. Theschizophrenic is like a man permanently under the influence ofmescalin, and therefore unable to shut off the experience of areality which he is not holy enough to live with, which he cannotexplain away because it is the most stubborn of primary facts,and which, because it never permits him to look at the world withmerely human eyes, scares him into interpreting its unremittingstrangeness, its burning intensity of significance, as themanifestations of human or even cosmic malevolence, calling forthe most desperate countermeasures, from murderous violence atone end of the scale to catatonia, or psychological suicide, atthe other. And once embarked upon the downward, the infernalroad, one would never be able to stop. That, now, was only tooobvious. "If you started in the wrong way," I saidin answer to the investigator's questions, "everything thathappened would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It wouldall be self-validating, You couldn't draw a breath withoutknowing it was part of the plot." "So you think you know where madnesslies?" My answer was a convinced and heartfelt,"Yes." "And you couldn't control it?" "No I couldn't control it. If one began withfear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on tothe conclusion." "Would you be able," my wife asked,"to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of TheDead calls the Clear Light?" I was doubtful. "Would it keep the evil away, if you couldhold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?" I considered the question for some time."Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps Icould—but only if there were somebody there to tell me aboutthe Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point,I suppose, of the Tibetan ritual—someone sitting there allthe time and telling you what's what." After listening to the record of this part of theexperiment, I took down my copy of Evans-Wentz's edition of TheTibetan Book of the Dead, and opened at random. "Onobly born, let not thy mind be distracted." That was theproblem—to remain undistracted. Undistracted by the memoryof past sins, by imagined pleasure, by the bitter aftertaste ofold wrongs and humiliations, by all the fears and hates andcravings that ordinarily eclipse the Light. What those Buddhistmonks did for the dying and the dead, might not the modernpsychiatrist do for the insane? Let there be a voice to assurethem, by day and even while they are asleep, that in spite of allthe terror, all the bewilderment and confusion, the ultimateReality remains unshakably itself and is of the same substance asthe inner light of even the most cruelly tormented mind. By meansof such devices as recorders, clock-controlled switches, publicaddress systems and pillow speakers it should be very easy tokeep the inmates of even an understaffed institution constantlyreminded of this primordial fact. Perhaps a few of the lost soulsmight in this way be helped to win some measure of control overthe universe—at once beautiful and appalling, but alwaysother than human, always totally incomprehensible-in which theyfind themselves condemned to live. None too soon, I was steered away from thedisquieting splendors of my garden chair. Drooping in greenparabolas from the hedge, the ivy fronds shone with a kind ofglassy, jade-like radiance. A moment later a clump of Red HotPokers, in full bloom, had exploded into my field of vision. Sopassionately alive that they seemed to be standing on the verybrink of utterance, the flowers strained upwards into the blue.Like the chair under the laths, they protected too much. I lookeddown at the leaves and discovered a cavernous intricacy of themost delicate green lights and shadows, pulsing withundecipherable mystery. Roses : The flowers are easy to paint, The leaves difficult. Shiki's haiku (which I quote in R. H.Blyth's translation) expresses, by indirection, exactly what Ithen felt— the excessive, the too obvious glory of theflowers, as contrasted with the subtler miracle of their foliage. We walked out into the street. A large pale blueauto- mobile was standing at the curb. At the sight of it, I wassuddenly overcome by enormous merriment. What complacency, whatan absurd self-satisfaction beamed from those bulging surfaces ofglossiest enamel! Man had created the thing in his ownimage—or rather in the image of his favorite character infiction. I laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks. We re-entered the house. A meal had been prepared.Somebody, who was not yet identical with myself, fell to withravenous appetite. From a considerable distance and without muchinterest, I looked on. When the meal had been eaten, we got into the carand went for a drive. The effects of the mescalin were already onthe decline: but the flowers in the gardens still trembled on thebrink of being supernatural, the pepper trees and carobs alongthe side streets still manifestly belonged to some sacred grove.Eden alternated with Dodona. Yggdrasil with the mystic Rose. Andthen, abruptly, we were at an intersection, waiting to crossSunset Boulevard. Before us the cars were rolling by in a steadystream—thousands of them, all bright and shiny like anadvertiser's dream and each more ludicrous than the last. Onceagain I was convulsed with laughter. The Red Sea of traffic parted at last, and wecrossed into another oasis of trees and lawns and roses. In a fewminutes we had climbed to a vantage point in the hills, and therewas the city spread out beneath us. Rather disappointingly, itlooked very like the city I had seen on other occasions. So faras I was concerned, transfiguration was proportional to distance.The nearer, the more divinely other. This vast, dim panorama washardly different from itself. We drove on, and so long as we remained in thehills, with view succeeding distant view, significance was at itseveryday level, well below transfiguration point. The magic beganto work again only when we turned down into a new suburb and weregliding between two rows of houses. Here, in spite of thepeculiar hideousness of the architecture, there were renewals oftranscendental otherness, hints of the morning's heaven. Brickchimneys and green composition roofs glowed in the sunshine, likefragments of the New Jerusalem. And all at once I saw what Guardihad seen and (with what incomparable skill) had so often renderedin his paintings—a stucco wall with a shadow slanting acrossit, blank but unforgettably beautiful, empty but charged with allthe meaning and the mystery of existence. The revelation dawnedand was gone again within a fraction of a second. The car hadmoved on; time was uncovering another manifestation of theeternal Suchness. "Within sameness there is difference. Butthat difference should be different from sameness is in no wisethe intention of all the Buddhas. Their intention is bothtotality and differentiation." This bank of red and whitegeraniums, for example—it was entirely different from thatstucco wall a hundred yards up the road. But the"is-ness" of both was the same, the eternal quality oftheir transience was the same. An hour later, with ten more miles and the visit tothe World's Biggest Drug Store safely behind us, we were back athome, and I had returned to that reassuring but profoundlyunsatisfactory state known as "being in one's rightmind." That humanity at large will ever be able todispense with Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely. Most menand women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best somonotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longingto transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and hasalways been one of the principal appetites of the soul. Art andreligion, carnivals and saturnalia, dancing and listening tooratory—all these have served, in H. G. Wells's phrase, asDoors in the Wall. And for private, far everyday use there havealways been chemical intoxicants. All the vegetable sedatives andnarcotics, all the euphorics that grow on trees, thehallucinogens that ripen in berries or can be squeezed fromroots—all, without exception, have been known andsystematically used by human beings from time immemorial. And tothese natural modifiers of consciousness modern science has addedits quota of synthetics—chloral, for example, andbenzedrine, the bromides and the barbiturates. Most of these modifiers of consciousness cannot nowbe taken except under doctor's orders, or else illegally and atconsiderable risk. For unrestricted use the West has permittedonly alcohol and tobacco. All the other chemical Doors in theWall are labeled Dope, and their unauthorized takers are Fiends. We now spend a good deal more on drink and smokethan we spend on education. This, of course, is not surprising.The urge to escape from selfhood and the environment is in almosteveryone almost all the time. The urge to do something for theyoung is strong only in parents, and in them only for the fewyears during which their children go to school. Equallyunsurprising is the current attitude towards drink and smoke. Inspite of the growing army of hopeless alcoholics, in spite of thehundreds of thousands of persons annually maimed or killed bydrunken drivers, popular comedians still crack jokes aboutalcohol and its addicts. And in spite of the evidence linkingcigarettes with lung cancer, practically everybody regardstobacco smoking as being hardly less normal and natural thaneating. From the point of view of the rationalist utilitarianthis may seem odd. For the historian, it is exactly what youwould expect. A firm conviction of the material reality of Hellnever prevented medieval Christians from doing what theirambition, lust or covetousness suggested. Lung cancer, trafficaccidents and the millions of miserable and misery-creatingalcoholics are facts even more certain than was, in Dante's day,the fact of the Inferno. But all such facts are remote andunsubstantial compared with the near, felt fact of a craving,here and now, for release or sedation, for a drink or a smoke. Ours is the age, among other things, of theautomobile and of rocketing population. Alcohol is incompatiblewith safety on the roads, and its production, like that oftobacco, condemns to virtual sterility many millions of acres ofthe most fertile soil. The problems raised by alcohol and tobaccocannot, it goes without saying, be solved by prohibition. Theuniversal and ever-present urge to self-transcendence is not tobe abolished by slamming the currently popular Doors in the Wall.The only reasonable policy is to open other, better doors in thehope of inducing men and women to exchange their old bad habitsfor new and less harmful ones. Some of these other, better doorswill be social and technological in nature, others religious orpsychological, others dietetic, educational, athletic. But theneed for frequent chemical vacations from intolerable selfhoodand repulsive surroundings will undoubtedly remain. What isneeded is a new drug which will relieve and console our sufferingspecies without doing more harm in the long run than it does goodin the short. Such a drug must be potent in minute doses andsynthesizable. If it does not possess these qualities, itsproduction, like that of wine, beer, spirits and tobacco willinterfere with the raising of indispensable food and fibers. Itmust be less toxic than opium or cocaine, less likely to produceundesirable social consequences than alcohol or the barbiturates,less inimical to heart and lungs than the tars and nicotine ofcigarettes. And, on the positive side, it should produce changesin consciousness more interesting, more intrinsically valuablethan mere sedation or dreaminess, delusions of omnipotence orrelease from inhibition. To most people, mescalin is almost completelyinnocuous. Unlike alcohol, it does not drive the taker into thekind of uninhibited action which results in brawls, crimes ofviolence and traffic accidents. A man under the influence ofmescalin quietly minds his own business. Moreover, the businesshe minds is an experience of the most enlightening kind, whichdoes not have to be paid for (and this is surely important) by acompensatory hangover. Of the long-range consequences of regularmescalin taking we know very little. The Indians who consumepeyote buttons do not seem to be physically or morally degradedby the habit. However, the available evidence is still scarce andsketchy.* Althoughobviously superior to cocaine, opium, alcohol and tobacco,mescalin is not yet the ideal drug. Along with the happilytransfigured majority of mescalin takers there is a minority thatfinds in the drug only hell or purgatory. Moreover, for a drugthat is to be used, like alcohol, for general consumption, itseffects last for an inconveniently long time. But chemistry andphysiology are capable nowadays of practically anything. If thepsychologists and sociologists will define the ideal, theneurologists and pharmacologists can be relied upon to discoverthe means whereby that ideal can be realized or at least (forperhaps this kind of ideal can never, in the very nature ofthings, be fully realized) more nearly approached than in thewine-bibbing past, the whisky-drinking, marijuana-smoking andbarbiturate-swallowing present. The urge to transcend self-conscious selfhood is,as I have said, a principal appetite of the soul. When, forwhatever reason, men and women fail to transcend themselves bymeans of worship, good works and spiritual exercises, they areapt to resort to religion's chemical surrogates-alcohol and"goof pills" in the modern West, alcohol and opium inthe East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuanain Central America, alcohol and coca in the Andes, alcohol andthe barbiturates in the more up-to-date regions of South America.In Poisons Sacr�s, Ivresses Divines Philippe de Felicehas written at length and with a wealth of documentation on theimmemorial connection between religion and the taking of drugs.Here, in summary or in direct quotation, are his conclusions. Theemployment for religious purposes of toxic substances is"extraordinarily widespread.... The practices studied inthis volume can be observed in every region of the earth, amongprimitives no less than among those who have reached a high pitchof civilization. We are therefore dealing not with exceptionalfacts, which might justifiably be overlooked, but with a generaland, in the widest sense of the word, a human phenomenon, thekind of phenomenon which cannot be disregarded by anyone who istrying to discover what religion is, and what are the deep needswhich it must satisfy." Ideally, everyone should be able to findself-transcendence in some form of pure or applied religion. Inpractice it seems very unlikely that this hoped for consummationwill ever be realized. There are, and doubtless there always willbe, good churchmen and good churchwomen for whom, unfortunately,piety is not enough. The late G. K. Chesterton, who wrote atleast as lyrically of drink as of devotion, may serve as theireloquent spokesman. The modern churches, with some exceptions among theProtestant denominations, tolerate alcohol; but even the mosttolerant have made no attempt to convert the drug toChristianity, or to sacramentalize its use. The pious drinker isforced to take his religion in one compartment, hisreligion-surrogate in another. And perhaps this is inevitable.Drinking cannot be sacramentalized except in religions which setno store on decorum. The worship of Dionysos or the Celtic god ofbeer was a loud and disorderly affair. The rites of Christianityare incompatible with even religious drunkenness. This does noharm to the distillers, but is very bad for Christianity.Countless persons desire self-transcendence and would be glad tofind it in church. But, alas, "the hungry sheep look up andare not fed." They take part in rites, they listen tosermons, they repeat prayers; but their thirst remainsunassuaged. Disappointed, they turn to the bottle. For a time atleast and in a kind of way, it works. Church may still beattended; but it is no more than the Musical Bank of Butler'sErewhon. God may still be acknowledged; but He is God only on theverbal level, only in a strictly Pickwickian sense. The effectiveobject of worship is the bottle and the sole religious experienceis that state of uninhibited and belligerent euphoria whichfollows the ingestion of the third cocktail. We see, then, that Christianity and alcohol do notand cannot mix. Christianity and mescalin seem to be much morecompatible. This has been demonstrated by many tribes of Indians,from Texas to as far north as Wisconsin. Among these tribes areto be found groups affiliated with the Native American Church, asect whose principal rite is a kind of Early Christian agape, orlove feast, where slices of peyote take the place of thesacramental bread and wine. These Native Americans regard thecactus as God's special gift to the Indians, and equate itseffects with the workings of the divine Spirit. Professor J. S. Slotkin, one of the very few whitemen ever to have participated in the rites of a Peyotistcongregation, says of his fellow worshipers that they are"certainly not stupefied or drunk.... They never get out ofrhythm or fumble their words, as a drunken or stupefied man woulddo.... They are all quiet, courteous and considerate of oneanother. I have never been in any white man's house of worshipwhere there is either so much religious feeling or decorum."And what, we may ask, are these devout and well-behaved Peyotistsexperiencing? Not the mild sense of virtue which sustains theaverage Sunday churchgoer through ninety minutes of boredom. Noteven those high feelings, inspired by thoughts of the Creator andthe Redeemer, the Judge and the Comforter, which animate thepious. For these Native Americans, religious experience issomething more direct and illuminating, more spontaneous, lessthe homemade product of the superficial, self-conscious mind.Sometimes (according to the reports collected by Dr. Slotkin)they see visions, which may be of Christ Himself. Sometimes theyhear the voice of the Great Spirit. Sometimes they become awareof the presence of God and of those personal shortcomings whichmust be corrected if they are to do His will. The practicalconsequences of these chemical openings of doors into the OtherWorld seem to be wholly good. Dr. Slotkin reports that habitualPeyotists are on the whole more industrious, more temperate (manyof them abstain altogether from alcohol), more Peaceable thannon-Peyotists. A tree with such satisfactory fruits cannot becondemned out of hand as evil. In sacramentalizing the use of peyote, the Indiansof the Native American Church have done something which is atonce psychologically sound and historically respectable. In theearly centuries of Christianity many pagan rites and festivalswere baptized, so to say, and made to serve the purposes of theChurch. These jollifications were not particularly edifying; butthey assuaged a certain psychological hunger and, instead oftrying to suppress them, the earlier missionaries had the senseto accept them for what they were, soul-satisfying expressions offundamental urges, and to incorporate them into the fabric of thenew religion. What the Native Americans have done is essentiallysimilar. They have taken a pagan custom (a custom, incidentally,far more elevating and enlightening than most of the ratherbrutish carousals and mummeries adopted from European paganism)and given it a Christian significance. Though but recently introduced into the northernUnited States, peyote-eating and the religion based upon it havebecome important symbols of the red man's right to spiritualindependence. Some Indians have reacted to white supremacy bybecoming Americanized, others by retreating into traditionalIndianism. But some have tried to make the best of both worlds,indeed of all the worlds—the best of Indianism, the best ofChristianity, and the best of those Other Worlds oftranscendental experience, where the soul knows itself asunconditioned and of like nature with the divine. Hence theNative American Church. In it two great appetites of thesoul— the urge to independence and self-determination andthe urge to self-transcendence-were fused with, and interpretedin the light of, a third—the urge to worship, to justify theways of God to man, to explain the universe by means of acoherent theology. Lo, the poor Indian, whose untutored mind Clothes him in front, but leaves him bare behind. But actually it is we, the rich and highly educated whites,who have left ourselves bare behind. We cover our anteriornakedness with some philosophy—Christian, Marxian,Freudo-Physicalist—but abaft we remain uncovered, at themercy of all the winds of circumstance. The poor Indian, on theother hand, has had the wit to protect his rear by supplementingthe fig leaf of a theology with the breechclout of transcendentalexperience. I am not so foolish as to equate what happens underthe influence of mescalin or of any other drug, prepared or inthe future preparable, with the realization of the end andultimate purpose of human life: Enlightenment, the BeatificVision. All I am suggesting is that the mescalin experience iswhat Catholic theologians call "a gratuitous grace,"not necessary to salvation but potentially helpful and to beaccepted thankfully, if made available. To be shaken out of theruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hoursthe outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animalobsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with wordsand notions, but as they are apprehended, directly andunconditionally, by Mind at Large—this is an experience ofinestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.For the intellectual is by definition the man for whom, inGoethe's phrase, "the word is essentially fruitful." Heis the man who feels that "what we perceive by the eye isforeign to us as such and need not impress us deeply." Andyet, though himself an intellectual and one of the suprememasters of language, Goethe did not always agree with his ownevaluation of the word. "We talk," he wrote in middlelife, "far too much. We should talk less and draw more. Ipersonally should like to renounce speech altogether and, likeorganic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches.That fig tree, this little snake, the cocoon on my window sillquietly awaiting its future-all these are momentous signatures. Aperson able to decipher their meaning properly would soon be ableto dispense with the written or the spoken word altogether. Themore I think of it, there is something futile, mediocre, even (Iam tempted to say) foppish about speech. By contrast, how thegravity of Nature and her silence startle you, when you standface to face with her, undistracted, before a barren ridge or inthe desolation of the ancient hills." We can never dispensewith language and the other symbol systems; for it is by means ofthem, and only by their means, that we have raised ourselvesabove the brutes, to the level of human beings. But we can easilybecome the victims as well as the beneficiaries of these systems.We must learn how to handle words effectively; but at the sametime we must preserve and, if necessary, intensify our ability tolook at the world directly and not through that half opaquemedium of concepts, which distorts every given fact into the alltoo familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatoryabstraction. Literary or scientific, liberal or specialist, allour education is predominantly verbal and therefore fails toaccomplish what it is supposed to do. Instead of transformingchildren into fully developed adults, it turns out students ofthe natural sciences who are completely unaware of Nature as theprimary fact of experience, it inflicts upon the world studentsof the humanities who know nothing of humanity, their own oranyone else's. Gestalt psychologists, such as Samuel Renshaw, havedevised methods for widening the range and increasing the acuityof human perceptions. But do our educators apply them? The answeris, No. Teachers in every field of psyche-physical skill,from seeing to tennis, from tightrope walking to prayer, havediscovered, by trial and error, the conditions of optimumfunctioning within their special fields. But have any of thegreat Foundations financed a project for coordinating theseempirical findings into a general theory and practice ofheightened creativeness? Again, so far as I am aware, the answeris, No. All sorts of cultists and queer fish teach allkinds of techniques for achieving health, contentment, peace ofmind; and for many of their hearers many of these techniques aredemonstrably effective. But do we see respectable psychologists,philosophers and clergymen boldly descending into those odd andsometimes malodorous wells, at the bottom of which poor Truth isso often condemned to sit? Yet once more the answer is, No. And now look at the history of mescalin research.Seventy years ago men of first-rate ability described thetranscendental experiences which come to those who, in goodhealth, under proper conditions and in the right spirit, take thedrug. How many philosophers, how many theologians, how manyprofessional educators have had the curiosity to open this Doorin the Wall? The answer, for all practical purposes, is, None. In a world where education is predominantly verbal,highly educated people find it all but impossible to pay seriousattention to anything but words and notions. There is alwaysmoney for, there are always doctorates in, the learned foolery ofresearch into what, for scholars, is the all-important problem:Who influenced whom to say what when? Even in this age oftechnology the verbal humanities are honored. The non-verbalhumanities, the arts of being directly aware of the given factsof our existence, ale almost completely ignored. A catalogue, abibliography, a definitive edition of a third-rate versifier's ipsissimaverba, a stupendous index to end all indexes —anygenuinely Alexandrian project is sure of approval and financialsupport: But when it comes to finding out how you and I, ourchildren and grand- children, may become more perceptive, moreintensely aware of inward and outward reality, more open to theSpirit, less apt, by psychological malpractices, to makeourselves physically ill, and more capable of controlling our ownautonomic nervous system—when it comes to any form ofnon-verbal education more fundamental (and more likely to be ofsome practical use) than Swedish drill, no really respectableperson in any really respectable university or church will doanything about it. Verbalists are suspicious of the non-verbal;rationalists fear the given, non-rational fact; intellectualsfeel that "what we perceive by the eye (or in any other way)is foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply."Besides, this matter of education in the non-verbal humanitieswill not fit into any of the established pigeonholes. It is notreligion, not neurology, not gymnastics, not morality or civics,not even experimental psychology. This being so the subject is,for academic and ecclesiastical purposes, non-existent and maysafely be ignored altogether or left, with a Patronizing smile,to those whom the Pharisees of verbal orthodoxy call cranks,quacks, charlatans and unqualified amateurs. "I have always found," Blake wrote ratherbitterly, "that Angels have the vanity to speak ofthemselves as the only wise. This they do with a confidentinsolence sprouting from systematic reasoning." Systematic reasoning is something we could not, asa species or as individuals, possibly do without. But neither, ifwe are to remain sane, can we possibly do without directperception, the more unsystematic the better, of the inner andouter worlds into which we have been born. This given reality isan infinite which passes all understanding and yet admits ofbeing directly and in some sort totally apprehended. It is atranscendence belonging to another order than the human, and yetit may be present to us as a felt immanence, an experiencedparticipation. To be enlightened is to be aware, always, of totalreality in its immanent otherness-to be aware of it and yet toremain in a condition to survive as an animal, to think and feelas a human being, to resort whenever expedient to systematicreasoning. Our goal is to discover that we have always been wherewe ought to be. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficultfor ourselves. Meanwhile, however, there are gratuitous graces inthe form of partial and fleeting realizations. Under a morerealistic, a less exclusively verbal system of education thanours, every Angel (in Blake's sense of that word) would bepermitted as a sabbatical treat, would be urged and even, ifnecessary, compelled to take an occasional trip through somechemical Door in the Wall into the world of transcendentalexperience. If it terrified him, it would be unfortunate butprobably salutary. If it brought him a brief but timelessillumination, so much the better. In either case the Angel mightlose a little of the confident insolence sprouting fromsystematic reasoning and the consciousness of having read all thebooks. Near the end of his life Aquinas experiencedInfused Contemplation. Thereafter he refused to go back to workon his unfinished book. Compared with this, everything he hadread and argued about and written—Aristotle and theSentences, the Questions, the Propositions, the majesticSummas—was no better than chaff or straw, For mostintellectuals such a sit-down strike would be inadvisable, evenmorally wrong. But the Angelic Doctor had done more systematicreasoning than any twelve ordinary Angels, and was already ripefor death. He had earned the right, in those last months of hismortality, to turn away from merely symbolic straw and chaff tothe bread of actual and substantial Fact. For Angels of a lowerorder and with better prospects of longevity, there must be areturn to the straw. But the man who comes back through the Doorin the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out.He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but lessself-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet betterequipped to understand the relationship of words to things, ofsystematic reasoning to the unfathomable Mystery which it tries,forever vainly, to comprehend. *See the following papers:"Schizophrenia.

Slotkin has written that"the habitual use of Peyote does not seem to produce anyincreased tolerance or dependence. I know many people who havebeen Peyotists for forty to fifty years. The amount of Peyotethey use depends upon the solemnity of the occasion; in generalthey do not take any more Peyote now than they did years ago.Also, there is sometimes an interval of a month or more betweenrites, and they go without Peyote during this period withoutfeeling any craving for it. Personally, even after a series ofrites occurring on four successive weekends. I neither increasedthe amount of Peyote consumed nor felt any continued need forit." It is evidently with good reason that "Peyote hasnever been legally declared a narcotic, or its use prohibited bythe federal government." However, "during the longhistory of Indian-white contact, white offcials have usuallytried to suppress the use of Peyote, because it has beenconceived to violate their own mores. But these at- tempts havealways failed." In a footnote Dr. Slotkin adds that "itis amazing to hear the fantastic stories about the effects ofPeyote and the nature of the ritual, which are told by the whiteand Catholic Indian officials in the Menomini Reservation. Noneof them have had the slightest first-hand experience with theplant or with the religion, yet some fancy themselves to beauthorities and write official reports on the subject."

Here, at last, the father of LSDdetails the history of his "problem child" and his longand fruitful career as a research chemist. In a real sense, thisbook is the inside story of the birth of the Psychedelic Age, andit cannot be denied that we have here a highly candid andpersonal insight into one of the most important scientificdiscoveries of our time, the signiflcance of which has yet todawn on mankind. Surpassing its historical value is the immensephilosophical import of this work. Never before has a chemist, anexpert in the most materialistic of the sciences, advanced a Weltanschauungof such a mystical and transcendental nature. LSD, psilocybin,and the other hallucinogens do indeed, as Albert Hofmann asserts,constitute "cracks" in the edifice of materialisticrationality, cracks we would do well to explore and perhapswiden. As a writer, it gives me great satisfaction to knowthat by this book the American reader interested in hallucinogenswill be introduced to the work of Rudolf Gelpke, Ernst Junger,and Walter Vogt, writers who are all but unknown here. With thenotable exceptions of Huxley and Wasson, English and Americanwriters on the hallucinogenic experience have been far lessdistinguished and eloquent than they. This translation has been carefully overseen byAlbert Hofmann, which made my task both simpler and moreenjoyable. I am beholden to R. Gordon Wasson for checking thechapters on LSD's "Mexican relatives" and on "SkaMaria Pastora" for accuracy and style. Two chapters of this book—"How LSDOriginated" and "LSD Experience andReality"—were presented by Albert Hofmann as a paperbefore the international conference "Hallucinogens,Shamanism and Modern Life" in San Francisco on the afternoonof Saturday, September 30, 1978. As a part of the conferenceproceedings, the first chapter has been published in the Journalof Psychedelic Drugs, Vol. 11 (1-2), 1979.

These are not particular externaloccurrences, but rather events of our inner lives, which aregenerally dismissed as figments of the imagination and barredfrom our memory. Suddenly, the familiar view of our surroundingsis transformed in a strange, delightful, or alarming way: itappears to us in a new light, takes on a special meaning. Such anexperience can be as light and fleeting as a breath of air, or itcan imprint itself deeply upon our minds. One enchantment of that kind, which I experiencedin childhood, has remained remarkably vivid in my memory eversince. It happened on a May morning—I have forgotten theyear—but I can still point to the exact spot where itoccurred, on a forest path on Martinsberg above Baden,Switzerland. As I strolled through the freshly greened woodsfilled with bird song and lit up by the morning sun, all at onceeverything appeared in an uncommonly clear light. Was thissomething I had simply failed to notice before? Was I suddenlydiscovering the spring forest as it actually looked? It shonewith the most beautiful radiance, speaking to the heart, asthough it wanted to encompass me in its majesty. I was filledwith an indescribable sensation of joy, oneness, and blissfulsecurity. I have no idea how long I stood there spellbound.But I recall the anxious concern I felt as the radiance slowlydissolved and I hiked on: how could a vision that was so real andconvincing, so directly and deeply felt—how could it end sosoon? And how could I tell anyone about it, as my overflowing joycompelled me to do, since I knew there were no words to describewhat I had seen? It seemed strange that I, as a child, had seensomething so marvelous, something that adults obviously did notperceive - for I had never heard them mention it. While still a child, I experienced several more ofthese deeply euphoric moments on my rambles through forest andmeadow. It was these experiences that shaped the main outlines ofmy world view and convinced me of the existence of a miraculous,powerful, unfathomable reality that was hidden from everydaysight. I was often troubled in those days, wondering if Iwould ever, as an adult, be able to communicate theseexperiences; whether I would have the chance to depict my visionsin poetry or paintings. But knowing that I was not cut out to bea poet or artist, I assumed I would have to keep theseexperiences to myself, important as they were to me. Unexpectedly—though scarcely bychance—much later, in middle age, a link was establishedbetween my profession and these visionary experiences fromchildhood. Because I wanted to gain insight into the structureand essence of matter, I became a research chemist. Intrigued bythe plant world since early childhood, I chose to specialize inresearch on the constituents of medicinal plants. In the courseof this career I was led to the psychoactive,hallucination-causing substances, which under certain conditionscan evoke visionary states similar to the spontaneous experiencesjust described. The most important of these hallucinogenicsubstances has come to be known as LSD. Hallucinogens, as activecompounds of considerable scientific interest, have gained entryinto medicinal research, biology, and psychiatry, andlater—especially LSD also obtained wide diffusion in thedrug culture. In studying the literature connected with my work,I became aware of the great universal significance of visionaryexperience. It plays a dominant role, not only in mysticism andthe history of religion, but also in the creative process in art,literature, and science. More recent investigations have shownthat many persons also have visionary experiences in daily life,though most of us fail to recognize their meaning and value.Mystical experiences, like those that marked my childhood, areapparently far from rare. There is today a widespread striving for mysticalexperience, for visionary breakthroughs to a deeper, morecomprehensive reality than that perceived by our rational,everyday consciousness. Efforts to transcend our materialisticworld view are being made in various ways, not only by theadherents to Eastern religious movements, but also byprofessional psychiatrists, who are adopting such profoundspiritual experiences as a basic therapeutic principle. I share the belief of many of my contemporariesthat the spiritual crisis pervading all spheres of Westernindustrial society can be remedied only by a change in our worldview. We shall have to shift from the materialistic, dualisticbelief that people and their environment are separate, toward anew consciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embracesthe experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel theironeness with animate nature and all of creation. Everything that can contribute to such afundamental alteration in our perception of reality musttherefore command earnest attention. Foremost among suchapproaches are the various methods of meditation, either in areligious or a secular context, which aim to deepen theconsciousness of reality by way of a total mystical experience.Another important, but still controversial, path to the same goalis the use of the consciousness-altering properties ofhallucinogenic psychopharmaceuticals. LSD finds such anapplication in medicine, by helping patients in psychoanalysisand psychotherapy to perceive their problems in their truesignificance. Deliberate provocation of mystical experience,particularly by LSD and related hallucinogens, in contrast tospontaneous visionary experiences, entails dangers that must notbe underestimated. Practitioners must take into account thepeculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability toinfluence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.The history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophicconsequences that can ensue when its profound effect is misjudgedand the substance is mistaken for a pleasure drug. Specialinternal and external advance preparations are required; withthem, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful experience. Wrongand inappropriate use has caused LSD to become my problem child. It is my desire in this book to give acomprehensive picture of LSD, its origin, its effects, and itsdangers, in order to guard against increasing abuse of thisextraordinary drug. I hope thereby to emphasize possible uses ofLSD that are compatible with its characteristic action. I believethat if people would learn to use LSD's vision-inducingcapability more wisely, under suitable conditions, in medicalpractice and in conjunction with meditation, then in the futurethis problem child could become a wonder child.

How LSD Originated In the realm of scientific observation, luck is granted only to those who are prepared. —Louis Pasteur Time and again I hear or read that LSD wasdiscovered by accident. This is only partly true. LSD came intobeing within a systematic research program, and the"accident" did not occur until much later: when LSD wasalready five years old, I happened to experience itsunforeseeable effects in my own body—or rather, in my ownmind. Looking back over my professional career to tracethe influential events and decisions that eventually steered mywork toward the synthesis of LSD, I realize that the mostdecisive step was my choice of employment upon completion of mychemistry studies. If that decision had been different, then thissubstance, which has become known the world over, might neverhave been created. In order to tell the story of the origin ofLSD, then, I must also touch briefly on my career as a chemist,since the two developments are inextricably interrelated. In the spring of 1929, on concluding my chemistrystudies at the University of Zurich, I joined the SandozCompany's pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratory in Basel,as a co-worker with Professor Arthur Stoll, founder and directorof the pharmaceutical department. I chose this position becauseit afforded me the opportunity to work on natural products,whereas two other job offers from chemical firms in Basel hadinvolved work in the field of synthetic chemistry. First Chemical Explorations My doctoral work at Zurich under Professor PaulKarrer had already given me one chance to pursue my interest inplant and animal chemistry. Making use of the gastrointestinaljuice of the vineyard snail, I accomplished the enzymaticdegradation of chitin, the structural material of which theshells, wings, and claws of insects, crustaceans, and other loweranimals are composed. I was able to derive the chemical structureof chitin from the cleavage product, a nitrogen-containing sugar,obtained by this degradation. Chitin turned out to be an analogueof cellulose, the structural material of plants. This importantresult, obtained after only three months of research, led to adoctoral thesis rated "with distinction." When I joined the Sandoz firm, the staff of thepharmaceutical-chemical department was still rather modest innumber. Four chemists with doctoral degrees worked in research,three in production. In Stoll's laboratory I found employment thatcompletely agreed with me as a research chemist. The objectivethat Professor Stoll had set for his pharmaceutical-chemicalresearch laboratories was to isolate the active principles (i.e.,the effective constituents) of known medicinal plants to producepure specimens of these substances. This is particularlyimportant in the case of medicinal plants whose active principlesare unstable, or whose potency is subject to great variation,which makes an exact dosage difficult. But if the activeprinciple is available in pure form, it becomes possible tomanufacture a stable pharmaceutical preparation, exactlyquantifiable by weight. With this in mind, Professor Stoll hadelected to study plant substances of recognized value such as thesubstances from foxglove (Digitalis), Mediterranean squill(Scilla maritima), and ergot of rye (Claviceps purpureaor Secale cornutum), which, owning to their instabilityand uncertain dosage, nevertheless, had been little used inmedicine. My first years in the Sandoz laboratories weredevoted almost exclusively to studying the active principles ofMediterranean squill. Dr. Walter Kreis, one of Professor Stoll'searliest associates, launched me in this field of research. Themost important constituents of Mediterranean squill alreadyexisted in pure form. Their active agents, as well as those ofwoolly foxglove (Digitalis lanata), had been isolated andpurified, chiefly by Dr. Kreis, with extraordinary skill. The active principles of Mediterranean squillbelong to the group of cardioactive glycosides (glycoside =sugar-containing substance) and serve, as do those of foxglove,in the treatment of cardiac insufficiency. The cardiac glycosidesare extremely active substances. Because the therapeutic and thetoxic doses differ so little, it becomes especially importanthere to have an exact dosage, based on pure compounds. At the beginning of my investigations, apharmaceutical preparation with Scilla glycosides had alreadybeen introduced into therapeutics by Sandoz; however, thechemical structure of these active compounds, with the exceptionof the sugar portion, remained largely unknown. My main contribution to the Scilla research,in which I participated with enthusiasm, was to elucidate thechemical structure of the common nucleus of Scilla glycosides,showing on the one hand their differences from the Digitalis glycosides,and on the other hand their close structural relationship withthe toxic principles isolated from skin glands of toads. In 1935,these studies were temporarily concluded. Looking for a new field of research, I askedProfessor Stoll to let me continue the investigations on thealkaloids of ergot, which he had begun in 1917 and which had leddirectly to the isolation of ergotamine in 1918. Ergotamine,discovered by Stoll, was the first ergot alkaloid obtained inpure chemical form. Although ergotamine quickly took asignificant place in therapeutics (under the trade name Gynergen)as a hemostatic remedy in obstetrics and as a medicament in thetreatment of migraine, chemical research on ergot in the Sandozlaboratories was abandoned after the isolation of ergotamine andthe determination of its empirical formula. Meanwhile, at thebeginning of the thirties, English and American laboratories hadbegun to determine the chemical structure of ergot alkaloids.They had also discovered a new, water-soluble ergot alkaloid,which could likewise be isolated from the mother liquor ofergotamine production. So I thought it was high time that Sandozresumed chemical research on ergot alkaloids, unless we wanted torisk losing our leading role in a field of medicinal research,which was already becoming so important. Professor Stoll granted my request, with somemisgivings: "I must warn you of the difficulties you face inworking with ergot alkaloids. These are-exceedingly sensitive,easily decomposed substances, less stable than any of thecompounds you have investigated in the cardiac glycoside field.But you are welcome to try." And so the switches were thrown, and I found myselfengaged in a field of study that would become the main theme ofmy professional career. I have never forgotten the creative joy,the eager anticipation I felt in embarking on the study of ergotalkaloids, at that time a relatively uncharted field of research. Ergot It may be helpful here to give some backgroundinformation about ergot itself.[For further information on ergot,readers should refer to the monographs of G. Berger, Ergot andErgotism (Gurney and Jackson, London, 1931 ) and A. Hofmann, DieMutterkornalkaloide (F. Enke Verlag, Stuttgart, 1964). Theformer is a classical presentation of the history of the drug,while the latter emphasizes the chemical aspects.] It is producedby a lower fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that growsparasitically on rye and, to a lesser extent, on other species ofgrain and on wild grasses. Kernels infested with this fungusdevelop into light-brown to violet-brown curved pegs (sclerotia)that push forth from the husk in place of normal grains. Ergot isdescribed botanically as a sclerotium, the form that the ergotfungus takes in winter. Ergot of rye (Secale cornutum) isthe variety used medicinally. Ergot, more than any other drug, has a fascinatinghistory, in the course of which its role and meaning have beenreversed: once dreaded as a poison, in the course of time it haschanged to a rich storehouse of valuable remedies. Ergot firstappeared on the stage of history in the early Middle Ages, as thecause of outbreaks of mass poisonings affecting thousands ofpersons at a time. The illness, whose connection with ergot wasfor a long time obscure, appeared in two characteristic forms,one gangrenous (ergotismus gangraenosus) and the otherconvulsive (ergotismus convulsivus). Popular names forergotism—such as "mal des ardents," "ignissacer," "heiliges Feuer," or "St. Anthony'sfire"—refer to the gangrenous form of the disease. Thepatron saint of ergotism victims was St. Anthony, and it wasprimarily the Order of St. Anthony that treated these patients. Until recent times, epidemic-like outbreaks ofergot poisoning have been recorded in most European countriesincluding certain areas of Russia. With progress in agriculture,and since the realization, in the seventeenth century, thatergot-containing bread was the cause, the frequency and extent ofergotism epidemics diminished considerably. The last greatepidemic occurred in certain areas of southern Russia in theyears 1926-27. [The mass poisoning in the southern French city ofPont-St. Esprit in the year 1951, which many writers haveattributed to ergot-containing bread, actually had nothing to dowith ergotism. It rather involved poisoning by an organic mercurycompound that was utilized for disinfecting seed.] The first mention of a medicinal use of ergot,namely as an ecbolic (a medicament to precipitate childbirth), isfound in the herbal of the Frankfurt city physician Adam Lonitzer(Lonicerus) in the year 1582. Although ergot, as Lonitzer stated,had been used since olden times by midwives, it was not until1808 that this drug gained entry into academic medicine, on thestrength of a work by the American physician John Stearnsentitled Account of the Putvis Parturiens, a Remedy forQuickening Childbirth. The use of ergot as an ecbolic didnot, however, endure. Practitioners became aware quite early ofthe great danger to the child, owing primarily to the uncertaintyof dosage, which when too high led to uterine spasms. From thenon, the use of ergot in obstetrics was confined to stoppingpostpartum hemorrhage (bleeding after childbirth). It was not until ergot's recognition in variouspharmacopoeias during the first half of the nineteenth centurythat the first steps were taken toward isolating the activeprinciples of the drug. However, of all the researchers whoassayed this problem during the first hundred years, not onesucceeded in identifying the actual substances responsible forthe therapeutic activity. In 1907, the Englishmen G. Barger andF. H. Carr were the first to isolate an active alkaloidalpreparation, which they named ergotoxine because it produced moreof the toxic than therapeutic properties of ergot. (Thispreparation was not homogeneous, but rather a mixture of severalalkaloids, as I was able to show thirty-five years later.)Nevertheless, the pharmacologist H. H. Dale discovered thatergotoxine, besides the uterotonic effect, also had anantagonistic activity on adrenaline in the autonomic nervoussystem that could lead to the therapeutic use of ergot alkaloids.Only with the isolation of ergotamine by A. Stoll (as mentionedpreviously) did an ergot alkaloid find entry and widespread usein therapeutics. The early 1930s brought a new era in ergotresearch, beginning with the determination of the chemicalstructure of ergot alkaloids, as mentioned, in English andAmerican laboratories. By chemical cleavage, W. A. Jacobs and L.C. Craig of the Rockefeller Institute of New York succeeded inisolating and characterizing the nucleus common to all ergotalkaloids. They named it lysergic acid. Then came a majordevelopment, both for chemistry and for medicine: the isolationof the specifically uterotonic, hemostatic principle of ergot,which was published simultaneously and quite independently byfour institutions, including the Sandoz laboratories. Thesubstance, an alkaloid of comparatively simple structure, wasnamed ergobasine (syn. ergometrine, ergonovine) by A. Stoll andE. Burckhardt. By the chemical degradation of ergobasine, W. A.Jacobs and L. C. Craig obtained lysergic acid and the aminoalcohol propanolamine as cleavage products. I set as my first goal the problem of preparingthis alkaloid synthetically, through chemical linking of the twocomponents of ergobasine, lysergic acid and propanolamine (seestructural formulas in the appendix). The lysergic acid necessary for these studies hadto be obtained by chemical cleavage of some other ergot alkaloid.Since only ergotamine was available as a pure alkaloid, and wasalready being produced in kilogram quantities in thepharmaceutical production department, I chose this alkaloid asthe starting material for my work. I set about obtaining 0.5 gmof ergotamine from the ergot production people. When I sent theinternal requisition form to Professor Stoll for hiscountersignature, he appeared in my laboratory and reproved me:"If you want to work with ergot alkaloids, you will have tofamiliarize yourself with the techniques of microchemistry. Ican't have you consuming such a large amount of my expensiveergotamine for your experiments." The ergot production department, besides usingergot of Swiss origin to obtain ergotamine, also dealt withPortuguese ergot, which yielded an amorphous alkaloidalpreparation that corresponded to the aforementioned ergotoxinefirst produced by Barger and Carr. I decided to use this lessexpensive material for the preparation of lysergic acid. Thealkaloid obtained from the production department had to bepurified further, before it would be suitable for cleavage tolysergic acid. Observations made during the purification processled me to think that ergotoxine could be a mixture of severalalkaloids, rather than one homogeneous alkaloid. I will speaklater of the far-reaching sequelae of these observations. Here I must digress briefly to describe the workingconditions and techniques that prevailed in those days. Theseremarks may be of interest to the present generation of researchchemists in industry, who are accustomed to far betterconditions. We were very frugal. Individual laboratories wereconsidered a rare extravagance. During the first six years of myemployment with Sandoz, I shared a laboratory with twocolleagues. We three chemists, plus an assistant each, worked inthe same room on three different fields: Dr. Kreiss on cardiacglycosides; Dr. Wiedemann, who joined Sandoz around the same timeas I, on the leaf pigment chlorophyll; and I ultimately on ergotalkaloids. The laboratory was equipped with two fume hoods(compartments supplied with outlets), providing less thaneffective ventilation by gas flames. When we requested that thesehoods be equipped with ventilators, our chief refused on theground that ventilation by gas flame had sufficed inWillstatter's laboratory. During the last years of World War I, ProfessorStoll had been an assistant in Berlin and Munich to theworld-famous chemist and Nobel laureate Professor RichardWillstatter, and with him had conducted the fundamentalinvestigations on chlorophyll and the assimilation of carbondioxide. There was scarcely a scientific discussion withProfessor Stoll in which he did not mention his revered teacherProfessor Willstatter and his work in Willstatter's laboratory. The working techniques available to chemists in thefield of organic chemistry at that time (the beginning of thethirties) were essentially the same as those employed by Justusvon Liebig a hundred years earlier. The most importantdevelopment achieved since then was the introduction ofmicroanalysis by B. Pregl, which made it possible to ascertainthe elemental composition of a compound with only a fewmilligrams of specimen, whereas earlier a few centigrams wereneeded. Of the other physical-chemical techniques at the disposalof the chemist today—techniques which have changed his wayof working, making it faster and more effective, and createdentirely new possibilities, above all for the elucidation ofstructure - none yet existed in those days. For the investigations of Scilla glycosidesand the first studies in the ergot field, I still used the oldseparation and purification techniques from Liebig's day:fractional extraction, fractional precipitation, fractionalcrystallization, and the like. The introduction of columnchromatography, the first important step in modern laboratorytechnique, was of great value to me only in later investigations.For structure determination, which today can be conducted rapidlyand elegantly with the help of spectroscopic methods (UV, IR,NMR) and X-ray crystallography, we had to rely, in the firstfundamental ergot studies, entirely on the old laborious methodsof chemical degradation and derivatization. Lysergic Acid and Its Derivatives Lysergic acid proved to be a rather unstablesubstance, and its rebonding with basic radicals poseddifficulties. In the technique known as Curtius' Synthesis, Iultimately found a process that proved useful for combininglysergic acid with amines. With this method I produced a greatnumber of lysergic acid compounds. By combining lysergic acidwith the amino alcohol propanolamine, I obtained a compound thatwas identical to the natural ergot alkaloid ergobasine. Withthat, the first synthesis—that is, artificialproduction—of an ergot alkaloid was accomplished. This wasnot only of scientific interest, as confirmation of the chemicalstructure of ergobasine, but also of practical significance,because ergobasine, the specifically uterotonic, hemostaticprinciple, is present in ergot only in very trifling quantities.With this synthesis, the other alkaloids existing abundantly inergot could now be converted to ergobasine, which was valuable inobstetrics. After this first success in the ergot field, myinvestigations went forward on two fronts. First, I attempted toimprove the pharmacological properties of ergobasine byvariations of its amino alcohol radical. My colleague Dr. J.Peyer and I developed a process for the economical production ofpropanolamine and other amino alcohols. Indeed, by substitutionof the propanolamine contained in ergobasine with the aminoalcohol butanolamine, an active principle was obtained that evensurpassed the natural alkaloid in its therapeutic properties.This improved ergobasine has found worldwide application as adependable uterotonic, hemostatic remedy under the trade nameMethergine, and is today the leading medicament for thisindication in obstetrics. I further employed my synthetic procedure toproduce new lysergic acid compounds for which uterotonic activitywas not prominent, but from which, on the basis of their chemicalstructure, other types of interesting pharmacological propertiescould be expected. In 1938, I produced the twenty-fifth substancein this series of lysergic acid derivatives: lysergic aciddiethylamide, abbreviated LSD-25 (Lyserg-s�ure-di�thylamid) forlaboratory usage. I had planned the synthesis of this compound withthe intention of obtaining a circulatory and respiratorystimulant (an analeptic). Such stimulating properties could beexpected for lysergic acid diethylamide, because it showssimilarity in chemical structure to the analeptic already knownat that time, namely nicotinic acid diethylamide (Coramine).During the testing of LSD-25 in the pharmacological department ofSandoz, whose director at the time was Professor Ernst Rothlin, astrong effect on the uterus was established. It amounted to some70 percent of the activity of ergobasine. The research reportalso noted, in passing, that the experimental animals becamerestless during the narcosis. The new substance, however, arousedno special interest in our pharmacologists and physicians;testing was therefore discontinued. For the next five years, nothing more was heard ofthe substance LSD-25. Meanwhile, my work in the ergot fieldadvanced further in other areas. Through the purification ofergotoxine, the starting material for lysergic acid, I obtained,as already mentioned, the impression that this alkaloidalpreparation was not homogeneous, but was rather a mixture ofdifferent substances. This doubt as to the homogeneity ofergotoxine was reinforced when in its hydrogenation twodistinctly different hydrogenation products were obtained,whereas the homogeneous alkaloid ergotamine under the samecondition yielded only a single hydrogenation product(hydrogenation = introduction of hydrogen). Extended, systematicanalytical investigations of the supposed ergotoxine mixture ledultimately to the separation of this alkaloidal preparation intothree homogeneous components. One of the three chemicallyhomogeneous ergotoxine alkaloids proved to be identical with analkaloid isolated shortly before in the production department,which A. Stoll and E. Burckhardt had named ergocristine. Theother two alkaloids were both new. The first I named ergocornine;and for the second, the last to be isolated, which had longremained hidden in the mother liquor, I chose the nameergokryptine (kryptos = hidden). Later it was found thatergokryptine occurs in two isomeric forms, which weredifferentiated as alfa- and beta-ergokryptine. The solution of the ergotoxine problem was notmerely scientifically interesting, but also had great practicalsignificance. A valuable remedy arose from it. The threehydrogenated ergotoxine alkaloids that I produced in the courseof these investigations, dihydroergocristine,dihydroergokryptine, and dihydroergocornine, displayedmedicinally useful properties during testing by Professor Rothlinin the pharmacological department. From these three substances,the pharmaceutical preparation Hydergine was developed, amedicament for improvement of peripheral circulation and cerebralfunction in the control of geriatric disorders. Hydergine hasproven to be an effective remedy in geriatrics for theseindications. Today it is Sandoz's most important pharmaceuticalproduct. Dihydroergotamine, which I likewise produced in thecourse of these investigations, has also found application intherapeutics as a circulation- and blood-pressure-stabilizingmedicament, under the trade name Dihydergot. While today research on important projects isalmost exclusively carried out as teamwork, the investigations onergot alkaloids described above were conducted by myself alone.Even the further chemical steps in the evolution of commercialpreparations remained in my hands—that is, the preparationof larger specimens for the clinical trials, and finally theperfection of the first procedures for mass production ofMethergine, Hydergine, and Dihydergot. This even included theanalytical controls for the development of the first galenicalforms of these three preparations: the ampoules, liquidsolutions, and tablets. My aides at that time included alaboratory assistant, a laboratory helper, and later in additiona second laboratory assistant and a chemical technician. Discovery of the Psychic Effects of LSD The solution of the ergotoxine problem had ledto fruitful results, described here only briefly, and had openedup further avenues of research. And yet I could not forget therelatively uninteresting LSD-25. A peculiar presentiment—thefeeling that this substance could possess properties other thanthose established in the first investigations—induced me,five years after the first synthesis, to produce LSD-25 onceagain so that a sample could be given to the pharmacologicaldepartment for further tests. This was quite unusual;experimental substances, as a rule, were definitely stricken fromthe research program if once found to be lacking inpharmacological interest. Nevertheless, in the spring of 1943, I repeated thesynthesis of LSD-25. As in the first synthesis, this involved theproduction of only a few centigrams of the compound. In the final step of the synthesis, during thepurification and crystallization of lysergic acid diethylamide inthe form of a tartrate (tartaric acid salt), I was interrupted inmy work by unusual sensations. The following description of thisincident comes from the report that I sent at the time toProfessor Stoll: Last Friday, April 16,1943, I was forced to interrupt my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and proceed home, being affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away. This was, altogether, a remarkableexperience—both in its sudden onset and its extraordinarycourse. It seemed to have resulted from some external toxicinfluence; I surmised a connection with the substance I had beenworking with at the time, lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate.But this led to another question: how had I managed to absorbthis material? Because of the known toxicity of ergot substances,I always maintained meticulously neat work habits. Possibly a bitof the LSD solution had contacted my fingertips duringcrystallization, and a trace of the substance was absorbedthrough the skin. If LSD-25 had indeed been the cause of thisbizarre experience, then it must be a substance of extraordinarypotency. There seemed to be only one way of getting to the bottomof this. I decided on a self-experiment. Exercising extreme caution, I began the plannedseries of experiments with the smallest quantity that could beexpected to produce some effect, considering the activity of theergot alkaloids known at the time: namely, 0.25 mg (mg =milligram = one thousandth of a gram) of lysergic aciddiethylamide tartrate. Quoted below is the entry for thisexperiment in my laboratory journal of April 19, 1943. Self-Experiments 4/19/43 16:20: 0.5 cc of 1/2 promil aqueous solution of diethylamide tartrate orally = 0.25 mg tartrate. Taken diluted with about 10 cc water. Tasteless. 17:00: Beginning dizziness, feeling of anxiety, visual distortions, symptoms of paralysis, desire to laugh. Supplement of 4/21: Home by bicycle. From 18:00- ca.20:00 most severe crisis. (See special report.) Here the notes in my laboratory journal cease. Iwas able to write the last words only with great effort. By nowit was already clear to me that LSD had been the cause of theremarkable experience of the previous Friday, for the alteredperceptions were of the same type as before, only much moreintense. I had to struggle to speak intelligibly. I asked mylaboratory assistant, who was informed of the self-experiment, toescort me home. We went by bicycle, no automobile being availablebecause of wartime restrictions on their use. On the way home, mycondition began to assume threatening forms. Everything in myfield of vision wavered and was distorted as if seen in a curvedmirror. I also had the sensation of being unable to move from thespot. Nevertheless, my assistant later told me that we hadtraveled very rapidly. Finally, we arrived at home safe andsound, and I was just barely capable of asking my companion tosummon our family doctor and request milk from the neighbors. In spite of my delirious, bewildered condition, Ihad brief periods of clear and effective thinking—and chosemilk as a nonspecific antidote for poisoning. The dizziness and sensation of fainting became sostrong at times that I could no longer hold myself erect, and hadto lie down on a sofa. My surroundings had now transformedthemselves in more terrifying ways. Everything in the room spunaround, and the familiar objects and pieces of furniture assumedgrotesque, threatening forms. They were in continuous motion,animated, as if driven by an inner restlessness. The lady nextdoor, whom I scarcely recognized, brought me milk—in thecourse of the evening I drank more than two liters. She was nolonger Mrs. R., but rather a malevolent, insidious witch with acolored mask. Even worse than these demonic transformations ofthe outer world, were the alterations that I perceived in myself,in my inner being. Every exertion of my will, every attempt toput an end to the disintegration of the outer world and thedissolution of my ego, seemed to be wasted effort. A demon hadinvaded me, had taken possession of my body, mind, and soul. Ijumped up and screamed, trying to free myself from him, but thensank down again and lay helpless on the sofa. The substance, withwhich I had wanted to experiment, had vanquished me. It was thedemon that scornfully triumphed over my will. I was seized by thedreadful fear of going insane. I was taken to another world,another place, another time. My body seemed to be withoutsensation, lifeless, strange. Was I dying? Was this thetransition? At times I believed myself to be outside my body, andthen perceived clearly, as an outside observer, the completetragedy of my situation. I had not even taken leave of my family(my wife, with our three children had traveled that day to visither parents, in Lucerne). Would they ever understand that I hadnot experimented thoughtlessly, irresponsibly, but rather withthe utmost caution, an-d that such a result was in no wayforeseeable? My fear and despair intensified, not only because ayoung family should lose its father, but also because I dreadedleaving my chemical research work, which meant so much to me,unfinished in the midst of fruitful, promising development.Another reflection took shape, an idea full of bitter irony: if Iwas now forced to leave this world prematurely, it was because ofthis Iysergic acid diethylamide that I myself had brought forthinto the world. By the time the doctor arrived, the climax of mydespondent condition had already passed. My laboratory assistantinformed him about my self-experiment, as I myself was not yetable to formulate a coherent sentence. He shook his head inperplexity, after my attempts to describe the mortal danger thatthreatened my body. He could detect no abnormal symptoms otherthan extremely dilated pupils. Pulse, blood pressure, breathingwere all normal. He saw no reason to prescribe any medication.Instead he conveyed me to my bed and stood watch over me. SlowlyI came back from a weird, unfamiliar world to reassuring everydayreality. The horror softened and gave way to a feeling of goodfortune and gratitude, the more normal perceptions and thoughtsreturned, and I became more confident that the danger of insanitywas conclusively past. Now, little by little I could begin to enjoy theunprecedented colors and plays of shapes that persisted behind myclosed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me,alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves incircles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearrangingand hybridizing themselves in constant flux. It was particularlyremarkable how every acoustic perception, such as the sound of adoor handle or a passing automobile, became transformed intooptical perceptions. Every sound generated a vividly changingimage, with its own consistent form and color. Late in the evening my wife returned from Lucerne.Someone had informed her by telephone that I was suffering amysterious breakdown. She had returned home at once, leaving thechildren behind with her parents. By now, I had recovered myselfsufficiently to tell her what had happened. Exhausted, I then slept, to awake next morningrefreshed, with a clear head, though still somewhat tiredphysically. A sensation of well-being and renewed life flowedthrough me. Breakfast tasted delicious and gave me extraordinarypleasure. When I later walked out into the garden, in which thesun shone now after a spring rain, everything glistened andsparkled in a fresh light. The world was as if newly created. Allmy senses vibrated in a condition of highest sensitivity, whichpersisted for the entire day. This self-experiment showed that LSD-25 behaved asa psychoactive substance with extraordinary properties andpotency. There was to my knowledge no other known substance thatevoked such profound psychic effects in such extremely low doses,that caused such dramatic changes in human consciousness and ourexperience of the inner and outer world. What seemed even more significant was that I couldremember the experience of LSD inebriation in every detail. Thiscould only mean that the conscious recording function was notinterrupted, even in the climax of the LSD experience, despitethe profound breakdown of the normal world view. For the entireduration of the experiment, I had even been aware ofparticipating in an experiment, but despite this recognition ofmy condition, I could not, with every exertion of my will, shakeoff the LSD world. Everything was experienced as completely real,as alarming reality; alarming, because the picture of the other,familiar everyday reality was still fully preserved in the memoryfor comparison. Another surprising aspect of LSD was its ability toproduce such a far-reaching, powerful state of inebriationwithout leaving a hangover. Quite the contrary, on the day afterthe LSD experiment I felt myself to be, as already described, inexcellent physical and mental condition. I was aware that LSD, a new active compound withsuch properties, would have to be of use in pharmacology, inneurology, and especially in psychiatry, and that it wouldattract the interest of concerned specialists. But at that time Ihad no inkling that the new substance would also come to be usedbeyond medical science, as an inebriant in the drug scene. Sincemy self-experiment had revealed LSD in its terrifying, demonicaspect, the last thing I could have expected was that thissubstance could ever find application as anything approaching apleasure drug. I failed, moreover, to recognize the meaningfulconnection between LSD inebriation and spontaneous visionaryexperience until much later, after further experiments, whichwere carried out with far lower doses and under differentconditions. The next day I wrote to Professor Stoll theabove-mentioned report about my extraordinary experience withLSD-25 and sent a copy to the director of the pharmacologicaldepartment, Professor Rothlin. As expected, the first reaction was incredulousastonishment. Instantly a telephone call came from themanagement; Professor Stoll asked: "Are you certain you madeno mistake in the weighing? Is the stated dose reallycorrect?" Professor Rothlin also called, asking the samequestion. I was certain of this point, for I had executed theweighing and dosage with my own hands. Yet their doubts werejustified to some extent, for until then no known substance haddisplayed even the slightest psychic effect infraction-of-a-milligram doses. An active compound of such potencyseemed almost unbelievable. Professor Rothlin himself and two of his colleagueswere the first to repeat my experiment, with only one-third ofthe dose I had utilized. But even at that level, the effects werestill extremely impressive, and quite fantastic. All doubts aboutthe statements in my report were eliminated.

LSD in Animal Experiments and Biological Research After the discovery of its extraordinary psychiceffects, the substance LSD-25, which five years earlier had beenexcluded from further investigation after the first trials onanimals, was again admitted into the series of experimentalpreparations. Most of the fundamental studies on animals werecarried out by Dr. Aurelio Cerletti in the Sandoz pharmacologicaldepartment, headed by Professor Rothlin. Before a new active substance can be investigatedin systematic clinical trials with human subjects, extensive dataon its effects and side effects must be determined inpharmacological tests on animals. These experiments must assaythe assimilation and elimination of the particular substance inorganisms, and above all its tolerance and relative toxicity.Only the most important reports on animal experiments with LSD,and those intelligible to the layperson, will be reviewed here.It would greatly exceed the scope of this book if I attempted tomention all the results of several hundred pharmacologicalinvestigations, which have been conducted all over the world inconnection with the fundamental work on LSD in the Sandozlaboratories. Animal experiments reveal little about the mentalalterations caused by LSD because psychic effects are scarcelydeterminable in lower animals, and even in the more highlydeveloped, they can be established only to a limited extent. LSDproduces its effects above all in the sphere of the higher andhighest psychic and intellectual functions. It is thereforeunderstandable that specific reactions to LSD can be expectedonly in higher animals. Subtle psychic changes cannot beestablished in animals because, even if they should be occurring,the animal could not give them expression. Thus, only relativelyheavy psychic disturbances, expressing themselves in the alteredbehavior of research animals, become discernible. Quantities thatare substantially higher than the effective dose of LSD in humanbeings are therefore necessary, even in higher animals like cats,dogs, and apes. While the mouse under LSD shows only motordisturbances and alterations in licking behavior, in the cat wesee, besides vegetative symptoms like bristling of the hair(piloerection) and salivation, indications that point to theexistence of hallucinations. The animals stare anxiously in theair, and instead of attacking the mouse, the cat leaves it aloneor will even stand in fear before the mouse. One could alsoconclude that the behavior of dogs that are under the influenceof LSD involves hallucinations. A caged community of chimpanzeesreacts very sensitively if a member of the tribe has receivedLSD. Even though no changes appear in this single animal, thewhole cage gets in an uproar because the LSD chimpanzee no longerobserves the laws of its finely coordinated hierarchic tribalorder. Of the remaining animal species on which LSD wastested, only aquarium fish and spiders need be mentioned here. Inthe fish, unusual swimming postures were observed, and in thespiders, alterations in web building were apparently produced byLSD. At very low optimum doses the webs were even betterproportioned and more exactly built than normally: however, withhigher doses, the webs were badly and rudimentarily made. How Toxic Is LSD? The toxicity of LSD has been determined invarious animal species. A standard for the toxicity of asubstance is the LD50, or the median lethal dose, thatis, the dose with which 50 percent of the treated animals die. Ingeneral it fluctuates broadly, according to the animal species,and so it is with LSD. The LD50 for the mouse amountsto 50-60 mg/kg. i.v. (that is, 50 to 60 thousandths of a gram ofLSD per kilogram of animal weight upon injection of an LSDsolution into the veins). In the rat the LD50 drops to16.5 mg/kg, and in rabbits to 0.3 mg/kg. One elephant given 0.297g of LSD died after a few minutes. The weight of this animal wasdetermined to be 5,000 kg, which corresponds to a lethal dose of0.06 mg/kg (0.06 thousandths of a gram per kilogram of bodyweight). Because this involves only a single case, this valuecannot be generalized, but we can at least deduce from it thatthe largest land animal reacts proportionally very sensitively toLSD, since the lethal dose in elephants must be some 1,000 timeslower than in the mouse. Most animals die from a lethal dose ofLSD by respiratory arrest. The minute doses that cause death in animalexperiments may give the impression that LSD is a very toxicsubstance. However, if one compares the lethal dose in animalswith the effective dose in human beings, which is 0.0003-0.001mg/kg (0.0003 to 0.001 thousandths of a gram per kilogram of bodyweight), this shows an extraordinarily low toxicity for LSD. Onlya 300- to 600-fold overdose of LSD, compared to the lethal dosein rabbits, or fully a 50,000- to 100,000fold overdose, incomparison to the toxicity in the mouse, would have fatal resultsin human beings. These comparisons of relative toxicity are, tobe sure, only understandable as estimates of orders of magnitude,for the determination of the therapeutic index (that is, theratio between the effective and the lethal dose) is onlymeaningful within a given species. Such a procedure is notpossible in this case because the lethal dose of LSD for humansis not known. To my knowledge, there have not as yet occurred anycasualties that are a direct consequence of LSD poisoning.Numerous episodes of fatal consequences attributed to LSDingestion have indeed been recorded, but these were accidents,even suicides, that may be attributed to the mentally disorientedcondition of LSD intoxication. The danger of LSD lies not in itstoxicity, but rather in the unpredictability of its psychiceffects. Some years ago reports appeared in the scientificliterature and also in the lay press, alleging that damage tochromosomes or the genetic material had been caused by LSD. Theseeffects, however, have been observed in only a few individualcases. Subsequent comprehensive investigations of a large,statistically significant number of cases, however, showed thatthere was no connection between chromosome anomalies and LSDmedication. The same applies to reports about fetal deformitiesthat had allegedly been produced by LSD. In animal experiments,it is indeed possible to induce fetal deformities throughextremely high doses of LSD, which lie well above the doses usedin human beings. But under these conditions, even harmlesssubstances produce such damage. Examination of reportedindividual cases of human fetal deformities reveals, again, noconnection between LSD use and such injury. If there had been anysuch connection, it would long since have attracted attention,for several million people by now have taken LSD. Pharmacological Properties of LSD LSD is absorbed easily and completely throughthe gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore unnecessary to injectLSD, except for special purposes. Experiments on mice withradioactively labeled LSD have established that intravenouslyinjected LSD disappeared down to a small vestige, very rapidlyfrom the bloodstream and was distributed throughout the organism.Unexpectedly, the lowest concentration is found in the brain. Itis concentrated here in certain centers of the midbrain that playa role in the regulation of emotion. Such findings giveindications as to the localization of certain psychic functionsin the brain. The concentration of LSD in the various organsattains maximum values 10 to 15 minutes after injection, thenfalls off again swiftly. The small intestine, in which theconcentration attains the maximum within two hours, constitutesan exception. The elimination of LSD is conducted for the mostpart (up to some 80 percent) through the intestine via liver andbile. Only 1 to 10 percent of the elimination product exists asunaltered LSD; the remainder is made up of various transformationproducts. As the psychic effects of LSD persist even after itcan no longer be detected in the organism, we must assume thatLSD is not active as such, but that it rather triggers certainbiochemical, neurophysiological, and psychic mechanisms thatprovoke the inebriated condition and continue in the absence ofthe active principle. LSD stimulates centers of the sympathetic nervoussystem in the midbrain, which leads to pupillary dilatation,increase in body temperature, and rise in the blood-sugar level.The uterine-constricting activity of LSD has already beenmentioned. An especially interesting pharmacological propertyof LSD, discovered by J. H. Gaddum in England, is itsserotonin-blocking effect. Serotonin is a hormone-like substance,occurring naturally in various organs of warm-blooded animals.Concentrated in the midbrain, it plays an important role in thepropagation of impulses in certain nerves and therefore in thebiochemistry of psychic functions. The disruption of naturalfunctioning of serotonin by LSD was for some time regarded as anexplanation of its psychic effects. However, it was soon shownthat even certain derivatives of LSD (compounds in which thechemical structure of LSD is slightly modified) that exhibit nohallucinogenic properties, inhibit the effects of serotonin justas strongly, or yet more strongly, than unaltered LSD. Theserotonin-blocking effect of LSD thus does not suffice to explainits hallucinogenic properties. LSD also influences neurophysiological functionsthat are connected with dopamine, which is, like serotonin, anaturally occurring hormone-like substance. Most of the braincenters receptive to dopamine become activated by LSD, while theothers are depressed. As yet we do not know the biochemical mechanismsthrough which LSD exerts its psychic effects. Investigations ofthe interactions of LSD with brain factors like serotonin anddopamine, however, are examples of how LSD can serve as a tool inbrain research, in the study of the biochemical processes thatunderlie the psychic functions.

Chemical Modifications of LSD When a new type of active compound is discovered inpharmaceutical-chemical research, whether by isolation from aplant drug or from animal organs, or through synthetic productionas in the case of LSD, then the chemist attempts, throughalterations in its molecular structure, to produce new compoundswith similar, perhaps improved activity, or with other valuableactive properties. We call this process a chemicalmodification of this type of active substance. Of theapproximately 20,000 new substances that are produced annually inthe pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratories of the world,the overwhelming majority are modification products ofproportionally few types of active compounds. The discovery of areally new type of active substance—new with regard tochemical structure and pharmacological effect—is a rarestroke of luck. Soon after the discovery of the psychic effects ofLSD, two coworkers were assigned to join me in carrying out thechemical modification of LSD on a broader basis and in furtherinvestigations in the field of ergot alkaloids. The work on thechemical structure of ergot alkaloids of the peptide type, towhich ergotamine and the alkaloids of the ergotoxine groupbelong, continued with Dr. Theodor Petrzilka. Working with Dr.Franz Troxler, I produced a great number of chemicalmodifications of LSD, and we attempted to gain further insightsinto the structure of lysergic acid, for which the Americanresearchers had already proposed a structural formula. In 1949 wesucceeded in correcting this formula and specifying the validstructure of this common nucleus of all ergot alkaloids,including of course LSD. The investigations of the peptide alkaloids ofergot led to the complete structural formulas of thesesubstances, which we published in 1951. Their correctness wasconfirmed through the total synthesis of ergotamine, which wasrealized ten years later in collaboration with two youngercoworkers, Dr. Albert J. Frey and Dr. Hans Ott. Another coworker,Dr. Paul A. Stadler, was largely responsible for the developmentof this synthesis into a process practicable on an industrialscale. The synthetic production of peptide ergot alkaloids usinglysergic acid obtained from special cultures of the ergot fungusin tanks has great economic importance. This procedure is used toproduce the starting material for the medicaments Hydergine andDihydergot. Now we return to the chemical modifications of LSD.Many LSD derivatives were produced, since 1945, in collaborationwith' Dr. Troxler, but none proved hallucinogenically more activethan LSD. Indeed, the very closest relatives proved themselvesessentially less active in this respect. There are four different possibilities of spatialarrangement of atoms in the LSD molecule. They are differentiatedin technical language by the prefix iso- and the letters Dand L. Besides LSD, which is more precisely designated asD-lysergic acid diethylamide, I have also produced and likewisetested in self-experiments the three other spatially differentforms, namely D-isolysergic acid diethylamide (iso-LSD),L-lysergic acid diethylamide (L-LSD), and L-isolysergic aciddiethylamide (L-iso-LSD). The last three forms of LSD showed nopsychic effects up to a dose of 0.5 mg, which corresponds to a20-fold quantity of a still distinctly active LSD dose. A substance very closely related to LSD, themonoethylamide of lysergic acid (LAE-23), in which an ethyl groupis replaced by a hydrogen atom on the diethylamide residue ofLSD, proved to be some ten times less psychoactive than LSD. Thehallucinogenic effect of this substance is also qualitativelydifferent: it is characterized by a narcotic component. Thisnarcotic effect is yet more pronounced in lysergic acid amide(LA-111), in which both ethyl groups of LSD are displaced byhydrogen atoms. These effects, which I established in comparativeself-experiments with LA-111 and LAE-32, were corroborated bysubsequent clinical investigations. Fifteen years later we encountered lysergic acidamide, which had been produced synthetically for theseinvestigations, as a naturally occurring active principle of theMexican magic drug ololiuqui. In a later chapter I shalldeal more fully with this unexpected discovery. Certain results of the chemical modification of LSDproved valuable to medicinal research; LSD derivatives were foundthat were only weakly or not at all hallucinogenic, but insteadexhibited other effects of LSD to an increased extent. Such aneffect of LSD is its blocking effect on the neurotransmitterserotonin (referred to previously in the discussion of thepharmacological properties of LSD). As serotonin plays a role inallergic-inflammatory processes and also in the generation ofmigraine, a specific serotonin-blocking substance was of greatsignificance to medicinal research. We therefore searchedsystematically for LSD derivatives without hallucinogeniceffects, but with the highest possible activity as serotoninblockers. The first such active substance was found in bromo-LSD,which has become known in medicinal-biological research under thedesignation BOL-148. In the course of our investigations onserotonin antagonists, Dr. Troxler produced in the sequel yetstronger and more specifically active compounds. The most activeentered the medicinal market as a medicament for the treatment ofmigraine, under the trademark "Deseril" or, inEnglish-speaking countries, "Sansert."

Use of LSD in Psychiatry Soon after LSD was tried on animals, the firstsystematic investigation of the substance was carried out onhuman beings, at the psychiatric clinic of the University ofZurich. Werner A. Stoll, M.D. (a son of Professor Arthur Stoll),who led this research, published his results in 1947 in the SchweizerArchiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie, under the title"Lysergs�ure-diathyl�mid, ein Phantastikum aus derMutterkorngruppe" [Lysergic acid diethylamide, aphantasticum from the ergot group]. The tests involved healthy research subjects aswell as schizophrenic patients. The dosages—substantiallylower than in my first self-experiment with 0.25 mg LSDtartrate—amounted to only 0.02 to 0.13 mg. The emotionalstate during the LSD inebriation was here predominantly euphoric,whereas in my experiment the mood was marked by grave sideeffects resulting from overdosage and, of course, fear of theuncertain outcome. This fundamental publication, which gave ascientific description of all the basic features of LSDinebriation, classified the new active principle as aphantasticum. However, the question of therapeutic applicationof LSD remained unanswered. On the other hand, the reportemphasized the extraordinarily high activity of LSD, whichcorresponds to the activity of trace substances occurring in theorganism that are considered to be responsible for certain mentaldisorders. Another subject discussed in this first publicationwas the possible application of LSD as a research tool inpsychiatry, which follows from its tremendous psychic activity. First Self-Experiment by a Psychiatrist In his paper, W. A. Stoll also gave a detaileddescription of his own personal experiment with LSD. Since thiswas the first self-experiment published by a psychiatrist, andsince it describes many characteristic features of LSDinebriation, it is interesting to quote extensively from thereport. I warmly thank the author for kind permission torepublish this extract. At 8 o'clock I took 60 mcg (0.06 milligrams) of LSD. Some 20 minutes later, the first symptoms appeared: heaviness in the limbs, slight atactic (i.e., confused, uncoordinated) symptoms. A subjectively very unpleasant phase of general malaise followed, in parallel with the drop in blood pressure registered by the examiners. A certain euphoria then set in, though it seemed weaker to me than experiences in an earlier experiment. The ataxia increased, and I went "sailing" around the room with large strides. I felt somewhat better, but was glad to lie down. Afterward the room was darkened (dark experiment); there followed an unprecedented experience of unimaginable intensity that kept increasing in strength. It w as characterized by an unbelievable profusion of optical hallucinations that appeared and vanished with great speed, to make way for countless new images. I saw a profusion of circles, vortices, sparks, showers, crosses, and spirals in constant, racing flux. The images appeared to stream in on me predominantly from the center of the visual field, or out of the lower left edge. When a picture appeared in the middle, the remaining field of vision was simultaneously filled up with a vast number of similar visions. All were colored: bright, luminous red, yellow, and green predominated. I never managed to linger on any picture. When the supervisor of the experiment emphasized my great fantasies, the richness of my statements, I could only react with a sympathetic smile. I knew, in fact, that I could not retain, much less describe, more than a fraction of the pictures. I had to force myself to give a description. Terms such as "fireworks" or "kaleidoscopic" were poor and inadequate. I felt that I had to immerse myself more and more deeply into this strange and fascinating world, in order to allow the exuberance, the unimaginable wealth, to work on me. At first, the hallucinations were elementary: rays, bundles of rays, rain, rings, vortices, loops, sprays, clouds, etc. Then more highly organized visions also appeared: arches, rows of arches, a sea of roofs, desert landscapes, terraces, flickering fire, starry skies of unbelievable splendor. The original, more simple images continued in the midst of these more highly organized hallucinations. I remember the following images in particular: A succession of towering, Gothic vaults, an endless choir, of which I could not see the lower portions. A landscape of skyscrapers, reminiscent of pictures of the entrance to New York harbor: house towers staggered behind and beside one another with innumerable rows of windows. Again the foundation was missing. A system of masts and ropes, which reminded me of a reproduction of a painting seen the previous day (the inside of a circus tent). An evening sky of an unimaginable pale blue over the dark roofs of a Spanish city. I had a peculiar feeling of anticipation, was full of joy and decidedly ready for adventure. All at once the stars flared up, amassed, and turned to a dense rain of stars and sparks that streamed toward me. City and sky had disappeared. I was in a garden, saw brilliant red, yellow, and green lights falling through a dark trelliswork, an indescribably joyous experience. It was significant that all the images consisted of countless repetitions of the same elements: many sparks, many circles, many arches, many windows, many fires, etc. I never saw isolated images, but always duplications of the same image, endlessly repeated. I felt myself one with all romanticists and dreamers, thought of E. T. A. Hoffmann, saw the maelstrom of Poe (even though, at the time I had read Poe, his description seemed exaggerated). Often I seemed to stand at the pinnacle of artistic experience; I luxuriated in the colors of the altar of Isenheim, and knew the euphoria and exultation of an artistic vision. I must also have spoken again and again of modern art; I thought of abstract pictures, which all at once I seemed to understand. Then again, there were impressions of an extreme trashiness, both in their shapes and their color combinations. The most garish, cheap modern lamp ornaments and sofa pillows came into my mind. The train of thought was quickened. But I had the feeling the supervisor of the experiment could still keep up with me. Of course I knew, intellectually, that I was rushing him. At first I had descriptions rapidly at hand. With the increasingly frenzied pace, it became impossible to think a thought through to the end. I must have only started many sentences. When I tried to restrict myself to specific subjects, the experiment proved most unsuccessful. My mind would even focus, in a certain sense, on contrary images: skyscrapers instead of a church, a broad desert instead of a mountain. I assumed that I had accurately estimated the elapsed time, but did not take the matter very seriously. Such questions did not interest me in the slightest. My state of mind was consciously euphoric. I enjoyed the condition, was serene, and took a most active interest in the experience. From time to time I opened my eyes. The weak red light seemed mysterious, much more than before. The busily writing research supervisor appeared to me to be very far away. Often I had peculiar bodily sensations: I believed my hands to be attached to some distant body, but was not certain whether it was my own. After termination of the first dark experiment, I strolled about in the room a bit, was unsure on my legs, and again felt less well. I became cold and was thankful that the research supervisor covered me with a blanket. I felt unkempt, unshaven, and unwashed. The room seemed strange and broad. Later I squatted on a high stool, thinking all the while that I sat there like a bird on the roost. The supervisor emphasized my own wretched appearance. He seemed remarkably graceful. I myself had small, finely formed hands. As I washed them, it was happening a long way from me, somewhere down below on the right. It was questionable, but utterly unimportant, whether they were my own hands. In the landscape outside, well known to me, many things appeared to have changed. Besides the hallucinations, I could now see the real as well. Later this was no longer possible, although I remained aware that reality was otherwise. A barracks, and the garage standing before it to the left, suddenly changed to a landscape of ruins, shattered to pieces. I saw wall wreckage and projecting beams, inspired undoubtedly by the memory of the war events in this region. In a uniform, extensive field, I kept seeing figures, which I tried to draw, but could get no farther than the crudest beginnings. I saw an extremely opulent sculptural ornamentation in constant metamorphosis, in continuous flux. I was reminded of every possible foreign culture, saw Mexican, Indian motifs. Between a grating of small beams and tendrils appeared little caricatures, idols, masks, strangely mixed all of a sudden with childish drawings of people. The tempo was slackened compared to the dark experiment. The euphoria had now vanished. I became depressed, especially during the second dark experiment, which followed. Whereas during the first dark experiment, the hallucinations had alternated with great rapidity in bright and luminous colors, now blue, violet, and dark green prevailed. The movement of larger images was slower milder, quieter, although even these were composed of finely raining "elemental dots," which streamed and whirled about quickly. During the first dark experiment, the commotion had frequently intruded upon me; now it often led distinctly away from me into the center of the picture, where a sucking mouth appeared. I saw grottoes with fantastic erosions and stalactites, reminding me of the child's book Im Wunderreiche des Bergkonigs [In the wondrous realm of the mountain king]. Serene systems of arches rose up. On the right-hand side, a row of shed roofs suddenly appeared; I thought of an evening ride homeward during military service. Significantly it involved a homeward ride: there was no longer anything like departure or love of adventure. I felt protected, enveloped by motherliness, was in peace. The hallucinations were no longer exciting, but instead mild and attenuated. Somewhat later I had the feeling of possessing the same motherly strength. I perceived an inclination, a desire to help, and behaved then in an exaggeratedly sentimental and trashy manner, where medical ethics are concerned. I realized this and was able to stop. But the depressed state of mind remained. I tried again and again to see bright and joyful images. But to no avail; only dark blue and green patterns emerged. I longed to imagine bright fire as in the first dark experiment. And I did see fires; however, they were sacrificial fires on the gloomy battlement of a citadel on a remote, autumnal heath. Once I managed to behold a bright ascending multitude of sparks, but at half-altitude it transformed itself into a group of silently moving spots from a peacock's tail. During the experiment I was very impressed that my state of mind and the type of hallucinations harmonized so consistently and uninterruptedly. During the second dark experiment I observed that random noises, and also noises intentionally produced by the supervisor of the experiment, provoked simultaneous changes in the optical impressions (synesthesia). In the same manner, pressure on the eyeball produced alterations of visual perceptions. Toward the end of the second dark experiment, I began to watch for sexual fantasies, which were, however, totally absent. In no way could I experience sexual desire. I wanted to imagine a picture of a woman; only a crude modern-primitive sculpture appeared. It seemed completely unerotic, and its forms were immediately replaced by agitated circles and loops. After the second dark experiment I felt benumbed and physically unwell. I perspired, was exhausted. I was thankful not to have to go to the cafeteria for lunch. The laboratory assistant who brought us the food appeared to me small and distant, of the same remarkable daintiness as the supervisor of the experiment. Sometime around 3:00 P.M. I felt better, so that the supervisor could pursue his work. With some effort I managed to take notes myself. I sat at the table, wanted to read, but could not concentrate. Once I seemed to myself like a shape from a surrealistic picture, whose limbs were not connected with the body, but were rather painted somewhere close by.... I was depressed and thought with interest of the possibility of suicide. With some terror I apprehended that such thoughts were remarkably familiar to me. It seemed singularly self-evident that a depressed person commits suicide.... On the way home and in the evening I was again euphoric, brimming with the experiences of the morning. I had experienced unexpected, impressive things. It seemed to me that a great epoch of my life had been crowded into a few hours. I was tempted to repeat the experiment. The next day I was careless in my thinking and conduct, had great trouble concentrating, was apathetic. . . . The casual, slightly dream-like condition persisted into the afternoon. I had great trouble reporting in any organized way on a simple problem. I felt a growing general weariness, an increasing awareness that I had now returned to everyday reality. The second day after the experiment brought an irresolute state.... Mild, but distinct depression was experienced during the following week, a feeling which of course could be related only indirectly to LSD. The Psychic Effects of LSD The picture of the activity of LSD obtained fromthese first investigations was not new to science. It largelymatched the commonly held view of mescaline, an alkaloid that hadbeen investigated as early as the turn of the century. Mescalineis the psychoactive constituent of a Mexican cactus Lophophorawilliamsii (syn. Anhalonium lewinii). This cactus hasbeen eaten by American Indians ever since pre-Columbian times,and is still used today as a sacred drug in religious ceremonies.In his monograph Phantastica (Verlag Georg Stilke, Berlin,1924), L. Lewin has amply described the history of this drug,called peyotl by the Aztecs. The alkaloid mescaline was isolatedfrom the cactus by A. Heffter in 1896, and in 1919 its chemicalstructure was elucidated and it was produced synthetically by E.Spath. It was the first hallucinogen or phantasticum (as thistype of active compound was described by Lewin) to becomeavailable as a pure substance, permitting the study of chemicallyinduced changes of sensory perceptions, mental illusions(hallucinations), and alterations of consciousness. In the 1920sextended experiments with mescaline were carried out on animaland human subjects and described comprehensively by K. Beringerin his book Der Meskalinrausch (Verlag Julius Springer,Berlin, 1927). Because these investigations failed to indicateany applications of mescaline in medicine, interest in thisactive substance waned. With the discovery of LSD, hallucinogen researchreceived a new impetus. The novelty of LSD as opposed tomescaline was its high activity, lying in a different order ofmagnitude. The active dose of mescaline, 0.2 to 0.5 g, iscomparable to 0.00002 to 0.0001 g of LSD; in other words, LSD issome 5,000 to 10,000 times more active than mescaline. LSD's unique position among thepsychopharmaceuticals is not only due to its high activity, in aquantitative sense. The substance also has qualitativesignificance: it manifests a high specificity, that is, anactivity aimed specifically at the human psyche. It can beassumed, therefore, that LSD affects the highest control centersof the psychic and intellectual functions. The psychic effects of LSD, which are produced bysuch minimal quantities of material, are too meaningful and toomultiform to be explained by toxic alterations of brain function.If LSD acted only through a toxic effect on the brain, then LSDexperiences would be entirely psychopathological in meaning,without any psychological or psychiatric interest. On thecontrary, it is likely that alterations of nerve conductivity andinfluence on the activity of nerve connections (synapses), whichhave been experimentally demonstrated, play an important role.This could mean that an influence is being exerted on theextremely complex system of cross-connections and synapsesbetween the many billions of brain cells, the system on which thehigher psychic and intellectual functions depend. This would be apromising area to explore in the search for an explanation ofLSD's radical efficacy. The nature of LSD's activity could lead to numerouspossibilities of medicinal-psychiatric uses, as W. A. Stoll'sground-breaking studies had already shown. Sandoz therefore madethe new active substance available to research institutes andphysicians as an experimental drug, giving it the trade nameDelysid (D-Lysergs�ure-di�thylamid) which I had proposed. Theprinted prospectus below describes possible applications of thiskind and voices the necessary precautions. Delysid (LSD 25) D-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate Sugar-coated tablets containing 0.025 mg. (25 �g) Ampoules of 1 ml. containing 0.1 mg. (100 �g) for oral administration The solution may also be injected s.c. or i.v. The effect is identical with that of oral administration but sets in more rapidly. PROPERTIES The administration of very small doses ofDelysid (1/2-2 �g/kg body weight) results in transitorydisturbances of affect, hallucinations, depersonalization,reliving of repressed memories, and mild neurovegetativesymptoms. The effect sets in after 30 to 90 minutes and generallylasts 5 to 12 hours. However, intermittent disturbances of affectmay occasionally persist for several days. METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION For oral administration the contents of 1 ampoule of Delysidare diluted with distilled water, a 1% solution of tartaric acidor halogen-free tap water. The absorption of the solution issomewhat more rapid and more constant than that of the tablets.Ampoules which have not been opened, which have been protectedagainst light and stored in a cool place are stable for anunlimited period. Ampoules which have been opened or dilutedsolutions retain their effectiveness for 1 to 2 days, if storedin a refrigerator. INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE a) Analytical psychotherapy, to elicit release of repressedmaterial and provide mental relaxation, particularly in anxietystates and obsessional neuroses. The initial dose is 25 �g (1/4 of an ampoule or 1 tablet). Thisdose is increased at each treatment by 25 �g until the optimumdose (usually between 50 and 200 �g) is found. The individualtreatments are best given at intervals of one week. b) Experimental studies on the nature of psychoses: By takingDelysid himself, the psychiatrist is able to gain an insight intothe world of ideas and sensations of mental patients. Delysid canalso be used to induce model psychoses of short duration innormal subjects, thus facilitating studies on the pathogenesis ofmental disease. In normal subjects, doses of 25 to 75 �g re generally sufficientto produce a hallucinatory psychosis (on an average 1 �g/kg bodyweight). In certain forms of psychosis and in chronic alcoholism,higher doses are necessary (2 to 4 �g/kg body weight). PRECAUTIONS Pathological mental conditions may beintensified by Delysid. Particular caution is necessary insubjects with a suicidal tendency and in those cases where apsychotic development appears imminent. The psycho-affectiveliability and the tendency to commit impulsive acts mayoccasionally last for some days. Delysid should only be administered under strictmedical supervision. The supervision should not be discontinueduntil the effects of the drug have completely orn off. ANTIDOTE The mental effects of Delysid can be rapidlyreversed by the i.m. administration of 50 mg chlorpromazine. Literature available on request. SANDOZ LTD., BASLE, SWITZERLAND The use of LSD in analytical psychotherapy is basedmainly on the following psychic effects. In LSD inebriation the accustomed world viewundergoes a deep-seated transformation and disintegration.Connected with this is a loosening or even suspension of theI-you barrier. Patients who are bogged down in an egocentricproblem cycle can thereby be helped to release themselves fromtheir fixation and isolation. The result can be an improvedrapport with the doctor and a greater susceptibility topsychotherapeutic influence. The enhanced suggestibility underthe influence of LSD works toward the same goal. Another significant, psychotherapeutically valuablecharacteristic of LSD inebriation is the tendency of longforgotten or suppressed contents of experience to appear again inconsciousness. Traumatic events, which are sought inpsychoanalysis, may then become accessible to psychotherapeutictreatment. Numerous case histories tell of experiences from eventhe earliest childhood that were vividly recalled duringpsychoanalysis under the influence of LSD. This does not involvean ordinary recollection, but rather a true reliving; not a r�miniscence,but rather a r�viviscence, as the French psychiatristJean Delay has formulated it. LSD does not act as a true medicament; rather itplays the role of a drug aid in the context of psychoanalytic andpsychotherapeutic treatment and serves to channel the treatmentmore effectively and to shorten its duration. It can fulfill thisfunction in two particular ways. In one procedure, which was developed in Europeanclinics and given the name psychotytic therapy, moderatelystrong doses of LSD are administered in several successivesessions at regular intervals. Subsequently the LSD experiencesare worked out in group discussions, and in expression therapy bydrawing and painting. The term psycholytic therapy wascoined by Ronald A. Sandison, an English therapist of Jungianorientation and a pioneerof clinical LSD research. The root -lysisor -lytic signifies the dissolution of tension orconflicts in the human psyche. In a second procedure, which is the favoredtreatment in the United States, a single, very high LSD dose (0.3to 0.6 mg) is administered after correspondingly intensivepsychological preparation of the patients. This method, describedas psychedelic therapy, attempts to induce amystical-religious experience through the shock effects of LSD.This experience can then serve as a starting point for arestructuring and curing of the patient's personality in theaccompanying psychotherapeutic treatment. The term psychedelic,which can be translated as "mind-manifesting" or"mind-expanding," was introduced by Humphry Osmond, apioneer of LSD research in the United States. LSD's apparent benefits as a drug auxiliary inpsychoanalysis and psychotherapy are derived from propertiesdiametrically opposed to the effects of tranquilizer-typepsychopharmaceuticals. Whereas tranquilizers tend to cover up thepatient's problems and conflicts, reducing their apparent gravityand importance: LSD, on the contrary, makes them more exposed andmore intensely experienced. This clearer recognition of problemsand conflicts makes them, in turn, more susceptible topsychotherapeutic treatment. The suitability and success of LSD inpsychoanalysis and psychotherapy are still a subject ofcontroversy in professional circles. The same could be said,however, of other procedures employed in psychiatry such aselectroshock, insulin therapy, or psychosurgery, procedures thatentail, moreover, a far greater risk than the use of LSD, whichunder suitable conditions can be considered practically safe. Because forgotten or repressed experiences, underthe influence of LSD, may become conscious with considerablespeed, the treatment can be correspondingly shortened. To somepsychiatrists, however, this reduction of the therapy's durationis a disadvantage. They are of the opinion that thisprecipitation leaves the patient insufficient time forpsychotherapeutic working-through. The therapeutic effect theybelieve, persists for a shorter time than when there is a gradualtreatment, including a slow process of becoming conscious of thetraumatic experiences. Psycholytic and especially psychedelic therapyrequire thorough preparation of the patient for the LSDexperience, to avoid his or her being frightened by the unusualand the unfamiliar. Only then is a positive interpretation of theexperience possible. The selection of patients is also important,since not all types of psychic disturbance respond equally wellto these methods of treatment. Successful use of LSD-assistedpsychoanalysis and psychotherapy presupposes specific knowledgeand experience. In this respect self-examination by psychiatrists,as W. A. Stoll has pointed out, can be most useful. They providethe doctors with direct insight, based on firsthand experienceinto the strange world of LSD inebriation, and make it possiblefor them truly to understand these phenomena in their patients,to interpret them properly, and to take full advantage of them. The following pioneers in use of LSD as a drug aidin psychoanalysis and psychotherapy deserve to be named in thefront rank: A. K. Busch and W. C. Johnson, S. Cohen and B.Eisner, H. A. Abramson, H. Osmond, and A. Hoffer in the UnitedStates; R. A. Sandison in England; W. Frederking and H. Leuner inGermany; and G. Roubicek and S. Grof in Czechoslovakia. The second indication for LSD cited in the Sandozprospectus on Delysid concerns its use in experimentalinvestigations on the nature of psychoses. This arises from thefact that extraordinary psychic states experimentally produced byLSD in healthy research subjects are similar to manymanifestations of certain mental disturbances. In the early daysof LSD research, it was often claimed that LSD inebriation hassomething to do with a type of "model psychosis." Thisidea was dismissed, however, because extended comparativeinvestigations showed that there were essential differencesbetween the manifestations of psychosis and the LSD experience.With the LSD model, nevertheless, it is possible to studydeviations from the normal psychic and mental condition, and toobserve the biochemical and electrophysiological alterationsassociated with them. Perhaps we shall thereby gain new insightsinto the nature of psychoses. According to certain theories,various mental disturbances could be produced by psychotoxicmetabolic products that have the power, even in minimalquantities, to alter the functions of brain cells. LSD representsa substance that certainly does not occur in the human organism,but whose existence and activity let it seem possible thatabnormal metabolic products could exist, that even in tracequantities could produce mental disturbances. As a result, theconception of a biochemical origin of certain mental disturbanceshas received broader support, and research in this direction hasbeen stimulated. One medicinal use of LSD that touches onfundamental ethical questions is its administration to the dying.This practice arose from observations in American clinics thatespecially severe painful conditions of cancer patients, which nolonger respond to conventional pain-relieving medication, couldbe alleviated or completely abolished by LSD. Of course, thisdoes not involve an analgesic effect in the true sense. Thediminution of pain sensitivity may rather occur because patientsunder the influence of LSD are psychologically so dissociatedfrom their bodies that physical pain no longer penetrates theirconsciousness. In order for LSD to be effective in such cases, itis especially crucial that patients be prepared and instructedabout the kind of experiences and transformations that awaitthem. In many cases it has proved beneficial for either a memberof the clergy or a psychotherapist to guide the patient'sthoughts in a religious direction. Numerous case histories tellof patients who gained meaningful insights about life and deathon their deathbeds as, freed from pain in LSD ecstasy andreconciled to their fate, they faced their earthly demisefearlessly and in peace. The hitherto existing knowledge about theadministration of LSD to the terminally ill has been summarizedand published by S. Grof and J. Halifax in their book TheHuman Encounter with Death (E. P. Dutton, New York, 1977).The authors, together with E. Kast, S. Cohen, and W. A. Pahnke,are among the pioneers of this application of LSD. The most recent comprehensive publication on theuse of LSD in psychiatry, Realms of the Human Unconscious:Observations from LSD Research (The Viking Press, New York,1975), likewise comes from S. Grof, the Czech psychiatrist whohas emigrated to the United States. This book offers a criticalevaluation of the LSD experience from the viewpoint of Freud andJung, as well as of existential analysis.

From Remedy to Inebriant During the first years after its discovery, LSDbrought me the same happiness and gratification that anypharmaceutical chemist would feel on learning that a substance heor she produced might possibly develop into a valuablemedicament. For the creation of new remedies is the goal of apharmaceutical chemist's research activity; therein lies themeaning of his or her work. Nonmedical Use of LSD This joy at having fathered LSD was tarnishedafter more than ten years of uninterrupted scientific researchand medicinal use when LSD was swept up in the huge wave of aninebriant mania that began to spread over the Western world,above all the United States, at the end of the 1950s. It wasstrange how rapidly LSD adopted its new role as inebriant and,for a time, became the number-one inebriating drug, at least asfar as publicity was concerned. The more its use as an inebriantwas disseminated, bringing an upsurge in the number of untowardincidents caused by careless, medically unsupervised use, themore LSD became a problem child for me and for the Sandoz firm. It was obvious that a substance with such fantasticeffects on mental perception and on the experience of the outerand inner world would also arouse interest outside medicalscience, but I had not expected that LSD, with its unfathomablyuncanny, profound effects, so unlike the character of arecreational drug, would ever find worldwide use as an inebriant.I had expected curiosity and interest on the part of artistsoutside of medicine—performers, painters, andwriters—but not among people in general. After thescientific publications around the turn of the century onmescaline—which, as already mentioned, evokes psychiceffects quite like those of LSD—the use of this compoundremained confined to medicine and to experiments within artisticand literary circles. I had expected the same fate for LSD. Andindeed, the first non-medicinal self-experiments with LSD werecarried out by writers, painters, musicians, and otherintellectuals. LSD sessions had reportedly provoked extraordinaryaesthetic experiences and granted new insights into the essenceof the creative process. Artists were influenced in theircreative work in unconventional ways. A particular type of artdeveloped that has become known as psychedelic art. It comprisescreations produced under the influenced of LSD and otherpsychedelic drugs, whereby the drugs acted as stimulus and sourceof inspiration. The standard publication in this field is thebook by Robert E. L. Masters and Jean Houston, Psychedelic Art(Balance House, 1968). Works of psychedelic art are not createdwhile the drug is in effect, but only afterward, the artist beinginspired by these experiences. As long as the inebriatedcondition lasts, creative activity is impeded, if not completelyhalted. The influx of images is too great and is increasing toorapidly to be portrayed and fashioned. An overwhelming visionparalyzes activity. Artistic productions arising directly fromLSD inebriation, therefore, are mostly rudimentary in characterand deserve consideration not because of their artistic merit,but because they are a type of psychoprogram, which offersinsight into the deepest mental structures of the artist,activated and made conscious by LSD. This was demonstrated laterin a large-scale experiment by the Munich psychiatrist Richard P.Hartmann, in which thirty famous painters took part. He publishedthe results in his book Malerei aus Bereichen des Unbewussten:Kunstler Experimentieren unter LSD [Painting from spheres ofthe unconscious: artists experiment with LSD], Verlag M. Du MontSchauberg, Cologne, 1974). LSD experiments also gave new impetus toexploration into the essence of religious and mysticalexperience. Religious scholars and philosophers discussed thequestion whether the religious and mystical experiences oftendiscovered in LSD sessions were genuine, that is, comparable tospontaneous mysticoreligious enlightenment. This nonmedicinal yet earnest phase of LSDresearch, at times in parallel with medicinal research, at timesfollowing it, was increasingly overshadowed at the beginning ofthe 1960s, as LSD use spread with epidemic-like speed through allsocial classes, as a sensational inebriating drug, in the courseof the inebriant mania in the United States. The rapid rise ofdrug use, which had its beginning in this country about twentyyears ago, was not, however, a consequence of the discovery ofLSD, as superficial observers often declared. Rather it haddeep-seated sociological causes: materialism, alienation fromnature through industrialization and increasing urbanization,lack of satisfaction in professional employment in a mechanized,lifeless working world, ennui and purposelessness in a wealthy,saturated society, and lack of a religious, nurturing, andmeaningful philosophical foundation of life. The existence of LSD was even regarded by the drugenthusiasts as a predestined coincidence—it had to bediscovered precisely at this time in order to bring help topeople suffering under the modern conditions. It is notsurprising that LSD first came into circulation as an inebriatingdrug in the United States, the country in whichindustrialization, urbanization, and mechanization, even ofagriculture, are most broadly advanced. These are the samefactors that have led to the origin and growth of the hippiemovement that developed simultaneously with the LSD wave. The twocannot be dissociated. It would be worth investigating to whatextent the consumption of psychedelic drugs furthered the hippiemovement and conversely. The spread of LSD from medicine and psychiatry intothe drug scene was introduced and expedited by publications onsensational LSD experiments that, although they were carried outin psychiatric clinics and universities, were not then reportedin scientific journals, but rather in magazines and daily papers,greatly elaborated. Reporters made themselves available as guineapigs. Sidney Katz, for example, participated in an LSD experimentin the Saskatchewan Hospital in Canada under the supervision ofnoted psychiatrists; his experiences, however, were not publishedin a medical journal. Instead, he described them in an articleentitled "My Twelve Hours as a Madman" in his magazine MacLean'sCanada National Magazine, colorfully illustrated in fancifulfullness of detail. The widely distributed German magazine Quick,in its issue number 12 of 21 March 1954, reported a sensationaleyewitness account on "Ein kuhnes wissenschaftlichesExperiment" [a daring scientific experiment] by the painterWilfried Zeller, who took "a few drops of lysergicacid" in the Viennese University Psychiatric Clinic. Of thenumerous publications of this type that have made effective laypropaganda for LSD, it is sufficient to cite just one moreexample: a large-scale, illustrated article in Lookmagazine of September 1959. Entitled "The Curious StoryBehind the New Cary Grant," it must have contributedenormously to the diffusion of LSD consumption. The famous moviestar had received LSD in a respected clinic in California, in thecourse of a psychotherapeutic treatment. He informed the Lookreporter that he had sought inner peace his whole life long, butyoga, hypnosis, and mysticism had not helped him. Only thetreatment with LSD had made a new, self-strengthened man out ofhim, so that after three frustrating marriages he now believedhimself really able to love and make a woman happy. The evolution of LSD from remedy to inebriatingdrug was, however, primarily promoted by the activities of Dr.Timothy Leary and Dr. Richard Alpert of Harvard University. In alater section I will come to speak in more detail about Dr. Learyand my meetings with this personage who has become knownworldwide as an apostle of LSD. Books also appeared on the U.S. market in which thefantastic effects of LSD were reported more fully. Here only twoof the most important will be mentioned: Exploring Inner Spaceby Jane Dunlap (Harcourt Brace and World, New York, 1961) and MySelf and I by Constance A. Newland (N A.L. Signet Books, NewYork, 1963). Although in both cases LSD was used within the scopeof a psychiatric treatment, the authors addressed their books,which became bestsellers, to the broad public. In her book,subtitled "The Intimate and Completely Frank Record of OneWoman's Courageous Experiment with Psychiatry's Newest Drug, LSD25," Constance A. Newland described in intimate detail howshe had been cured of frigidity. After such avowals, one caneasily imagine that many people would want to try the wondrousmedicine for themselves. The mistaken opinion created by suchreports— that it would be sufficient simply to take LSD inorder to accomplish such miraculous effects and transformationsin oneself—soon led to broad diffusion ofself-experimentation with the new drug. Objective, informative books about LSD and itsproblems also appeared, such as the excellent work by thepsychiatrist Dr. Sidney Cohen, The Beyond Within(Atheneum, New York, 1967), in which the dangers of careless useare clearly exposed. This had, however, no power to put a stop tothe LSD epidemic. As LSD experiments were often carried out inignorance of the uncanny, unforeseeable, profound effects, andwithout medical supervision, they frequently came to a bad end.With increasing LSD consumption in the drug scene, there came anincrease in "horror trips"—LSD experiments thatled to disoriented conditions and panic, often resulting inaccidents and even crime. The rapid rise of nonmedicinal LSD consumption atthe beginning of the 1960s was also partly attributable to thefact that the drug laws then current in most countries did notinclude LSD. For this reason, drug habitu�s changed from thelegally proscribed narcotics to the still-legal substance LSD.Moreover, the last of the Sandoz patents for the production ofLSD expired in 1963, removing a further hindrance to illegalmanufacture of the drug. The rise of LSD in the drug scene caused our firm anonproductive, laborious burden. National control laboratoriesand health authorities requested statements from us aboutchemical and pharmacological properties, stability and toxicityof LSD, and analytical methods for its detection in confiscateddrug samples, as well as in the human body, in blood and urine.This brought a voluminous correspondence, which expanded inconnection with inquiries from all over the world aboutaccidents, poisonings, criminal acts, and so forth, resultingfrom misuse of LSD. All this meant enormous, unprofitabledifficulties, which the business management of Sandoz regardedwith disapproval. Thus it happened one day that Professor Stoll,managing director of the firm at the time, said to mereproachfully: "I would rather you had not discoveredLSD." At that time, I was now and again assailed bydoubts whether the valuable pharmacological and psychic effectsof LSD might be outweighed by its dangers and by possibleinjuries due to misuse. Would LSD become a blessing for humanity,or a curse? This I often asked myself when I thought about myproblem child. My other preparations, Methergine,Dihydroergotamine, and Hydergine, caused me no such problems anddifficulties. They were not problem children; lacking extravagantproperties leading to misuse, they have developed in a satisfyingmanner into therapeutically valuable medicines. The publicity about LSD attained its high point inthe years 1964 to 1966, not only with regard to enthusiasticclaims about the wondrous effects of LSD by drug fanatics andhippies, but also to reports of accidents, mental breakdowns,criminal acts, murders, and suicide under the influence of LSD. Averitable LSD hysteria reigned. Sandoz Stops LSD Distribution In view of this situation, the management ofSandoz was forced to make a public statement on the LSD problemand to publish accounts of the corresponding measures that hadbeen taken. The pertinent letter, dated 23 August 1965, by Dr. A.Cerletti, at the time director of the Pharmaceutical Departmentof Sandoz, is reproduced below: Decision Regarding LSD 25 and Other Hallucinogenic Substances More than twenty years have elapsed since the discovery by Albert Hofmann of LSD 25 in the SANDOZ Laboratories. Whereas the . fundamental importance of this discovery may be assessed by its impact on the development of modern psychiatric research, it must be recognized that it placed a heavy burden of responsibility on SANDOZ, the owner of this product. The finding of a new chemical with outstanding biological properties, apart from the scientific success implied by its synthesis, is usually the first decisive step toward profitable development of a new drug. In the case of LSD, however, it soon became clear that, despite the outstanding properties of this compound, or rather because of the very nature of these qualities, even though LSD was fully protected by SANDOZ-owned patents since the time of its first synthesis in 1938, the usual means of practical exploitation could not be envisaged. On the other hand, all the evidence obtained following the initial studies in animals and humans carried out in the SANDOZ research laboratories pointed to the important role that this substance could play as an investigational tool in neurological research and in psychiatry. It was therefore decided to make LSD available free of charge to qualified experimental and clinical investigators all over the world. This broad research approach was assisted by the provision of any necessary technical aid and in many instances also by financial support. An enormous amount of scientific documents, published mainly in the international biochemical and medical literature and systematically listed in the "SANDOZ Bibliography on LSD" as well as in the "Catalogue of Literature on Delysid" periodically edited by SANDOZ, gives vivid proof of what has been achieved by following this line of policy over nearly two decades. By exercising this kind of "nobile officium" in accordance with the highest standards of medical ethics with all kinds of self-imposed precautions and restrictions, it was possible for many years to avoid the danger of abuse (i.e., use by people neither competent nor qualified), which is always inherent in a compound with exceptional CNS activity. In spite of all our precautions, cases of LSD abuse have occurred from time to time in varying circumstances completely beyond the control of SANDOZ. Very recently this danger has increased considerably and in some parts of the world has reached the scale of a serious threat to public health. This state of affairs has now reached a critical point for the following reasons: (1) A worldwide spread of misconceptions of LSD has been caused by an increasing amount of publicity aimed at provoking an active interest in laypeople by means of sensational stories and statements; (2) In most countries no adequate legislation exists to control and regulate the production and distribution of substances like LSD; (3) The problem of availability of LSD, once limited on technical grounds, has fundamentally changed with the advent of mass production of lysergic acid by fermentation procedures. Since the last patent on LSD expired in 1963, it is not surprising to find that an increasing number of dealers in fine chemicals are offering LSD from unknown sources at the high price known to be paid by LSD fanatics. Taking into consideration all the above-mentioned circumstances and the flood of requests for LSD which has now become uncontrollable, the pharmaceutical management of SANDOZ has decided to stop immediately all further production and distribution of LSD. The same policy will apply to all derivatives or analogues of LSD with hallucinogenic properties as well as to Psilocybin, Psilocin, and their hallucinogenic congeners. For a while the distribution of LSD andpsilocybin was stopped completely by Sandoz. Most countries hadsubsequently proclaimed strict regulations concerning possession,distribution, and use of hallucinogens, so that physicians,psychiatric clinics, and research institutes, if they couldproduce a special permit to work with these substances from therespective national health authorities, could again be suppliedwith LSD and psilocybin. In the United States the NationalInstitute of Mental Health (NIMH) undertook the distribution ofthese agents to licensed research institutes. All these legislative and official precautions,however, had little influence on LSD consumption in the drugscene, yet on the other hand hindered and continue to hindermedicinal-psychiatric use and LSD research in biology andneurology, because many researchers dread the red tape that isconnected with the procurement of a license for the use of LSD.The bad reputation of LSD—its depiction as an "insanitydrug" and a "satanic invention" - constitutes afurther reason why many doctors shunned use of LSD in theirpsychiatric practice. In the course of recent years the uproar ofpublicity about LSD has quieted, and the consumption of LSD as aninebriant has also diminished, as far as that can be concludedfrom the rare reports about accidents and other regrettableoccurrences following LSD ingestion. It may be that the decreaseof LSD accidents, however, is not simply due to a decline in LSDconsumption. Possibly the recreational users, with time, havebecome more aware of the particular effects and dangers of LSDand more cautious in their use of this drug. Certainly LSD, whichwas for a time considered in the Western world, above all in theUnited States, to be the number-one inebriant, has relinquishedthis leading role to other inebriants such as hashish and thehabituating, even physically destructive drugs like heroin andamphetamine. The last-mentioned drugs represent an alarmingsociological and public health problem today. Dangers of Nonmedicinal LSD Experiments While professional use of LSD in psychiatryentails hardly any risk, the ingestion of this substance outsideof medical practice, without medical supervision, is subject tomultifarious dangers. These dangers reside, on the one hand, inexternal circumstances connected with illegal drug use and, onthe other hand, in the peculiarity of LSD's psychic effects. The advocates of uncontrolled, free use of LSD andother hallucinogens base their attitude on two claims: (l) thistype of drug produces no addiction, and (2) until now no dangerto health from moderate use of hallucinogens has beendemonstrated. Both are true. Genuine addiction, characterized bythe fact that psychic and often severe physical disturbancesappear on withdrawal of the drug, has not been observed, even incases in which LSD was taken often and over a long period oftime. No organic injury or death as a direct consequence of anLSD intoxication has yet been reported. As discussed in greaterdetail in the chapter "LSD in Animal Experiments andBiological Research," LSD is actually a relatively nontoxicsubstance in proportion to its extraordinarily high psychicactivity. Psychotic Reactions Like the other hallucinogens, however, LSD isdangerous in an entirely different sense. While the psychic andphysical dangers of the addicting narcotics, the opiates,amphetamines, and so forth, appear only with chronic use, thepossible danger of LSD exists in every single experiment. This isbecause severe disoriented states can appear during any LSDinebriation. It is true that through careful preparation of theexperiment and the experimenter such episodes can largely beavoided, but they cannot be excluded with certainty. LSD crisesresemble psychotic attacks with a manic or depressive character. In the manic, hyperactive condition, the feeling ofomnipotence or invulnerability can lead to serious casualties.Such accidents have occurred when inebriated persons confused inthis way—believing themselves to be invulnerable—walkedin front of a moving automobile or jumped out a window in thebelief that they were able to fly. This type of LSD casualty,however, is not so common as one might be led to think on thebasis of reports that were sensationally exaggerated by the massmedia. Nevertheless, such reports must serve as serious warnings. On the other hand, a report that made the roundsworldwide, in 1966, about an alleged murder committed under theinfluence on LSD, cannot be true. The suspect, a young man in NewYork accused of having killed his mother-in-law, explained at hisarrest, immediately after the fact, that he knew nothing of thecrime and that he had been on an LSD trip for three days. But anLSD inebriation, even with the highest doses, lasts no longerthan twelve hours, and repeated ingestion leads to tolerance,which means that extra doses are ineffective. Besides, LSDinebriation is characterized by the fact that the personremembers exactly what he or she has experienced. Presumably thedefendant in this case expected leniency for extenuatingcircumstances, owing to unsoundness of mind. The danger of a psychotic reaction is especiallygreat if LSD is given to someone without his or her knowledge.This was demonstrated in an episode that took place soon afterthe discovery of LSD, during the first investigations with thenew substance in the Zurich University Psychiatric Clinic, whenpeople were not yet aware of the danger of such jokes. A youngdoctor, whose colleagues had slipped LSD into his coffee as alark, wanted to swim across Lake Zurich during the winter at-20!C (-4!F) and had to be prevented by force. There is a different danger when the LSD-induceddisorientation exhibits a depressive rather than manic character.In the course of such an LSD experiment, frightening visions,death agony, or the fear of becoming insane can lead to athreatening psychic breakdown or even to suicide. Here the LSDtrip becomes a "horror trip." The demise of a Dr. Olson, who had been given LSDwithout his knowledge in the course of U.S. Army drugexperiments, and who then committed suicide by jumping from awindow, caused a particular sensation. His family could notunderstand how this quiet, well-adjusted man could have beendriven to this deed. Not until fifteen years later, when thesecret documents about the experiments were published, did theylearn the true circumstances, whereupon the president of theUnited States publicly apologized to the dependents. The conditions for the positive outcome of an LSDexperiment, with little possibility of a psychotic derailment,reside on the one hand in the individual and on the other hand inthe external milieu of the experiment. The internal, personalfactors are called set, the external conditions setting. The beauty of a living room or of an outdoorlocation is perceived with particular force because of the highlystimulated sense organs during LSD inebriation, and such anamenity has a substantial influence on the course of theexperiment. The persons present, their appearance, their traits,are also part of the setting that determines the experience. Theacoustic milieu is equally significant. Even harmless noises canturn to torment, and conversely lovely music can develop into aeuphoric experience. With LSD experiments in ugly or noisysurroundings, however, there is greater danger of a negativeoutcome, including psychotic crises. The machine- andappliance-world of today offers much scenery and all types ofnoise that could very well trigger panic during enhancedsensibility. Just as meaningful as the external milieu of theLSD experience, if not even more important, is the mentalcondition of the experimenters, their current state of mind,their attitude to the drug experience, and their expectationsassociated with it. Even unconscious feelings of happiness orfear can have an effect. LSD tends to intensify the actualpsychic state. A feeling of happiness can be heightened to bliss,a depression can deepen to despair. LSD is thus the mostinappropriate means imaginable for curing a depressive state. Itis dangerous to take LSD in a disturbed, unhappy frame of mind,or in a state of fear. The probability that the experiment willend in a psychic breakdown is then quite high. Among persons with unstable personality structures,tending to psychotic reactions, LSD experimentation ought to becompletely avoided. Here an LSD shock, by releasing a latentpsychosis, can produce a lasting mental injury. The psyche of very young persons should also beconsidered as unstable, in the sense of not yet having matured.In any case, the shock of such a powerful stream of new andstrange perceptions and feelings, such as is engendered by LSD,endangers the sensitive, still-developing psycho-organism. Eventhe medicinal use of LSD in youths under eighteen years of age,in the scope of psychoanalytic or psychotherapeutic treatment, isdiscouraged in professional circles, correctly so in my opinion.Juveniles for the most part still lack a secure, solidrelationship to reality. Such a relationship is needed before thedramatic experience of new dimensions of reality can bemeaningfully integrated into the world view. Instead of leadingto a broadening and deepening of reality consciousness, such anexperience in adolescents will lead to insecurity and a feelingof being lost. Because of the freshness of sensory perception inyouth and the still-unlimited capacity for experience,spontaneous visionary experiences occur much more frequently thanin later life. For this reason as well, psychostimulating agentsshould not be used by juveniles. Even in healthy, adult persons, even with adherenceto all of the preparatory and protective measures discussed, anLSD experiment can fail, causing psychotic reactions. Medicalsupervision is therefore earnestly to be recommended, even fornonmedicinal LSD experiments. This should include an examinationof the state of health before the experiment. The doctor need notbe present at the session; however, medical help should at alltimes be readily available. Acute LSD psychoses can be cut short and broughtunder control quickly and reliably by injection of chlorpromazineor another sedative of this type. The presence of a familiar person, who can requestmedical help in the event of an emergency, is also anindispensable psychological assurance. Although the LSDinebriation is characterized mostly by an immersion in theindividual inner world, a deep need for human contact sometimesarises, especially in depressive phases. LSD from the Black Market Nonmedicinal LSD consumption can bring dangersof an entirely different type than hitherto discussed: for mostof the LSD offered in the drug scene is of unknown origin. LSDpreparations from the black market are unreliable when it comesto both quality and dosage. They rarely contain the declaredquantity, but mostly have less LSD, often none at all, andsometimes even too much. In many cases other drugs or evenpoisonous substances are sold as LSD. These observations weremade in our laboratory upon analysis of a great number of LSDsamples from the black market. They coincide with the experiencesof national drug control departments. The unreliability in the strength of LSDpreparations on the illicit drug market can lead to dangerousoverdosage. Overdoses have often proved to be the cause of failedLSD experiments that led to severe psychic and physicalbreakdowns. Reports of alleged fatal LSD poisoning, however, haveyet to be confirmed. Close scrutiny of such cases invariablyestablished other causative factors. The following case, which took place in 1970, iscited as an example of the possible dangers of black market LSD.We received for investigation from the police a drug powderdistributed as LSD. It came from a young man who was admitted tothe hospital in critical condition and whose friend had alsoingested this preparation and died as a result. Analysis showedthat the powder contained no LSD, but rather the very poisonousalkaloid strychnine. If most black market LSD preparations containedless than the stated quantity and often no LSD at all, the reasonis either deliberate falsification or the great instability ofthis substance. LSD is very sensitive to air and light. It isoxidatively destroyed by the oxygen in the air and is transformedinto an inactive substance under the influence of light. Thismust be taken into account during the synthesis and especiallyduring the production of stable, storable forms of LSD. Claimsthat LSD may easily be prepared, or that every chemistry studentin a half-decent laboratory is capable of producing it, areuntrue. Procedures for synthesis of LSD have indeed beenpublished and are accessible to everyone. With these detailedprocedures in hand, chemists would be able to carry out thesynthesis, provided they had pure lysergic acid at theirdisposal; its possession today, however, is subject to the samestrict regulations as LSD. In order to isolate LSD in purecrystalline form from the reaction solution and in order toproduce stable preparations, however, special equipment and noteasily acquired specific experience are required, owing (asstated previously) to the great instability of this substance. Only in completely oxygen-free ampules protectedfrom light is LSD absolutely stable. Such ampules, containing 100�g (= 0.1 mg) LSD-tartrate (tartaric acid salt of LSD) in 1 ccof aqueous solution, were produced for biological research andmedicinal use by the Sandoz firm. LSD in tablets prepared withadditives that inhibit oxidation, while not absolutely stable, atleast keeps for a longer time. But LSD preparations often foundon the black market—LSD that has been applied in solutiononto sugar cubes or blotting paper—decompose in the courseof weeks or a few months. With such a highly potent substance as LSD, thecorrect dosage is of paramount importance. Here the tenet ofParacelsus holds good: the dose determines whether a substanceacts as a remedy or as a poison. A controlled dosage, however, isnot possible with preparations from the black market, whoseactive strength is in no way guaranteed. One of the greatestdangers of non-medicinal LSD experiments lies, therefore, in theuse of such preparations of unknown provenience. The Case of Dr. Leary Dr. Timothy Leary, who has become knownworldwide in his role of drug apostle, had an extraordinarilystrong influence on the diffusion of illegal LSD consumption inthe United States. On the occasion of a vacation in Mexico in theyear 1960, Leary had eaten the legendary "sacredmushrooms," which he had purchased from a shaman. During themushroom inebriation he entered into a state of mystico-religiousecstasy, which he described as the deepest religious experienceof his life. From then on, Dr. Leary, who at the time was alecturer in psychology at Harvard University in Cambridge,Massachusetts, dedicated himself totally to research on theeffects and possibilities of the use of psychedelic drugs.Together with his colleague Dr. Richard Alpert, he startedvarious research projects at the university, in which LSD andpsilocybin, isolated by us in the meantime, were employed. The reintegration of convicts into society, theproduction of mystico-religious experiences in theologians andmembers of the clergy, and the furtherance of creativity inartists and writers with the help of LSD and psilocybin weretested with scientific methodology. Even persons like AldousHuxley, Arthur Koestler, and Allen Ginsberg participated in theseinvestigations. Particular consideration was given to thequestion, to what degree mental preparation and expectation ofthe subjects, along with the external milieu of the experiment,are able to influence the course and character of states ofpsychedelic inebriation. In January 1963, Dr. Leary sent me a detailedreport of these studies, in which he enthusiastically impartedthe positive results obtained and gave expression to his beliefsin the advantages and very promising possibilities of such use ofthese active compounds. At the same time, the Sandoz firmreceived an inquiry about the supply of 100g LSD and 25 kgpsilocybin, signed by Dr. Timothy Leary, from the HarvardUniversity Department of Social Relations. The requirement forsuch an enormous quantity (the stated amounts correspond to 1million doses of LSD and 2.5 million doses of psilocybin) wasbased on the planned extension of investigations to tissue,organ, and animal studies. We made the supply of these substancescontingent upon the production of an import license on behalf ofthe U.S. health authorities. Immediately we received the orderfor the stated quantities of LSD and psilocybin, along with acheck for $10,000 as deposit but without the required importlicense. Dr. Leary signed for this order, but no longer aslecturer at Harvard University, rather as president of anorganization he had recently founded, the InternationalFederation for Internal Freedom (IFIF). Because, in addition, ourinquiry to the appropriate dean of Harvard University had shownthat the university authorities did not approve of thecontinuation of the research project by Leary and Alpert, wecanceled our offer upon return of the deposit. Shortly thereafter, Leary and Alpert weredischarged from the teaching staff of Harvard- University becausethe investigations, at first conducted in an academic milieu, hadlost their scientific character. The experiments had turned intoLSD parties. The LSD trip—LSD as a ticket to an adventurousjourney into new worlds of mental and physicalexperience—became the latest exciting fashion among academicyouth, spreading rapidly from Harvard to other universities.Leary's doctrine—that LSD not only served to find the divineand to discover the self, but indeed was the most potentaphrodisiac yet discovered—surely contributed quitedecisively to the rapid propagation of LSD consumption among theyounger generation. Later, in an interview with the monthlymagazine Playboy, Leary said that the intensification of sexualexperience and the potentiation of sexual ecstasy by LSD was oneof the chief reasons for the LSD boom. After his expulsion from Harvard University, Learywas completely transformed from a psychology lecturer pursuingresearch, into the messiah of the psychedelic movement. He andhis friends of the IFIF founded a psychedelic research center inlovely, scenic surroundings in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. I received apersonal invitation from Dr. Leary to participate in a top-levelplanning session on psychedelic drugs, scheduled to take placethere in August 1963. I would gladly have accepted this grandinvitation, in which I was offered reimbursement for travelexpenses and free lodging, in order to learn from personalobservation the methods, operation, and the entire atmosphere ofsuch a psychedelic research center, about which contradictory, tosome extent very remarkable, reports were then circulating.Unfortunately, professional obligations kept me at that momentfrom flying to Mexico to get a picture at first hand of thecontroversial enterprise. The Zihuatanejo Research Center did notlast long. Leary and his adherents were expelled from the countryby the Mexican government. Leary, however, who had now become notonly the messiah but also the martyr of the psychedelic movement,soon received help from the young New York millionaire WilliamHitchcock, who made a manorial house on his large estate inMillbrook, New York, available to Leary as new home andheadquarters. Millbrook was also the home of another foundationfor the psychedelic, transcendental way of life, the CastaliaFoundation. On a trip to India in 1965 Leary was converted toHinduism. In the following year he founded a religious community,the League for Spiritual Discovery, whose initials give theabbreviation "LSD." Leary's proclamation to youth, condensed in hisfamous slogan "Turn on, tune in, drop out !", became acentral dogma of the hippie movement. Leary is one of thefounding fathers of the hippie cult. The last of these threeprecepts, "drop out," was the challenge to escape frombourgeois life, to turn one's back on society, to give up school,studies, and employment, and to dedicate oneself wholly to thetrue inner universe, the study of one's own nervous system, afterone has turned on with LSD. This challenge above all went beyondthe psychological and religious domain to assume social andpolitical significance. It is therefore understandable that Learynot only became the enfant terrible of the university andamong his academic colleagues in psychology and psychiatry, butalso earned the wrath of the political authorities. He was,therefore, placed under surveillance, followed, and ultimatelylocked in prison. The high sentences—ten years' imprisonmenteach for convictions in Texas and California concerningpossession of LSD and marijuana, and conviction (lateroverturned) with a sentence of thirty years' imprisonment formarijuana smuggling—show that the punishment of theseoffenses was only a pretext: the real aim was to put under lockand key the seducer and instigator of youth, who could nototherwise be prosecuted. On the night of 13-14 September 1970,Leary managed to escape from the California prison in San LuisObispo. On a detour from Algeria, where he made contact withEldridge Cleaver, a leader of the Black Panther movement livingthere in exile, Leary came to Switzerland and there petitionedfor political asylum. Meeting with Timothy Leary Dr. Leary lived with his wife, Rosemary, in theresort town Villars-sur-Ollon in western Switzerland. Through theintercession of Dr. Mastronardi, Dr. Leary's lawyer, contact wasestablished between us. On 3 September 1971, I met Dr. Leary inthe railway station snack bar in Lausanne. The greeting wascordial, a symbol of our fateful relationship through LSD. Learywas medium-sized, slender, resiliently active, his brown facesurrounded with slightly curly hair mixed with gray, youthful,with bright, laughing eyes. This gave Leary somewhat the mark ofa tennis champion rather than that of a former Harvard lecturer.We traveled by automobile to Buchillons, where in the arbor ofthe restaurant A la Grande For�t, over a meal of fish and aglass of white wine, the dialogue between the father and theapostle of LSD finally began. I voiced my regret that the investigations with LSDand psilocybin at Harvard University, which had begunpromisingly, had degenerated to such an extent that theircontinuance in an academic milieu became impossible. My most serious remonstrance to Leary, however,concerned the propagation of LSD use among juveniles. Leary didnot attempt to refute my opinions about the particular dangers ofLSD for youth. He maintained, however, that I was unjustified inreproaching him for the seduction of immature persons to drugconsumption, because teenagers in the United States, with regardto information and life experience, were comparable to adultEuropeans. Maturity, with satiation and intellectual stagnation,would be reached very early in the United States. For thatreason, he deemed the LSD experience significant, useful, andenriching, even for people still very young in years. In this conversation, I further objected to thegreat publicity that Leary sought for his LSD and psilocybininvestigations, since he had invited reporters from daily papersand magazines to his experiments and had mobilized radio andtelevision. Emphasis was thereby placed on publicity rather thanon objective information. Leary defended this publicity programbecause he felt it had been his fateful historic role to make LSDknown worldwide. The overwhelmingly positive effects of suchdissemination, above all among America's younger generation,would make any trifling injuries, any regrettable accidents as aresult of improper use of LSD, unimportant in comparison, a smallprice to pay. During this conversation, I ascertained that onedid Leary an injustice by indiscriminately describing him as adrug apostle. He made a sharp distinction between psychedelicdrugs—LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, hashish—of whosesalutary effects he was persuaded, and the addicting narcoticsmorphine, heroin, etc., against whose use he repeatedlycautioned. My impression of Dr. Leary in this personal meetingwas that of a charming personage, convinced of his mission, whodefended his opinions with humor yet uncompromisingly; a man whotruly soared high in the clouds pervaded by beliefs in thewondrous effects of psychedelic drugs and the optimism resultingtherefrom, and thus a man who tended to underrate or completelyoverlook practical difficulties, unpleasant facts, and dangers.Leary also showed carelessness regarding charges and dangers thatconcerned his own person, as his further path in lifeemphatically showed. During his Swiss sojourn, I met Leary by chanceonce more, in February 1972, in Basel, on the occasion of a visitby Michael Horowitz, curator of the Fitz Hugh Ludlow MemorialLibrary in San Francisco, a library specializing in drugliterature. We traveled together to my house in the country nearBurg, where we resumed our conversation of the previousSeptember. Leary appeared fidgety and detached, probably owing toa momentary indisposition, so that our discussions were lessproductive this time. That was my last meeting with Dr. Leary. He left Switzerland at the end of the year, havingseparated from his wife, Rosemary, now accompanied by his newfriend Joanna Harcourt-Smith. After a short stay in Austria,where he assisted in a documentary film about heroin, Leary andfriend traveled to Afghanistan. At the airport in Kabul he wasapprehended by agents of the American secret service and broughtback to the San Luis Obispo prison in California. After nothing had been heard from Leary for a longtime, his name again appeared in the daily papers in summer 1975with the announcement of a parole and early release from prison.But he was not set free until early in 1976. I learned from hisfriends that he was now occupied with psychological problems ofspace travel and with the exploration of cosmic relationshipsbetween the human nervous system and interstellar space—thatis, with problems whose study would bring him no furtherdifficulties on the part of governmental authorities. Travels in the Universe of the Soul Thus the Islamic scholar Dr. Rudolf Gelpkeentitled his accounts of self-experiments with LSD andpsilocybin, which appeared in the publication Antaios, forJanuary 1962, and this title could also be used for the followingdescriptions of LSD experiments. LSD trips and the space flightsof the astronauts are comparable in many respects. Bothenterprises require very careful preparations, as far as measuresfor safety as well as objectives are concerned, in order tominimize dangers and to derive the most valuable resultspossible. The astronauts cannot remain in space nor the LSDexperimenters in transcendental spheres, they have to return toearth and everyday reality, where the newly acquired experiencesmust be evaluated. The following reports were selected in order todemonstrate how varied the experiences of LSD inebriation can be.The particular motivation for undertaking the experiments wasalso decisive in their selection. Without exception, thisselection involves only reports by persons who have tried LSD notsimply out of curiosity or as a sophisticated pleasure drug, butwho rather experimented with it in the quest for expandedpossibilities of experience of the inner and outer world; whoattempted, with the help of this drug key, to unlock new"doors of perception" (William Blake); or, to continuewith the comparison chosen by Rudolf Gelpke, who employed LSD tosurmount the force of gravity of space and time in the accustomedworld view, in order to arrive thereby at new outlooks andunderstandings in the "universe of the soul." The first two of the following research records aretaken from the previously cited report by Rudolf Gelpke inAntaios. Dance of the Spirits in the Wind (0.075 mg LSD on 23 June 1961, 13:00 hours) After I had ingested this dose, which could be considered average, I conversed very animatedly with a professional colleague until approximately 14:00 hours. Following this, I proceeded alone to the Werthm�ller bookstore where the drug now began to act most unmistakably. I discerned, above all, that the subjects of the books in which I rummaged peacefully in the back of the shop were indifferent to me, whereas random details of my surroundings suddenly stood out strongly, and somehow appeared to be "meaningful." . . . Then, after some ten minutes, I was discovered by a married couple known to me, and had to let myself become involved in a conversation with them that, I admit, was by no means pleasant to me, though not really painful either. I listened to the conversation (even to myself) " as from far away. " The things that were discussed (the conversation dealt with Persian stories that I had translated) "belonged to another world": a world about which I could indeed express myself (I had, after all, recently still inhabited it myself and remembered the "rules of the game"!), but to which I no longer possessed any emotional connection. My interest in it was obliterated—only I did not dare to let myself observe that. After I managed to dismiss myself, I strolled farther through the city to the marketplace. I had no "visions," saw and heard everything as usual, and yet everything was also altered in an indescribable way; "imperceptible glassy walls" everywhere. With every step that I took, I became more and more like an automaton. It especially struck me that I seemed to lose control over my facial musculature—I was convinced that my face was grown stiff, completely expressionless, empty, slack and mask-like. The only reason I could still walk and put myself in motion, was because I remembered that, and how I had "earlier" gone and moved myself. But the farther back the recollection went, the more uncertain I became. I remember that my own hands somehow were in my way: I put them in my pockets, let them dangle, entwined them behind my back . . . as some burdensome objects, which must be dragged around with us and which no one knows quite how to stow away. I had the same reaction concerning my whole body. I no longer knew why it was there, and where I should go with it. All sense for decisions of that kind had been lost . They could only be reconstructed laboriously, taking a detour through memories from the past. It took a struggle of this kind to enable me to cover the short distance from the marketplace to my home, which I reached at about 15:10. In no way had I had the feeling of being inebriated. What I experienced was rather a gradual mental extinction. It was not at all frightening; but I can imagine that in the transition to certain mental disturbances - naturally dispersed over a greater interval—a very similar process happens: as long as the recollection of the former individual existence in the human world is still present, the patient who has become unconnected can still (to some extent) find his way about in the world: later, however, when the memories fade and ultimately die out, he completely loses this ability. Shortly after I had entered my room, the "glassy stupor" gave way. I sat down, with a view out of a window, and was at once enraptured: the window was opened wide, the diaphanous gossamer curtains, on the other hand, were drawn, and now a mild wind from the outside played with these veils and with the silhouettes of potted plants and leafy tendrils on the sill behind, which the sunlight delineated on the curtains breathing in the breeze. This spectacle captivated me completely. I "sank" into it, saw only this gentle and incessant waving and rocking of the plant shadows in the sun and the wind. I knew what "it" was, but I sought after the name for it, after the formula, after the "magic word" that I knew and already I had it: Totentanz, the dance of the dead.... This was what the wind and the light were showing me on the screen of gossamer. Was it frightening? Was I afraid? Perhaps—at first. But then a great cheerfulness infiltrated me, and I heard the music of silence, and even my soul danced with the redeemed shadows to the whistle of the wind. Yes, I understood: this is the curtain, and this curtain itself IS the secret, the "ultimate" that it concealed. Why, therefore, tear it up? He who does that only tears up himself. Because "there behind," behind the curtain, is "nothing.". . . Polyp from the Deep (0.150 mg LSD on 15 April 1961, 9:15 hours) Beginning of the effect already after about 30 minutes with strong inner agitation, trembling hands, skin chills, taste of metal on the palate. 10:00: The environment of the room transforms itself into phosphorescent waves, running hither from the feet even through my body. The skin—and above all the toes—is as electrically charged; a still constantly growing excitement hinders all clear thoughts.... 10:20: I lack the words to describe my current condition. It is as if an "other" complete stranger were seizing possession of me bit by bit. Have greatest trouble writing ("inhibited" or "uninhibited"?—I don't know!). This sinister process of an advancing self-estrangement aroused in me the feeling of powerlessness, of being helplessly delivered up. Around 10:30, through closed eyes I saw innumerable, self-intertwining threads on a red background. A sky as heavy as lead appeared to press down on everything; I felt my ego compressed in itself, and I felt like a withered dwarf.... Shortly before 13:00 I escaped the more and more oppressing atmosphere of the company in the studio, in which we only hindered one another reciprocally from unfolding completely into the inebriation. I sat down in a small, empty room, on the floor, with my back to the wall, and saw through the only window on the narrow frontage opposite me a bit of gray- white cloudy sky. This, like the whole environment in general, appeared to be hopelessly normal at this moment. I was dejected, and my self seemed so repulsive and hateful to me that I had not dared (and on this day even had actually repeatedly desperately avoided) to look in a mirror or in the face of another person. I very much wished this inebriation were finally finished, but it still had my body totally in its possession. I imagined that I perceived, deep within its stubborn oppressive weight, how it held my limbs surrounded with a hundred polyp arms—yes, I actually experienced this in a mysterious rhythm; electrified contacts, as of a real, indeed imperceptible, but sinister omnipresent being, which I addressed with a loud voice, reviled, bid, and challenged to open combat. "It is only the projection of evil in your self," another voice assured me. "It is your soul monster!" This perception was like a flashing sword. It passed through me with redeeming sharpness. The polyp arms fell away from me—as if cut through—and simultaneously the hitherto dull and gloomy gray-white of the sky behind the open window suddenly scintillated like sunlit water. As I stared at it so enchanted, it changed (for me!) to real water: a subterranean spring overran me, which had ruptured there all at once and now boiled up toward me, wanted to become a storm, a lake, an ocean, with millions and millions of drops—and on all of these drops, on every single one of them, the light danced.... As the room, window, and sky came back into my consciousness (it was 13:25 hours), the inebriation was certainly not at an end—not yet—but its rearguard, which passed by me during the ensuing two hours, very much resembled the rainbow that follows the storm. Both the estrangement from the environment and theestrangement from the individual body, experienced in both of thepreceding experiments described by Gelpke—as well as thefeeling of an alien being, a demon, seizing possession ofoneself—are features of LSD inebriation that, in spite ofall the other diversity and variability of the experience, arecited in most research reports. I have already described thepossession by the LSD demon as an uncanny experience in my firstplanned self-experiment. Anxiety and terror then affected meespecially strongly, because at that time I had no way of knowingthat the demon would again release his victim. The adventures described in the following report,by a painter, belong to a completely different type of LSDexperience. This artist visited me in order to obtain my opinionabout how the experience under LSD should be understood andinterpreted. He feared that the profound transformation of hispersonal life, which had resulted from his experiment with LSD,could rest on a mere delusion. My explanation—that LSD, as abiochemical agent, only triggered his visions but had not createdthem and that these visions rather originated from his ownsoul—gave him confidence in the meaning of histransformation. LSD Experience of a Painter . . . Therefore I traveled with Eva to a solitary mountain valley. Up there in nature, I thought it would be particularly beautiful with Eva. Eva was young and attractive. Twenty years older than she, I was already in the middle of life. Despite the sorrowful consequences that I had experienced previously, as a result of erotic escapades, despite the pain and the disappointments that I inflicted on those who loved me and had believed in me, I was drawn again with irresistible power to this adventure, to Eva, to her youth. I was under the spell of this girl. Our affair indeed was only beginning, but I felt this seductive power more strongly than ever before. I knew that I could no longer resist. For the second time in my life I was again ready to desert my family, to give up my position, to break all bridges. I wanted to hurl myself uninhibitedly into this lustful inebriation with Eva. She was life, youth. Over again it cried out in me, again and again to drain the cup of lust and life until the last drop, until death and perdition. Let the Devil fetch me later on! I had indeed long ago done away with God and the Devil. They were for me only human inventions, which came to be utilized by a skeptical, unscrupulous minority, in order to suppress and exploit a believing, naive majority. I wanted to have nothing to do with this mendacious social moral. To enjoy, at all costs, I wished to enjoy et apr�s nous le deluge. "What is wife to me, what is child to me—let them go begging, if they are hungry." I also perceived the institution of marriage as a social lie. The marriage of my parents and marriages of my acquaintances seemed to confirm that sufficiently for me. Couples remained together because it was more convenient; they were accustomed to it, and "yes, if it weren't for the children . . ." Under the pretense of a good marriage, each tormented the other emotionally, to the point of rashes and stomach ulcers, or each went his own way. Everything in me rebelled against the thought of having to love only one and the same woman a life long. I frankly perceived that as repugnant and unnatural. Thus stood my inner disposition on that portentous summer evening at the mountain lake. At seven o'clock in the evening both of us took a moderately strong dose of LSD, some 0.1 milligrams. Then we strolled along about the lake and then sat on the bank. We threw stones in the water and watched the forming wave circles. We felt a slight inner restlessness. Around eight o'clock we entered the hotel lounge and ordered tea and sandwiches. Some guests still sat there, telling jokes and laughing loudly. They winked at us. Their eyes sparkled strangely. We felt strange and distant and had the feeling that they would notice something in us. Outside it slowly became dark. We decided only reluctantly to go to our hotel room. A street without lights led along the black lake to the distant guest house. As I switched on the light, the granite staircase, leading from the shore road to the house, appeared to flame up from step to step. Eva quivered all at once, frightened. "Hellish" went through my mind, and all of a sudden horror passed through my limbs, and I knew: now it's going to turn out badly. From afar, from the village, a clock struck nine. Scarcely were we in our room, when Eva threw herself on the bed and looked at me with wide eyes. It was not in the least possible to think of love. I sat down on the edge of the bed and held both of Eva's hands. Then came the terror. We sank into a deep, indescribable horror, which neither of us understood. "Look in my eyes, look at me," I implored Eva, yet again and again her gaze was averted from me, and then she cried out loud in terror and trembled all over her body. There was no way out. Outside was only gloomy night and the deep, black lake. In the public house all the lights were extinguished; the people had probably gone to sleep. What would they have said if they could see us now? Possibly they would summon the police, and then everything would become still much worse. A drug scandal—intolerable agonizing thoughts. We could no longer move from the spot. We sat there surrounded by four wooden walls whose board joints shone infernally. It became more unbearable all the time. Suddenly the door was opened and "something dreadful" entered. Eva cried out wildly and hid herself under the bed covers. Once again a cry. The horror under the covers was yet worse. "Look straight in my eyes!" I called to her, but she rolled her eyes back and forth as though out of her mind. She is becoming insane, I realized. In desperation I seized her by the hair so that she could no longer turn her face away from me. I saw dreadful fear in her eyes. Everything around us was hostile and threatening, as if everything wanted to attack us in the next moment. You must protect Eva, you must bring her through until morning, then the effects will discontinue, I said to myself. Then again, however, I plunged into nameless horror. There was no more time or reason; it seemed as if this condition would never end. The objects in the room were animated to caricatures; everything on all sides sneered scornfully. I saw Eva's yellow-black striped shoes, which I had found so stimulating, appearing as two large, evil wasps crawling on the floor. The water piping above the washbasin changed to a dragon head, whose eyes, the two water taps, observed me malevolently. My first name, George, came into my mind, and all at once I felt like Knight George, who must fight for Eva. Eva's cries tore me from these thoughts. Bathed in perspiration and trembling, she fastened herself to me. "I am thirsty," she moaned. With great effort, without releasing Eva's hand, I succeeded in getting a glass of water for her. But the water seemed slimy and viscous, was poisonous, and we could not quench our thirst with it. The two night-table lamps glowed with a strange brightness, in an infernal light. The clock struck twelve. This is hell, I thought. There is indeed no Devil and no demons, and yet they were perceptible in us, filled up the room, and tormented us with unimaginable terror. Imagination, or not? Hallucinations, projections?—insignificant questions when confronted with the reality of fear that was fixed in our bodies and shook us: the fear alone, it existed. Some passages from Huxley's book The Doors of Perception came to me and brought me brief comfort. I looked at Eva, at this whimpering, horrified being in her torment, and felt great remorse and pity. She had become strange to me; I scarcely recognized her any longer. She wore a fine golden chain around her neck with the medallion of the Virgin Mary. It was a gift from her younger brother. I noticed how a benevolent, comforting radiation, which was connected with pure love, emanated from this necklace. But then the terror broke loose again, as if to our final destruction. I needed my whole strength to constrain Eva. Loudly I heard the electrical meter ticking weirdly outside of the door, as if it wanted to make a most important, evil, devastating announcement to me in the next moment. Disdain, derision, and malignity again whispered out of all nooks and crevices. There, in the midst of this agony, I perceived the ringing of cowbells from afar as a wonderful, promising music. Yet soon it became silent again, and renewed fear and dread once again set in. As a drowning man hopes for a rescuing plank, so I wished that the cows would yet again want to draw near the house. But everything remained quiet, and only the threatening tick and hum of the current meter buzzed round us like an invisible, malevolent insect. Morning finally dawned. With great relief I noticed how the chinks in the window shutters lit up. Now I could leave Eva to herself; she had quieted down. Exhausted, she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Shocked and deeply sad, I still sat on the edge of the bed. Gone was my pride and self- assurance; all that remained of me was a small heap of misery. I examined myself in the mirror and started: I had become ten years older in the course of the night. Downcast, I stared at the light of the night-table lamp with the hideous shade of intertwined plastic cords. All at once the light seemed to become brighter, and in the plastic cords it began to sparkle and to twinkle; it glowed like diamonds and gems of all colors, and an overwhelming feeling of happiness welled up in me. All at once, lamp, room, and Eva disappeared, and I found myself in a wonderful, fantastic landscape. It was comparable to the interior of an immense Gothic church nave, with infinitely many columns and Gothic arches. These consisted, however, not of stone, but rather of crystal. Bluish, yellowish, milky, and clearly transparent crystal columns surrounded me like trees in an open forest. Their points and arches became lost in dizzying heights. A bright light appeared before my inner eye, and a wonderful, gentle voice spoke to me out of the light. I did not hear it with my external ear, but rather perceived it, as if it were clear thoughts that arise in one. I realized that in the horror of the passing night I had experienced my own individual condition: selfishness. My egotism had kept me separated from mankind and had led me to inner isolation. I had loved only myself, not my neighbor; loved only the gratification that the other offered me. The world had existed only for the satisfaction of my greed. I had become tough, cold, and cynical. Hell, therefore, had signified that: egotism and lovelessness. Therefore everything had seemed strange and unconnected to me, so scornful and threatening. Amid flowing tears, I was enlightened with the knowledge that true love means surrender of selfishness and that it is not desires but rather selfless love that forms the bridge to the heart of our fellow man. Waves of ineffable happiness flowed through my body. I had experienced the grace of God. But how could it be possible that it was radiating toward me, particularly out of this cheap lampshade? Then the inner voice answered: God is in everything. The experience at the mountain lake has given me the certainty that beyond the ephemeral, material world there also exists an imperishable, spiritual reality, which is our true home. I am now on my way home. For Eva everything remained just a bad dream. We broke up a short time thereafter. The following notes kept by a twenty-five-year-oldadvertising agent are contained in The LSD Story by John Cashman(Fawcett Publications, Greenwich, Conn., 1966). They wereincluded in this selection of LSD reports, along with thepreceding example, because the progression that theydescribe—from terrifying visions to extreme euphoria, a kindof death-rebirth cycle—is characteristic of many LSDexperiments. A Joyous Song of Being My first experience with LSD came at the home of a close friend who served as my guide. The surroundings were comfortably familiar and relaxing. I took two ampuls (200 micrograms) of LSD mixed in half a glass of distilled water. The experience lasted for close to eleven hours, from 8 o'clock on a Saturday evening until very nearly 7 o'clock the next morning. I have no firm point of comparison, but I am positive that no saint ever saw more glorious or joyously beautiful visions or experienced a more blissful state of transcendence. My powers to convey the miracles are shabby and far too inadequate to the task at hand. A sketch, and an artless one at that, must suffice where only the hand of a great master working from a complete palette could do justice to the subject. I must apologize for my own limitations in this feeble attempt to reduce the most remarkable experience of my life to mere words. My superior smile at the fumbling, halting attempts of others in their attempts to explain the heavenly visions to me has been transformed into a knowing smile of a conspirator—the common experience requires no words. My first thought after drinking the LSD was that it was having absolutely no effect. They had told me thirty minutes would produce the first sensation, a tingling of the skin. There was no tingling. I commented on this and was told to relax and wait. For the lack of anything else to do I stared at the dial light of the table radio, nodding my head to a jazz piece I did not recognize. I think it was several minutes before I realized that the light was changing color kaleidoscopically with the different pitch of the musical sounds, bright reds and yellows in the high register, deep purple in the low. I laughed. I had no idea when it had started. I simply knew it had. I closed my eyes, but the colored notes were still there. I was overcome by the remarkable brilliance of the colors. I tried to talk, to explain what I was seeing, the vibrant and luminous colors. Somehow it didn't seem important. With my eyes open, the radiant colors flooded the room, folding over on top of one another in rhythm with the music. Suddenly I was aware that the colors were the music. The discovery did not seem startling. Values, so cherished and guarded, were becoming unimportant. I wanted to talk about the colored music, but I couldn't. I was reduced to uttering one-syllable words while polysyllabic impressions tumbled through my mind with the speed of light. The dimensions of the room were changing, now sliding into a fluttering diamond shape, then straining into an oval shape as if someone were pumping air into the room, expanding it to the bursting point. I was having trouble focusing on objects. They would melt into fuzzy masses of nothing or sail off into space, self-propelled, slow-motion trips that were of acute interest to me. I tried to check the time on my watch, but I was unable to focus on the hands. I thought of asking for the time, but the thought passed. I was too busy seeing and listening. The sounds were exhilarating, the sights remarkable. I was completely entranced. I have no idea how long this lasted. I do know the egg came next. The egg, large, pulsating, and a luminous green, was there before I actually saw it. I sensed it was there. It hung suspended about halfway between where I sat and the far wall. I was intrigued by the beauty of the egg. At the same time I was afraid it would drop to the floor and break. I didn't want the egg to break. It seemed most important that the egg should not break. But even as I thought of this, the egg slowly dissolved and revealed a great multihued flower that was like no flower I have ever seen. Its incredibly exquisite petals opened on the room, spraying indescribable colors in every direction. I felt the colors and heard them as they played across my body, cool and warm, reedlike and tinkling. The first tinge of apprehension came later when I saw the center of the flower slowly eating away at the petals, a black, shiny center that appeared to be formed by the backs of a thousand ants. It ate away the petals at an agonizingly slow pace. I wanted to scream for it to stop or to hurry up. I was pained by the gradual disappearance of the beautiful petals as if being swallowed by an insidious disease. Then in a flash of insight I realized to my horror that the black thing was actually devouring me. I was the flower and this foreign, creeping thing was eating me! I shouted or screamed, I really don't remember. I was too full of fear and loathing. I heard my guide say: "Easy now. Just go with it. Don't fight it. Go with it." I tried, but the hideous blackness caused such repulsion that I screamed: "I can't! For God's sake help me! Help me!" The voice was soothing, reassuring: "Let it come. Everything is all right. Don't worry. Go with it. Don't fight." I felt myself dissolving into the terrifying apparition, my body melting in waves into the core of blackness, my mind stripped of ego and life and, yes even death. In one great crystal instant I realized that I was immortal. I asked the question: "Am I dead?" But the question had no meaning. Meaning was meaningless. Suddenly there was white light and the shimmering beauty of unity. There was light everywhere, white light with a clarity beyond description. I was dead and I was born and the exultation was pure and holy. My lungs were bursting with the joyful song of being. There was unity and life and the exquisite love that filled my being was unbounded. My awareness was acute and complete. I saw God and the devil and all the saints and I knew the truth. I felt myself flowing into the cosmos, levitated beyond all restraint, liberated to swim in the blissful radiance of the heavenly visions. I wanted to shout and sing of miraculous new life and sense and form, of the joyous beauty and the whole mad ecstasy of loveliness. I knew and understood all there is to know and understand. I was immortal, wise beyond wisdom, and capable of love, of all loves. Every atom of my body and soul had seen and felt God. The world was warmth and goodness. There was no time, no place, no me. There was only cosmic harmony. It was all there in the white light. With every fiber of my being I knew it was so. I embraced the enlightenment with complete abandonment. As the experience receded I longed to hold onto it and tenaciously fought against the encroachment of the realities of time and place. For me, the realities of our limited existence were no longer valid. I had seen the ultimate realities and there would be no others. As I was slowly transported back to the tyranny of clocks and schedules and petty hatreds, I tried to talk of my trip, my enlightenment, the horrors, the beauty, all of it. I must have been babbling like an idiot. My thoughts swirled at a fantastic rate, but the words couldn't keep pace. My guide smiled and told me he understood. The preceding collection of reports on"travels in the universe of the soul," even though theyencompass such dissimilar experiences, are still not able toestablish a complete picture of the broad spectrum of allpossible reactions to LSD, which extends from the most sublimespiritual, religious, and mystical experiences, down to grosspsychosomatic disturbances. Cases of LSD sessions have beendescribed in which the stimulation of fantasy and of visionaryexperience, as expressed in the LSD reports assembled here, iscompletely absent, and the experimenter was for the whole time ina state of ghastly physical and mental discomfort, or even feltseverely ill. Reports about the modification of sexual experienceunder the influence of LSD are also contradictory. Sincestimulation of all sensory perception is an essential feature ofLSD effects, the sensual orgy of sexual intercourse can undergounimaginable enhancements. Cases have also been described,however, in which LSD led not to the anticipated erotic paradise,but rather to a purgatory or even to the hell of frightfulextinction of every perception and to a lifeless vacuum. Such a variety and contradiction of reactions to adrug is found only in LSD and the related hallucinogens. Theexplanation for this lies in the complexity and variability ofthe conscious and subconscious minds of people, which LSD is ableto penetrate and to bring to life as experienced reality.

The Mexican Relatives of LSD The Sacred Mushroom Teonan�catl Late in 1956 a notice in the daily paper caught myinterest. Among some Indians in southern Mexico, Americanresearchers had discovered mushrooms that were eaten in religiousceremonies and that produced an inebriated condition accompaniedby hallucinations. Since, outside of the mescaline cactus found alsoin Mexico, no other drug was known at the time that, like LSD,produced hallucinations, I would have liked to establish contactwith these researchers, in order to learn details about thesehallucinogenic mushrooms. But there were no names and addressesin the short newspaper article, so that it was impossible to getfurther information. Nevertheless, the mysterious mushrooms,whose chemical investigation would be a tempting problem, stayedin my thoughts from then on. As it later turned out, LSD was the reason thatthese mushrooms found their way into my laboratory, with out myassistance, at the beginning of the following year. Through the mediation of Dr. Yves Dunant, at thetime director of the Paris branch of Sandoz, an inquiry came tothe pharmaceutical research management in Basel from ProfessorRoger Heim, director of the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie of theMuseum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, asking whether wewere interested in carrying out the chemical investigation of theMexican hallucinogenic mushrooms. With great joy I declaredmyself ready to begin this work in my department, in thelaboratories for natural product research. That was to be my linkto the exciting investigations of the Mexican sacred mushrooms,which were already broadly advanced in the ethnomycological andbotanical aspects. For a long time the existence of these magicmushrooms had remained an enigma. The history of theirrediscovery is presented at first hand in the magnificenttwo-volume standard work of ethnomycology, Mushrooms, Russiaand History (Pantheon Books, New York, 1957), for theauthors, the American researchers Valentina Pavlovna Wasson andher husband, R. Gordon Wasson, played a decisive role in thisrediscovery. The following descriptions of the fascinatinghistory of these mushrooms are taken from the Wassons' book. The first written evidence of the use ofinebriating mushrooms on festival occasions, or in the course ofreligious ceremonies and magically oriented healing practices, isfound among the Spanish chroniclers and naturalists of thesixteenth century, who entered the country soon after theconquest of Mexico by Hernando Cort�s. The most important ofthese witnesses is the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun,who mentions the magic mushrooms and describes their effects andtheir use in several passages of his famous historical work, HistoriaGeneral de tas Cosas de Nueva Espana, written between theyears 1529 and 1590. Thus he describes, for example, howmerchants celebrated the return home from a successful businesstrip with a mushroom party: Coming at the very first, at the time of feasting, they ate mushrooms when, as they said, it was the hour of the blowing of the flutes. Not yet did they partake of food; they drank only chocolate during the night. And they ate mushrooms with honey. When already the mushrooms were taking effect, there was dancing, there was weeping.... Some saw in a vision that they would die in war. Some saw in a vision that they would be devoured by wild beasts.... Some saw in a vision that they would become rich, wealthy. Some saw in a vision that they would buy slaves, would become slave owners. Some saw in a vision that they would commit adultery [and so] would have their heads bashed in, would be stoned to death.... Some saw in a vision that they would perish in the water. Some saw in a vision that they would pass to tranquillity in death. Some saw in a vision that they would fall from the housetop, tumble to their death. . . . All such things they saw.... And when [the effects of] the mushroom ceased, they conversed with one another, spoke of what they had seen in the vision. In a publication from the same period, Diego Duran,a Dominican friar, reported that inebriating mushrooms were eatenat the great festivity on the occasion of the accession to thethrone of Moctezuma II, the famed emperor of the Aztecs, in theyear 1502. A passage in the seventeenth-century chronicle of DonJacinto de la Serna refers to the use of these mushrooms in areligious framework: And what happened was that there had come to [the village] an Indian . . . and his name was Juan Chichiton . . . and he had brought the red-colored mushrooms that are gathered in the uplands, and with them he had committed a great idolatry.... In the house where everyone had gathered on the occasion of a saint's feast . . . the teponastli [an Aztec percussion instrument] was playing and singing was going on the whole night through. After most of the night had passed, Juan Chichiton, who was the priest for that solumn rite, to all of those present at the fiesta gave the mushrooms to eat, after the manner of Communion, and gave them pulque to drink. . . so that they all went out of their heads, a shame it was to see. In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, these mushrooms were described as teo-nancatl, which can be translated as "sacred mushroom." There are indications that ceremonial use of suchmushrooms reaches far back into pre-Columbian times. So-calledmushroom stones have been found in El Salvador, Guatemala, andthe contiguous mountainous districts of Mexico. These are stonesculptures in the form of pileate mushroom, on whose stem theface or the form of a god or an animal-like demon is carved. Mostare about 30 cm high. The oldest examples, according toarchaeologists, date back to before 500 B.C. R. G. Wasson argues, quite convincingly, that thereis a connection between these mushroom stones and teonan�catl.If true, this means that the mushroom cult, the magico-medicinaland religious-ceremonial use of the magic mushrooms, is more thantwo thousand years old. To the Christian missionaries, the inebriating,vision- and hallucination-producing effects of these mushroomsseemed to be Devil's work. They therefore tried, with all themeans in their power, to extirpate their use. But they succeededonly partially, for the Indians have continued secretly down toour time to utilize the mushroom teonan�catl, which wassacred to them. Strange to say, the reports in the old chroniclesabout the use of magic mushrooms remained unnoticed during thefollowing centuries, probably because they were consideredproducts of the imagination of a superstitious age. All traces of the existence of "sacredmushrooms" were in danger of becoming obliterated once andfor all, when, in 1915, an American botanist of repute, Dr. W. E.Safford, in an address before the Botanical Society in Washingtonand in a scientific publication, advanced the thesis that no suchthing as magic mushrooms had ever existed at all: the Spanishchroniclers had taken the mescaline cactus for a mushroom! Evenif false, this proposition of Safford's served nevertheless todirect the attention of the scientific world to the riddle of themysterious mushrooms. It was the Mexican physician Dr. Blas Pablo Rekowho first openly disagreed with Safford's interpretation and whofound evidence that mushrooms were still employed inmedicinal-religious ceremonies even in our time, in remotedistricts of the southern mountains of Mexico. But not until theyears 19338 did the anthropologist Robert J. Weitlaner and Dr.Richard Evans Schultes, a botanist from Harvard University, findactual mushrooms in that region, which were used there for thisceremonial purpose; and only in 1938 could a group of youngAmerican anthropologists, under the direction of Jean BassettJohnson, attend a secret nocturnal mushroom ceremony for thefirst time. This was in Huautla de Jim�nez, the capital of theMazatec country, in the State of Oaxaca. But these researcherswere only spectators, they were not permitted to partake of themushrooms. Johnson reported on the experience in a Swedishjournal (Ethnological Studies 9, 1939). Then exploration of the magic mushrooms wasinterrupted. World War II broke out. Schultes, at the behest ofthe American government, had to occupy himself with rubberproduction in the Amazon territory, and Johnson was killed afterthe Allied landing in North Africa. It was the American researchers, the married coupleDr. Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and her husband, R. Gordon Wasson,who again took up the problem from the ethnographic aspect. R. G.Wasson was a banker, vice-president of the J. P. Morgan Co. inNew York. His wife, who died in 1958, was a pediatrician. TheWassons began their work in 1953, in the Mazatec village Huautlade Jim�nez, where fifteen years earlier J. B. Johnson and othershad established the continued existence of the ancient Indianmushroom cult. They received especially valuable information froman American missionary who had been active there for many years,Eunice V. Pike, member of the Wycliffe Bible Translators. Thanksto her knowledge of the native language and her ministerialassociation with the inhabitants, Pike had information about thesignificance of the magic mushrooms that nobody else possessed.During several lengthy sojourns in Huautla and environs, theWassons were able to study the present use of the mushrooms indetail and compare it with the descriptions in the oldchronicles. This showed that the belief in the "sacredmushrooms" was still prevalent in that region. However, theIndians kept their beliefs a secret from strangers. It took greattact and skill, therefore, to gain the confidence of theindigenous population and to receive insight into this secretdomain. In the modern form of the mushroom cult, the oldreligious ideas and customs are mingled with Christian ideas andChristian terminology. Thus the mushrooms are often spoken of asthe blood of Christ, because they will grow only where a drop ofChrist's blood has fallen on the earth. According to anothernotion, the mushrooms sprout where a drop of saliva from Christ'smouth has moistened the ground, and it is therefore Jesus Christhimself who speaks through the mushrooms. The mushroom ceremony follows the form of aconsultation. The seeker of advice or a sick person or his or herfamily questions a "wise man" or a "wisewoman," a sabio or sabia, also named curanderoor curandera, in return for a modest payment. Curanderocan best be translated into English as "healingpriest," for his function is that of a physician as well asthat of a priest, both being found only rarely in these remoteregions. In the Mazatec language the healing priest is called co-ta-ci-ne,which means "one who knows." He eats the mushroom inthe framework of a ceremony that always takes place at night. Theother persons present at the ceremony may sometimes receivemushrooms as well, yet a much greater dose always goes to the curandero.The performance is executed with the accompaniment of prayers andentreaties, while the mushrooms are incensed briefly over abasin, in which copal (an incense-like resin) is burned.In complete darkness, at times by candlelight, while the otherspresent lie quietly on their straw mats, the curandero, kneelingor sitting, prays and sings before a type of altar bearing acrucifix, an image of a saint, or some other object of worship.Under the influence of the sacred mushrooms, the curanderocounsels in a visionary state, in which even the inactiveobservers more or less participate. In the monotonous song of thecurandero, the mushroom teonan�catl gives itsanswers to the questions posed. It says whether the diseasedperson will live or die, which herbs will effect the cure; itreveals who has killed a specific person, or who has stolen thehorse; or it makes known how a distant relative fares, and soforth. The mushroom ceremony not only has the function ofa consulation of the type described, for the Indians it also hasa meaning in many respects similar to the Holy Communion for thebelieving Christian. From many utterances of the natives it couldbe inferred that they believe that God has given the Indians thesacred mushroom because they are poor and possess no doctors andmedicines; and also, because they cannot read, in particular theBible, God can therefore speak directly to them through themushroom. The missionary Eunice V. Pike even alluded to thedifficulties that result from explaining the Christian message,the written word, to a people who believe they possess ameans—the sacred mushrooms of course - to make God's willknown to them in a direct, clear manner: yes, the mushroomspermit them to see into heaven and to establish communicationwith God himself. The Indians' reverence for the sacred mushrooms isalso evident in their belief that they can be eaten only by a"clean" person. "Clean" here meansceremonially clean, and that term among other things includessexual abstinence at least four days before and after ingestionof the mushrooms. Certain rules must also be observed ingathering the mushrooms. With non-observance of thesecommandments, the mushrooms can make the person who eats itinsane, or can even kill. The Wassons had undertaken their first expeditionto the Mazatec country in 1953, but not until 1955 did theysucceed in overcoming the shyness and reserve of the Mazatecfriends they had managed to make, to the point of being admittedas active participants in a mushroom ceremony. R. Gordon Wassonand his companion, the photographer Allan Richardson, were givensacred mushrooms to eat at the end of June 1955, on the occasionof a nocturnal mushroom ceremony. They thereby became in alllikelihood the first outsiders, the first whites, ever permittedto take teonan�catl. In the second volume of Mushrooms, Russia andHistory, in enraptured words, Wasson describes how themushroom seized possession of him completely, although he hadtried to struggle against its effects, in order to be able toremain an objective observer. First he saw geometric, coloredpatterns, which then took on architectural characteristics. Nextfollowed visions of splendid colonnades, palaces of supernaturalharmony and magnificence embellished with precious gems,triumphal cars drawn by fabulous creatures as they are known onlyfrom mythology, and landscapes of fabulous luster. Detached fromthe body, the spirit soared timelessly in a realm of fantasyamong images of a higher reality and deeper meaning than those ofthe ordinary, everyday world. The essence of life, the ineffable,seemed to be on the verge of being unlocked, but the ultimatedoor failed to open. This experience was the final proof, for Wasson,that the magical powers attributed to the mushrooms actuallyexisted and were not merely superstition. In order to introduce the mushrooms to scientificresearch, Wasson had earlier established an association withmycologist Professor Roger Heim of Paris. Accompanying theWassons on further expeditions into the Mazatec country, Heimconducted the botanical identification of the sacred mushrooms.He showed that they were gilled mushrooms from the family Strophariaceae,about a dozen different species not previously describedscientifically, the greatest part belonging to the genus Psilocybe.Professor Heim also succeeded in cultivating some of the speciesin the laboratory. The mushroom Psilocybe mexicana turnedout to be especially suitable for artificial cultivation. Chemical investigations ran parallel with thesebotanical studies on the magic mushrooms, with the goal ofextracting the hallucinogenically active principle from themushroom material and preparing it in chemically pure form. Suchinvestigations were carried out at Professor Heim's instigationin the chemical laboratory of the Museum National d'HistoireNaturelle in Paris, and work teams were occupied with thisproblem in the United States in the research laboratories of twolarge pharmaceutical companies: Merck, and Smith, Kline andFrench. The American laboratories had obtained some of themushrooms from R. G. Wasson and had gathered others themselves inthe Sierra Mazateca. As the chemical investigations in Paris and in theUnited States turned out to be ineffectual, Professor Heimaddressed this matter to our firm, as mentioned at the beginningof this chapter, because he felt that our experimental experiencewith LSD, related to the magic mushrooms by similar activity,could be of use in the isolation attempts. Thus it was LSD thatshowed teonan�catl the way into our laboratory. As director of the department of natural productsof the Sandoz pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratories atthat time, I wanted to assign-the investigation of the magicmushrooms to one of my coworkers. However, nobody showed mucheagerness to take on this problem because it was known that LSDand everything connected with it were scarcely popular subjectsto the top management. Because the enthusiasm necessary forsuccessful endeavors cannot be commanded, and because theenthusiasm was already present in me as far as this problem wasconcerned, I decided to conduct the investigation myself. Some 100 g of dried mushrooms of the species Psilocybemexicana, cultivated by Professor Heim in the laboratory,were available for the beginning of the chemical analysis. Mylaboratory assistant, Hans Tscherter, who during our decade-longcollaboration, had developed into a very capable helper,completely familiar with my manner of work, aided me in theextraction and isolation attempts. Since there were no clues atall concerning the chemical properties of the active principle wesought, the isolation attempts had to be conducted on the basisof the effects of the extract fractions. But none of the variousextracts showed an unequivocal effect, either in the mouse or thedog, which could have pointed to the presence of hallucinogenicprinciples. It therefore became doubtful whether the mushroomscultivated and dried in Paris were still active at all. Thatcould only be determined by experimenting with this mushroommaterial on a human being. As in the case of LSD, I made thisfundamental experiment myself, since it is not appropriate forresearchers to ask anyone else to perform self-experiments thatthey require for their own investigations, especially if theyentail, as in this case, a certain risk. In this experiment I ate 32 dried specimens of Psilocybemexicana, which together weighed 2.4 g. This amountcorresponded to an average dose, according to the reports ofWasson and Heim, as it is used by the curanderos. Themushrooms displayed a strong psychic effect, as the followingextract from the report on that experiment shows: Thirty minutes after my taking the mushrooms, the exterior world began to undergo a strange transformation. Everything assumed a Mexican character. As I was perfectly well aware that my knowledge of the Mexican origin of the mushroom would lead me to imagine only Mexican scenery, I tried deliberately to look on my environment as I knew it normally. But all voluntary efforts to look at things in their customary forms and colors proved ineffective. Whether my eyes were closed or open, I saw only Mexican motifs and colors. When the doctor supervising the experiment bent over me to check my blood pressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest and I would not have been astonished if he had drawn an obsidian knife. In spite of the seriousness of the situation, it amused me to see how the Germanic face of my colleague had acquired a purely Indian expression. At the peak of the intoxication, about 1 1/2 hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, the rush of interior pictures, mostly abstract motifs rapidly changing in shape and color, reached such an alarming degree that I feared that I would be torn into this whirlpool of form and color and would dissolve. After about six hours the dream came to an end. Subjectively, I had no idea how long this condition had lasted. I felt my return to everyday reality to be a happy return from a strange, fantastic but quite real world to an old and familiar home. This self-experiment showed once again that humanbeings react much more sensitively than animals to psychoactivesubstances. We had already reached the same conclusion inexperimenting with LSD on animals, as described in an earlierchapter of this book. It was not inactivity of the mushroommaterial, but rather the deficient reaction capability of theresearch animals vis-�-vis such a type of active principle, thatexplained why our extracts had appeared inactive in the mouse anddog. Because the assay on human subjects was the onlytest at our disposal for the detection of the active extractfractions, we had no other choice than to perform the testing onourselves if we wanted to carry on the work and bring it to asuccessful conclusion. In the self-experiment just described, astrong reaction lasting several hours was produced by 2.4 g driedmushrooms. Therefore, in the sequel we used samples correspondingto only one-third of this amount, namely 0.8 g dried mushrooms.If these samples contained the active principle, they would onlyprovoke a mild effect that impaired the ability to work for ashort time, but this effect would still be so distinct that theinactive fractions and those containing the active principlecould unequivocally be differentiated from one another. Severalcoworkers and colleagues volunteered as guinea pigs for thisseries of tests. Psilocybin and Psilocin With the help of this reliable test on humansubjects, the active principle could be isolated, concentrated,and transformed into a chemically pure state by means of thenewest separation methods. Two new substances, which I namedpsilocybin and psilocin, were thereby obtained in the form ofcolorless crystals. These results were published in March 1958 in thejournal Experientia, in collaboration with Professor Heimand with my colleagues Dr. A. Brack and Dr. H. Kobel, who hadprovided greater quantities of mushroom material for theseinvestigations after they had essentially improved the laboratorycultivation of the mushrooms. Some of my coworkers at the time—Drs. A. J.Frey, H. Ott, T. Petrzilka, and F. Troxler—then participatedin the next steps of these investigations, the determination ofthe chemical structure of psilocybin and psilocin and thesubsequent synthesis of these compounds, the results of whichwere published in the November 1958 issue of Experientia.The chemical structures of these mushroom factors deserve specialattention in several respects. Psilocybin and psilocin belong,like LSD, to the indole compounds, the biologically importantclass of substances found in the plant and animal kingdoms.Particular chemical features common to both the mushroomsubstances and LSD show that psilocybin and psilocin are closelyrelated to LSD, not only with regard to psychic effects but alsoto their chemical structures. Psilocybin is the phosphoric acidester of psilocin and, as such, is the first and hitherto onlyphosphoric-acid-containing indole compound discovered in nature.The phosphoric acid residue does not contribute to the activity,for the phosphoric-acid-free psilocin is just as active aspsilocybin, but it makes the molecule more stable. While psilocinis readily decomposed by the oxygen in air, psilocybin is astable substance. Psilocybin and psilocin possess a chemicalstructure very similar to the brain factor serotonin. As wasalready mentioned in the chapter on animal experiments andbiological research, serotonin plays an important role in thechemistry of brain functions. The two mushroom factors, like LSD,block the effects of serotonin in pharmacological experiments ondifferent organs. Other pharmacological properties of psilocybinand psilocin are also similar to those of LSD. The maindifference consists in the quantitative activity, in animal aswell as human experimentation. The average active dose ofpsilocybin or psilocin in human beings amounts to 10 mg (0.01 g);accordingly, these two substances are more than 100 times lessactive than LSD, of which 0.1 mg constitutes a strong dose.Moreover, the effects of the mushroom factors last only four tosix hours, much shorter than the effects of LSD (eight to twelvehours). The total synthesis of psilocybin and psilocin,without the aid of the mushrooms, could be developed into atechnical process, which would allow these substances to beproduced on a large scale. Synthetic production is more rationaland cheaper than extraction from the mushrooms. Thus with the isolation and synthesis of the activeprinciples, the demystification of the magic mushrooms wasaccomplished. The compounds whose wondrous effects led theIndians to believe for millennia that a god was residing in themushrooms had their chemical structures elucidated and could beproduced synthetically in flasks. Just what progress in scientific knowledge wasaccomplished by natural products research in this case?Essentially, when all is said and done, we can only say that themystery of the wondrous effects of teonan�catl wasreduced to the mystery of the effects of two crystallinesubstances—since these effects cannot be explained byscience either, but can only be describe. A Voyage into the Universe of the Soul with Psilocybin The relationship between the psychic effects ofpsilocybin and those of LSD, their visionaryhallucinatorycharacter, is evident in the following report from Antaios,of a psilocybin experiment by Dr. Rudolf Gelpke. He hascharacterized his experiences with LSD and psilocybin, as alreadymentioned in a previous chapter, as "travels in the universeof the soul." Where Time Stands Still (10 mg psilocybin, 6 April 1961, 10:20) After ca. 20 minutes, beginning effects: serenity, speechlessness, mild but pleasant dizzy sensation, and "pleasureful deep breathing." 10:50 Strong! dizziness, can no longer concentrate . 10:55 Excited, intensity of colors: everything pink to red. 11:05 The world concentrates itself there on the center of the table. Colors very intense. 11:10 A divided being, unprecedented—how can I describe this sensation of life? Waves, different selves, must control me. Immediately after this note I went outdoors, leaving the breakfast table, where I had eaten with Dr. H. and our wives, and lay down on the lawn. The inebriation pushed rapidly to its climax. Although I had firmly resolved to make constant notes, it now seemed to me a complete waste of time, the motion of writing infinitely slow, the possibilities of verbal expression unspeakably paltry - measured by the flood of inner experience that inundated me and threatened to burst me. It seemed to me that 100 years would not be sufficient to describe the fullness of experience of a single minute. At the beginning, optical impressions predominated: I saw with delight the boundless succession of rows of trees in the nearby forest. Then the tattered clouds in the sunny sky rapidly piled up with silent and breathtaking majesty to a superimposition of thousands of layers—heaven on heaven—and I waited then expecting that up there in the next moment something completely powerful, unheard of, not yet existing, would appear or happen - would I behold a god? But only the expectation remained, the presentiment, this hovering, "on the threshold of the ultimate feeling." . . . Then I moved farther away (the proximity of others disturbed me) and lay down in a nook of the garden on a sun-warmed wood pile—my fingers stroked this wood with overflowing, animal-like sensual affection. At the same time I was submerged within myself; it was an absolute climax: a sensation of bliss pervaded me, a contented happiness—I found myself behind my closed eyes in a cavity full of brick-red ornaments, and at the same time in the "center of the universe of consummate calm." I knew everything was good—the cause and origins of everything was good. But at the same moment I also understood the suffering and the loathing, the depression and misunderstanding of ordinary life: there one is never "total," but instead divided, cut in pieces, and split up into the tiny fragments of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years: there one is a slave of Moloch time, which devoured one piecemeal; one is condemned to stammering, bungling, and patchwork; one must drag about with oneself the perfection and absolute, the togetherness of all things; the eternal moment of the golden age, this original ground of being—that indeed nevertheless has always endured and will endure forever—there in the weekday of human existence, as a tormenting thorn buried deeply in the soul, as a memorial of a claim never fulfilled, as a fata morgana of a lost and promised paradise; through this feverish dream "present" to a condemned "past" in a clouded "future." I understood. This inebriation was a spaceflight, not of the outer but rather of the inner man, and for a moment I experienced reality from a location that lies somewhere beyond the force of gravity of time. As I began again to feel this force of gravity, I was childish enough to want to postpone the return by taking a new dose of 6 mg psilocybin at 11:45, and once again 4 mg at 14:30. The effect was trifling, and in any case not worth mentioning. Mrs. Li Gelpke, an artist, also participated inthis series of investigations, taking three self-experiments withLSD and psilocybin. The artist wrote of the drawing she madeduring the experiment: Nothing on this page is consciously fashioned. While I worked on it, the memory (of the experience under psilocybin) was again reality, and led me at every stroke. For that reason the picture is as many-layered as this memory, and the figure at the lower right is really the captive of its dream.... When books about Mexican art came into my hands three weeks later, I again found the motifs of my visions there with a sudden start.... I have also mentioned the occurrence of Mexicanmotifs in psilocybin inebriation during my first self-experimentwith dried Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms, as was described in thesection on the chemical investigation of these mushrooms. Thesame phenomenon has also struck R. Gordon Wasson. Proceeding fromsuch observations, he has advanced the conjecture that ancientMexican art could have been influenced by visionary images, asthey appear in mushroom inebriation. The "Magic Morning Glory" Ololiuhqui After we had managed to solve the riddle of thesacred mushroom teonan�catl in a relatively short time, Ialso became interested in the problem of another Mexican magicdrug not yet chemically elucidated, ololiuhqui. Ololiuhquiis the Aztec name for the seeds of certain climbing plants (Convolvulaceae)that, like the mescaline cactus peyotl and the teonan�catlmushrooms, were used in pre-Columbian times by the Aztecs andneighboring people in religious ceremonies and magical healingpractices. Ololiuhqui is still used even today by certainIndian tribes like the Zapotec, Chinantec, Mazatec, and Mixtec,who until a short time ago still led a genuinely isolatedexistence, little influenced by Christianity, in the remotemountains of southern Mexico. An excellent study of the historical, ethnological,and botanical aspects of ololiuhqui was published in 1941by Richard Evans Schultes, director of the Harvard BotanicalMuseum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is entitled "AContribution to Our Knowledge of Rivea corymbosa, theNarcotic Ololiuqui of the Aztecs." The followingstatements about the history of ololiuhqui derive chieflyfrom Schultes's monograph. [Translator's note: As R. GordonWasson has pointed out, "ololiuhqui" is a moreprecise orthography than the more popular spelling used bySchultes. See Botanical Museum Leaflets Harvard University20: 161-212, 1963.] The earliest records about this drug were writtenby Spanish chroniclers of the sixteenth century, who alsomentioned peyotl and teonan�catl. Thus theFranciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun, in his already citedfamous chronicle Historia General de las Cosas de NuevaEspana, writes about the wondrous effects of ololiuhqui:"There is an herb, called coatl xoxouhqui (greensnake), which produces seeds that are called ololiuhqui.These seeds stupefy and deprive one of reason: they are taken asa potion." We obtain further information about these seedsfrom the physician Francisco Hernandez, whom Philip II sent toMexico from Spain, from 1570 to 1575, in order to study themedicaments of the natives. In the chapter "On Ololiuhqui"of his monumental work entitled Rerum Medicarum NovaeHispaniae Thesaurus seu Plantarum, Animalium MineraliumMexicanorum Historia, published in Rome in 1651, he gives adetailed description and the first illustration of ololiuhqui.An extract from the Latin text accompanying the illustrationreads in translation: "Ololiuhqui, which others call coaxihuitlor snake plant, is a climber with thin, green, heart-shapedleaves.... The flowers are white, fairly large.... The seeds areroundish. . . . When the priests of the Indians wanted to visitwith the gods and obtain information from them, they ate of thisplant in order to become inebriated. Thousands of fantasticimages and demons then appeared to them...." Despite thiscomparatively good description, the botanical identification of ololiuhquias seeds of Rivea corymbosa (L.) Hall. f. occasioned manydiscussions in specialist circles. Recently preference has beengiven to the synonym Turbina corymbosa (L.) Raf. When I decided in 1959 to attempt the isolation othe active principles of ololiuhqui, only a single reporton chemical work with the seeds of Turbina corymbosa wasavailable. It was the work of the pharmacologist C. G. Santessonof Stockholm, from the year 1937. Santesson, however, was notsuccessful in isolating an active substance in pure form. Contradictory findings had been published about theactivity of the ololiuhqui seeds. The psychiatrist H.Osmond conducted a self-experiment with the seeds of Turbinacorymbosa in 1955. After the ingestion of 60 to 100 seeds, heentered into a state of apathy and emptiness, accompanied byenhanced visual sensitivity. After four hours, there followed aperiod of relaxation and well-being, lasting for a longer time.The results of V. J. Kinross-Wright, published in England in1958, in which eight voluntary research subjects, who had takenup to 125 seeds, perceived no effects at all, contradicted thisreport. Through the mediation of R. Gordon Wasson, Iobtained two samples of ololiuhqui seeds. In hisaccompanying letter of 6 August 1959 from Mexico City, he wroteof them: . . . The parcels that I am sending you are the following: . . . A small parcel of seeds that I take to be Rivea corymbosa, otherwise known as ololiuqui well-known narcotic of the Aztecs, called in Huautla "la semilla de la Virgen." This parcel, you will find, consists of two little bottles, which represent two deliveries of seeds made to us in Huautla, and a larger batch of seeds delivered to us by Francisco Ortega "Chico," the Zapotec guide, who himself gathered the seeds from the plants at the Zapotec town of San Bartolo Yautepec.... The first-named, round, light brown seeds fromHuautla proved in the botanical determination to have beencorrectly identified as Rivea (Turbina) corymbosa, whilethe black, angular seeds from San Bartolo Yautepec wereidentified as Ipomoea violacea L. While Turbina corymbosa thrives only intropical or subtropical climates, one also finds Ipomoeaviolacea as an ornamental plant dispersed over the wholeearth in the temperate zones. It is the morning glory thatdelights the eye in our gardens in diverse varieties with blue orblue-red striped calyxes. The Zapotec, besides the original ololiuhqui(that is, the seeds of Turbina corymbosa, which they call badoh),also utilize badoh negro, the seeds of Ipomoea violacea.T. MacDougall, who furnished us with a second larger consignmentof the last-named seeds, made this observation. My capable laboratory assistant Hans Tscherter,with whom I had already carried out the isolation of the activeprinciples of the mushrooms, participated in the chemicalinvestigation of the ololiuhqui drug. We advanced theworking hypothesis that the active principles of the ololiuhquiseeds could be representatives of the same class of chemicalsubstances, the indole compounds, to which LSD, psilocybin, andpsilocin belong. Considering the very great number of othergroups of substances that, like the indoles, were underconsideration as active principles of ololiuhqui, it wasindeed extremely improbable that this assumption would provetrue. It could, however, very easily be tested. The presence ofindole compounds, of course, may simply and rapidly be determinedby colorimetric reactions. Thus even traces of indole substances,with a certain reagent, give an intense blue-colored solution. We had luck with our hypothesis. Extracts of ololiuhquiseeds with the appropriate reagent gave the blue colorationcharacteristic of indole compounds. With the help of thiscolorimetric test, we succeeded in a short time in isolating theindole substances from the seeds and in obtaining them inchemically pure form. Their identification led to an astonishingresult. What we found appeared at first scarcely believable. Onlyafter repetition and the most careful scrutiny of the operationswas our suspicion concerning the peculiar findings eliminated:the active principles from the ancient Mexican magic drug ololiuhquiproved to be identical with substances that were already presentin my laboratory. They were identical with alkaloids that hadbeen obtained in the course of the decades-long investigations ofergot; partly isolated as such from ergot, partly obtainedthrough chemical modification of ergot substances. Lysergic acid amide, lysergic acidhydroxyethylamide, and alkaloids closely related to themchemically were established as the main active principles of ololiuhqui.(See formulae in the appendix.) Also present was the alkaloidergobasine, whose synthesis had constituted the starting point ofmy investigations on ergot alkaloids. Lysergic acid amide andlysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, active principles of ololiuhqui,are chemically very closely related to lysergic acid diethylamide(LSD), which even for the non-chemist follows from the names. Lysergic acid amide was described for the firsttime by the English chemists S. Smith and G. M. Timmis as acleavage product of ergot alkaloids, and I had also produced thissubstance synthetically in the course of the investigations inwhich LSD originated. Certainly, nobody at the time could havesuspected that this compound synthesized in the flask would bediscovered twenty years later as a naturally occurring activeprinciple of an ancient Mexican magic drug. After the discovery of the psychic effects of LSD,I had also tested lysergic acid amide in a self-experiment andestablished that it likewise evoked a dreamlike condition, butonly with about a tenfold to twenty-fold greater dose than LSD.This effect was characterized by a sensation of mental emptinessand the unreality and meaninglessness of the outer world, byenhanced sensitivity of hearing, and by a not unpleasant physicallassitude, which ultimately led to sleep. This picture of theeffects of LA-111, as lysergic acid amide was called as aresearch preparation, was confirmed in a systematic investigationby the psychiatrist Dr. H. Solms. When I presented the findings of our investigationson ololiuhqui at the Natural Products Congress of theInternational Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) inSydney, Australia, in the fall of 1960, my colleagues received mytalk with skepticism. In the discussions following my lecture,some persons voiced the suspicion that the ololiuhquiextracts could well have been contaminated with traces oflysergic acid derivatives, with which so much work had been donein my laboratory. There was another reason for the doubt inspecialist circles concerning our findings. The occurrence inhigher plants (i.e., in the morning glory family) of ergotalkaloids that hitherto had been known only as constituents oflower fungi, contradicted the experience that certain substancesare typical of and restricted to respective plant families. It isindeed a very rare exception to find a characteristic group ofsubstances, in this case the ergot alkaloids, occurring in twodivisions of the plant kingdom broadly separated in evolutionaryhistory. Our results were confirmed, however, when differentlaboratories in the United States, Germany, and Hollandsubsequently verified our investigations on the ololiuhquiseeds. Nevertheless, the skepticism went so far that some personseven considered the possibility that the seeds could have beeninfected with alkaloid-producing fungi. That suspicion, however,was ruled out experimentally. These studies on the active principles of ololiuhquiseeds, although they were published only in professionaljournals, had an unexpected sequel. We were apprised by two Dutchwholesale seed companies that their sale of seeds of Ipomoeaviolacea, the ornamental blue morning glory, had reachedunusual proportions in recent times. They had heard that thegreat demand was connected with investigations of these seeds inour laboratory, about which they were eager to learn the details.It turned out that the new demand derived from hippie circles andother groups interested in hallucinogenic drugs. They believedthey had found in the ololiuhqui seeds a substitute forLSD, which was becoming less and less accessible. The morning glory seed boom, however, lasted only acomparatively short time, evidently because of the undesirableexperiences that those in the drug world had with this"new" ancient inebriant. The ololiuhqui seeds,which are taken crushed with water or another mild beverage,taste very bad and are difficult for the stomach to digest.Moreover, the psychic effects of ololiuhqui, in fact,differ from those of LSD in that the euphoric and thehallucinogenic components are less pronounced, while a sensationof mental emptiness, often anxiety and depression, predominates.Furthermore, weariness and lassitude are hardly desirable effectsas traits in an inebriant. These could all be reasons why thedrug culture's interest in the morning glory seeds hasdiminished. Only a few investigations have considered thequestion whether the active principles of ololiuhqui couldfind a useful application in medicine. In my opinion, it would beworthwhile to clarify above all whether the strong narcotic,sedative effect of certain ololiuhqui constituents, or ofchemical modifications of these, is medicinally useful. My studies in the field of hallucinogenic drugsreached a kind of logical conclusion with the investigations of ololiuhqui.They now formed a circle, one could almost say a magic circle:the starting point had been the synthesis of lysergic acidamides, among them the naturally occurring ergot alkaloidergobasin. This led to the synthesis of lysergic aciddiethylamide, LSD. The hallucinogenic properties of LSD were thereason why the hallucinogenic magic mushroom teonan�catlfound its way into my laboratory. The work with teonan�catl,from which psilocybin and psilocin were isolated, proceeded tothe investigation of another Mexican magic drug, ololiuhqui,in which hallucinogenic principles in the form of lysergic acidamides were again encountered, including ergobasin—withwhich the magic circle closed. In Search of the Magic Plant "Ska Mar�a Pastora"in the Mazatec Country R. Gordon Wasson, with whom I had maintainedfriendly relations since the investigations of the Mexican magicmushrooms, invited my wife and me to take part in an expeditionto Mexico in the fall of 1962. The purpose of the journey was tosearch for another Mexican magic plant. Wasson had learned on histravels in the mountains of southern Mexico that the expressedjuice of the leaves of a plant, which were called hojas de laPastora or hojas de Mar�a Pastora, in Mazatec skaPastora or ska Mar�a Pastora (leaves of theshepherdess or leaves of Mary the shepherdess), were used amongthe Mazatec in medico-religious practices, like the teonan�catlmushrooms and the ololiuhqui seeds. The question now was to ascertain from what sort ofplant the "leaves of Mary the shepherdess" derived, andthen to identify this plant botanically. We also hoped, if at allpossible, to gather sufficient plant material to conduct achemical investigation on the hallucinogenic principles itcontained. Ride through the Sierra Mazateca On 26 September 1962, my wife and I accordinglyflew to Mexico City, where we met Gordon Wasson. He had made allthe necessary preparations for the expedition, so that in twodays we had already set out on the next leg of the journey to thesouth. Mrs. Irmgard Weitlaner Johnson, (widow of Jean B. Johnson,a pioneer of the ethnographic study of the Mexican magicmushrooms, killed in the Allied landing in North Africa) hadjoined us. Her father, Robert J. Weitlaner, had emigrated toMexico from Austria and had likewise contributed toward therediscovery of the mushroom cult. Mrs. Johnson worked at theNational Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, as an expert onIndian textiles. After a two-day journey in a spacious Land Rover,which took us over the plateau, along the snow-cappedPopocat�petl, passing Puebla, down into the Valley of Orizabawith its magnificent tropical vegetation, then by ferry acrossthe Popoloapan (Butterfly River), on through the former Aztecgarrison Tuxtepec, we arrived at the starting point of ourexpedition, the Mazatec village of Jalapa de Diaz, lying on ahillside. There we were in the midst of the environment andamong the people that we would come to know in the succeeding 21/2 weeks. There was an uproar upon our arrival in themarketplace, center of this village widely dispersed in thejungle. Old and young men, who had been squatting and standingaround in the half-opened bars and shops, pressed suspiciouslyyet curiously about our Land Rover; they were mostly barefoot butall wore a sombrero. Women and girls were nowhere to beseen. One of the men gave us to understand that we should follow.him. He led us to the local president, a fat mestizo whohad his office in a one-story house with a corrugated iron roof.Gordon showed him our credentials from the civil authorities andfrom the military governor of Oaxaca, which explained that we hadcome here to carry out scientific investigations. The president,who probably could not read at all, was visibly impressed by thelarge-sized documents equipped with official seals. He hadlodgings assigned to us in a spacious shed, in which we couldplace our air mattresses and sleeping bags. I looked around the region somewhat. The ruins of alarge church from colonial times, which must have once been verybeautiful, rose almost ghostlike in the direction of an ascendingslope at the side of the village square. Now I could also seewomen looking out of their huts, venturing to examine thestrangers. In their long, white dresses, adorned with redborders, and with their long braids of blue-black hair, theyoffered a picturesque sight. We were fed by an old Mazatec woman, who directed ayoung cook and two helpers. She lived in one of the typicalMazatec huts. These are simply rectangular structures withthatched gabled roofs and walls of wooden poles joined together,windowless, the chinks between the wooden poles offeringsufficient opportunity to look out. In the middle of the hut, onthe stamped clay floor, was an elevated, open fireplace, built upout of dried clay or made of stones. The smoke escaped throughlarge openings in the walls under the two ends of the roof. Bastmats that lay in a corner or along the walls served as beds. Thehuts were shared with the domestic animals, as well as blackswine, turkeys, and chickens. There was roasted chicken to eat,black beans, and also, in place of bread, tortillas, atype of cornmeal pancake that is baked on the hot stone slab ofthe hearth. Beer and tequila, an Agave liquor, wereserved. Next morning our troop formed for the ride throughthe Sierra Mazateca. Mules and guides were engaged from thehorsekeeper of the village. Guadelupe, the Mazatec familiar withthe route, took charge of guiding the lead animal. Gordon,Irmgard, my wife, and I were stationed on our mules in themiddle. Teodosio and Pedro, called Chico, two young fellows whotrotted along barefoot beside the two mules laden with ourbaggage, brought up the rear. It took some time to get accustomed to the hardwooden saddles. Then, however, this mode of locomotion proved tobe the most ideal type of travel that I know of. The mulesfollowed the leader, single file, at a steady pace. They requiredno direction at all by the rider. With surprising dexterity, theysought out the best spots along the almost impassable, partlyrocky, partly marshy paths, which led through thickets andstreams or onto precipitous slopes. Relieved of all travel cares,we could devote all our attention to the beauty of the landscapeand the tropical vegetation. There were tropical forests withgigantic trees overgrown with twining plants, then againclearings with banana groves or coffee plantations, between lightstands of trees, flowers at the edge of the path, over whichwondrous butterflies bustled about.... We made our way upstreamalong the broad riverbed of Rio Santo Domingo, with brooding heatand steamy air, now steeply ascending, then again falling. Duringa short, violent tropical downpour, the long broad ponchos ofoilcloth, with which Gordon had equipped us, proved quite useful.Our Indian guides had protected themselves from the cloudburstwith gigantic, heart-shaped leaves that they nimbly chopped offat the edge of the path. Teodosio and Chico gave the impressionof great, green hay cricks as they ran, covered with theseleaves, beside their mules. Shortly before nightfall we arrived at the firstsettlement, La Providencia ranch. The patron, Don Joaquin Garcia,the head of a large family, welcomed us hospitably and full ofdignity. It was impossible to determine how many children, inaddition to the grown-ups and the domestic animals, were presentin the large living room, feebly illuminated by the hearth firealone. Gordon and I placed our sleeping bags outdoorsunder the projecting roof. I awoke in the morning to find a piggrunting over my face. After another day's journey on the backs of ourworthy mules, we arrived at Ayautla, a Mazatec settlement spreadacross a hillside. En route, among the shrubbery, I had delightedin the blue calyxes of the magic morning glory Ipomoeaviolacea, the mother plant of the ololiuhqui seeds. Itgrew wild there, whereas among us it is only found in the Gardenas an ornamental plant. We remained in Ayautla for several days. We hadlodging in the house of Do�a Donata Sosa de Garc�a. Do�aDonata was in charge of a large family, which included her ailinghusband. In addition, she presided over the coffee cultivation ofthe region. The collection center for the freshly picked coffeebeans was in an adjacent building. It was a lovely picture, theyoung Indian woman and girls returning home from the harvesttoward evening, in their bright garments adorned with coloredborders, the coffee sacks carried on their backs by headbands.Do�a Donata also managed a type of grocery store, in which herhusband, Don Eduardo, stood behind the counter. In the evening by candlelight, Do�a Donata, whobesides Mazatec also spoke Spanish, told us about life in thevillage; one tragedy or another had already struck nearly everyone of the seemingly peaceful huts that lay surrounded by thisparadisiacal scenery. A man who had murdered his wife, and whonow sits in prison for life, had lived in the house next door,which now stood empty. The husband of a daughter of Do�a Donata,after an affair with another woman, was murdered out of jealousy.The president of Ayautla, a young bull of a mestizo, to whom wehad made our formal visit in the afternoon, never made the shortwalk from his hut to his "office" in the village hall(with the corrugated iron roof) unless accompanied by two heavilyarmed men. Because he exacted illegal taxes, he was afraid ofbeing shot to death. Since no higher authority sees to justice inthis remote region, people have recourse to self-defense of thistype. Thanks to Do�a Donata's good connections, wereceived the first sample of the sought-after plant, some leavesof hojas de la Pastora, from an old woman. Since theflowers and roots were missing, however, this plant material wasnot suitable for botanical identification. Our efforts to obtainmore precise information about the habitat of the plant and itsuse were also fruitless. The continuation of our journey from Ayautla wasdelayed, as we had to wait until our boys could again bring backthe mules that they had taken to pasture on the other side of RioSanto Domingo, over the river swollen by intense downpours. After a two-day ride, on which we had passed thenight in the high mountain village of San Miguel-Huautla, wearrived at Rio Santiago. Here we were joined by Do�a HerlindaMartinez Cid, a teacher from Huautla de Jim�nez. She had riddenover on the invitation of Gordon Wasson, who had known her sincehis mushroom expeditions, and was to serve as our Mazatec andSpanish-speaking interpreter. Moreover, she could help us,through her numerous relatives scattered in the region, to pavethe way to contacts with curanderos and curanderaswho used the hojas de la Pastora in their practice.Because of our delayed arrival in Rio Santiago, Do�a Herlinda,who was acquainted with the dangers of the region, had beenapprehensive about us, fearing we might have plunged down a rockypath or been attacked by robbers. Our next stop was in San Jos� Tenango, asettlement lying deep in a valley, in the midst of tropicalvegetation with orange and lemon trees and banana plantations.Here again was the typical village picture: in the center, amarketplace with a half-ruined church from the colonial period,with two or three stands, a general store, and shelters forhorses and mules. We found lodging in a corrugated iron barracks,with the special luxury of a cement floor, on which we couldspread out our sleeping bags. In the thick jungle on the mountainside wediscovered a spring, whose magnificent fresh water in a naturalrocky basin invited us to bathe. That was an unforgettablepleasure after days without opportunities to wash properly. Inthis grotto I saw a hummingbird for the first time in nature, ablue-green, metallic, iridescent gem, which whirred over greatliana blossoms. The desired contact with persons skilled inmedicine came about thanks to the kindred connections of Do�aHerlinda, beginning with the curandero Don Sabino. But herefused, for some reason, to receive us in a consultation and toquestion the leaves. From an old curandera, a venerablewoman in a strikingly magnificent Mazatec garment, with thelovely name Natividad Rosa, we received a whole bundle offlowering specimens of the sought-after plant, but even she couldnot be prevailed upon to perform a ceremony with the leaves forus. Her excuse was that she was too old for the hardship of themagical trip; she could never cover the long distance to certainplaces: a spring where the wise women gather their powers, a lakeon which the sparrows sing, and where objects get their names.Nor would Natividad Rosa tell us where she had gathered theleaves. They grew in a very, very distant forest valley. Wherevershe dug up a plant, she put a coffee bean in the earth as thanksto the gods. We now possessed ample plants with flowers androots, which were suitable for botanical identification. It wasapparently a representative of the genus Salvia, a relative ofthe well-known meadow sage. The plants had blue flowers crownedwith a white dome, which are arranged on a panicle 20 to 30 cmlong, whose stem leaked blue. Several days later, Natividad Rosa brought us awhole basket of leaves, for which she was paid fifty pesos. Thebusiness seemed to have been discussed, for two other womenbrought us further quantities of leaves. As it was known that theexpressed juice of the leaves is drunk in the ceremony, and thismust therefore contain the active principle, the fresh leaveswere crushed on a stone plate, squeezed out in a cloth, the juicediluted with alcohol as a preservative, and decanted into flasksin order to be studied later in the laboratory in Basel. I wasassisted in this work by an Indian girl, who was accustomed todealing with the stone plate, the metate, on which theIndians since ancient times have ground their corn by hand. On the day before the journey was to continue,having given up all hope of being able to attend a ceremony, wesuddenly made another contact with a curandera, one whowas ready " to serve us ." A confidante of Herlinda's,who had produced this contact, led us after nightfall along asecret path to the hut of the curandera, lying solitary onthe mountainside above the settlement. No one from the villagewas to see us or discover that we were received there. It wasobviously considered a betrayal of sacred customs, worthy ofpunishment, to allow strangers, whites, to take part in this.That indeed had also been the real reason why the other healerswhom we asked had refused to admit us to a leaf ceremony. Strangebirdcalls from the darkness accompanied us on the ascent, and thebarking of dogs was heard on all sides. The dogs had detected thestrangers. The curandera Consuela Garc�a, a woman of someforty years, barefoot like all Indian women in this region,timidly admitted us to her hut and immediately closed up thedoorway with a heavy bar. She bid us lie down on the bast mats onthe stamped mud floor. As Consuela spoke only Mazatec, Herlindatranslated her instructions into Spanish for us. The curanderalit a candle on a table covered with some images of saints, alongwith a variety of rubbish. Then she began to bustle about busily,but in silence. All at once we heard peculiar noises and arummaging in the room-did the hut harbor some hidden person whoseshape and proportions could not be made out in the candlelight?Visibly disturbed, Consuela searched the room with the burningcandle. It appeared to be merely rats, however, who were workingtheir mischief. In a bowl the curandera now kindled copal,an incense-like resin, which soon filled the whole hut with itsaroma. Then the magic potion was ceremoniously prepared. Consuelainquired which of us wished to drink of it with her. Gordonannounced himself. Since I was suffering from a severe stomachupset at the time, I could not join in. My wife substituted forme. The curandera laid out six pairs of leaves forherself. She apportioned the same number to Gordon. Anitareceived three pairs. Like the mushrooms, the leaves are alwaysdosed in pairs, a practice that, of course, has a magicalsignificance. The leaves were crushed with the metate,then squeezed out through a fine sieve into a cup, and the metateand the contents of the sieve were rinsed with water. Finally,the filled cups were incensed over the copal vessel withmuch ceremony. Consuela asked Anita and Gordon, before she handedthem their cups, whether they believed in the truth and theholiness of the ceremony. After they answered in the affirmativeand the very bitter-tasting potion was solemnly imbibed, thecandles were extinguished and, lying in darkness on the bastmasts, we awaited the effects. After some twenty minutes Anita whispered to methat she saw striking, brightly bordered images. Gordon alsoperceived the effect of the drug. The voice of the curanderasounded from the darkness, half speaking, half singing. Herlindatranslated: Did we believe in Christ's blood and the holiness ofthe rites? After our "creemos" ("Webelieve"), the ceremonial performance continued. The curanderalit the candles, moved them from the "altar table" ontothe floor, sang and spoke prayers or magic formulas, placed thecandles again under the images of the saints-then again silenceand darkness. Thereupon the true consultation began. Consuelaasked for our request. Gordon inquired after the health of hisdaughter, who immediately before his departure from New York hadto be admitted prematurely to the hospital in expectation of ababy. He received the comforting information that mother andchild were well. Then again came singing and prayer andmanipulations with the candles on the "altar table" andon the floor, over the smoking basin. When the ceremony was at an end, the curanderaasked us to rest yet a while longer in prayer on our bast mats.Suddenly a thunderstorm burst out. Through the cracks of the beamwalls, lightning flashed into the darkness of the hut,accompanied by violent thunderbolts, while a tropical downpourraged, beating on the roof. Consuela voiced apprehension that wewould not be able to leave her house unseen in the darkness. Butthe thunderstorm let up before daybreak, and we went down themountainside to our corrugated iron barracks, as noiselessly aspossible by the light of flashlights, unnoticed by the villagers,but dogs again barked from all sides. Participation in this ceremony was the climax ofour expedition. It brought confirmation that the hojas de laPastora were used by the Indians for the same purpose and inthe same ceremonial milieu as teonan�catl, the sacredmushrooms. Now we also had authentic plant material, not onlysufficient for botanical identification, but also for the plannedchemical analysis. The inebriated state that Gordon Wasson and mywife had experienced with the hojas had been shallow andonly of short duration, yet it had exhibited a distinctlyhallucinogenic character. On the morning after this eventful night we tookleave of San Jos� Tenango. The guide, Guadelupe, and the twofellows Teodosio and Pedro appeared before our barracks with themules at the appointed time. Soon packed up and mounted, ourlittle troop then moved uphill again, through the fertilelandscape glittering in the sunlight from the night'sthunderstorm. Returning by way of Santiago, toward evening wereached our last stop in Mazatec country, the capital Huautla deJim�nez. From here on, the return trip to Mexico City wasmade by automobile. With a final supper in the Posada Rosaura, atthe time the only inn in Huautla, we took leave of our Indianguides and of the worthy mules that had carried us sosurefootedly and in such a pleasant way through the SierraMazatec. The Indians were paid of, and Teodosio, who alsoaccepted payment for his chief in Jalapa de Diaz (where theanimals were to be returned afterward), gave a receipt with histhumbprint colored by a ballpoint pen. We took up quarters inDona Herlinda's house. A day later we made our formal visit to the curanderaMar�a Sabina, a woman made famous by the Wassons' publications.It had been in her hut that Gordon Wasson became the first whiteman to taste of the sacred mushrooms, in the course of anocturnal ceremony in the summer of 1955. Gordon and Mar�aSabina greeted each other cordially, as old friends. The curanderalived out of the way, on the mountainside above Huautla. Thehouse in which the historic session with Gordon Wasson had takenplace had been burned, presumably by angered residents or anenvious colleague, because she had divulged the secret of teonan�catlto strangers. In the new hut in which we found ourselves, anincredible disorder prevailed, as had probably also prevailed inthe old hut, in which half-naked children, hens, and pigs bustledabout. The old curandera had an intelligent face,exceptionally changeable in expression. She was obviouslyimpressed when it was explained that we had managed to confinethe spirit of the mushrooms in pills, and she at once declaredherself ready to " serve us" with these, that is, togrant us a consultation. It was agreed that this should takeplace the coming night in the house of Do�a Herlinda. In the course of the day I took a stroll throughHuautla de Jim�nez, which led along a main street on themountainside. Then I accompanied Gordon on his visit to theInstituto Nacional Indigenista. This governmental organizationhad the duty of studying and helping to solve the problems of theindigenous population, that is, the Indians. Its leader told usof the difficulties that the "coffee policy" had causedin the area at that time. The president of Huautla, incollaboration with the Instituto Nacional Indigenista had triedto eliminate middlemen in order to shape the coffee pricesfavorably for the producing Indians. His body was found,mutilated, the previous June. Our stroll also took us past the cathedral, fromwhich Gregorian chants resounded. Old Father Aragon, whom Gordonknew well from his earlier stays, invited us into the vestry fora glass of tequila. A Mushroom Ceremony As we returned home to Herlinda's house towardevening, Mar�a Sabina had already arrived there with a largecompany, her two lovely daughters, Apolonia and Aurora (twoprospective curanderas), and a niece, all of whom broughtchildren along with them. Whenever her child began to cry,Apolonia would offer her breast to it. The old curandero DonAurelio also appeared, a mighty man, one-eyed, in ablack-and-white patterned serape (cloak). Cacao and sweet pastrywere served on the veranda. I was reminded of the report from anancient chronicle which described how chocolatl was drunkbefore the ingestion of teonan�catl. After the fall of darkness, we all proceeded intothe room in which the ceremony would take place. It was thenlocked up-that is, the door was obstructed with the only bedavailable. Only an emergency exit into the back garden remainedunlatched for absolute necessity. It was nearly midnight when theceremony began. Until that time the whole party lay, in darknesssleeping or awaiting the night's events, on the bast mats spreadon the floor. Mar�a Sabina threw a piece of copal on theembers of a brazier from time to time, whereby the stuffy air inthe crowded room became somewhat bearable. I had explained to thecurandera through Herlinda, who was again with the partyas interpreter, that one pill contained the spirit of two pairsof mushrooms. (The pills contained 5.0 mg synthetic psilocybinapiece.) When all was ready, Mar�a Sabina apportioned thepills in pairs among the grown-ups present. After solemn smoking,she herself took two pairs (corresponding to 20 mg psilocybin).She gave the same dose to Don Aurelio and her daughter Apolonia,who would also serve as curandera. Aurora received onepair, as did Gordon, while my wife and Irmgard got only one pilleach. One of the children, a girl of about ten, under theguidance of Mar�a Sabina, had prepared for me the juice of fivepairs of fresh leaves of hojas de la Pastora. I wanted toexperience this drug that I had been unable to try in San Jos�Tenango. The potion was said to be especially active whenprepared by an innocent child. The cup with the expressed juicewas likewise incensed and conjured by Mar�a Sabina and DonAurelio, before it was delivered to me. All of these preparations and the followingceremony progressed in much the same way as the consultation withthe curandera Consuela Garcia in San Jos� Tenango. After the drug was apportioned and the candle onthe "altar" was extinguished, we awaited the effects inthe darkness. Before a half hour had elapsed, the curanderamurmured something; her daughter and Don Aurelio also becamerestless. Herlinda translated and explained to us what was wrong.Mar�a Sabina had said that the pills lacked the spirit of themushrooms. I discussed the situation with Gordon, who lay besideme. For us it was clear that absorption of the active principlefrom the pills, which must first dissolve in the stomach, occursmore slowly than from the mushrooms, in which some of the activeprinciple already becomes absorbed through the mucous membranesduring chewing. But how could we give a scientific explanationunder such conditions? Rather than try to explain, we decided toact. We distributed more pills. Both curanderas and thecurandero each received another pair. They had now each taken atotal dosage of 30 mg psilocybin. After about another quarter of an hour, the spiritof the pills did begin to yield its effects, which lasted untilthe crack of dawn. The daughters, and Don Aurelio with his deepbass voice, fervently answered the prayers and singing of the curandera.Blissful, yearning moans of Apolonia and Aurora, between singingand prayer, gave the impression that the religious experience ofthe young women in the drug inebriation was combined withsensual-sexual feelings. In the middle of the ceremony Mar�a Sabina askedfor our request. Gordon inquired again after the health of hisdaughter and grandchild. He received the same good information asfrom the curandera Consuela. Mother and child were in factwell when he returned home to New York. Obviously, however, thisstill represents no proof of the prophetic abilities of both curanderas. Evidently as an effect of the hojas, I foundmyself for some time in a state of mental sensitivity and intenseexperience, which, however, was not accompanied byhallucinations. Anita, Irmgard, and Gordon experienced a euphoriccondition of inebriation that was influenced by the strange,mystical atmosphere. My wife was impressed by the vision of verydistinct strange line patterns. She was astonished and perplexed, later, ondiscovering precisely the same images in the rich ornamentationover the altar in an old church near Puebla. That was on thereturn trip to Mexico City, when we visited churches fromcolonial times. These admirable churches offer great cultural andhistorical interest because the Indian artists and workmen whoassisted in their construction smuggled in elements of Indianstyle. Klaus Thomas, in his book Die kunstlich gesteuerteSeele [The artificially steered mind] (Ferdinand Enke Verlag,Stuttgart, 1970), writes about the possible influence of visionsfrom psilocybin inebriation on Meso-American Indian art:"Surely a cultural-historical comparison of the old and newcreations of Indian art . . . must convince the unbiasedspectator of the harmony with the images, forms and colors of apsilocybin inebriation." The Mexican character of thevisions seen in my first experience with dried Psilocybe mexicanamushrooms and the drawing of Li Gelpke after a psilocybininebriation could also point to such an association. As we took leave of Mar�a Sabina and her clan atthe crack of dawn, the curandera said that the pills hadthe same power as the mushrooms, that there was no difference.This was a confirmation from the most competent authority, thatthe synthetic psilocybin is identical with the natural product.As a parting gift I let Mar�a Sabina have a vial of psilocybinpills. She radiantly explained to our interpreter Herlinda thatshe could now give consultations even in the season when nomushrooms grow. How should we judge the conduct of Mar�a Sabina,the fact that she allowed strangers, white people, access to thesecret ceremony, and let them try the sacred mushroom? To her credit it can be said that she had therebyopened the door to the exploration of the Mexican mushroom cultin its present form, and to the scientific, botanical, andchemical investigation of the sacred mushrooms. Valuable activesubstances, psilocybin and psilocin, resulted. Without thisassistance, the ancient knowledge and experience that wasconcealed in these secret practices would possibly, evenprobably, have disappeared without a trace, without having bornefruit, in the advancement of Western civilization. From another standpoint, the conduct of this curanderacan be regarded as a profanation of a sacred custom-even as abetrayal. Some of her countrymen were of this opinion, which wasexpressed in acts of revenge, including the burning of her house. The profanation of the mushroom cult did not stopwith the scientific investigations. The publication about themagic mushrooms unleashed an invasion of hippies and drug seekersinto the Mazatec country, many of whom behaved badly, some evencriminally. Another undesirable consequence was the beginning oftrue tourism in Huautla de Jim�nez, whereby the originality ofthe place was eradicated. Such statements and considerations are, for themost part, the concern of ethnographical research. Whereverresearchers and scientists trace and elucidate the remains ofancient customs that are becoming rarer, their primitiveness islost. This loss is only more or less counterbalanced when theoutcome of the research represents a lasting cultural gain. From Huautla de Jim�nez we proceeded first toTeotitl�n, in a breakneck truck ride along a half-paved road,and from there went on a comfortable car trip back to MexicoCity, the starting point of our expedition. I had lost severalkilograms in body weight, but was overwhelmingly compensated inenchanting experiences. The herbarium samples of hojas de la Pastora,which we had brought with us, were subjected to botanicalidentification by Carl Epling and Carlos D. Jativa at theBotanical Institute of Harvard University in Cambridge,Massachusetts. They found that this plant was a hithertoundescribed species of Salvia, which was named Salviadivinorum by these authors. The chemical investigation of the juice of themagic sage in the laboratory in Basel was unsuccessful. Thepsychoactive principle of this drug seems to be a rather unstablesubstance, since the juice prepared in Mexico and preserved withalcohol proved in self-experiments to be no longer active. Wherethe chemical nature of the active principle is concerned, theproblem of the magic plant ska Mar�a Pastora still awaitssolution. So far in this book I have mainly described myscientific work and matters relating to my professional activity.But this work, by its very nature, had repercussions on my ownlife and personality, not least because it brought me intocontact with interesting and important contemporaries. I havealready mentioned some of them—Timothy Leary, Rudolf Gelpke,Gordon Wasson. Now, in the pages that follow, I would like toemerge from the natural scientist's reserve, in order to portrayencounters which were personally meaningful to me and whichhelped me solve questions posed by the substances I haddiscovered.

Radiance from Ernst J�nger Radiance is the perfect term to express theinfluence that Ernst J�nger's literary work and personality havehad on me. In the light of his perspective, whichstereoscopically comprises the surfaces and depths of things, theworld I knew took on a new, translucent splendor. That happened along time before the discovery of LSD and before I came intopersonal contact with this author in connection withhallucinogenic drugs. My enchantment with Ernst J�nger began with hisbook Das Abenteuerliche Herz [The adventurous heart].Again and again in the last forty years I have taken up thisbook. Here more than ever, in themes that weigh more lightly andlie closer to me than war and a new type of human being (subjectsof J�nger's earlier books), the beauty and magic of J�nger'sprose was opened to me-descriptions of flowers, of dreams, ofsolitary walks; thoughts about chance, the future, colors, andabout other themes that have direct relation to our personallives. Everywhere in his prose the miracle of creation becameevident, in the precise description of the surfaces and, intranslucence, of the depths; and the uniqueness and theimperishable in every human being was touched upon. No otherwriter has thus opened my eyes. Drugs were also mentioned in Das AbenteuerlicheHerz. Many years passed, however, before I myself began to beespecially interested in this subject, after the discovery of thepsychic effects of LSD. My first correspondence with Ernst J�nger hadnothing to do with the context of drugs; rather I once wrote tohim on his birthday, as a thankful reader. Bottmingen, 29 March 1947 Dear Mr. J�nger, As one richly endowed by you for years, I wished to send a jar of honey to you for your birthday. But I did not have this pleasure, because my export license has been refused in Bern. The gift was intended less as a greeting from a country in which milk and honey still flow, than as a reminiscence of the enchanting sentences in your book Auf den Marmorklippen (On the Marble Cliffs), where you speak of the "golden bees." The book mentioned here had appeared in 1939,just shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Auf denMarmorklippen is not only a masterpiece of German prose, but alsoa work of great significance because in this book thecharacteristics of tyrants and the horror of war and nocturnalbombardment are described prophetically, in poetic vision. In the course of our correspondence, Ernst J�ngeralso inquired about my LSD studies, of which he had learnedthrough a friend. Thereupon I sent him the pertinentpublications, which he acknowledged with the following comments: Kirchhorst, 3/3/1948 . . . together with both enclosures concerning your new phantasticum. It seems indeed that you have entered a field that contains so many tempting mysteries. Your consignment came together with the Confessions of an English Opium Eater, that has just been published in a new translation. The translator writes me that his reading of Das Abenteuerliche Herz stimulated him to do his work. As far as I am concerned, my practical studies in this field are far behind me. These are experiments in which one sooner or later embarks on truly dangerous paths, and may be considered lucky to escape with only a black eye. What interested me above all was the relationship of these substances to productivity. It has been my experience, however, that creative achievement requires an alert consciousness, and that it diminishes under the spell of drugs. On the other hand, conceptualization is important, and one gains insights under the influence of drugs that indeed are not possible otherwise. I consider the beautiful essay that Maupassant has written about ether to be such an insight. Moreover, I had the impression that in fever one also discovers new landscapes, new archipelagos, and a new music, that becomes completely distinct when the "customs station" ["An der Zollstation" [At the custom station], the title heading of a section in Das Abenteuerliche Herz (2d ed.) that concerns the transition from life to death.] appears. For geographic description, on the other hand, one must be fully conscious. What productivity means to the artist, healing means to the physician. Accordingly, it also may suffice for him that he sometimes enters the regions through the tapestries that our senses have woven. Moreover, I seem to perceive in our time less of a taste for the phantastica than for the energetica—amphetamine, which has even been furnished to fliers and other soldiers by the armies, belongs to this group. Tea is in my opinion a phantasticum, coffee an energeticum—tea therefore possesses a disproportionately higher artistic rank. I notice that coffee disrupts the delicate lattice of light and shadows, the fruitful doubts that emerge during the writing of a sentence. One exceeds his inhibitions. With tea, on the other hand, the thoughts climb genuinely upward. So far as my "studies" are concerned, I had a manuscript on that topic, but have since burned it. My excursions terminated with hashish, that led to very pleasant, but also to manic states, to oriental tyranny.... Soon afterward, in a letter from Ernst J�nger Ilearned that he had inserted a discourse about drugs in the novelHeliopolis, on which he was then working. He wrote to meabout the drug researcher who figures in the novel: Among the trips in the geographical and metaphysical worlds, which I am attempting to describe there, are those of a purely sedentary man, who explores the archipelagos beyond the navigable seas, for which he uses drugs as a vehicle. I give extracts from his log book. Certainly, I cannot allow this Columbus of the inner globe to end well-he dies of a poisoning. Avis au lecteur. The book that appeared the following year bore thesubtitle Ruckblick auf eine Stadt [Retrospective on acity], a retrospective on a city of the future, in whichtechnical apparatus and the weapons of the present time weredeveloped still further in magic, and in which power strugglesbetween a demonic technocracy and a conservative force tookplace. In the figure of Antonio Peri, J�nger depicted thementioned drug researcher, who resided in the ancient city of Heliopolis. He captured dreams, just like others appear to chase after butterflies with nets. He did not travel to the islands on Sundays and holidays and did not frequent the taverns on Pagos beach. He locked himself up in his studio for trips into the dreamy regions. He said that all countries and unknown islands were woven into the tapestry. The drugs served him as keys to entry into the chambers and caves of this world. In the course of the years he had gained great knowledge, and he kept a log book of his excursions. A small library adjoined this studio, consisting partly of herbals and medicinal reports, partly of works by poets and magicians. Antonio tended to read there while the effect of the drug itself developed. . . . He went on voyages of discovery in the universe of his brain.... In the center of this library, which was pillagedby mercenaries of the provincial governor during the arrest ofAntonio Peri, stood The great inspirers of the nineteenth century: De Quincey, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Poe, and Baudelaire. Yet there were also books from the ancient past: herbals, necromancy texts, and demonology of the middle-aged world. They included the names Albertus Magnus, Raimundus Lullus, and Agrippa of Nettesheym.... Moreover, there was the great folio De Praestigiis Daemonum by Wierus, and the very unique compilations of Medicus Weckerus, published in Basel in 1582.... In another part of his collection, Antonio Periseemed to have cast his attention principally "on ancientpharmacology books, formularies and pharmacopoeias, and to havehunted for reprints of journals and annals. Among others wasfound a heavy old volume by the Heidelberg psychologists on theextract of mescal buttons, and a paper on the phantastica ofergot by Hofmann-Bottmingen...." In the same year in which Heliopolis cameout, I made the personal acquaintance of the author. I went tomeet Ernst J�nger in Ravensburg, for a Swiss sojourn. On awonderful fall journey in southern Switzerland, together withmutual friends, I experienced the radiant power of hispersonality. Two years later, at the beginning of February 1951,came the great adventure, an LSD trip with Ernst J�nger. Since,up until that moment, there were only reports of LSD experimentsin connection with psychiatric inquiries, this experimentespecially interested me, because this was an opportunity toobserve the effects of LSD on the artistic person, in anonmedical milieu. That was still somewhat before Aldous Huxley,from the same perspective, began to experiment with mescaline,about which he then reported in his two books The Doors ofPerception and Heaven and Hell. In order to have medical aid on hand if necessary,I invited my friend, the physician and pharmacologist ProfessorHeribert Konzett, to participate. The trip took place at 10:00 inthe morning, in the living room of our house in Bottmingen. Sincethe reaction of such a highly sensitive man as Ernst J�nger wasnot foreseeable, a low dose was chosen for this first experimentas a precaution, only 0.05 mg. The experiment then, did not leadinto great depths. The beginning phase was characterized by theintensification of aesthetic experience. Red-violet roses were ofunknown luminosity and radiated in portentous brightness. Theconcerto for flute and harp by Mozart was perceived in itscelestial beauty as heavenly music. In mutual astonishment wecontemplated the haze of smoke that ascended with the ease ofthought from a Japanese incense stick. As the inebriation becamedeeper and the conversation ended, we came to fantastic reverieswhile we lay in our easy chairs with closed eyes. Ernst J�ngerenjoyed the color display of oriental images: I was on a tripamong Berber tribes in North Africa, saw colored caravans andlush oases. Heribert Konzett, whose features seemed to me to betransfigured, Buddha-like, experienced a breath of timelessness,liberation from the past and the future, blessedness throughbeing completely here and now. The return from the altered state of consciousnesswas associated with strong sensitivity to cold. Like freezingtravelers, we enveloped ourselves in covers for the landing. Thereturn to everyday reality was celebrated with a good dinner, inwhich Burgundy flowed copiously. This trip was characterized by the mutuality andparallelism of our experiences, which were perceived asprofoundly joyful. All three of us had drawn near the gate to anexperience of mystical being; however, it did not open. The dosewe had chosen was too low. In misunderstanding this reason, ErnstJ�nger, who had earlier been thrust into deeper realms by a highdose of mescaline, remarked: "Compared with the tigermescaline, your LSD, is, after all, only a house cat." Afterlater experiments with higher doses of LSD, he revised thisestimation. J�nger has assimilated the mentioned spectacle ofthe incense stick into literature, in his story Besuch aufGotenhotm [Visit to Godenholm], in which deeper experiencesof drug inebriation also play a part: Schwarzenberg burned an incense stick, as he sometimes did, to clear the air. A blue plume ascended from the tip of the stick. Moltner looked at it first with astonishment, then with delight, as if a new power of the eyes had come to him. It revealed itself in the play of this fragrant smoke, which ascended from the slender stick and then branched out into a delicate crown. It was as if his imagination had created it-a pallid web of sea lilies in the depths, that scarcely trembled from the beat of the surf. Time was active in this creation-it had circled it, whirled about it, wreathed it, as if imaginary coins rapidly piled up one on top of another. The abundance of space revealed itself in the fiber work, the nerves, which stretched and unfolded in the height, in a vast number of filaments. Now a breath of air affected the vision, and softly twisted it about the shaft like a dancer. Moltner uttered a shout of surprise. The beams and lattices of the wondrous flower wheeled around in new planes, in new fields. Myriads of molecules observed the harmony. Here the laws no longer acted under the veil of appearance; matter was so delicate and weightless that it clearly reflected them. How simple and cogent everything was. The numbers, masses and weights stood out from matter. They cast off the raiments. No goddess could inform the initiates more boldly and freely. The pyramids with their weight did not reach up to this revelation. That was Pythagorean luster. No spectacle had ever affected him with such a magic spell. This deepened experience in the aesthetic sphere,as it is described here in the example of contemplation of a hazeof blue smoke, is typical of the beginning phase of LSDinebriation, before deeper alterations of conscious begin. I visited Ernst J�nger occasionally in thefollowing years, in Wilfingen, Germany, where he had moved fromRavensburg; or we met in Switzerland, at my place in Bottmingen,or in Bundnerland in southeastern Switzerland. Through the sharedLSD experience our relations had deepened. Drugs and problemsconnected with them constituted a major subject of ourconversation and correspondence, without our having made furtherpractical experiments in the meantime. We exchanged literature about drugs. Ernst J�ngerthus let me have for my drug library the rare, valuable monographof Dr. Ernst Freiherrn von Bibra, Die NarkotischenGenussmittel und der Mensch [Narcotic pleasure drugs and man]printed in Nuremburg in 1855. This book is a pioneering, standardwork of drug literature, a source of the first order, above allas relates to the history of drugs. What von Bibra embraces underthe designation "Narkotischen Genussmittel" are notonly substances like opium and thorn apple, but also coffee,tobacco, kat, which do not fall under the present conception ofnarcotics, any more than do drugs such as coca, fly agaric, andhashish, which he also described. Noteworthy, and today still as topical as at thetime, are the general opinions about drugs that von Bibracontrived more than a century ago: The individual who has taken too much hashish, and then runs frantically about in the streets and attacks everyone who confronts him, sinks into insignificance beside the numbers of those who after mealtime pass calm and happy hours with a moderate dose; and the number of those who are able to overcome the heaviest exertions through coca, yes, who were possibly rescued from death by starvation through coca, by far exceed the few coqueros who have undermined their health by immoderate use. In the same manner, only a misplaced hypocrisy can condemn the vinous cup of old father Noah, because individual drunkards do not know how to observe limit and moderation. From time to time I advised Ernst J�nger aboutactual and entertaining events in the field of inebriating drugs,as in my letter of September 1955: . . . Last week the first 200 grams of a new drug arrived, whose investigation I wish to take up. It involves the seeds of a mimosa (Piptadenia peregrina Benth,) that is used as a stimulating intoxicant by the Indians of the Orinoco. The seeds are ground, fermented, and then mixed with the powder of burned snail shells. This powder is sniffed by the Indians with the help of a hollow, forked bird bone, as already reported by Alexander von Humboldt in Reise nach den Aequinoctiat-Gegenden des Neuen Kontinents [Voyage to the equinoctial regions of the new continent] (Book 8, Chapter 24). The warlike tribe, the Otomaco, especially use this drug, called niopo, yupa, nopo or cojoba, to an extensive degree, even today. It is reported in the monograph by P. J. Gumilla, S. J. (El Orinoco Ilustrado, 1741): "The Otomacos sniffed the powder before they went to battle with the Caribes, for in earlier times there existed savage wars between these tribes.... This drug robs them completely of reason, and they frantically seize their weapons. And if the women were not so adept at holding them back and binding them fast, they would daily cause horrible devastation. It is a terrible vice.... Other benign and docile tribes that also sniff the yupa, do not get into such a fury as the Otomacos, who through self-injury with this agent made themselves completely cruel before combat, and marched into battle with savage fury." I am curious how niopo would act on people like us. Should a niopo session one day come to pass, then we should on no account send our wives away, as on that early spring reverie [The LSD trip of February 1951 is meant here.], that they may bind us fast if necessary.... Chemical analysis of this drug led to isolation ofactive principles that, like the ergot alkaloids and psilocybin,belong to the group of indole alkaloids, but which were alreadydescribed in the technical literature, and were therefore notinvestigated further in the Sandoz laboratories. [Translator'snote: The active principles of niopo are DMT(N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and its congeners. DMT was firstprepared in 1931 by Manske.] The fantastic effects describedabove appeared to occur only with the particular manner of use assnuff powder, and also seemed to be related, in all probability,to the psychic structure of the Indian tribes concerned. Ambivalence of Drug Use Fundamental questions of drug problems were dealtwith in the following correspondence. Bottmingen, 16 December 1961 Dear Mr. J�nger, On the one hand, I would have the great desire, besides the natural-scientific, chemical-pharmacological investigation of hallucinogenic substances, also to research their use as magic drugs in other regions.... On the other hand, I must admit that the fundamental question very much occupies me, whether the use of these types of drugs, namely of substances that so deeply affect our minds, could not indeed represent a forbidden transgression of limits. As long as any means or methods are used, which provide only an additional, newer aspect of reality, surely there is nothing to object to in such means; on the contrary, the experience and the knowledge of further facets of the reality only makes this reality ever more real to us. The question exists, however, whether the deeply affecting drugs under discussion here will in fact only open an additional window for our senses and perceptions, or whether the spectator himself, the core of his being, undergoes alterations. The latter would signify that something is altered that in my opinion should always remain intact. My concern is addressed to the question, whether the innermost core of our being is actually unimpeachable, and cannot become damaged by whatever happens in its material, physical-chemical, biological and psychic shells-or whether matter in the form of these drugs displays a potency that has the ability to attack the spiritual center of the personality, the self. The latter would have to be explained by the fact that the effect of magic drugs happens at the borderline where mind and matter merge-that these magic substances are themselves cracks in the infinite realm of matter, in which the depth of matter, its relationship with the mind, becomes particularly obvious. This could be expressed by a modification of the familiar words of Goethe: "Were the eye not sunny, It could never behold the sun; If the power of the mind were not in matter, How could matter disturb the mind." This would correspond to cracks which the radioactive substances constitute in the periodic system of the elements, where the transition of matter into energy becomes manifest. Indeed, one must ask whether the production of atomic energy likewise represents a transgression of forbidden limits. A further disquieting thought, which follows from the possibility of influencing the highest intellectual functions by traces of a substance, concerns free will. The highly active psychotropic substances like LSD and psilocybin possess in their chemical structure a very close relationship with substances inherent in the body, which are found in the central nervous system and play an important role in the regulation of its functions. It is therefore conceivable that through some disturbance in the metabolism of the normal neurotransmitters, a compound like LSD or psilocybin is formed, which can determine and alter the character of the individual, his world view and his behavior. A trace of a substance, whose production or nonproduction we cannot control with our wills, has the power to shape our destiny. Such biochemical considerations could have led to the sentence that Gottfried Benn quoted in his essay "Provoziertes Leben" [Provoked life]: "God is a substance, a drug!" On the other hand, it is well known that substances like adrenaline, for example, are formed or set free in our organism by thoughts and emotions, which for their part determine the functions of the nervous system. One may therefore suppose that our material organism is susceptible to and shaped by our mind, in the same way that our intellectual essence is shaped by our biochemistry. Which came first can indeed no better be determined than the question, whether the chicken came before the egg. In spite of my uncertainty with regard to the fundamental dangers that could lie in the use of hallucinogenic substances, I have continued investigations on the active principles of the Mexican magic morning glories, of which I wrote you briefly once before. In the seeds of this morning glory, that were called ololiuhqui by the ancient Aztecs, we found as active principles lysergic acid derivatives chemically very closely related to LSD. That was an almost unbelievable finding. I have all along had a particular love for the morning glories. They were the first flowers that I grew myself in my little child's garden. Their blue and red cups belong to the first memories of my childhood. I recently read in a book by D. T. Suzuki, Zen and Japanese Culture, that the morning glory plays a great role in Japan, among the flower lovers, in literature, and in graphic arts. Its fleeting splendor has given the Japanese imagination rich stimulus. Among others, Suzuki quotes a three- line poem of the poetess Chiyo (1702-75), who one morning went to fetch water from a neighbor's house, because . . . "My trough is captivated by a morning glory blossom, So I ask after water." The morning glory thus shows both possible ways of influencing the mind-body-essence of man: in Mexico it exerts its effects in a chemical way as a magic drug, while in Japan it acts from the spiritual side, through the beauty of its flower cups. Wilflingen, 17 December 1961 Dear Mr. Hofmann, I give you my thanks for your detailed letter of 16 December. I have reflected on your central question, and may probably become occupied with it on the occasion of the revision of An der Zeitmauer [At the wall of time]. There I intimated that, in the field of physics as well as in the field of biology, we are beginning to develop procedures that are no longer to be understood as advances in the established sense, but that rather intervene in evolution and lead forth in the development of the species. Certainly I turn the glove inside out, for I suppose that it is a new world age, which begins to act evolutionarily on the prototypes. Our science with its theories and discoveries is therefore not the cause, rather one of the consequences of evolution, among others. Animals, plants, the atmosphere and the surfaces of planets will be concerned simultaneously. We do not progress from point to point, rather we cross over a line. The risk that you indicated is well to be considered. However, it exists in every aspect of our existence. The common denominator appears now here, now there. In mentioning radioactivity, you use the word crack. Cracks are not merely points of discovery, but also points of destruction. Compared to the effects of radiation, those of the magical drugs are more genuine and much less rough. In classical manner they lead us beyond the humane. Gurdjieff has already seen that to some extent. Wine has already changed much, has brought new gods and a new humanity with it. But wine is to the new substances as classical physics is to modern physics. These things should only be tried in small circles. I cannot agree with the thoughts of Huxley, that possibilities for transcendence could here be given to the masses. Indeed, this does not involve comforting fictions, but rather realities, if we take the matter earnestly. And few contacts will suffice here for the setting of courses and guidance. It also transcends theology and belongs in the chapter of theogony, as it necessarily entails entry into a new house, in the astrological sense. At first, one can be satisfied with this insight, and should above all be cautious with the designations. Heartfelt thanks also for the beautiful picture of the blue morning glory. It appears to be the same that I cultivate year after year in my garden. I did not know that it possesses specific powers; however, that is probably the case with every plant. We do not know the key to most. Besides this, there must be a central viewpoint from which not only the chemistry, the structure, the color, but rather all attributes become significant.... An Experiment with Psilocybin Such theoretical discussions about the magic drugswere supplemented by practical experiments. One such experiment,which served as a comparison between LSD and psilocybin, tookplace in the spring of 1962. The proper occasion for it presenteditself at the home of the J�ngers, in the former head forester'shouse of Stauffenberg's Castle in Wilflingen. My friends, thepharmacologist Professor Heribert Konzett and the Islamic scholarDr. Rudolf Gelpke, also took part in this mushroom symposium. The old chronicles described how the Aztecs drank chocolatlbefore they ate teonan�catl. Thus Mrs. Liselotte J�ngerlikewise served us hot chocolate, to set the mood. Then sheabandoned the four men to their fate. We had gathered in a fashionable living room, witha dark wooden ceiling, white tile stove, period furniture, oldFrench engravings on the walls, a gorgeous bouquet of tulips onthe table. Ernst J�nger wore a long, broad, dark blue stripedkaftan-like garment that he had brought from Egypt; HeribertKonzett was resplendent in a brightly embroidered mandarin gown;Rudolf Gelpke and I had put on housecoats. The everyday realityshould be laid aside, along with everyday clothing. Shortly before sundown we took the drug, not themushrooms, but rather their active principle, 20 mg psilocybineach. That corresponded to some two-thirds of the very strongdose that was taken by the curandera Maria Sabina in the form ofPsilocybe mushrooms. After an hour I still noticed no effect, while mycompanions were already very deeply into the trip. I had comewith the hope that in the mushroom inebriation I could manage toallow certain images from euphoric moments of my childhood, whichremained in my memory as blissful experiences, to come alive: ameadow covered with chrysanthemums lightly stirred by the earlysummer wind; the rosebush in the evening light after a rainstorm; the blue irises hanging over the vineyard wall. Instead ofthese bright images from my childhood home, strange sceneryemerged, when the mushroom factor finally began to act. Halfstupefied, I sank deeper, passed through totally deserted citieswith a Mexican type of exotic, yet dead splendor. Terrified, Itried to detain myself on the surface, to concentrate alertly onthe outer world, on the surroundings. For a time I succeeded. Ithen observed Ernst J�nger, colossal in the room, pacing backand forth, a powerful, mighty magician. Heribert Konzett in thesilky lustrous housecoat seemed to be a dangerous, Chinese clown.Even Rudolf Gelpke appeared sinister to me; long, thin,mysterious. With the increasing depth of inebriation,everything became yet stranger. I even felt strange to myself.Weird, cold, foolish, deserted, in a dull light, were the placesI traversed when I closed my eyes. Emptied of all meaning, theenvironment also seemed ghostlike to me whenever I opened my eyesand tried to cling to the outer world. The total emptinessthreatened to drag me down into absolute nothingness. I rememberhow I seized Rudolf Gelpke's arm as he passed by my chair, andheld myself to him, in order not to sink into dark nothingness.Fear of death seized me, and illimitable longing to return to theliving creation, to the reality of the world of men. Aftertimeless fear I slowly returned to the room . I saw and heard thegreat magician lecturing uninterruptedly with a clear, loudvoice, about Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel, and speaking about theold G�a, the beloved little mother. Heribert Konzett and RudolfGelpke were already completely on the earth again, while I couldonly regain my footing with great effort. For me this entry into the mushroom world had beena test, a confrontation with a dead world and with the void. Theexperiment had developed differently from what I had expected.Nevertheless, the encounter with the void can also be appraisedas a gain. Then the existence of the creation appears so muchmore wondrous. Midnight had passed, as we sat together at thetable that the mistress of the house had set in the upper story.We celebrated the return with an exquisite repast and withMozart's music. The conversation, during which we exchanged ourexperiences, lasted almost until morning. Ernst J�nger has described how he had experiencedthis trip, in his book Ann�henngen—Drogen und Rausch[Approaches-drugs and inebriation] (published by Ernst KlettVerlag, Stuttgart, 1970), in the section "EinPilz-Symposium" [A mushroom symposium]. The following is anextract from the work: As usual, a half hour or a little more passed in silence. Then came the first signs: the flowers on the table began to flare up and sent out flashes. It was time for leaving work; outside the streets were being cleaned, like on every weekend. The brush strokes invaded the silence painfully. This shuffling and brushing, now and again also a scraping, pounding, rumbling, and hammering, has random causes and is also symptomatic, like one of the signs that announces an illness. Again and again it also plays a role in the history of magic practices. By this time the mushroom began to act; the spring bouquet glowed darker. That was no natural light. The shadows stirred in the corners, as if they sought form. I became uneasy, even chilled, despite the heat that emanated from the tiles. I stretched myself on the sofa, drew the covers over my head. Everything became skin and was touched, even the retina-there the contact was light. This light was multicolored; it arranged itself in strings, which gently swung back and forth; in strings of glass beads of oriental doorways. They formed doors, like those one passes through in a dream, curtains of lust and danger. The wind stirred them like a garment. They also fell down from the belts of dancers, opened and closed themselves with the swing of the hips, and from the beads a rippling of the most delicate sounds fluttered to the heightened senses. The chime of the silver rings on the ankles and wrists is already too loud. It smells of sweat, blood, tobacco, chopped horse hairs, cheap rose essence. Who knows what is going on in the stables? It must be an immense palace, Mauritanian, not a good place. At this ballroom flights of adjoining rooms lead into the lower stratum. And everywhere the curtains with their glitter, their sparkling, radioactive glow. Moreover, the rippling of glassy instruments with their beckoning, their wooing solicitation: " Will you go with me, beautiful boy?" Now it ceased, now it repeated, more importunate, more intrusive, almost already assured of agreement. Now came forms-historical collages, the vox humana, the call of the cuckoo. Was it the whore of Santa Lucia, who stuck her breasts out of the window? Then the play was ruined. Salome danced; the amber necklace emitted sparks and made the nipples erect. What would one not do for one's Johannes? [Translator's note: "Johannes" here is slang for penis, as in English "Dick" or "Peter."] -damned, that was a disgusting obscenity, which did not come from me, but was whispered through the curtain. The snakes were dirty, scarcely alive, they wallowed sluggishly over the floor mats. They were garnished with brilliant shards. Others looked up from the floor with red and green eyes. It glistened and whispered, hissed and sparkled like diminutive sickles at the sacred harvest. Then it quieted, and came anew, more faintly, more forward. They had me in their hand. "There we immediately understood ourselves." Madam came through the curtain: she was busy, passed by me without noticing me. I saw the boots with the red heels. Garters constricted the thick thighs in the middle, the flesh bulged out there. The enormous breasts, the dark delta of the Amazon, parrots, piranhas, semiprecious stones everywhere. Now she went into the kitchen-or are there still cellars here? The sparkling and whispering, the hissing and twinkling could no longer be differentiated; it seemed to become concentrated, now proudly rejoicing, full of hope. It became hot and intolerable; I threw the covers off. The room was faintly illuminated; the pharmacologist stood at the window in the white mandarin frock, which had served me shortly before in Rottweil at the carnival. The orientalist sat beside the tile stove; he moaned as if he had a nightmare. I understood; it had been a first round, and it would soon start again. The time was not yet up. I had already seen the beloved little mother under other circumstances. But even excrement is earth, belongs like gold to transformed matter. One must come to terms with it, without getting too close. These were the earthy mushrooms. More light was hidden in the dark grain that burst from the ear, more yet in the green juice of the succulents on the glowing slopes of Mexico. . . . [Translator's note: J�nger is referring to LSD, a derivative of ergot, and mescaline, derived from the Mexican peyotl cactus.] The trip had run awry—possibly I should address the mushrooms once more. Yet indeed the whispering returned, the flashing and sparkling—the bait pulled the fish close behind itself. Once the motif is given, then it engraves itself, like on a roller each new beginning, each new revolution repeats the melody. The game did not get beyond this kind of dreariness. I don't know how often this was repeated, and prefer not to dwell upon it. Also, there are things which one would rather keep to oneself. In any case, midnight was past.... We went upstairs; the table was set. The senses were still heightened and the Doors of Perception were opened. The light undulated from the red wine in the carafe; a froth surged at the brim. We listened to a flute concerto. It had not turned out better for the others: How beautiful, to be back among men." Thus Albert Hofmann. The orientalist on the other hand had been inSamarkand, where Timur rests in a coffin of nephrite. He hadfollowed the victorious march through cities, whose dowry onentry was a cauldron filled with eyes. There he had long stoodbefore one of the skull pyramids that terrible Timur had erected,and in the multitude of severed heads had perceived even his own.It was encrusted with stones. A light dawned on the pharmacologist when he heard this: Now I know why you were sitting in the armchair without your head-I was astonished; I knew I wasn't dreaming. I wonder whether I should not strike out this detail since it borders on the area of ghost stories. The mushroom substance had carried all four of usoff, not into luminous heights, rather into deeper regions. Itseems that the psilocybin inebriation is more darkly colored inthe majority of cases than the inebriation produced by LSD. Theinfluence of these two active substances is sure to differ fromone individual to another. Personally, for me, there was morelight in the LSD experiments than in the experiments with theearthy mushroom, just as Ernst J�nger remarks in the precedingreport. Another LSD Session The next and last thrust into the inner universetogether with Ernst J�nger, this time again using LSD, led usvery far from everyday consciousness. We came close to theultimate door. Of course this door, according to Ernst J�nger,will in fact only open for us in the great transition from lifeinto the hereafter. This last joint experiment occurred in February1970, again at the head forester's house in Wilflingen. In thiscase there were only the two of us. Ernst J�nger took 0.15 mgLSD, I took 0.10 mg. Ernst J�nger has published withoutcommentary the log book, the notes he made during the experiment,in Approaches, in the section "Nochmals LSD"[LSD once again]. They are scanty and tell the reader little,just like my own records. The experiment lasted from morning just afterbreakfast until darkness fell. At the beginning of the trip, weagain listened to the concerto for flute and harp by Mozart,which always made me especially happy, but this time, strange tosay, seemed to me like the turning of porcelain figures. Then theintoxication led quickly into wordless depths. When I wanted todescribe the perplexing alterations of consciousness to ErnstJ�nger, no more than two or three words came out, for theysounded so false, so unable to express the experience; theyseemed to originate from an infinitely distant world that hadbecome strange; I abandoned the attempt, laughing hopelessly.Obviously, Ernst J�nger had the same experience, yet we did notneed speech; a glance sufficed for the deepest understanding. Icould, however, put some scraps of sentences on paper, such as atthe beginning: "Our boat tosses violently." Later, uponregarding expensively bound books in the library: "Likered-gold pushed from within to without-exuding goldenluster." Outside it began to snow. Masked children marchedpast and carts with carnival revelers passed by in the streets.With a glance through the window into the garden, in which snowpatches lay, many-colored masks appeared over the high wallsbordering it, embedded in an infinitely joyful shade of blue:"A Breughel garden—I live with and in theobjects." Later: "At present—no connection withthe everyday world." Toward the end, deep, comfortinginsight expressed: "Hitherto confirmed on my path."This time LSD had led to a blessed approach.

Meeting with Aldous Huxley In the mid-1950s, two books by Aldous Huxleyappeared, The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell, dealingwith inebriated states produced by hallucinogenic drugs. Thealterations of sensory perceptions and consciousness, which theauthor experienced in a self-experiment with mescaline, areskillfully described in these books. The mescaline experiment wasa visionary experience for Huxley. He saw objects in a new light;they disclosed their inherent, deep, timeless existence, whichremains hidden from everyday sight. These two books contained fundamental observationson the essence of visionary experience and about the significanceof this manner of comprehending the world—in culturalhistory, in the creation of myths, in the origin of religions,and in the creative process out of which works of art arise.Huxley saw the value of hallucinogenic drugs in that they givepeople who lack the gift of spontaneous visionary perceptionbelonging to mystics, saints, and great artists, the potential toexperience this extraordinary state of consciousness, and therebyto attain insight into the spiritual world of these greatcreators. Hallucinogens could lead to a deepened understanding ofreligious and mystical content, and to a new and fresh experienceof the great works of art. For Huxley these drugs were keyscapable of opening new doors of perception; chemical keys, inaddition to other proven but laborious " door openers"to the visionary world like meditation, isolation, and fasting,or like certain yoga practices. At the time I already knew the earlier work of thisgreat writer and thinker, books that meant much to me, like PointCounter Point, Brave New World, After Many a Summer, Eyeless inGaza, and a few others. In The Doors of Perception andHeaven and Hell, Huxley's newly-published works, I found ameaningful exposition of the experience induced by hallucinogenicdrugs, and I thereby gained a deepened insight into my own LSDexperiments. I was therefore delighted when I received atelephone call from Aldous Huxley in the laboratory one morningin August 1961. He was passing through Zurich with his wife. Heinvited me and my wife to lunch in the Hotel Sonnenberg. A gentleman with a yellow freesia in hisbuttonhole, a tall and noble appearance, who exudedkindness—this is the image I retained from this firstmeeting with Aldous Huxley. The table conversation revolvedmainly around the problem of magic drugs. Both Huxley and hiswife, Laura Archera Huxley, had also experimented with LSD andpsilocybin. Huxley would have preferred not to designate thesetwo substances and mescaline as "drugs," because inEnglish usage, as also by the way with Droge in German,that word has a pejorative connotation, and because it wasimportant to differentiate the hallucinogens from the otherdrugs, even linguistically. He believed in the great importanceof agents producing visionary experience in the modern phase ofhuman evolution. He considered experiments under laboratoryconditions to be insignificant, since in the extraordinarilyintensified susceptibility and sensitivity to externalimpressions, the surroundings are of decisive importance. Herecommended to my wife, when we spoke of her native place in themountains, that she take LSD in an alpine meadow and then lookinto the blue cup of a gentian flower, to behold the wonder ofcreation. As we parted, Aldous Huxley gave me, as aremembrance of this meeting, a tape recording of his lecture"Visionary Experience," which he had delivered the weekbefore at an international congress on applied psychology inCopenhagen. In this lecture, Aldous Huxley spoke about themeaning and essence of visionary experience and compared thistype of world view to the verbal and intellectual comprehensionof reality as its essential complement. In the following year, the newest and last book byAldous Huxley appeared, the novel Island. This story, seton the utopian island Pala, is an attempt to blend theachievements of natural science and technical civilization withthe wisdom of Eastern thought, to achieve a new culture in whichrationalism and mysticism are fruitfully united. The moksha medicine,a magical drug prepared from a mushroom, plays a significant rolein the life of the population of Pala (moksha is Sanskrit for"release," "liberation"). The drug could beused only in critical periods of life. The young men on Palareceived it in initiation rites, it is dispensed to theprotagonist of the novel during a life crisis, in the scope of apsychotherapeutic dialogue with a spiritual friend, and it helpsthe dying to relinquish the mortal body, in the transition toanother existence. In our conversation in Zurich, I had alreadylearned from Aldous Huxley that he would again treat the problemof psychedelic drugs in his forthcoming novel. Now he sent me acopy of Island, inscribed "To Dr. Albert Hofmann, theoriginal discoverer of the moksha medicine, from AldousHuxley." The hopes that Aldous Huxley placed in psychedelicdrugs as a means of evoking visionary experience, and the uses ofthese substances in everyday life, are subjects of a letter of 29February 1962, in which he wrote me: . . . I have good hopes that this and similar work will result in the development of a real Natural History of visionary experience, in all its variations, determined by differences of physique, temperament and profession, and at the same time of a technique of Applied Mysticism—a technique for helping individuals to get the most out of their transcendental experience and to make use of the insights from the "Other World" in the affairs of "This World." Meister Eckhart wrote that "what is taken in by contemplation must be given out in love." Essentially this is what must be developed—the art of giving out in love and intelligence what is taken in from vision and the experience of self-transcendence and solidarity with the Universe.... Aldous Huxley and I were together often at theannual convention of the World Academy of Arts and Sciences(WAAS) in Stockholm during late summer 1963. His suggestions andcontributions to discussions at the sessions of the academy,through their form and importance, had a great influence on theproceedings. WAAS had been established in order to allow themost competent specialists to consider world problems in a forumfree of ideological and religious restrictions and from aninternational viewpoint encompassing the whole world. Theresults: proposals, and thoughts in the form of appropriatepublications, were to be placed at the disposal of theresponsible governments and executive organizations. The 1963 meeting of WAAS had dealt with thepopulation explosion and the raw material reserves and foodresources of the earth. The corresponding studies and proposalswere collected in Volume II of WAAS under the title ThePopulation Crisis and the Use of World Resources. A decadebefore birth control, environmental protection, and the energycrisis became catchwords, these world problems were examinedthere from the most serious point of view, and proposals fortheir solution were made to governments and responsibleorganizations. The catastrophic events since that time in theaforementioned fields makes evident the tragic discrepancybetween recognition, desire, and feasibility. Aldous Huxley made the proposal, as a continuationand complement of the theme "World Resources" at theStockholm convention, to address the problem "HumanResources," the exploration and application of capabilitieshidden in humans yet unused. A human race with more highlydeveloped spiritual capacities, with expanded consciousness ofthe depth and the incomprehensible wonder of being, would alsohave greater understanding of and better consideration for thebiological and material foundations of life on this earth. Aboveall, for Western people with their hypertrophied rationality, thedevelopment and expansion of a direct, emotional experience ofreality, unobstructed by words and concepts, would be ofevolutionary significance. Huxley considered psychedelic drugs tobe one means to achieve education in this direction. Thepsychiatrist Dr. Humphry Osmond, likewise participating in thecongress, who had created the term psychedelic (mind-expanding),assisted him with a report about significant possibilities of theuse of hallucinogens. The convention in Stockholm in 1963 was my lastmeeting with Aldous Huxley. His physical appearance was alreadymarked by a severe illness; his intellectual personage, however,still bore the undiminished signs of a comprehensive knowledge ofthe heights and depths of the inner and outer world of man, whichhe had displayed with so much genius, love, goodness, and humorin his literary work. Aldous Huxley died on 22 November of the same year,on the same day President Kennedy was assassinated. From LauraHuxley I obtained a copy of her letter to Julian and JulietteHuxley, in which she reported to her brother- and sister-in-lawabout her husband's last day. The doctors had prepared her for adramatic end, because the terminal phase of cancer of the throat,from which Aldous Huxley suffered, is usually accompanied byconvulsions and choking fits. He died serenely and peacefully,however. In the morning, when he was already so weak that hecould no longer speak, he had written on a sheet of paper:"LSD—try it—intramuscular—100 mmg." Mrs.Huxley understood what was meant by this, and ignoring themisgivings of the attending physician, she gave him, with her ownhand, the desired injection-she let him have the moksha medicine.

Correspondence with the Poet-Physician Walter Vogt My friendship with the physician, psychiatrist, andwriter Walter Vogt, M.D., is also among the personal contactsthat I owe to LSD. As the following extract from ourcorrespondence shows, it was less the medicinal aspects of LSD,important to the physician, than the consciousness-alteringeffects on the depth of the psyche, of interest to the writer,that constituted the theme of our correspondence. Muri/Bern, 22 November 1970 Dear Mr. Hofmann, Last night I dreamed that I was invited to tea in a cafe by a friendly family in Rome. This family also knew the pope, and so the pope sat at—the same table to tea with us. He was all in white and also wore a white miter. He sat there so handsome and was silent. And today I suddenly had the idea of sending you my Vogel auf dem Tisch [Bird on the table—as a visiting card if you so wish—a book that remained a little apocryphal, which upon reflection I do not regret, although the Italian translator is firmly convinced that is my best. (Ah yes, the pope is also an Italian. So it goes. …) Possibly this little work will interest you. It was written in 1966 by an author who at that time still had not had any shred of experience with psychedelic substances and who read the reports about medicinal experiments with these drugs devoid of understanding. However, little has changed since, except that now the misgiving comes from the other side. I suppose that your discovery has caused a hiatus (not directly a Saul-to-Paul conversion as Roland Fischer says…) in my work (also a large word) - and indeed, that which I have written since has become rather realistic or at least less expressive. In any case I could not have brought off the cool realism of my TV piece "Spiele der Macht" [Games of power] without it. The different drafts attest it, in case they are still lying around somewhere. Should you have interest and time for a meeting, it would delight me very much to visit you sometime for a conversation. W. V. Burg, i.L. 28 November 1970 Dear Mr. Vogt, If the bird that alighted on my table was able to find its way to me, this is one more debt I owe to the magical effect of LSD. I could soon write a book about all of the results that derive from that experiment in 1943.... A. H. Muri/Bern, 13 March 1971 Dear Mr. Hofmann, Enclosed is a critique of J�nger's Annahenngen [Approaches], from the daily paper, that will presumably interest you.... It seems to me that to hallucinate—to dream—to write, stands at all times in contrast to everyday consciousness, and their functions are complementary. Here I can naturally speak only for myself. This could be different with others—it is also truly difficult to speak with others about such things, because people often speak altogether different languages.... However, since you are now gathering autographs, and do me the honor of incorporating some of my letters in your collection, I enclose for you the manuscript of my "testament"—in which your discovery plays a role as "the only joyous invention of the twentieth century...."

Very remarkable dreams in recent times induce me to test a connection between the composition (chemical) of the evening meal and the quality of dreams. Yes, LSD is also something that one eats.... A. H. Muri/Bern, 5 September 1971 Dear Mr. Hofmann, Over the weekend at Murtensee [On that Sunday, I (A. H.) hovered over the Murtensee in the balloon of my friend E. I., who had taken me along as passenger.] I often thought of you—a most radiant autumn day. Yesterday, Saturday, thanks to one tablet of aspirin (on account of a headache or mild flu), I experienced a very comical flashback, like with mescaline (of which I have had only a little, exactly once).... I have read a delightful essay by Wasson about mushrooms; he divides mankind into mycophobes and mycophiles.... Lovely fly agarics must now be growing in the forest near you. Sometime shouldn't we sample some? W. V. Muri/Bern, 7 September 1971 Dear Mr. Hofmann, Now I feel I must write briefly to tell you what I have done outside in the sun, on the dock under your balloon: I finally wrote some notes about our visit in Villars-sur-Ollons (with Dr. Leary), then a hippie-bark went by on the lake, self-made like from a Fellini film, which I sketched, and over and above it I drew your balloon. W. V. Burg i.L., 15 April 1972 Dear Mr. Vogt, Your television play "Spiele der Macht" [Games of power] has impressed me extraordinarily. I congratulate you on this magnificent piece, which allows mental cruelty to become conscious, and therefore also acts in its way as "consciousness- expanding", and can thereby prove itself therapeutic in a higher sense, like ancient tragedy. A. H. Burg i.L., 19 May 1973 Dear Mr. Vogt, Now I have already read your lay sermon three times, the description and interpretation of your Sinai Trip. [Walter Vogt: Mein Sinai Trip. Eine Laienpredigt [My Sinai trip: A lay sermon] (Verlag der Arche, Zurich, 1972). This publication contains the text of a lay sermon that Walter Vogt gave on 14 November 1971 on the invitation of Parson Christoph Mohl, in the Protestant church of Vaduz (Lichtenstein), in the course of a series of sermons by writers, and in addition contains an afterword by the author and by the inviting parson. It involves the description and interpretation of an ecstatic-religious experience evoked by LSD, that the author is able to "place in a distant, if you will superficial, analogy to the great Sinai Trip of Moses." It is not only the "patriarchal atmosphere" that is to be traced out of these descriptions, that constitutes this analogy; there are deeper references, which are more to be read between the lines of this text.] Was it really an LSD trip?… It was a courageous deed, to choose such a notorious event as a drug experience as the theme of a sermon, even a lay sermon. But the questions raised by hallucinogenic drugs do actually belong in the church—in a prominent place in the church, for they are sacred drugs (peyotl, teonanacatl, ololiuhqui, with which LSD is mostly closely related by chemical structure and activity). I can fully agree with what you say in your introduction about the modern ecclesiastical religiosity: the three sanctioned states of consciousness (the waking condition of uninterrupted work and performance of duty, alcoholic intoxication, and sleep), the distinction between two phases of psychedelic inebriation (the first phase, the peak of the trip, in which the cosmic relationship is experienced, or the submersion into one's own body, in which everything that is, is within; and the second phase, characterized as the phase of enhanced comprehension of symbols), and the allusion to the candor that hallucinogens bring about in consciousness states. These are all observations that are of fundamental importance in the judgment of hallucinogenic inebriation. The most worthwhile spiritual benefit from LSD experiments was the experience of the inextricable intertwining of the physical and spiritual. "Christ in matter" (Teilhard de Chardin). Did the insight first come to you also through your drug experiences, that we must descend "into the flesh, which we are," in order to get new prophesies? A criticism of your sermon: you allow the "deepest experience that there is"—"The kingdom of heaven is within you"—to be uttered by Timothy Leary. This sentence, quoted without the indication of its true source, could be interpreted as ignorance of one, or rather the principal truth of Christian belief. One of your statements deserves universal recognition: "There is no non-ecstatic religious experience."… Next Monday evening I shall be interviewed on Swiss television (about LSD and the Mexican magic drugs, on the program "At First Hand"). I am curious about the sort of questions that will be asked… A. H. Muri/Bern, 24 May 1973 Dear Mr. Hofmann, Of course it was LSD—only I did not want to write about it explicitly, I really do not know just why myself.... The great emphasis I placed on the good Leary, who now seems to me to be somewhat flipped out, as the prime witness, can indeed only be explained by the special context of the talk or sermon. I must admit that the perception that we must descend "into the flesh, which we are" actually first came to me with LSD. I still ruminate on it, possibly it even came "too late" for me in fact, although more and more I advocate your opinion that LSD should be taboo for youth (taboo, not forbidden, that is the difference…). The sentence that you like, "there is no nonecstatic religious experience," was apparently not liked so much by others—for example, by my (almost only) literary friend and minister-lyric poet Kurt Marti.… But in any case, we are practically never of the same opinion about anything, and notwithstanding, we constitute when we occasionally communicate by phone and arrange little activities together, the smallest minimafia of Switzerland. W. V. Burg i.L., 13 April 1974 Dear Mr. Vogt, Full of suspense, we watched your TV play "Pilate before the Silent Christ" yesterday evening. … as a representation of the fundamental man-God relationship: man, who comes to God with his most difficult questions, which finally he must answer himself, because God is silent. He does not answer them with words. The answers are contained in the book of his creation (to which the questioning man himself belongs). True natural science deciphering of this text. A. H. Muri/Bern, 11 May 1974 Dear Mr. Hofmann, I have composed a "poem" in half twilight, that I dare to send to you. At first I wanted to send it to Leary, but this would make no sense. Leary in jail Gelpke is dead Treatment in the asylum is this your psychedelic revolution? Had we taken seriously something with which one only ought to play or vice-versa… W. V.

Various Visitors The diverse aspects, the multi-faceted emanationsof LSD are also expressed in the variety of cultural circles withwhich this substance has brought me into contact. On thescientific plane, this has involved colleagues-chemists,pharmacologists, physicians, and mycologists—whom I met atuniversities, congresses, lectures, or with whom I came intoassociation through publication. In the literary-philosophicalfield there were contacts with writers. In the preceding chaptersI have reported on the relationships of this type that were mostsignificant for me. LSD also provided me with a variegated seriesof personal acquaintances from the drug scene and from hippiecircles, which will briefly be described here. Most of these visitors came from the United Statesand were young people, often in transit to the Far East in searchof Eastern wisdom or of a guru; or else hoping to come by drugsmore easily there. Prague also was sometimes the goal, becauseLSD of good quality could at the time easily be acquired there.[Translator's Note: When Sandoz's patents on LSD expired in 1963,the Czech pharmaceutical firm Spofa began to manufacture thedrug.] Once arrived in Europe, they wanted to take advantage ofthe opportunity to see the father of LSD, "the man who madethe famous LSD bicycle trip." But more serious concernssometimes motivated a visit. There was the desire to report onpersonal LSD experiences and to debate the purport of theirmeaning, at the source, so to speak. Only rarely did a visitprove to be inspired by the desire to obtain LSD when a visitorhinted that he or she wished once to experiment with mostassuredly pure material, with original LSD. Visitors of various types and with diverse desiresalso came from Switzerland and other European countries. Suchencounters have become rarer in recent times, which may berelated to the fact that LSD has become less important in thedrug scene. Whenever possible, I have welcomed such visitors oragreed to meet somewhere. This I considered to be an obligationconnected with my role in the history of LSD, and I have tried tohelp by instructing and advising. Sometimes no true conversation occurred, forexample with the inhibited young man who arrived on a motorbike.I was not clear about the objective of his visit. He stared atme, as if asking himself: can the man who has made something soweird as LSD really look so completely ordinary? With him, aswith other similar visitors, I had the feeling that he hoped, inmy presence, the LSD riddle would somehow solve itself. Other meetings were completely different, like theone with the young man from Toronto. He invited me to lunch at anexclusive restaurant—impressive appearance, tall, slender, abusinessman, proprietor of an important industrial firm inCanada, brilliant intellect. He thanked me for the creation ofLSD, which had given his life another direction. He had been 100percent a businessman, with a purely materialistic world view.LSD had opened his eyes to the spiritual aspect of life. Now hepossessed a sense for art, literature, and philosophy and wasdeeply concerned with religious and metaphysical questions. Henow desired to make the LSD experience accessible in a suitablemilieu to his young wife, and hoped for a similarly fortunatetransformation in her. Not as profound, yet still liberating andrewarding, were the results of LSD experiments which a young Danedescribed to me with much humor and fantasy. He came fromCalifornia, where he had been a houseboy for Henry Miller in BigSur. He moved on to France with the plan of acquiring adilapidated farm there, which he, a skilled carpenter, thenwanted to restore himself. I asked him to obtain an autograph ofhis former employer for my collection, and after some time Iactually received an original piece of writing from HenryMiller's hand. A young woman sought me out to report on LSDexperiences that had been of great significance to her innerdevelopment. As a superficial teenager who pursued all sorts ofentertainments, and quite neglected by her parents, she had begunto take LSD out of curiosity and love of adventure. For threeyears she took frequent LSD trips. They led to an astonishingintensification of her inner life. She began to seek after thedeeper meaning of her existence, which eventually revealed itselfto her. Then, recognizing that LSD had no further power to helpher, without difficulty or exertion of will she was able toabandon the drug. Thereafter she was in a position to developherself further without artificial means. She was now a happyintrinsically secure person—thus she concluded her report.This young woman had decided to tell me her history, because shesupposed that I was often attacked by narrow-minded persons whosaw only the damage that LSD sometimes caused among youths. Theimmediate motive of her testimony was a conversation that she hadaccidentally overheard on a railway journey. A man complainedabout me, finding it disgraceful that I had spoken on the LSDproblem in an interview published in the newspaper. In hisopinion, I ought to denounce LSD as primarily the devil's workand should publicly admit my guilt in the matter. Persons in LSD delirium, whose condition could havegiven rise to such indignant condemnation, have never personallycome into my sight. Such cases, attributable to LSD consumptionunder irresponsible circumstances, to overdosage, or to psychoticpredisposition, always landed in the hospital or at the policestation. Great publicity always came their way. A visit by one youn American girl stands out in mymemory as an example of the tragic effects of LSD. It was duringthe lunch hour, which I normally spent in my office under strictconfinement—no visitors, secretary's office closed up.Knocking came at the door, discretely but firmly repeated, untileventually I went to open.it. I scarcely believed my eyes: beforeme stood a very beautiful young woman, blond, with large blueeyes, wearing a long hippie dress, headband, and sandals. "Iam Joan, I come from New York—you are Dr. Hofmann?"Before I inquired what brought her to me, I asked her how she hadgot through the two checkpoints, at the main entrance to thefactory area and at the door of the laboratory building, forvisitors were admitted only after telephone query, and thisflower child must have been especially noticeable. "I am anangel, I can pass everywhere," she replied. Then sheexplained that she came on a great mission. She had to rescue hercountry, the United States; above all she had to direct thepresident (at the time L. B. Johnson) onto the correct path. Thiscould be accomplished only by having him take LSD. Then he wouldreceive the good ideas that would enable him to lead the countryout of war and internal difficulties. Joan had come to me hoping that I would help herfulfill her mission, namely to give LSD to the president. Hername would indicate she was the Joan of Arc of the USA. I don'tknow whether my arguments, advanced with all consideration of herholy zeal, were able to convince her that her plan had noprospects of success on psychological, technical, internal, andexternal grounds. Disappointed and sad she went away. Next day Ireceived a telephone call from Joan. She again asked me to helpher, since her financial resources were exhausted. I took her toa friend in Zurich who provided her with work, and with whom shecould live. Joan was a teacher by profession, and also anightclub pianist and singer. For a while she played and sang ina fashionable Zurich restaurant. The good bourgeois clients ofcourse had no idea what sort of angel sat at the grand piano in ablack evening dress and entertained them with sensitive playingand a soft and sensuous voice. Few paid attention to the words ofher songs; they were for the most part hippie songs, many of themcontaining veiled praise of drugs. The Zurich performance did notlast long; within a few weeks I learned from my friend that Joanhad suddenly disappeared. He received a greeting card from herthree months later, from Israel. She had been committed to apsychiatric hospital there. For the conclusion of my assortment of LSDvisitors, I wish to report about a meeting in which LSD figuredonly indirectly. Miss H. S., head secretary in a hospital, wroteto ask me for a personal interview. She came to tea. Sheexplained her visit thus: in a report about an LSD experience,she had read the description of a condition she herself hadexperienced as a young girl, which still disturbed her today;possibly I could help her to understand this experience. She had gone on a business trip as a commercialapprentice. They spent the night in a mountain hotel. H. S. awokevery early and left the house alone in order to watch thesunrise. As the mountains began to light up in a sea of rays, shewas perfused by an unprecedented feeling of happiness, whichpersisted even after she joined the other participants of thetrip at morning service in the chapel. During the Mass everythingappeared to her in a supernatural luster, and the feeling ofhappiness intensified to such an extent that she had to cryloudly. She was brought back to the hotel and treated as someonewith a mental disorder. This experience largely determined her laterpersonal life. H.S. feared she was not completely normal. On theone hand, she feared this experience, which had been explained toher as a nervous breakdown; on the other hand, she longed forarepetitionof the condition. Internally split, she had led anunstable life. In repeated vocational changes and in varyingpersonal relationships, consciously or unconsciously she againsought this ecstatic outlook, which once made her so deeplyhappy. I was able to reassure my visitor. It was nopsychopathological event, no nervous breakdown that she hadexperienced at the time. What many people seek to attain with thehelp of LSD, the visionary experience of a deeper reality, hadcome to her as spontaneous grace. I recommended a book by AldousHuxley to her, The Perennial Philosophy (Harper, New York& London, 1945) a collection of reports of spontaneousblessed visions from all times and cultures. Huxley wrote thatnot only mystics and saints, but also many more ordinary peoplethan one generally supposes, experience such blessed moments, butthat most do not recognize their importance and, instead ofregarding them as promising rays of hope, repress them, becausethey do not fit into everyday rationality.

LSD Experience and Reality Was kann ein Mensch im Leben mehr gewinnen Als dass sich Gott-Natur ihm offenbare? What more can a person gain in life Than that God-Nature reveals himself to him? —Goethe I am often asked what has made the deepestimpression upon me in my LSD experiments, and whether I havearrived at new understandings through these experiences. Valious Realities Of greatest significance to me has been theinsight that I attained as a fundamental understanding from allof my LSD experiments: what one commonly takes as "thereality," including the reality of one's own individualperson, by no means signifies something fixed, but rathersomething that is ambiguous—that there is not only one, butthat there are many realities, each comprising also a differentconsciousness of the ego. One can also arrive at this insight throughscientific reflections. The problem of reality is and has beenfrom time immemorial a central concern of philosophy. It is,however, a fundamental distinction, whether one approaches theproblem of reality rationally, with the logical methods ofphilosophy, or if one obtrudes upon this problem emotionally,through an existential experience. The first planned LSDexperiment was therefore so deeply moving and alarming, becauseeveryday reality and the ego experiencing it, which I had untilthen considered to be the only reality, dissolved, and anunfamiliar ego experienced another, unfamiliar reality. Theproblem concerning the innermost self also appeared, which,itself unmoved, was able to record these external and internaltransformations. Reality is inconceivable without an experiencingsubject, without an ego. It is the product of the exterior world,of the sender and of a receiver, an ego in whose deepest self theemanations of the exterior world, registered by the antennae ofthe sense organs, become conscious. If one of the two is lacking,no reality happens, no radio music plays, the picture screenremains blank. If one continues with the conception of reality asa product of sender and receiver, then the entry of anotherreality under the influence of LSD may be explained by the factthat the brain, the seat of the receiver, becomes biochemicallyaltered. The receiver is thereby tuned into another wavelengththan that corresponding to normal, everyday reality. Since theendless variety and diversity of the universe correspond toinfinitely many different wavelengths, depending on theadjustment of the receiver, many different realities, includingthe respective ego, can become conscious. These differentrealities, more correctly designated as different aspects of thereality, are not mutually exclusive but are complementary,and form together a portion of the all-encompassing, timeless,transcendental reality, in which even the unimpeachable core ofself-consciousness, which has the power to record the differentegos, is located. The true importance of LSD and relatedhallucinogens lies in their capacity to shift the wavelengthsetting of the receiving "self," and thereby to evokealterations in reality consciousness. This ability to allowdifferent, new pictures of reality to arise, this trulycosmogonic power, makes the cultish worship of hallucinogenicplants as sacred drugs understandable. What constitutes the essential, characteristicdifference between everyday reality and the world pictureexperienced in LSD inebriation? Ego and the outer world areseparated in the normal condition of consciousness, in everydayreality; one stands face-to-face with the outer world; it hasbecome an object. In the LSD state the boundaries between theexperiencing self and the outer world more or less disappear,depending on the depth of the inebriation. Feedback betweenreceiver and sender takes place. A portion of the self overflowsinto the outer world, into objects, which begin to live, to haveanother, a deeper meaning. This can be perceived as a blessed, oras a demonic transformation imbued with terror, proceeding to aloss of the trusted ego. In an auspicious case, the new ego feelsblissfully united with the objects of the outer world andconsequently also with its fellow beings. This experience of deeponeness with the exterior world can even intensify to a feelingof the self being one with the universe. This condition of cosmicconsciousness, which under favorable conditions can be evoked byLSD or by another hallucinogen from the group of Mexican sacreddrugs, is analogous to spontaneous religious enlightenment, withthe unio mystica. In both conditions, which often last only for atimeless moment, a reality is experienced that exposes a gleam ofthe transcendental reality, in vihich universe and self, senderand receiver, are one. [The relationship of spontaneous todrug-induced enlightenment has been most extensively investigatedby R. C. Zaehner, Mysticism Sacred and Profane (TheClarendon Press, Oxford, 1957).] Gottfried Benn, in his essay "ProvoziertesLeben" [Provoked life] (in Ausdnckswelt, LimesVerlag, Wiesbaden, 1949), characterized the reality in which selfand world are separated, as "the schizoid catastrophe, theWestern entelechy neurosis." He further writes: . . . In the southern part of our continent this concept of reality began to be formed. The Hellenistic-European agonistic principle of victory through effort, cunning, malice, talent, force, and later, European Darwinism and "superman," was instrumental in its formation. The ego emerged, dominated, fought; for this it needed instruments, material, power. It had a different relationship to matter, more removed sensually, but closer formally. It analyzed matter, tested, sorted: weapons, object of exchange, ransom money. It clarified matter through isolation, reduced it to formulas, took pieces out of it, divided it up. [Matter became] a concept which hung like a disaster over the West, with which the West fought, without grasping it, to which it sacrified enormous quantities of blood and happiness; a concept whose inner tension and fragmentations it was impossible to dissolve through a natural viewing or methodical insight into the inherent unity and peace of prelogical forms of being . . . instead the cataclysmic character of this idea became clearer and clearer . . . a state, a social organization, a public morality, for which life is economically usable life and which does not recognize the world of provoked life, cannot stop its destructive force. A society, whose hygiene and race cultivation as a modern ritual is founded solely on hollow biological statistics, can only represent the external viewpoint of the mass; for this point of view it can wage war, incessantly, for reality is simply raw material, but its metaphysical background remains forever obscured. [This excerpt from Benn's essay was taken from Ralph Metzner's translation "Provoked Life: An Essay on the Anthropology of the Ego," which was published in Psychedelic Review 1 (1): 47-54, 1963. Minor corrections in Metzner's text have been made by A. H.] As Gottfried Benn formulates it in these sentences,a concept of reality that separates self and the world hasdecisively determined the evolutionary course of Europeanintellectual history. Experience of the world as matter, asobject, to which man stands opposed, has produced modern naturalscience and technology—creations of the Western mind thathave changed the world. With their help human beings have subduedthe world. Its wealth has been exploited in a manner that may becharacterized as plundering, and the sublime accomplishment oftechnological civilization, the comfort of Western industrialsociety, stands face-to-face with a catastrophic destruction ofthe environment. Even to the heart of matter, to the nucleus ofthe atom and its splitting, this objective intellect hasprogressed and has unleashed energies that threaten all life onour planet. A misuse of knowledge and understanding, theproducts of searching intelligence, could not have emerged from aconsciousness of reality in which human beings are not separatedfrom the environment but rather exist as part of living natureand the universe. All attempts today to make amends for thedamage through environmentally protective measures must remainonly hopeless, superficial patchwork, if no curing of the"Western entelechy neurosis" ensues, as Benn hascharacterized the objective reality conception. Healing wouldmean existential experience of a deeper, self-encompassingreality. The experience of such a comprehensive reality isimpeded in an environment rendered dead by human hands, such asis present in our great cities and industrial districts. Here thecontrast between self and outer world becomes especially evident.Sensations of alienation, of loneliness, and of menace arise. Itis these sensations that impress themselves on everydayconsciousness in Western industrial society; they also take theupper hand everywhere that technological civilization extendsitself, and they largely determine the production of modern artand literature. There is less danger of a cleft reality experiencearising in a natural environment. In field and forest, and in theanimal world sheltered therein, indeed in every garden, a realityis perceptible that is infinitely more real, older, deeper, andmore wondrous than everything made by people, and that will yetendure, when the inanimate, mechanical, and concrete world againvanishes, becomes rusted and fallen into ruin. In the sprouting,growth, blooming, fruiting, death, and regermination of plants,in their relationship with the sun, whose light they are able toconvert into chemically bound energy in the form of organiccompounds, out of which all that lives on our earth is built; inthe being of plants the same mysterious, inexhaustible, eternallife energy is evident that has also brought us forth and takesus back again into its womb, and in which we are sheltered andunited with all living things. We are not leading up to a sentimental enthusiasmfor nature, to "back to nature" in Rousseau's sense.That romantic movement, which sought the idyll in nature, canalso be explained by a feeling of humankind's separation fromnature. What is needed today is a fundamental reexperience of theoneness of all living things, a comprehensive realityconsciousness that ever more infrequently develops spontaneously,the more the primordial flora and fauna of our mother earth mustyield to a dead technological environment. Mystery and Myth The notion of reality as the self juxtaposed tothe world, in confrontation with the outer world, began to formitself, as reported in the citation from Benn, in the southernportion of the European continent in Greek antiquity. No doubtpeople at that time knew the suffering that was connected withsuch a cleft reality consciousness. The Greek genius tried thecure, by supplementing the multiformed and richly colored,sensual as well as deeply sorrowful Apollonian world view createdby the subject/object cleavage, with the Dionysian world ofexperience, in which this cleavage is abolished in ecstaticinebriation. Nietzsche writes in The Birth of Tragedy: It is either through the influence of narcotic potions, of which all primitive peoples and races speak in hymns, or through the powerful approach of spring, penetrating with joy all of nature, that those Dionysian stirrings arise, which in their intensification lead the individual to forget himself completely.... Not only does the bond between man and man come to be forged once again by the magic of the Dionysian rite, but alienated, hostile, or subjugated nature again celebrates her reconciliation with her prodigal son, man. The Mysteries of Eleusis, which were celebratedannually in the fall, over an interval of approximately 2,000years, from about 1500 B.C. until the fourth century A.D., wereintimately connected with the ceremonies and festivals in honorof the god Dionysus. These Mysteries were established by thegoddess of agriculture, Demeter, as thanks for the recovery ofher daughter Persephone, whom Hades, the god of the underworld,had abducted. A further thank offering was the ear of grain,which was presented by the two goddesses to Triptolemus, thefirst high priest of Eleusis. They taught him the cultivation ofgrain, which Triptolemus then disseminated over the whole globe.Persephone, however, was not always allowed to remain with hermother, because she had taken nourishment from Hades, contrary tothe order of the highest gods. As punishment she had to return tothe underworld for a part of the year. During this time, it waswinter on the earth, the plants died and were withdrawn into theground, to awaken to new life early in the year with Persephone'sjourney to earth. The myth of Demeter, Persephone, Hades, and theother gods, which was enacted as a drama, formed, however, onlythe external framework of events. The climax of the yearlyceremonies, which began with a procession from Athens to Eleusislasting several days, was the concluding ceremony with theinitiation, which took place in the night. The initiates wereforbidden by penalty of death to divulge what they had learned,beheld, in the innermost, holiest chamber of the temple, the telesterion(goal). Not one of the multitude that were initiated into thesecret of Eleusis has ever done this. Pausanias, Plato, manyRoman emperors like Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, and many otherknown personages of antiquity were party to this initiation. Itmust have been an illumination, a visionary glimpse of a deeperreality, an insight into the true basis of the universe. That canbe concluded from the statements of initiates about the value,about the importance of the vision. Thus it is reported in aHomeric Hymn: "Blissful is he among men on Earth, who hasbeheld that! He who has not been initiated into the holyMysteries, who has had no part therein, remains a corpse ingloomy darkness." Pindar speaks of the Eleusinianbenediction with the following words: "Blissful is he, whoafter having beheld this enters on the way beneath the Earth. Heknows the end of life as well as its divinely grantedbeginning." Cicero, also a famous initiate, likewise put infirst position the splendor that fell upon his life from Eleusis,when he said: " Not only have we received the reason there,that we may live in joy, but also, besides, that we may die withbetter hope." How could the mythological representation of suchan obvious occurrence, which runs its course annually before oureyes—the seed grain that is dropped into the earth, diesthere, in order to allow a new plant, new life, to ascend intothe light—prove to be such a deep, comforting experience asthat attested by the cited reports? It is traditional knowledgethat the initiates were furnished with a potion, the kykeon,for the final ceremony. It is also known that barley extract andmint were ingredients of the kykeon. Religious scholarsand scholars of mythology, like Karl Kerenyi, from whose book onthe Eleusinian Mysteries (Rhein-Verlag, Zurich, 1962) thepreceding statements were taken, and with whom I was associatedin relation to the research on this mysterious potion [In theEnglish publication of Kerenyi's book Eleusis (SchockenBooks, New York, 1977) a reference is made to thiscollaboration.], are of the opinion that the kykeon wasmixed with an hallucinogenic drug. [In The Road to Eleusisby R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, and Carl A. P. Ruck(Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York, 1978) the possibility isdiscussed that the kykeon could have acted through anLSD-like preparation of ergot.] That would make understandablethe ecstatic-visionary experience of the DemeterPersephone myth,as a symbol of the cycle of life and death in both acomprehensive and timeless reality. When the Gothic king Alarich, coming from thenorth, invaded Greece in 396 A.D. and destroyed the sanctuary ofEleusis, it was not only the end of a religious center, but italso signified the decisive downfall of the ancient world. Withthe monks that accompanied Alarich, Christianity penetrated intothe country that must be regarded as the cradle of Europeanculture. The cultural-historical meaning of the EleusinianMysteries, their influence on European intellectual history, canscarcely be overestimated. Here suffering humankind found a curefor its rational, objective, cleft intellect, in a mysticaltotality experience, that let it believe in immortality, in aneverlasting existence. This belief had survived in early Christianity,although with other symbols. It is found as a promise, even inparticular passages of the Gospels, most clearly in the Gospelaccording to John, as in Chapter 14: 120. Jesus speaks to hisdisciples, as he takes leave of them: And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shatl know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. This promise constitutes the heart of my Christianbeliefs and my call to natural-scientific research: we willattain to knowledge of the universe through the spirit of truth,and thereby to understanding of our being one with the deepest,most comprehensive reality, God. Ecclesiastical Christianity, determined by theduality of creator and creation, has, however, with itsnature-alienated religiosity largely obliterated theEleusinian-Dionysian legacy of antiquity. In the Christian sphereof belief, only special blessed men have attested to a timeless,comforting reality, experienced in a spontaneous vision, anexperience to which in antiquity the elite of innumerablegenerations had access through the initiation at Eleusis. The uniomystica of Catholic saints and the visions that therepresentatives of Christian mysticism—Jakob Boehme, MeisterEckhart, Angelus Silesius, Thomas Traherne, William Blake, andothers—describe in their writings, are obviously essentiallyrelated to the enlightenment that the initiates to the EleusinianMysteries experienced. The fundamental importance of a mysticalexperience, for the recovery of people in Western industrialsocieties who are sickened by a one-sided, rational,materialistic world view, is today given primary emphasis, notonly by adherents to Eastern religious movements like ZenBuddhism, but also by leading representatives of academicpsychiatry. Of the appropriate literature, we will here referonly to the books of Balthasar Staehelin, the Basel psychiatristworking in Zurich. [Haben und Sein (1969), Die Welt alsDu (1970), Urvertrauen und zweite Wirklichkeit (1973),and Der flnale Mensch (1976); all published byTheologischer Verlag, Zurich.] They make reference to numerousother authors who deal with the same problem. Today a type of"metamedicine," "metapsychology," and"metapsychiatry" is beginning to call upon themetaphysical element in people, which manifests itself as anexperience of a deeper, duality-surmounting reality, and to makethis element a basic healing principle in therapeutic practice. In addition, it is most significant that not onlymedicine but also wider circles of our society consider theovercoming of the dualistic, cleft world view to be aprerequisite and basis for the recovery and spiritual renewal ofoccidental civilization and culture. This renewal could lead tothe renunciation of the materialistic philosophy of life and thedevelopment of a new reality consciousness. As a path to the perception of a deeper,comprehensive reality, in which the experiencing individual isalso sheltered, meditation, in its different forms, occupies aprominent place today. The essential difference betweenmeditation and prayer in the usual sense, which is based upon theduality of creatorcreation, is that meditation aspires to theabolishment of the I-you-barrier by a fusing of object andsubject, of sender and receiver, of objective reality and self. Objective reality, the world view produced by thespirit of scientific inquiry, is the myth of our time. It hasreplaced the ecclesiastical-Christian and mythical-Apollonianworld view. But this ever broadening factual knowledge, whichconstitutes objective reality, need not be a desecration. On thecontrary, if it only advances deep enough, it inevitably leads tothe inexplicable, primal ground of the universe: the wonder, themystery of the divine—in the microcosm of the atom, in themacrocosm of the spiral nebula; in the seeds of plants, in thebody and soul of people. Meditation begins at the limits of objectivereality, at the farthest point yet reached by rational knowledgeand perception. Meditation thus does not mean rejection ofobjective reality; on the contrary, it consists of a penetrationto deeper dimensions of reality. It is not escape into animaginary dream world; rather it seeks after the comprehensivetruth of objective reality, by simultaneous, stereoscopiccontemplation of its surfaces and depths. It could become of fundamental importance, and benot merely a transient fashion of the present, if more and morepeople today would make a daily habit of devoting an hour, or atleast a few minutes, to meditation. As a result of the meditativepenetration and broadening of the natural-scientific world view,a new, deepened reality consciousness would have to evolve, whichwould increasingly become the property of all humankind. Thiscould become the basis of a new religiosity, which would not bebased on belief in the dogmas of various religions, but rather onperception through the "spirit of truth." What is meanthere is a perception, a reading and understanding of the text atfirst hand, "out of the book that God's finger haswritten" (Paracelsus), out of the creation. The transformation of the objective world view intoa deepened and thereby religious reality consciousness can beaccomplished gradually, by continuing practice of meditation. Itcan also come about, however, as a sudden enlightenment; avisionary experience. It is then particularly profound, blessed,and meaningful. Such a mystical experience may nevertheless"not be induced even by decade-long meditation," asBalthasar Staehelin writes. Also, it does not happen to everyone,although the capacity for mystical experience belongs to theessence of human spirituality. Nevertheless, at Eleusis, the mystical vision, thehealing, comforting experience, could be arranged in theprescribed place at the appointed time, for all of the multitudeswho were initiated into the holy Mysteries. This could beaccounted for by the fact that an hallucinogenic drug came intouse; this, as already mentioned, is something that religiousscholars believe. The characteristic property of hallucinogens, tosuspend the boundaries between the experiencing self and theouter world in an ecstatic, emotional experience, makes itpossible with their help, and after suitable internal andexternal preparation, as it was accomplished in a perfect way atEleusis, to evoke a mystical experience according to plan, so tospeak. Meditation is a preparation for the same goal thatwas aspired to and was attained in the Eleusinian Mysteries.Accordingly it seems feasible that in the future, with the helpof LSD, the mystical vision, crowning meditation, could be madeaccessible to an increasing number of practitioners of meditation I see the true importance of LSD in thepossibitity ofproviding material aid to meditation aimed at themystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive reality. Such ause accords entirely with the essence and working character ofLSD as a sacred drug.

This is, of course, exactly the distinction which AlanWatts wants us to transcend. But Mr. Watts is playing the verbalgame in a Western language, and his reader can be excused forfollowing along with conventional dichotomous models. External and internal. Behavior and consciousness. Changingthe external world has been the genius and the obsession of ourcivilization. In the last two centuries the Western monotheisticcultures have faced outward and moved objects about withastonishing efficiency. In more recent years, however, ourculture has become aware of a disturbing imbalance. We havebecome aware of the undiscovered universe within, of theuncharted regions of consciousness. This dialectic trend is not new. The cycle has occurred inthe lives of many cultures and individuals. External materialsuccess is followed by disillusion and the basic "why"questions, and then by the discovery of the world within---aworld infinitely more complex and rich than the artifactualstructures of the outer world, which after all are, in origin,projections of human imagination. Eventually, the logicalconceptual mind turns on itself, recognizes the foolishinadequacy of the flimsy systems it imposes on the world,suspends its own rigid control, and overthrows the domination ofcognitive experience. We speak here (and Alan Watts speaks in this book) about thepolitics of the nervous system---certainly as complicated andcertainly as important as external politics. The politics of thenervous system involves the mind against the brain, thetyrannical verbal brain disassociating itself from the organismand world of which it is a part, censoring, alerting, evaluating. Thus appears the fifth freedom---freedom from the learned,cultural mind. The freedom to expand one's consciousness beyondartifactual cultural knowledge. The freedom to move from constantpreoccupation with the verbal games---the social games, the gameof self---to the joyous unity of what exists beyond. We are dealing here with an issue that is not new, an issuethat has been considered for centuries by mystics, byphilosophers of the religious experience, by those rare and trulygreat scientists who have been able to move in and then outbeyond the limits of the science game. It was seen and describedclearly by the great American psychologist William James: . . . our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question,-for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back on my own experiences, they all converge toward a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. But what are the stimuli necessary and sufficient tooverthrow the domination of the conceptual and to open up the"potential forms of consciousness"? There are many.Indian philosophers have described hundreds of methods. So havethe Japanese Buddhists. The monastics of our Western religionsprovide more examples. Mexican healers and religious leaders fromSouth and North American Indian groups have for centuriesutilized sacred plants to trigger off the expansion ofconsciousness. Recently our Western science has provided, in theform of chemicals, the most direct techniques for opening newrealms of awareness. William James used nitrous oxide and ether to "stimulatethe mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree."Today the attention of psychologists, philosophers, andtheologians is centering on the effects of three syntheticsubstances---mescaline, lysergic acid, and psilocybin. What are these substances? Medicines or drugs or sacramentalfoods? It is easier to say what they are not. They are notnarcotics, nor intoxicants, nor energizers, nor anaesthetics, nortranquilizers. They are, rather, biochemical keys which unlockexperiences shatteringly new to most Westerners. For the last two years, staff members of the Center forResearch in Personality at Harvard University have engaged insystematic experiments with these substances. Our first inquiryinto the biochemical expansion of consciousness has been a studyof the reactions of Americans in a supportive, comfortablenaturalistic setting. We have had the opportunity ofparticipating in over one thousand individual administrations.From our observations, from interviews and reports, from analysisof questionnaire data, and from pre- and postexperimentaldifferences in personality test results, certain conclusions haveemerged. (I) These substances do alter consciousness. There is nodispute on this score. (2) It is meaningless to talk morespecifically about the "effect of the drug." Set andsetting, expectation, and atmosphere account for all specificityof reaction. There is no "drug reaction" but alwayssetting-plus-drug. (3) In talking about potentialities it isuseful to consider not just the setting-plus-drug but rather thepotentialities of the human cortex to create images andexperiences far beyond the narrow limitations of words andconcepts. Those of us on this research project spend a good shareof our working hours listening to people talk about the effectand use of consciousness-altering drugs. If we substitute thewords human cortex for drug we can then agree with any statementmade about the potentialities---for good or evil, for helping orhurting, for loving or fearing. Potentialities of the cortex, notof the drug. The drug is just an instrument. In analyzing and interpreting the results of our studies welooked first to the conventional models of modernpsychology---psychoanalytic, behaviorist---and found theseconcepts quite inadequate to map the richness and breadth ofexpanded consciousness. To understand our findings we havefinally been forced back on a language and point of view quitealien to us who are trained in the traditions of mechanisticobjective psychology. We have had to return again and again tothe nondualistic conceptions of Eastern philosophy, a theory ofmind made more explicit and familiar in our Western world byBergson, Aldous Huxley, and Alan Watts. In the first part of thisbook Mr. Watts presents with beautiful clarity this theory ofconsciousness, which we have seen confirmed in the accounts ofour research subjects--- philosophers, unlettered convicts,housewives, intellectuals, alcoholics. The leap across entanglingthickets of the verbal, to identify with the totality of theexperienced, is a phenomenon reported over and over by thesepersons. Alan Watts spells out in eloquent detail his drug-inducedvisionary moments. He is, of course, attempting theimpossible---to describe in words (which always lie) that whichis beyond words. But how well he can do it! Alan Watts is one of the great reporters of our times. He hasan intuitive sensitivity for news, for the crucial issues andevents of the century. And he has along with this the verbalequipment of a poetic philosopher to teach and inform. Here hehas given us perhaps the best statement on the subject ofspace-age mysticism, more daring than the two classic works ofAldous Huxley because Watts follows Mr. Huxley's lead and pushesbeyond. The recognition of the love aspects of the mysticalexperience and the implications for new forms of socialcommunication are especially important. You are holding in your hand a great human document. Butunless you are one of the few Westerners who have (accidentallyor through chemical good fortune) experienced a mystical minuteof expanded awareness, you will probably not understand what theauthor is saying. Too bad, but still not a cause for surprise.The history of ideas reminds us that new concepts and new visionshave always been non-understood. We cannot understand that forwhich we have no words. But Alan Watts is playing the book game,the word game, and the reader is his contracted partner. But listen. Be prepared. There are scores of great lines inthis book. Dozens of great ideas. Too many. Too compressed. Theyglide by too quickly. Watch for them. If you catch even n few of these ideas, you will findyourself asking the questions which we ask ourselves as we lookover our research data: Where do we go from here? What is theapplication of these new wonder medicines? Can they do more thanprovide memorable moments and memorable books? The answer will come from two directions. We must providemore and more people with these experiences and have them tellus, as Alan Watts does here, what they experienced. (There willhardly be a lack of volunteers for this ecstatic voyage.Ninety-one percent of our subjects are eager to repeat and toshare the experience with their family and friends). We must alsoencourage systematic objective research by scientists who havetaken the drug themselves and have come to know the differencebetween inner and outer, between consciousness and behavior. Suchresearch should explore the application of these experiences tothe problems of modern living---in education, religion, creativeindustry, creative arts. There are many who believe that we stand at an importantturning point in man's power to control and expand his awareness.Our research provides tentative grounds for such optimism. TheJoyous Cosmology is solid testimony for the same happyexpectations.

It was a record of his first experienceof this remarkable transformation of consciousness, and by now,through subsequent experiments, he knows that it can lead to fardeeper insights than his book described. While I cannot hope tosurpass Aldous Huxley as a master of English prose, I feel thatthe time is ripe for an account of some of the deeper, or higher,levels of insight that can be reached through theseconsciousness-changing "drugs" when accompanied withsustained philosophical reflection by a person who is in search,not of kicks, but of understanding. I should perhaps add that,for me, philosophical reflection is barren when divorced frompoetic imagination, for we proceed to understanding of the worldupon two legs, not one. It is now a commonplace that there is a serious lack ofcommunication between scientists and laymen on the theoreticallevel, for the layman does not understand the mathematicallanguage in which the scientist thinks. For example, the conceptof curved space cannot be represented in any image that isintelligible to the senses. But I am still more concerned withthe gap between theoretical description and direct experienceamong scientists themselves. Western science is now delineating anew concept of man, not as a solitary ego within a wall of flesh,but as an organism which is what it is by virtue of itsinseparability from the rest of the world. But with the rarestexceptions even scientists do not feel themselves to existin this way. They, and almost all of us, retain a sense ofpersonality which is independent, isolated, insular, andestranged from the cosmos that surrounds it. Somehow this gapmust be closed, and among the varied means whereby the closuremay be initiated or achieved are medicines which science itselfhas discovered, and which may prove to be the sacraments of itsreligion. For a long time we have been accustomed to thecompartmentalization of religion and science as if they were twoquite different and basically unrelated ways of seeing the world.I do not believe that this state of doublethink can last. It musteventually be replaced by a view of the world which is neitherreligious nor scientific but simply our view of the world. Moreexactly, it must become a view of the world in which the reportsof science and religion are as concordant as those of the eyesand the ears. But the traditional roads to spiritual experience seldomappeal to persons of scientific or skeptical temperament, for thevehicles that ply them are rickety and piled with excess baggage.There is thus little opportunity for the alert and criticalthinker to share at first hand in the modes of consciousness thatseers and mystics are trying to express-often in archaic andawkward symbolism. If the pharmacologist can be of help inexploring this unknown world, he may be doing us theextraordinary service of rescuing religious experience from theobscurantists. To make this book as complete an expression as possible ofthe quality of consciousness which these drugs induce, I haveincluded a number of photographs which, in their vivid reflectionof the patterns of nature, give some suggestion of the rhythmicbeauty of detail which the drugs reveal in common things. Forwithout losing their normal breadth of vision the eyes seem tobecome a microscope through which the mind delves deeper anddeeper into the intricately dancing texture of our world. Alan W.

Thisdoes not mean that we are being forced to admit that we are onlybodies; it means that we are forming an altogether new idea ofthe body. For the body considered as separate from the mind isone thing---an animated corpse. But the body considered asinseparable from the mind is another, and as yet we have noproper word for a reality which is simultaneously mental andphysical. To call it mental-physical will not do at all, for thisis the very unsatisfactory joining of two concepts which haveboth been impoverished by long separation and opposition. But weare at least within sight of being able to discard altogetherideas of a stuff which is mental and a stuff which is material."Stuff" is a word which describes the formless mushthat we perceive when sense is not keen enough to make out itspattern. The notion of material or mental stuff is based on thefalse analogy that trees are made of wood, mountains of stone,and minds of spirit in the same way that pots are made of clay."Inert" matter seems to require an external andintelligent energy to give it form. But now we know that matteris not inert. Whether it is organic or inorganic, we are learningto see matter as patterns of energy---not of energy as ifenergy were a stuff, but as energetic pattern, moving order,active intelligence. The realization that mind and body, form and matter, are oneis blocked, however, by ages of semantic confusion andpsychological prejudice. For it is common sense that everypattern, shape, or structure is a form of something aspots are forms of clay. It is hard to see that this"something" is as dispensable as the ether in whichlight was once supposed to travel, or as the fabulous tortoiseupon which the earth was once thought to be supported. Anyone whocan really grasp this point will experience a curiouslyexhilarating liberation, for the burden of stuff will drop fromhim and he will walk less heavily. The dualism of mind and body arose, perhaps, as a clumsy wayof describing the power of an intelligent organism to controlitself. It seemed reasonable to think of the part controlled asone thing and the part controlling as another. In this way theconscious will was opposed to the involuntary appetites andreason to instinct. In due course we learned to center ouridentity, our selfhood, in the controlling part---the mind--- andincreasingly to disown as a mere vehicle the part controlled. Itthus escaped our attention that the organism as a whole, largelyunconscious, was using consciousness and reason to inform andcontrol itself. We thought of our conscious intelligence asdescending from a higher realm to take possession of a physicalvehicle. We therefore failed to see it as an operation of thesame formative process as the structure of nerves, muscles,veins, and bones---a structure so subtly ordered (that is,intelligent) that conscious thought is as yet far from being ableto describe it. This radical separation of the part controlling from the partcontrolled changed man from a self-controlling to a self-frustrating organism, to the embodied conflict andself-contradiction that he has been throughout his known history.Once the split occurred conscious intelligence began to serve itsown ends instead of those of the organism that produced it. Moreexactly, it became the intention of the consciousintelligence to work for its own, dissociated, purposes. But, aswe shall see, just as the separation of mind from body is anillusion, so also is the subjection of the body to theindependent schemes of the mind. Meanwhile, however, the illusionis as real as the hallucinations of hypnosis, and the organism ofman is indeed frustrating itself by patterns of behavior whichmove in the most complex vicious circles. The culmination is aculture which ever more serves the ends of mechanical order asdistinct from those of organic enjoyment, and which is bent onself-destruction against the instinct of every one of itsmembers. We believe, then, that the mind controls the body, not thatthe body controls itself through the mind. Hence the ingrainedprejudice that the mind should be independent of all physicalaids to its working---despite microscopes, telescopes, cameras,scales, computers, books, works of art, alphabets, and all thosephysical tools apart from which it is doubtful whether therewould be any mental life at all. At the same time there hasalways been at least an obscure awareness that in feeling oneselfto be a separate mind, soul, or ego there is something wrong.Naturally, for a person who finds his identity in something otherthan his full organism is less than half a man. He is cut offfrom complete participation in nature. Instead of being a body he"has" a body. Instead of living and loving he"has" instincts for survival and copulation. Disowned,they drive him as if they were blind furies or demons thatpossessed him. The feeling that there is something wrong in all thisrevolves around a contradiction characteristic of allcivilizations. This is the simultaneous compulsion to preserveoneself and to forget oneself. Here is the vicious circle: if youfeel separate from your organic life, you feel driven to survive;survival---going on living---thus becomes a duty and also a dragbecause you are not fully with it; because it does not quite comeup to expectations, you continue to hope that it will, to cravefor more time, to feel driven all the more to go on. What we callself-consciousness is thus the sensation of the organismobstructing itself, of not being with itself, of driving, so tosay, with accelerator and brake on at once. Naturally, this is ahighly unpleasant sensation, which most people want to forget. The lowbrow way of forgetting oneself is to get drunk, to bediverted with entertainments, or to exploit such natural means ofself-transcendence as sexual intercourse. The highbrow way is tothrow oneself into the pursuit of the arts, of social service, orof religious mysticism. These measures are rarely successfulbecause they do not disclose the basic error of the split self.The highbrow ways even aggravate the error to the extent thatthose who follow them take pride in forgetting themselves bypurely mental means---even though the artist uses paints orsounds, the social idealist distributes material wealth, and thereligionist uses sacraments and rituals, or such other physicalmeans as fasting, yoga breathing, or dervish dancing. And thereis a sound instinct in the use of these physical aids, as in therepeated insistence of mystics that to know about God is notenough: transformation of the self is only through realizing orfeeling God. The hidden point is that man cannot functionproperly through changing anything so superficial as the order ofhis thoughts, of his dissociated mind. What has to change is thebehavior of his organism; it has to become self-controllinginstead of self-frustrating. How is this to be brought about? Clearly, nothing can be doneby the mind, by the conscious will, so long as this is felt to besomething apart from the total organism. But if it were feltotherwise, nothing would need to be done! A very small number ofEastern gurus, or masters of wisdom, and Westernpsychotherapists have found---rather laborious---ways of trickingor coaxing the organism into integrating itself---mostly by akind of judo, or "gentle way," which overthrowsthe process of self-frustration by carrying it to logical andabsurd extremes. This is pre-eminently the way of Zen, andoccasionally that of psychoanalysis. When these ways work it isquite obvious that something more has happened to the student orpatient than a change in his way of thinking; he is alsoemotionally and physically different; his whole being isoperating in a new way. For a long time it has been clear to me that certain forms ofEastern "mysticism"---in particular Taoism and ZenBuddhism---do not presuppose a universe divided into thespiritual and the material, and do not culminate in a state ofconsciousness where the physical world vanishes into someundifferentiated and bodiless luminescence. Taoism and Zen arealike founded upon a philosophy of relativity, but thisphilosophy is not merely speculative. It is a discipline inawareness as a result of which the mutual interrelation of allthings and all events becomes a constant sensation. Thissensation underlies and supports our normal awareness of theworld as a collection of separate and different things---anawareness which, by itself, is called avidya (ignorance) inBuddhist philosophy because, in paying exclusive attention todifferences, it ignores relationships. It does not see, forexample, that mind and form or shape and space are as inseparableas front and back, nor that the individual is so interwoven withthe universe that he and it are one body. This is a point of view which, unlike some other forms ofmysticism, does not deny physical distinctions but sees them asthe plain expression of unity. As one sees so clearly in Chinesepainting, the individual tree or rock is not on but withthe space that forms its background. The paper untouched by thebrush is an integral part of the picture and never mere backing.It is for this reason that when a Zen master is asked about theuniversal or the ultimate, he replies with the immediate andparticular--- "The cypress tree in the yard!" Here,then, we have what Robert Linssen has called a spiritualmaterialism---a standpoint far closer to relativity and fieldtheory in modern science than to any religious supernaturalism.But whereas the scientific comprehension of the relative universeis as yet largely theoretical, these Eastern disciplines havemade it a direct experience. Potentially, then, they would seemto offer a marvelous parallel to Western science, but on thelevel of our immediate awareness of the world. For science pursues the common-sense assumption that thenatural world is a multiplicity of individual things and eventsby attempting to describe these units as accurately and minutelyas possible. Because science is above all analytic in its way ofdescribing things, it seems at first to disconnect them more thanever. Its experiments are the study of carefully isolatedsituations, designed to exclude influences that cannot bemeasured and controlled---as when one studies falling bodies in avacuum to cut out the friction of air. But for this reason thescientist understands better than anyone else just howinseparable things are. The more he tries to cut out externalinfluences upon an experimental situation, the more he discoversnew ones, hitherto unsuspected. The more carefully he describes,say, the motion of a given particle, the more he finds himselfdescribing also the space in which it moves. The realization thatall things are inseparably related is in proportion to one'seffort to make them clearly distinct. Science therefore surpassesthe common-sense point of view from which it begins, coming tospeak of things and events as properties of the"fields" in which they occur. But this is simply atheoretical description of a state of affairs which, in theseforms of Eastern Mysticism," is directly sensed. As soon asthis is clear, we have a sound basis for a meeting of mindsbetween East and West which could be remarkably fruitful. The practical difficulty is that Taoism and Zen are soinvolved with the forms of Far Eastern culture that it is a majorproblem to adapt them to Western needs. For example, Easternteachers work on the esoteric and aristocratic principle that thestudent must learn the hard way and find out almost everythingfor himself. Aside from occasional hints, the teacher merelyaccepts or rejects the student's attainments. But Westernteachers work on the exoteric and democratic principle thateverything possible must be done to inform and assist the studentso as to make his mastery of the subject as easy as possible.Does the latter approach, as purists insist, merely vulgarize thediscipline? The answer is that it depends upon the type ofdiscipline. If everyone learns enough mathematics to masterquadratic equations, the attainment will seem small in comparisonwith the much rarer comprehension of the theory of numbers. Butthe transformation of consciousness undertaken in Taoism and Zenis more like the correction of faulty perception or the curing ofa disease. It is not an acquisitive process of learning more andmore facts or greater and greater skills, but rather anunlearning of wrong habits and opinions. As Lao-tzu said,"The scholar gains every day, but the Taoist loses everyday." The practice of Taoism or Zen in the Far East is therefore anundertaking in which the Westerner will find himself confrontedwith many barriers erected quite deliberately to discourage idlecuriosity or to nullify wrong views by inciting the student toproceed systematically and consistently upon false assumptions tothe reductio ad absurdum. My own main interest in thestudy of comparative mysticism has been to cut through thesetangles and to identify the essential psychological processesunderlying those alterations of perception which enable us to seeourselves and the world in their basic unity. I have perhaps hadsome small measure of success in trying, Western fashion, to makethis type of experience more accessible. I am therefore at oncegratified and embarrassed by a development in Western sciencewhich could possibly put this unitive vision of the world, byalmost shockingly easy means, within the reach of many who havethus far sought it in vain by traditional methods. Part of the genius of Western science is that it findssimpler and more rational ways of doing things that were formerlychancy or laborious. Like any inventive process, it does notalways make these discoveries systematically; often it juststumbles upon them, but then goes on to work them into anintelligible order. In medicine, for example, science isolatesthe essential drug from the former witch-doctor's brew ofsalamanders, mugwort, powdered skulls, and dried blood. Thepurified drug cures more surely, but---it does notperpetuate health. The patient still has to change habits of lifeor diet which made him prone to the disease. Is it possible, then, that Western science could provide amedicine which would at least give the human organism a start inreleasing itself from its chronic self-contradiction? Themedicine might indeed have to be supported by otherprocedures---psychotherapy, "spiritual" disciplines,and basic changes in one's pattern of life---but every diseasedperson seems to need some kind of initial lift to set him on theway to health. The question is by no means absurd if it is truethat what afflicts us is a sickness not just of the mind but ofthe organism, of the very functioning of the nervous system andthe brain. Is there, in short, a medicine which can give ustemporarily the sensation of being integrated, of being fully onewith ourselves and with nature as the biologist knows us,theoretically, to be? If so, the experience might offer clues towhatever else must be done to bring about full and continuousintegration. It might be at least the tip of an Ariadne's threadto lead us out of the maze in which all of us are lost from ourinfancy. Relatively recent research suggests that there are at leastthree such medicines, though none is an infallible"specific." They work with some people, and muchdepends upon the social and psychological context in which theyare given. Occasionally their effects may be harmful, but suchlimitations do not deter us from using penicillin---often a farmore dangerous chemical than any of these three. I am speaking,of course, of mescaline (the active ingredient of the peyotecactus), lysergic acid diethylamide (a modified ergot alkaloid),and psilocybin (a derivative of the mushroom Psilocybemexicana). The peyote cactus has long been used by the Indians of theSouthwest and Mexico as a means of communion with the divineworld, and today the eating of the dried buttons of the plant isthe principal sacrament of an Indian church known as the NativeAmerican Church of the United States ---by all accounts a mostrespectable and Christian organization. At the end of thenineteenth century its effects were first described by WeirMitchell and Havelock Ellis, and some years later its activeingredient was identified as mescaline, a chemical of the aminegroup which is quite easily synthesized. Lysergic acid diethylamide was first discovered in 1938 bythe Swiss pharmacologist A. Hofmann in the course of studying theproperties of the ergot fungus. Quite by accident he absorbed asmall amount of this acid while making certain changes in itsmolecular structure, and noticed its peculiar psychologicaleffects. Further research proved that he had hit upon the mostpowerful consciousness-changing drug now known, for LSD-25 (as itis called for short) will produce its characteristic results inso minute a dosage as 20 micrograms, 1/700,000,000 of an averageman's weight. Psilocybin is derived from another of the sacred plants ofthe Mexican Indians---a type of mushroom known to them as teonanacatl,"the flesh of God." Following Robert Weitlaner'sdiscovery in 1936 that the cult of "the sacredmushroom" was still prevalent in Oaxaca, a number ofmycologists, as specialists in mushrooms are known, began to makestudies of the mushrooms of this region. Three varieties werefound to be in use. In addition to Psilocybe mexicanathere were also Psilocybe aztecorum Heim and Psilocybewassonii, named respectively after the mycologists Roger Heimand Gordon and Valentina Wasson, who took part in the ceremoniesof the cult. Despite a very considerable amount of research andspeculation, little is known of the exact physiological effect ofthese chemicals upon the nervous system. The subjective effectsof all three tend to be rather similar, though LSD-25, perhapsbecause of the minute dosage required, seldom produces thenauseous reactions so often associated with the other two. Allthe scientific papers I have read seem to add up to the vagueimpression that in some way these drugs suspend certaininhibitory or selective processes in the nervous system so as torender our sensory apparatus more open to impressions than isusual. Our ignorance of the precise effect of these drugs is, ofcourse, linked to the still rather fumbling state of ourknowledge of the brain. Such ignorance obviously suggests greatcaution in their use, but thus far there is no evidence that, innormal dosage, there is any likelihood of physiological damage.* In a very wide sense of the word, each of these substances isa drug, but one must avoid the serious semantic error ofconfusing them with drugs which induce physical craving forrepeated use or which dull the senses like alcohol or thesedatives. They are classed, officially, as hallucinogens---anastonishingly inaccurate term, since they cause one neither tohear voices nor to see visions such as might be confused withphysical reality. While they do indeed produce the most complexand very obviously "hallucinatory" patterns beforeclosed eyes, their general effect is to sharpen the senses to asupernormal degree of awareness. The standard dosage of eachsubstance maintains its effects for from five to eight hours, andthe experience is often so deeply revealing and moving that onehesitates to approach it again until it has been thoroughly"digested," and this may be a matter of months. The reaction of most cultured people to the idea of gainingany deep psychological or philosophical insight through a drug isthat it is much too simple, too artificial, and even too banal tobe seriously considered. A wisdom which can be "turnedon" like the switch of a lamp seems to insult human dignityand degrade us to chemical automata. One calls to mind picturesof a brave new world in which there is a class of synthesizedBuddhas, of people who have been "fixed" like thelobotomized, the sterilized, or the hypnotized, only in anotherdirection---people who have somehow lost their humanity and withwhom, as with drunkards, one cannot really communicate. This is,however, a somewhat ghoulish fantasy which has no relation to thefacts or to the experience itself. It belongs to the same kind ofsuperstitious dread which one feels for the unfamiliar, confusingit with the unnatural---the way some people feel about Jewsbecause they are circumcised or even about Negroes because oftheir "alien" features and color. Despite the widespread and undiscriminating prejudice againstdrugs as such, and despite the claims of certain religiousdisciplines to be the sole means to genuine mystical insight, Ican find no essential difference between the experiences induced,under favorable conditions, by these chemicals and the states of"cosmic consciousness" recorded by R. M. Bucke, WilliamJames, Evelyn Underhill, Raynor Johnson, and other investigatorsof mysticism. "Favorable conditions" means a settingwhich is socially and physically congenial; ideally this would besome sort of retreat house (not a hospital or sanitarium)supervised by religiously oriented psychiatrists orpsychologists. The atmosphere should be homelike rather thanclinical, and it is of the utmost importance that thesupervisor's attitude be supportive and sympathetic. Underinsecure, bizarre, or unfriendly circumstances the experience caneasily degenerate into a highly unpleasant paranoia. Two daysshould be set aside---one for the experience itself, which lastsfor six or eight hours, and one for evaluation in the calm andrelaxed frame of mind that normally follows. This is simply to say that the use of such powerful medicinesis not to be taken lightly, as one smokes a cigarette or tossesdown a cocktail. They should be approached as one approaches asacrament, though not with the peculiar inhibition of gaiety andhumor that has become customary in our religious rituals. It is asound general rule that there should always be present somequalified supervisor to provide a point of contact with"reality" as it is socially defined. Ideally the"qualified supervisor" should be a psychiatrist orclinical psychologist who has himself experienced the effects ofthe drug, though I have observed that many who are technicallyqualified have a frightened awe of unusual states ofconsciousness which is apt to communicate itself, to thedetriment of the experience, to those under their care. The mostessential qualification of the supervisor is, therefore,confidence in the situation---which is likewise "pickedup" by people in the state of acute sensitivity that thedrugs induce. The drugs in question are not aphrodisiacs, and when they aretaken in common by a small group the atmosphere is not in theleast suggestive of a drunken brawl nor of the communal torpor ofan opium den. Members of the group usually become open to eachother with a high degree of friendly affection, for in themystical phase of the experience the underlying unity or"belongingness" of the members can have all the clarityof a physical sensation. Indeed the social situation may becomewhat religious bodies aim at, but all too rarely achieve, intheir rites of communion---a relationship of the most vividunderstanding, forgiveness, and love. Of course, this does notautomatically become a permanent feeling, but neither does thesense of fellowship sometimes evoked in strictly religiousgatherings. The experience corresponds almost exactly to thetheological concept of a sacrament or means of grace---anunmerited gift of spiritual power whose lasting effects dependupon the use made of it in subsequent action. Catholic theologyalso recognizes those so-called "extraordinary" graces,often of mystical insight, which descend spontaneously outsidethe ordinary or regular means that the Church provides throughthe sacraments and the disciplines of prayer. It seems to me thatonly special pleading can maintain that the graces mediatedthrough mushrooms, cactus plants, and scientists are artificialand spurious in contrast with those which come through religiousdiscipline. Claims for the exclusive virtue of one's own brandis, alas, as common in organized religion as in commerce, coupledin the former instance with the puritan's sense of guilt inenjoying anything for which he has not suffered. When I wrote this book, I was well aware that LSD inparticular might become a public scandal, especially in theUnited States where we had the precedents of Prohibition and offantastically punitive laws against the use of marijuana---lawspassed with hardly a pretense of scientific investigation of thedrug, and amazingly foisted upon many other nations. That wasnine years ago ( 1961 ) and since then all that I feared wouldhappen has happened. I ask myself whether I should ever havewritten this book, whether I was profaning the mysteries andcasting pearls before swine. I reasoned, however, that sinceHuxley and others had already let the secret out, it was up to meto encourage a positive, above-board, fearless, and intelligentapproach to what are now known as psychedelic chemicals. But in vain. Thousands of young people, fed up withstandard-brand religions which provided nothing but talk,admonition, and (usually) bad ritual, rushed immediately to LSDand other psychedelics in search of some key to genuine religiousexperience. As might be expected, there were accidents. A fewpotential psychotics were pushed over the brink, usually becausethey took LSD in uncontrolled circumstances, in excessive dosage,or in the arid and threatening atmosphere of hospital researchrun by psychiatrists who imagined that they were investigatingartificially induced schizophrenia. Because most news is badnews, these accidents received full coverage in the press, to therelative exclusion of reports on the overwhelming majority ofsuch splendid and memorable experiences as I describe further on.A divorce is news; a happy marriage isn't. There were evendeliberately falsified stories in the newspapers, as that severalyoung men taking LSD stared at the sun for so long that theybecame blind. Phychiatrists raised alarms about "braindamage," for which no solid evidence was ever produced, andwarnings were issued about its destructive effect on the genes,which was later shown to be insignificant and more or less thesame as the effects of coffee and aspirin. In view of this public hysteria the Sandoz Company, whichheld a patent on LSD, withdrew it from the market. At the sametime the United States government, having learned absolutelynothing from the disaster of Prohibition, simply banned LSD (allowing its use only in some few research projects sponsored bythe National Institute of Mental Health and by the Army, in itsinvestigations of chemical warfare) and turned over its controlto the police. Now a law against LSD is simply unenforceable because thesubstance is tasteless and colorless, because effective dosagescan be confined, in vast amounts, to minute spaces, and becauseit can be disguised as almost anything drinkable or eatable fromgin to blotting paper. Thus as soon as the reliable Sandozmaterial was withdrawn, amateur chemists began to produceblack-market LSD in immense quantities---LSD of uncertain qualityand dosage, often mixed with such other ingredients asmethedrine, belladonna, and heroin. Consequently the number ofpsychotic episodes resulting from its use began to increase,aggravated by the fact that, in improperly controlled situationsand under threat from the police, the LSD taker is an easy victimof extreme paranoia. At the same time, some of these amateurs,mainly graduate students in chemistry with a mission to"turn people on," produced some tolerably good LSD.Thus there were still so many more positive experiences thannegative that fascination with this alchemy continued andexpanded, and though the general public associates its use withhippies and college students, it has been very widely used bymature adults ---doctors, lawyers, clergymen, artists,businessmen, professors, and levelheaded housewives. The blanket suppression of LSD and other psychedelics hasbeen a complete disaster in that ( 1 ) it has seriously hinderedproper research on these drugs; (2) it has created a profitableblack market by raising the price; (3) it has embarrassed thepolice with an impossible assignment; (4) it has created thefalse fascination with fruit that is forbidden; (5) it hasseriously impeded the normal work of courts of justice, andherded thousands of non-criminal types of people into alreadyovercrowded prisons, which, as everyone knows, are schools forsodomy and for crime as a profession; ( 6 ) it has made users ofpsychedelics more susceptible to paranoia than ever. ** What, then, are the true dangers of real LSD? Principallythat it may trigger a short- or long-term psychosis in anyonesusceptible, and, despite all our techniques for psychologicaland neurological testing, we can never detect a potentialpsychotic with certainty. Anyone contemplating the use of apsychedelic chemical should weigh this risk carefully: there is aslight chance of becoming, at least temporarily, insane. The riskis probably much greater than in traveling by a commercialairline, but considerably less than in traveling by road. Everyhousehold contains things of potential danger: electricity,matches, gas, kitchen knives, carbon tetrachloride (cleaningfluid), ammonia, aerosol sprayers, alcohol, slippery bathtubs,sliding rugs, rifles, lawn mowers, axes, plate-glass doors, andswimming pools. There are no laws against the sale and possessionof such things, nor is one prevented from cultivating Amanitapantherina (the most deceptive and poisonous mushroom),deadly nightshade, laburnum, morning-glory, wood rose, Scotchbroom, and many other poisonous or psychedelic plants. One of the most sensible tenets of Jewish and ( at leasttheoretically) of Christian theology is that no substance orcreature is, in itself, evil. Evil arises only in its abuse---inkilling someone with a knife, committing arson with matches, orrunning down a pedestrian while driving alcoholized. (But notethat a highly depressed, anxious, or angry driver is just asdangerous, for his attention is not on the road. ) It seems to mea sound legal principle that people should be prosecuted only forovert and clearly specifiable deeds, damaging or clearly intendedto damage life, limb, and property. Laws which proscribe the meresale, purchase, or possession of substances ( aside from machineguns and bombs ) which might be used in some harmful way invitethe worst abuses of police power for political ends or for theharassment of unpopular individuals. (How easy to plant somemarijuana on an unwanted competitor in business!) All suchsumptuary laws (regulating private morals and creating crimeswithout unwilling victims ) are attempts to make personal freedomfoolproof and without risk, and thus to deprive the individual ofresponsibility for his own life and of taking calculated risk forthe achievement of political, social, athletic, scientific, orreligious objectives which he feels well worth the dangers. Adventurous and creative people have always been willing, andhave usually been encouraged, to take the most serious risks inthe exploration of the outer world and in the development ofscientific and technological skill. Many young people now feelthat the time has come to explore the inner world, and arewilling to take the unfamiliar risks which it involves. They,too, should be encouraged and also assisted with all the care andwisdom at our disposal. Why permit the purely athletic tour deforce of climbing Everest (using oxygen) and forbid thespiritual adventure of ascending Mount Sumeru, Mount Zion, orMount Analogue (using psychedelics)? Superficially, the public and official fear of psychedelicdrugs is based on uninformed association with such addictivepoisons as heroin, amphetamines, and barbiturates. But drinkingcoffee or whisky is also "using drugs," and this isallowed even though the effects may be harmful and the creativeresults negligible. Psychedelic drugs are feared, basically, forthe same reason that mystical experience has been feared,discouraged, and even condemned in the Catholic, Protestant, andIslamic orthodoxies. It leads to disenchantment and apathy towardthe approved social rewards of status and success, to chuckles atpretentiousness and pomposity, and, worse, to disbelief in theChurch-and-State dogma that we are all God's adopted orphans orfluky little germs in a mechanical and mindless universe. Noauthoritarian government, whether ecclesiastical or secular, cantolerate the apprehension that each one of us is God in disguise,and that our real inmost, outmost, and utmost Self cannot bekilled. That's why they had to do away with Jesus. Thus the possibility that even a preliminary glimpse of thisapprehension is available through taking a pill or chewing aplant threatens mystical experience for the millions---that is,masses of people who will be difficult to rule by force of"authority." It is even now being recognized in theUnited States that the real danger of psychedelics is not so muchneurological as political---that "turned-on" people arenot interested in serving the power games of the present rulers.Looking at the successful men, they see completely boring lives. In the Epilogue I shall make it clear that psychedelicexperience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but aglimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways ofmeditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. Whenyou get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs aresimply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones.The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to themicroscope; he goes away and works on what he has seen. Furthermore, speaking quite strictly, mystical insight is nomore in the chemical itself than biological knowledge is in themicroscope. There is no difference in principle betweensharpening perception with an external instrument, such as amicroscope, and sharpening it with an internal instrument, suchas one of these three drugs. If they are an affront to thedignity of the mind, the microscope is an affront to the dignityof the eye and the telephone to the dignity of the ear. Strictlyspeaking, these drugs do not impart wisdom at all, any more thanthe microscope alone gives knowledge. They provide the rawmaterials of wisdom, and are useful to the extent that theindividual can integrate what they reveal into the whole patternof his behavior and the whole system of his knowledge. As anescape, an isolated and dissociated ecstasy, they may have thesame sort of value as a rest cure or a good entertainment. Butthis is like using a giant computer to play tick-tack-toe, andthe hours of heightened perception are wasted unless occupiedwith sustained reflection or meditation upon whatever themes maybe suggested. The nearest thing I know in literature to the reflective useof one of these drugs is the so-called Bead Game in HermannHesse's Magister Ludi (Das Glasperlenspiel). Hesse writesof a distant future in which an order of scholar-mystics havediscovered an ideographic language which can relate all thebranches of science and art, philosophy and religion. The gameconsists in playing with the relationships between configurationsin these various fields in the same way that the musician playswith harmonic and contrapuntal relationships. From such elementsas the design of a Chinese house, a Scarlatti sonata, atopological formula, and a verse from the Upanishads, theplayers will elucidate a common theme and develop its applicationin numerous directions. No two games are the same, for not onlydo the elements differ, but also there is no thought ofattempting to force a static and uniform order upon the world.The universal language facilitates the perception ofrelationships but does not fix them, and is founded upon a"musical" conception of the world in which order is asdynamic and changing as the patterns of sound in a fugue. Similarly, in my investigations of LSD or psilocybin, Iusually started with some such theme as polarity, transformation(as of food into organism), competition for survival, therelation of the abstract to the concrete, or of Logos to Eros,and then allowed my heightened perception to elucidate the themein terms of certain works of art or music, of some natural objectas a fern, a flower, or a sea shell, of a religious ormythological archetype (it might be the Mass), and even ofpersonal relationships with those who happened to be with me atthe time. Or I would concentrate upon one of the senses and try,as it were, to turn it back upon itself so as to see the processof seeing, and from this move on to trying to know knowing, soapproaching the problem of my own identity. From these reflections there arise intuitive insights ofastonishing clarity, and because there is little difficulty inremembering them after the effects of the drug have ceased(especially if they are recorded or written down at the time),the days or weeks following may be used for testing them by thenormal standards of logical, aesthetic, philosophical, orscientific criticism. As might be expected, some prove to bevalid and others not. It is the same with the sudden hunches thatcome to the artist or inventor in the ordinary way; they are notalways as true or as applicable as they seem to be in themovement of illumination. The drugs appear to give an enormousimpetus to the creative intuition, and thus to be of more valuefor constructive invention and research than for psychotherapy inthe ordinary sense of "adjusting" the disturbedpersonality. Their best sphere of use is not the mental hospitalbut the studio and the laboratory, or the institute of advancedstudies. The following pages make no attempt to be a scientific reporton the effects of these chemicals, with the usual details ofdosage, time and place, physical symptoms, and the like. Suchdocuments exist by the thousand, and, in view of our veryrudimentary knowledge of the brain, seem to me to have a ratherlimited value. As well try to understand a book by dissolving itin solution and popping it into a centrifuge. My object is ratherto give some impression of the new world of consciousness whichthese substances reveal. I do not believe that this world iseither a hallucination or an unimpeachable revelation of truth.It is probably the way things appear when certain inhibitoryprocesses of the brain and senses are suspended, but this is aworld in some ways so unfamiliar that it is liable tomisinterpretation. Our first impressions may be as wide of themark as those of the traveler in an unfamiliar country or ofastronomers taking their first look at the galaxies beyond ourown. I have written this account as if the whole experience hadhappened on one day in a single place, but it is in fact acomposite of several occasions. Except where I am describingvisions before closed eyes, and this is always specified, none ofthese experiences are hallucinations. They are simply changedways of seeing, interpreting, and reacting to actual persons andevents in the world of "public reality," which, forpurposes of this description, is a country estate on the WestCoast of America with garden. orchard, barns, and surroundingmountains---all just as described, including the rattletrap carloaded with junk. Consciousness-changing drugs are popularlyassociated with the evocation of bizarre and fantastic images,but in my own experience this happens only with closed eyes.Otherwise, it is simply that the natural world is endowed with arichness of grace, color, significance, and, sometimes, humor,for which our normal adjectives are insufficient. The speed ofthought and association is increased so astonishingly that it ishard for words to keep pace with the flood of ideas that come tomind. Passages that may strike the reader as ordinaryphilosophical reflection are reports of what, at the time, appearto be the most tangible certainties. So, too, images that appearbefore closed eyes are not just figments of imagination, butpatterns and scenes so intense and autonomous that they seem tobe physically present. The latter have, however, proved of lessinterest to me than one's transformed impression of the naturalworld and the heightened speed of associative thought, and it isthus with these that the following account is chiefly concerned. *Normal dosage for mescaline is 300milligrams, for LSD-25 100 micrograms, and for psilocybin 20milligrams.

It isthe time of biological rhythm, not of the clock and all that goeswith the clock. There is no hurry. Our sense of time isnotoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of ourattention, whether of interest or boredom, and upon the alignmentof our behavior in terms of routines, goals, and deadlines. Herethe present is self-sufficient, but it is not a static present.It is a dancing present---the unfolding of a pattern which has nospecific destination in the future but is simply its own point.It leaves and arrives simultaneously, and the seed is as much thegoal as the flower. There is therefore time to perceive everydetail of the movement with infinitely greater richness ofarticulation. Normally we do not so much look at things asoverlook them. The eye sees types and classes---flower, leaf,rock, bird, fire---mental pictures of things rather than things,rough outlines filled with flat color, always a little dusty anddim. But here the depth of light and structure in a bursting budgo on forever. There is time to see them, time for the wholeintricacy of veins and capillaries to develop in consciousness,time to see down and down into the shape of greenness, which isnot green at all, but a whole spectrum generalizing itself asgreen---purple, gold, the sunlit turquoise of the ocean, theintense luminescence of the emerald. I cannot decide where shapeends and color begins. The bud has opened and the fresh leavesfan out and curve back with a gesture which is unmistakablycommunicative but does not say anything except, "Thus!"And somehow that is quite satisfactory, even startlingly clear.The meaning is transparent in the same way that the color and thetexture are transparent, with light which does not seem to fallupon surfaces from above but to be right inside the structure andcolor. Which is of course where it is, for light is aninseparable trinity of sun, object, and eye, and the chemistry ofthe leaf is its color, its light. But at the same time color and light are the gift of the eyeto the leaf and the sun. Transparency is the property of theeyeball, projected outward as luminous space, interpreting quantaof energy in terms of the gelatinous fibers in the head. I beginto feel that the world is at once inside my head and outside it,and the two, inside and outside, begin to include or"cap" one another like an infinite series of concentricspheres. I am unusually aware that everything I am sensing isalso my body---that light, color, shape, sound, and texture areterms and properties of the brain conferred upon the outsideworld. I am not looking at the world, not confronting it; I amknowing it by a continuous process of transforming it intomyself, so that everything around me, the whole globe of space,no longer feels away from me but in the middle. This is at first confusing. I am not quite sure of thedirection from which sounds come. The visual space seems toreverberate with them as if it were a drum. The surrounding hillsrumble with the sound of a truck, and the rumble and thecolor-shape of the hills become one and the same gesture. I usethat word deliberately and shall use it again. The hills aremoving into their stillness. They mean something because they arebeing transformed into my brain, and my brain is an organ ofmeaning. The forests of redwood trees upon them look like greenfire, and the copper gold of the sun-dried grass heaves immenselyinto the sky. Time is so slow as to be a kind of eternity, andthe flavor of eternity transfers itself to the hills---burnishedmountains which I seem to remember from an immeasurably distantpast, at once so unfamiliar as to be exotic and yet as familiaras my own hand. Thus transformed into consciousness, into theelectric, interior luminosity of the nerves, the world seemsvaguely insubstantial--- developed upon a color film, resoundingupon the skin of a drum, pressing, not with weight, but withvibrations interpreted as weight. Solidity is a neurologicalinvention, and, I wonder, can the nerves be solid to themselves?Where do we begin? Does the order of the brain create the orderof the world, or the order of the world the brain? The two seemlike egg and hen, or like back and front. The physical world is vibration, quanta, but vibrations ofwhat? To the eye, form and color; to the ear, sound; to the nose,scent; to the fingers, touch. But these are all differentlanguages for the same thing, different qualities of sensitivity,different dimensions of consciousness. The question, "Ofwhat are they differing forms?" seems to have no meaning.What is light to the eye is sound to the ear. I have the image ofthe senses being terms, forms, or dimensions not of one thingcommon to all, but of each other, locked in a circle ofmutuality. Closely examined, shape becomes color, which becomesvibration, which becomes sound, which becomes smell, whichbecomes taste, and then touch, and then again shape. (One cansee, for example, that the shape of a leaf is its color. There isno outline around the leaf; the outline is the limit where onecolored surface becomes another.) I see all these sensorydimensions as a round dance, gesticulations of one pattern beingtransformed into gesticulations of another. And thesegesticulations are flowing through a space that has still otherdimensions, which I want to describe as tones of emotional color,of light or sound being joyous or fearful, gold elated or leaddepressed. These, too, form a circle of reciprocity, a roundspectrum so polarized that we can only describe each in terms ofthe others. Sometimes the image of the physical world is not so much adance of gestures as a woven texture. Light, sound, touch, taste,and smell become a continuous warp, with the feeling that thewhole dimension of sensation is a single continuum or field.Crossing the warp is a woof representing the dimension ofmeaning---moral and aesthetic values, personal or individualuniqueness, logical significance, and expressive form---and thetwo dimensions interpenetrate so as to make distinguishableshapes seem like ripples in the water of sensation. The warp andthe woof stream together, for the weaving is neither flat norstatic but a many-directioned cross-flow of impulses filling thewhole volume of space. I feel that the world is on something insomewhat the same way that a color photograph is on a film,underlying and connecting the patches of color, though the filmhere is a dense rain of energy. I see that what it is on is mybrain---"that enchanted loom," as Sherrington calledit. Brain and world, warp of sense and woof of meaning, seem tointerpenetrate inseparably. They hold their boundaries or limitsin common in such a way as to define one another and to beimpossible without each other. I am listening to the music of an organ. As leaves seemed togesture, the organ seems quite literally to speak. There is nouse of the vox humana stop, but every sound seems to issuefrom a vast human throat, moist with saliva. As, with the basepedals, the player moves slowly down the scale, the sounds seemto blow forth in immense, gooey spludges. As I listen morecarefully, the spludges acquire texture---expanding circles ofvibration finely and evenly toothed like combs, no longer moistand liquidinous like the living throat, but mechanicallydiscontinuous. The sound disintegrates into the innumerableindividual drrrits of vibration. Listening on, the gapsclose, or perhaps each individual drrrit becomes in itsturn a spludge. The liquid and the hard, the continuous and thediscontinuous, the gooey and the prickly, seem to betransformations of each other, or to be different levels ofmagnification upon the same thing. This theme recurs in a hundred different ways---theinseparable polarity of opposites, or the mutuality andreciprocity of all the possible contents of consciousness. It iseasy to see theoretically that all perception is ofcontrasts---figure and ground, light and shadow, clear and vague,firm and weak. But normal attention seems to have difficulty intaking in both at once. Both sensuously and conceptually we seemto move serially from one to the other; we do not seem to be ableto attend to the figure without relative unconsciousness of theground. But in this new world the mutuality of things is quiteclear at every level. The human face, for example, becomes clearin all its aspects---the total form together with each singlehair and wrinkle. Faces become all ages at once, forcharacteristics that suggest age also suggest youth byimplication; the bony structure suggesting the skull evokesinstantly the newborn infant. The associative couplings of thebrain seem to fire simultaneously instead of one at a time,projecting a view of life which may be terrifying in itsambiguity or joyous in its integrity. Decision can be completely paralyzed by the suddenrealization that there is no way of having good without evil, orthat it is impossible to act upon reliable authority withoutchoosing, from your own inexperience, to do so. If sanity impliesmadness and faith doubt, am I basically a psychotic pretending tobe sane, a blithering terrified idiot who manages, temporarily,to put on an act of being self-possessed? I begin to see my wholelife as a masterpiece of duplicity---the confused, helpless,hungry, and hideously sensitive little embryo at the root of mehaving learned, step by step, to comply, placate, bully, wheedle,flatter, bluff, and cheat my way into being taken for a person ofcompetence and reliability. For when it really comes down to it,what do any of us know? I am listening to a priest chanting the Mass and a choir ofnuns responding. His mature, cultivated voice rings with theserene authority of the One, Holy, Catholic, and ApostolicChurch, of the Faith once and for all delivered to the saints,and the nuns respond, naively it seems, with childlike, utterlyinnocent devotion. But, listening again, I can hear the priest"putting on" his voice, hear the inflated, pompousballoon, the studiedly unctuous tones of a master deceptionistwho has the poor little nuns, kneeling in their stalls,completely cowed. Listen deeper. The nuns are not cowed at all.They are playing possum. With just a little stiffening, the limpgesture of bowing turns into the gesture of the closing claw.With too few men to go around, the nuns know what is good forthem: how to bend and survive. But this profoundly cynical view of things is only anintermediate stage. I begin to congratulate the priest on hisgamesmanship, on the sheer courage of being able to put up such aperformance of authority when he knows precisely nothing. Perhapsthere is no other knowing than the mere competence of the act.If, at the heart of one's being, there is no real self to whichone ought to be true, sincerity is simply nerve; it lies in theunabashed vigor of the pretense. But pretense is only pretense when it is assumed that the actis not true to the agent. Find the agent. In the priest's voice Ihear down at the root the primordial howl of the beast in thejungle, but it has been inflected, complicated, refined, andtextured with centuries of culture. Every new twist, everyadditional subtlety, was a fresh gambit in the game of making theoriginal howl more effective. At first, crude and unconcealed,the cry for food or mate, or just noise for the fun of it, makingthe rocks echo. Then rhythm to enchant. then changes of tone toplead or threaten. Then words to specify the need, to promise andbargain. And then, much later, the gambits of indirection. Thefeminine stratagem of stooping to conquer, the claim to superiorworth in renouncing the world for the spirit, the cunning ofweakness proving stronger than the might of muscle---and the meekinheriting the earth. As I listen, then, I can hear in that one voice thesimultaneous presence of all the levels of man's history, as ofall the stages of life before man. Every step in the game becomesas clear as the rings in a severed tree. But this is an ascendinghierarchy of maneuvers, of stratagems capping stratagems, allsymbolized in the overlays of refinement beneath which theoriginal howl is still sounding. Sometimes the howl shifts fromthe mating call of the adult animal to the helpless crying of thebaby, and I feel all man's music---its pomp and circumstance, itsgaiety, its awe, its confident solemnity---as just so muchcomplication and concealment of baby wailing for mother. And as Iwant to cry with pity, I know I am sorry for myself. I, as anadult, am also back there alone in the dark, just as theprimordial howl is still present beneath the sublime modulationsof the chant. You poor baby! And yet---you selfish little bastard! As I tryto find the agent behind the act, the motivating force at thebottom of the whole thing, I seem to see only an endlessambivalence. Behind the mask of love I find my innateselfishness. What a predicament I am in if someone asks, "Doyou really love me?" I can't say yes without saying no, forthe only answer that will really satisfy is, "Yes, I loveyou so much I could eat you! My love for you is identical with mylove for myself. I love you with the purest selfishness." Noone wants to be loved out of a sense of duty. So I will be very frank. "Yes, I am pure, selfish desireand I love you because you make me feel wonderful---at any ratefor the time being." But then I begin to wonder whetherthere isn't something a bit cunning in this frankness. It is bigof me to be so sincere, to make a play for her by not pretendingto be more than I am---unlike the other guys who say they loveher for herself. I see that there is always something insincereabout trying to be sincere, as if I were to say openly, "Thestatement that I am now making is a lie." There seems to besomething phony about every attempt to define myself, to betotally honest. The trouble is that I can't see the back, muchless the inside, of my head. I can't be honest because I don'tfully know what I am. Consciousness peers out from a center whichit cannot see---and that is the root of the matter. Life seems to resolve itself down to a tiny germ or nipple ofsensitivity. I call it the Eenie-Weenie---a squiggling littlenucleus that is trying to make love to itself and can never quiteget there. The whole fabulous complexity of vegetable and animallife, as of human civilization, is just a colossal elaboration ofthe Eenie-Weenie trying to make the Eenie-Weenie. I am in lovewith myself, but cannot seek myself without hiding myself. As Ipursue my own tail, it runs away from me. Does the amoeba splititself in two in an attempt to solve this problem? I try to go deeper, sinking thought and feeling down and downto their ultimate beginnings. What do I mean by loving myself? Inwhat form do I know myself? Always, it seems, in the form ofsomething other, something strange. The landscape I am watchingis also a state of myself, of the neurons in my head. I feel therock in my hand in terms of my own fingers. And nothing isstranger than my own body---the sensation of the pulse, the eyeseen through a magnifying glass in the mirror, the shock ofrealizing that oneself is something in the external world. Atroot, there is simply no way of separating self from other,self-love from other-love. All knowledge of self is knowledge ofother, and all knowledge of other knowledge of self. I begin tosee that self and other, the familiar and the strange, theinternal and the external, the predictable and the unpredictable implyeach other. One is seek and the other is hide, and the more Ibecome aware of their implying each other, the more I feel themto be one with each other. I become curiously affectionate andintimate with all that seemed alien. In the features ofeverything foreign, threatening, terrifying, incomprehensible,and remote I begin to recognize myself. Yet this is a"myself" which I seem to be remembering from long, longago---not at all my empirical ego of yesterday, not my speciouspersonality. The "myself" which I am beginning to recognize,which I had forgotten but actually know better than anythingelse, goes far back beyond my childhood, beyond the time whenadults confused me and tried to tell me that I was someone else;when, because they were bigger and stronger, they could terrifyme with their imaginary fears and bewilder and outface me in thecomplicated game that I had not yet learned. (The sadism of theteacher explaining the game and yet having to prove hissuperiority in it.) Long before all that, long before I was anembryo in my mother's womb, there looms the ever-so-familiarstranger, the everything not me, which I recognize, with a joyimmeasurably more intense than a meeting of lovers separated bycenturies, to be my original self. The good old sonofabitch whogot me involved in this whole game. At the same time everyone and everything around me takes onthe feeling of having been there always, and then forgotten, andthen remembered again. We are sitting in a garden surrounded inevery direction by uncultivated hills, a garden of fuchsias andhummingbirds in a valley that leads down to the westernmostocean, and where the gulls take refuge in storms. At some time inthe middle of the twentieth century, upon an afternoon in thesummer, we are sitting around a table on the terrace, eating darkhomemade bread and drinking white wine. And yet we seem to havebeen there forever, for the people with me are no longer thehumdrum and harassed little personalities with names, addresses,and social security numbers, the specifically dated mortals weare all pretending to be. They appear rather as immortalarchetypes of themselves without, however, losing their humanity.It is just that their differing characters seem, like thepriest's voice, to contain all history; they are at once uniqueand eternal, men and women but also gods and goddesses. For nowthat we have time to look at each other we become timeless. Thehuman form becomes immeasurably precious and, as if to symbolizethis, the eyes become intelligent jewels, the hair spun gold, andthe flesh translucent ivory. Between those who enter this worldtogether there is also a love which is distinctly eucharistic, anacceptance of each other's natures from the heights to thedepths. Ella, who planted the garden, is a beneficentCirce---sorceress, daughter of the moon, familiar of cats andsnakes, herbalist and healer---with the youngest old face one hasever seen, exquisitely wrinkled, silver-black hair rippled likeflames. Robert is a manifestation of Pan, but a Pan of bullsinstead of the Pan of goats, with frizzled short hair tufted intoblunt horns ---a man all sweating muscle and body, incarnation ofexuberant glee. Beryl, his wife, is a nymph who has stepped outof the forest, a mermaid of the land with swinging hair and adancing body that seems to be naked even when clothed. It is herbread that we are eating, and it tastes like the Original Breadof which mother's own bread was a bungled imitation. And thenthere is Mary, beloved in the usual, dusty world, but in thisworld an embodiment of light and gold, daughter of the sun, witheyes formed from the evening sky---a creature of all ages, baby,moppet, maid, matron, crone, and corpse, evoking love of allages. I try to find words that will suggest the numinous,mythological quality of these people. Yet at the same time theyare as familiar as if I had known them for centuries, or rather,as if I were recognizing them again as lost friends whom I knewat the beginning of time, from a country begotten before allworlds. This is of course bound up with the recognition of my ownmost ancient identity, older by far than the blind squiggling ofthe Eenie-Weenie, as if the highest form that consciousness couldtake had somehow been present at the very beginning of things.All of us look at each other knowingly, for the feeling that weknew each other in that most distant past conceals somethingelse---tacit, awesome, almost unmentionable ---the realizationthat at the deep center of a time perpendicular to ordinary timewe are, and always have been, one. We acknowledge the marvelouslyhidden plot, the master illusion, whereby we appear to bedifferent. The shock of recognition. In the form of everything mostother, alien, and remote---the ever-receding galaxies, themystery of death, the terrors of disease and madness, theforeign- feeling, gooseflesh world of sea monsters and spiders,the queasy labyrinth of my own insides---in all these forms Ihave crept up on myself and yelled "Boo!" I scaremyself out of my wits, and, while out of my wits, cannot rememberjust how it happened. Ordinarily I am lost in a maze. I don'tknow how I got here, for I have lost the thread and forgotten theintricately convoluted system of passages through which the gameof hide-and-seek was pursued. (Was it the path I followed ingrowing the circuits of my brain?) But now the principle of themaze is clear. It is the device of something turning back uponitself so as to seem to be other, and the turns have been so manyand so dizzyingly complex that I am quite bewildered. Theprinciple is that all dualities and opposites are not disjoinedbut polar; they do not encounter and confront one another fromafar; they exfoliate from a common center. Ordinary thinkingconceals polarity and relativity because it employs terms,the terminals or ends, the poles, neglecting what lies betweenthem. The difference of front and back, to be and not to be,hides their unity and mutuality. Now consciousness, sense perception, is always a sensation ofcontrasts. It is a specialization in differences, in noticing,and nothing is definable, classifiable, or noticeable except bycontrast with something else. But man does not live byconsciousness alone, for the linear, step-by-step,contrast-by-contrast procedure of attention is quite inadequatefor organizing anything so complex as a living body. The bodyitself has an "omniscience" which is unconscious, orsuperconscious, just because it deals with relation instead ofcontrast, with harmonies rather than discords. It"thinks" or organizes as a plant grows, not as abotanist describes its growth. This is why Shiva has ten arms,for he represents the dance of life, the omnipotence of beingable to do innumerably many things at once. In the type of experience I am describing, it seems that thesuperconscious method of thinking becomes conscious. We see theworld as the whole body sees it, and for this very reason thereis the greatest difficulty in attempting to translate this modeof vision into a form of language that is based on contrast andclassification. To the extent, then, that man has become a beingcentered in consciousness, he has become centered in clash,conflict, and discord. He ignores, as beneath notice, theastounding perfection of his organism as a whole, and this iswhy, in most people, there is such a deplorable disparity betweenthe intelligent and marvelous order of their bodies and thetrivial preoccupations of their consciousness. But in this otherworld the situation is reversed. Ordinary people look like godsbecause the values of the organism are uppermost, and theconcerns of consciousness fall back into the subordinate positionwhich they should properly hold. Love, unity, harmony, andrelationship therefore take precedence over war and division. For what consciousness overlooks is the fact that allboundaries and divisions are held in common by their oppositesides and areas, so that when a boundary changes its shape bothsides move together. It is like the yang-yin symbol of theChinese---the black and white fishes divided by an S-curveinscribed within a circle. The bulging head of one is thenarrowing tail of the other. But how much more difficult it is tosee that my skin and its movements belong both to me and to theexternal world, or that the spheres of influence of differenthuman beings have common walls like so many rooms in a house, sothat the movement of my wall is also the movement of yours. Youcan do what you like in your room just so long as I can do what Ilike in mine. But each man's room is himself in his fullestextension, so that my expansion is your contraction and viceversa. I am looking at what I would ordinarily call a confusion ofbushes---a tangle of plants and weeds with branches and leavesgoing every which way. But now that the organizing, relationalmind is uppermost I see that what is confusing is not the bushesbut my clumsy method of thinking. Every twig is in its properplace, and the tangle has become an arabesque more delicatelyordered than the fabulous doodles in the margins of Celticmanuscripts. In this same state of consciousness I have seen awoodland at fall, with the whole multitude of almost barebranches and twigs in silhouette against the sky, not as aconfusion, but as the lacework or tracery of an enchantedjeweler. A rotten log bearing rows of fungus and patches of mossbecame as precious as any work of Cellini---an inwardly luminousconstruct of jet, amber, jade, and ivory, all the porous andspongy disintegrations of the wood seeming to have been carvedout with infinite patience and skill. I do not know whether thismode of vision organizes the world in the same way that itorganizes the body, or whether it is just that the natural worldis organized in that way. A journey into this new mode of consciousness gives one amarvelously enhanced appreciation of patterning in nature, afascination deeper than ever with the structure of ferns, theformation of crystals, the markings upon sea shells, theincredible jewelry of such unicellular creatures of the ocean asthe radiolaria, the fairy architecture of seeds and pods, theengineering of bones and skeletons, the aerodynamics of feathers,and the astonishing profusion of eye-forms upon the wings ofbutterflies and birds. All this involved delicacy of organizationmay, from one point of view, be strictly functional for thepurposes of reproduction and survival. But when you come down toit, the survival of these creatures is the same as their veryexistence---and what is that for? More and more it seems that the ordering of nature is an artakin to music---fugues in shell and cartilage, counterpoint infibers and capillaries, throbbing rhythm in waves of sound,light, and nerve. And oneself is connected with it quiteinextricably---a node, a ganglion, an electronic interweaving ofpaths, circuits, and impulses that stretch and hum through thewhole of time and space. The entire pattern swirls in itscomplexity like smoke in sunbeams or the rippling networks ofsunlight in shallow water. Transforming itself endlessly intoitself, the pattern alone remains. The crosspoints, nodes, nets,and curlicues vanish perpetually into each other. "Thebaseless fabric of this vision." It is its own base. Whenthe ground dissolves beneath me I float. Closed-eye fantasies in this world seem sometimes to berevelations of the secret workings of the brain, of theassociative and patterning processes, the ordering systems whichcarry out all our sensing and thinking. Unlike the one I havejust described, they are for the most part ever more complexvariations upon a theme---ferns sprouting ferns sprouting fernsin multidimensional spaces, vast kaleidoscopic domes of stainedglass or mosaic, or patterns like the models of highly intricatemolecules---systems of colored balls, each one of which turns outto be a multitude of smaller balls, forever and ever. Is this,perhaps, an inner view of the organizing process which, when theeyes are open, makes sense of the world even at points where itappears to be supremely messy? Later that same afternoon, Robert takes us over to his barnfrom which he has been cleaning out junk and piling it into a bigand battered Buick convertible, with all the stuffing coming outof the upholstery. The sight of trash poses two of the greatquestions of human life, "Where are we going to putit?" and "Who's going to clean up?" From one pointof view living creatures are simply tubes, putting things in atone end and pushing them out at the other---until the tube wearsout. The problem is always where to put what is pushed out at theother end, especially when it begins to pile so high that thetubes are in danger of being crowded off the earth by their ownrefuse. And the questions have metaphysical overtones."Where are we going to put it?" asks for the foundationupon which things ultimately rest ---the First Cause, the DivineGround, the bases of morality, the origin of action. "Who'sgoing to clean up?" is asking where responsibilityultimately lies, or how to solve our ever-multiplying problemsother than by passing the buck to the next generation. I contemplate the mystery of trash in its immediatemanifestation: Robert's car piled high, with only the driver'sseat left unoccupied by broken door-frames, rusty stoves, tanglesof chicken-wire, squashed cans, insides of ancient harmoniums,nameless enormities of cracked plastic, headless dolls, bicycleswithout wheels, torn cushions vomiting kapok, non-returnablebottles, busted dressmakers' dummies, rhomboid picture-frames,shattered bird-cages, and inconceivable messes of string,electric wiring, orange peels, eggshells, potato skins, and lightbulbs---all garnished with some ghastly-white chemical powderthat we call "angel shit." Tomorrow we shall escortthis in a joyous convoy to the local dump. And then what? Can anymelting and burning imaginable get rid of these ever-risingmountains of ruin---especially when the things we make and buildare beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before theyare thrown away? The only answer seems to be that of the presentgroup. The sight of Robert's car has everyone helpless withhysterics. The Divine Comedy. All things dissolve in laughter. And forRobert this huge heap of marvelously incongruous uselessness is averitable creation, a masterpiece of nonsense. He slams ittogether and ropes it securely to the bulbous, low-slung wreck ofthe supposedly chic convertible, and then stands back to admireit as if it were a float for a carnival. Theme: the American wayof life. But our laughter is without malice, for in this state ofconsciousness everything is the doing of gods. The culmination ofcivilization in monumental heaps of junk is seen, not asthoughtless ugliness, but as self-caricature---as the creation ofphenomenally absurd collages and abstract sculptures indeliberate but kindly mockery of our own pretensions. For in thisworld nothing is wrong, nothing is even stupid. The sense ofwrong is simply failure to see where something fits into apattern, to be confused as to the hierarchical level upon whichan event belongs---a play which seems quite improper at level 28may be exactly right at level 96. I am speaking of levels orstages in the labyrinth of twists and turns, gambits andcounter-gambits, in which life is involving and evolving itself---the cosmological one-upmanship which the yang and the yin,the light and the dark principles, are forever playing, the gamewhich at some early level in its development seems to bethe serious battle between good and evil. If the square may bedefined as one who takes the game seriously, one must admire himfor the very depth of his involvement, for the courage to be sofar-out that he doesn't know where he started. The more prosaic, the more dreadfully ordinary anyone oranything seems to be, the more I am moved to marvel at theingenuity with which divinity hides in order to seek itself, atthe lengths to which this cosmic joie de vivre will go inelaborating its dance. I think of a corner gas station on a hotafternoon. Dust and exhaust fumes, the regular Standard guy allbaseball and sports cars, the billboards halfheartedly gaudy, theflatness so reassuring---nothing around here but just us folks! Ican see people just pretending not to see that they are avatarsof Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, that the cells of their bodiesaren't millions of gods, that the dust isn't a haze of jewels.How solemnly they would go through the act of not understandingme if I were to step up and say, "Well, who do you thinkyou're kidding? Come off it, Shiva, you old rascal! It's a greatact, but it doesn't fool me." But the conscious ego doesn'tknow that it is something which that divine organ, the body, isonly pretending to be.* When people go to a guru, a master of wisdom, seeking away out of darkness, all he really does is to humor them in theirpretense until they are outfaced into dropping it. He tellsnothing, but the twinkle in his eye speaks to theunconscious---"You know....You know!" In the contrast world of ordinary consciousness man feelshimself, as will, to be something in nature but not of it. Helikes it or dislikes it. He accepts it or resists it. He moves itor it moves him. But in the basic superconsciousness of the wholeorganism this division does not exist. The organism and itssurrounding world are a single, integrated pattern of action inwhich there is neither subject nor object, doer nor done to. Atthis level there is not one thing called pain and another thingcalled myself, which dislikes pain. Pain and the"response" to pain are the same thing. When thisbecomes conscious it feels as if everything that happens is myown will. But this is a preliminary and clumsy way of feelingthat what happens outside the body is one process with whathappens inside it. This is that "original identity"which ordinary language and our conventional definitions of manso completely conceal. The active and the passive are two phases of the same act. Aseed, floating in its white sunburst of down, drifts across thesky, sighing with the sound of a jet plane invisible above. Icatch it by one hair between thumb and index finger, and amastonished to watch this little creature actually wiggling andpulling as if it were struggling to get away. Common sense tellsme that this tugging is the action of the wind, not of thethistledown. But then I recognize that it is the"intelligence" of the seed to have just such delicateantennae of silk that, in an environment of wind, it can move.Having such extensions, it moves itself with the wind. When itcomes to it, is there any basic difference between putting up asail and pulling an oar? If anything, the former is a moreintelligent use of effort than the latter. True, the seed doesnot intend to move itself with the wind, but neither did I intendto have arms and legs. It is this vivid realization of the reciprocity of will andworld, active and passive, inside and outside, self and not-self,which evokes the aspect of these experiences that is mostpuzzling from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness: thestrange and seemingly unholy conviction that "I" amGod. In Western culture this sensation is seen as the verysignature of insanity But in India it is simply a matter ofcourse that the deepest center of man, atman, is thedeepest center of the universe, Brahman. Why not? Surely acontinuous view of the world is more whole, more holy, morehealthy, than one in which there is a yawning emptiness betweenthe Cause and its effects. Obviously, the "I" which isGod is not the ego, the consciousness of self which issimultaneously an unconsciousness of the fact that its outerlimits are held in common with the inner limits of the rest ofthe world. But in this wider, less ignore-ant consciousness I amforced to see that everything I claim to will and intend has acommon boundary with all I pretend to disown. The limits of whatI will, the form and shape of all those actions which I claim asmine, are identical and coterminous with the limits of all thoseevents which I have been taught to define as alien and external. The feeling of self is no longer confined to the inside ofthe skin. Instead, my individual being seems to grow out from therest of the universe like a hair from a head or a limb from abody, so that my center is also the center of the whole. I findthat in ordinary consciousness I am habitually trying to ringmyself off from this totality, that I am perpetually on thedefensive. But what am I trying to protect? Only veryoccasionally are my defensive attitudes directly concerned withwarding off physical damage or deprivation. For the most part Iam defending my defenses: rings around rings around rings aroundnothing. Guards inside a fortress inside entrenchments inside aradar curtain. The military war is the outward parody of the warof ego versus world: only the guards are safe. In the next waronly the air force will outlive the women and children. I trace myself back through the labyrinth of my brain,through the innumerable turns by which I have ringed myself offand, by perpetual circling, obliterated the original trailwhereby I entered this forest. Back through the tunnels---throughthe devious status-and-survival strategy of adult life, throughthe interminable passages which we remember in dreams ---all thestreets we have ever traveled, the corridors of schools, thewinding pathways between the legs of tables and chairs where onecrawled as a child, the tight and bloody exit from the womb, thefountainous surge through the channel of the penis, the timelesswanderings through ducts and spongy caverns. Down and backthrough ever-narrowing tubes to the point where the passageitself is the traveler---a thin string of molecules going throughthe trial and error of getting itself into the right order to bea unit of organic life. Relentlessly back and back throughendless and whirling dances in the astronomically proportionedspaces which surround the original nuclei of the world, thecenters of centers, as remotely distant on the inside as thenebulae beyond our galaxy on the outside. Down and at last out---out of the cosmic maze to recognize inand as myself, the bewildered traveler, the forgotten yetfamiliar sensation of the original impulse of all things, supremeidentity, inmost light, ultimate center, self more me thanmyself. Standing in the midst of Ella's garden I feel, with apeace so deep that it sings to be shared with all the world, thatat last I belong, that I have returned to the home behind home,that I have come into the inheritance unknowingly bequeathed fromall my ancestors since the beginning. Plucked like the strings ofa harp, the warp and woof of the world reverberate with memoriesof triumphant hymns. The sure foundation upon which I had soughtto stand has turned out to be the center from which I seek. Theelusive substance beneath all the forms of the universe isdiscovered as the immediate gesture of my hand. But how did Iever get lost? And why have I traveled so far through theseintertwined tunnels that I seem to be the quaking vortex ofdefended defensiveness which is my conventional self? Going indoors I find that all the household furniture isalive. Everything gestures. Tables are tabling, pots are potting,walls are walling, fixtures are fixturing---a world of eventsinstead of things. Robert turns on the phonograph, withouttelling me what is being played. Looking intently at the picturespicturing, I only gradually become conscious of the music, and atfirst cannot decide whether I am hearing an instrument or a humanvoice simply falling. A single stream of sound, curving,rippling, and jiggling with a soft snarl that at last reveals itto be a reed instrument---some sort of oboe. Later, human voicesjoin it. But they are not singing words, nothing but a kind of"buoh---buah---bueeh" which seems to beexploring all the liquidinous inflections of which the voice iscapable. What has Robert got here? I imagine it must be some ofhis far-out friends in a great session of nonsense-chanting. Thesinging intensifies into the most refined, exuberant, anddelightful warbling, burbling. honking. hooting. andhowling---which quite obviously means nothing whatsoever. and isbeing done out of pure glee. There is a pause. A voice says. "Dit!"Another seems to reply, "Da!" Then, "Dit-da!Di-dittty-da!" And getting gradually faster. "Da-di-ditty-di-ditty-da!Di-da-di-ditty-ditty-da-di-da-di-ditty-da-da!" And soon, until the players are quite out of their minds. The recordcover which Robert now shows me, says "Classical Music ofIndia," and informs me that this is a series edited by AlainDanielou, who happens to be the most serious, esoteric, andlearned scholar of Hindu music, and an exponent. in the line ofRene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy, of the most formal,traditional, and difficult interpretation of Yoga and Vedanta.Somehow I cannot quite reconcile Danielou, the pandit of pandits,with this delirious outpouring of human bird-song. I feel my legis being pulled. Or perhaps Danielou's leg. But then, maybe not. Oh, indeed not ! For quite suddenly Ifeel my understanding dawning into a colossal clarity, as ifeverything were opening up down to the roots of my being and oftime and space themselves. The sense of the world becomes totallyobvious. I am struck with amazement that I or anyone could havethought life a problem or being a mystery. I call to everyone togather round. "Listen, there's something I must tell. I'venever, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn't matter a bit ifyou don't understand, because each one of you is quite perfect asyou are, even if you don't know it. Life is basically a gesture,but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessityfor it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For itisn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself.It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no oneis making it, it isn't happening to anyone. There issimply no problem of life; it is completely purposelessplay---exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is thegesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it.There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations arejust another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life ontop of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simplyextreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the wholeuniverse to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone!There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind offlip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It's acurlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take orreverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same asanxiety." Of course, to say that life is just a gesture, anaction without agent, recipient, or purpose, sounds much moreempty and futile than joyous. But to me it seems that an ego, asubstantial entity to which experience happens, is more of aminus than a plus. It is an estrangement from experience, a lackof participation. And in this moment I feel absolutely withthe world, free of that chronic resistance to experience whichblocks the free flowing of life and makes us move likemuscle-bound dancers. But I don't have to overcome resistance. Isee that resistance, ego, is just an extra vortex in the stream--part of it---and that in fact there is no actual resistance atall. There is no point from which to confront life, or standagainst it. I go into the garden again. The hummingbirds are soaring upand falling in their mating dance, as if there were someonebehind the bushes playing ball with them. Fruit and more winehave been put out on the table. Oranges ---transformations of thesun into its own image, as if the tree were acknowledginggratitude for warmth. Leaves, green with the pale, yellow-freshgreen that I remember from the springtimes of my childhood inKentish spinneys, where breaking buds were spotted all over thehazel branches in a floating mist. Within them, trunks, boughs,and twigs moist black behind the sunlit green. Fuchsia bushes,tangled traceries of stalks, intermingled with thousands ofmagenta ballerinas with purple petticoats. And, behind all,towering into the near-twilight sky, the grove of gianteucalyptus trees with their waving clusters of distinctlyindividual, bamboo-like leaves. Everything here is the visualform of the lilting nonsense and abandoned vocal dexterity ofthose Hindu musicians. I recall the words of an ancient Tantric scripture: "Aswaves come with water and flames with fire, so the universalwaves with us." Gestures of the gesture, waves of thewave---leaves flowing into caterpillars, grass into cows, milkinto babies, bodies into worms, earth into flowers, seeds intobirds, quanta of energy into the iridescent or reverberatinglabyrinths of the brain. Within and swept up into this endless,exulting, cosmological dance are the base and grinding undertonesof the pain which transformation involves: chewed nerve endings,sudden electric-striking snakes in the meadow grass, swoop of thelazily circling hawks, sore muscles piling logs, sleepless nightstrying to keep track of the unrelenting bookkeeping whichcivilized survival demands. How unfamiliarly natural it is to see pain as no longer aproblem. For problematic pain arises with the tendency ofself-consciousness to short-circuit the brain and fill itspassages with dithering echoes---revulsions to revulsions, fearsof fear, cringing from cringing, guilt about guilt---twistingthought to trap itself in endless oscillations. In his ordinaryconsciousness man lives like someone trying to speak in anexcessively sensitive echo-chamber; he can proceed only bydoggedly ignoring the interminably gibbering reflections of hisvoice. For in the brain there are echoes and reflected images inevery dimension of sense, thought, and feeling, chattering on andon in the tunnels of memory. The difficulty is that we confusethis storing of information with an intelligent commentary onwhat we are doing at the moment, mistaking for intelligence theraw materials of the data with which it works. Like too muchalcohol, self-consciousness makes us see ourselves double, and wemistake the double image for two selves---mental and material,controlling and controlled, reflective and spontaneous. Thusinstead of suffering we suffer about suffering, and suffer aboutsuffering about suffering. As has always been said, clarity comes with the giving up ofself. But what this means is that we cease to attribute selfhoodto these echoes and mirror images. Otherwise we stand in a hallof mirrors, dancing hesitantly and irresolutely because we aremaking the images take the lead. We move in circles because weare following what we have already done. We have lost touch withour original identity, which is not the system of images but thegreat self-moving gesture of this as yet unremembered moment. Thegift of remembering and binding time creates the illusion thatthe past stands to the present as agent to act, mover to moved.Living thus from the past, with echoes taking the lead, we arenot truly here, and are always a little late for the feast. Yetcould anything be more obvious than that the past follows fromthe present like the wake of a ship, and that if we are to bealive at all, here is the place to be? Evening at last closes a day that seemed to have been goingon since the world began. At the high end of the garden, above aclearing, there stands against the mountain wall a semicircle oftrees, immensely tall and dense with foliage, suggesting theentrance grove to some ancient temple. It is from here that thedeep blue-green transparency of twilight comes down, silencingthe birds and hushing our own conversation. We have been watchingthe sunset, sitting in a row upon the ridgepole of the great barnwhose roof of redwood tiles, warped and cracked, sweeps clear tothe ground. Below, to the west, lies an open sward where twowhite goats are munching the grass, and beyond this is Robert'shouse where lights in the kitchen show that Beryl is preparingdinner. Time to go in, and leave the garden to the awakeningstars. Again music---harpsichords and a string orchestra, and Bachin his most exultant mood. I lie down to listen, and close myeyes. All day, in wave after wave and from all directions of themind's compass, there has repeatedly come upon me the sense of myoriginal identity as one with the very fountain of the universe.I have seen, too, that the fountain is its own source and motive,and that its spirit is an unbounded playfulness which is themany-dimensioned dance of life. There is no problem left, but whowill believe it? Will I believe it myself when I return to normalconsciousness? Yet I can see at the moment that this does notmatter. The play is hide- and-seek or lost-and-found, and it isall part of the play that one can get very lost indeed. How far,then, can one go in getting found? As if in answer to my question there appears before my closedeyes a vision in symbolic form of what Eliot has called "thestill point of the turning world." I find myself lookingdown at the floor of a vast courtyard, as if from a window highupon the wall, and the floor and the walls are entirely surfacedwith ceramic tiles displaying densely involved arabesques ingold, purple, and blue. The scene might be the inner court ofsome Persian palace, were it not of such immense proportions andits colors of such preternatural transparency. In the center ofthe floor there is a great sunken arena, shaped like acombination of star and rose, and bordered with a strip of tilesthat suggest the finest inlay work in vermilion, gold, andobsidian. Within this arena some kind of ritual is being performed intime with the music. At first its mood is stately and royal, asif there were officers and courtiers in rich armor and many-colored cloaks dancing before their king. As I watch, the moodchanges. The courtiers become angels with wings of golden fire,and in the center of the arena there appears a pool of dazzlingflame. Looking into the pool I see, just for a moment, a facewhich reminds me of the Christos Pantocrator of Byzantinemosaics, and I feel that the angels are drawing back with wingsover their faces in a motion of reverent dread. But the facedissolves. The pool of flame grows brighter and brighter, and Inotice that the winged beings are drawing back with a gesture,not of dread, but of tenderness---for the flame knows no anger.Its warmth and radiance---"tongues of flameinfolded"---are an efflorescence of love so endearing that Ifeel I have seen the heart of all hearts. * "Self-conscious man thinks hethinks.

At the same time Ihave more or less kept to the basic form which every individualexperiment seems to take---a sort of cycle in which one'spersonality is taken apart and then put together again, in whatone hopes is a more intelligent fashion. For example, one's trueidentity is first of all felt as something extremely ancient,familiarly distant ---with overtones of the magical,mythological, and archaic. But in the end it revolves back towhat one is in the immediate present, for the moment of theworld's creation is seen to lie, not in some unthinkably remotepast, but in the eternal now. Similarly, the play of life is atfirst apprehended rather cynically as an extremely intricatecontest in one-upmanship, expressing itself deviously even in themost altruistic of human endeavors. Later, one begins to feel a"good old rascal" attitude toward the system; humorgets the better of cynicism. But finally, rapacious andall-embracing cosmic selfishness turns out to be a disguise forthe unmotivated play of love. But I do not mean to generalize. I am speaking only of what Ihave experienced for myself, and I wish to repeat that drugs ofthis kind are in no sense bottled and predigested wisdom. I feelthat had I no skill as a writer or philosopher, drugs whichdissolve some of the barriers between ordinary, pedestrianconsciousness and the multidimensional superconsciousness of theorganism would bring little but delightful, or sometimesterrifying, confusion. I am not saying that only intellectualscan benefit from them, but that there must be sufficientdiscipline or insight to relate this expanded consciousness toour normal, everyday life. Such aids to perception are medicines, not diets, and as theuse of a medicine should lead on to a more healthful mode ofliving, so the experiences which I have described suggestmeasures we might take to maintain a sounder form of sanity. Ofthese, the most important is the practice of what I would like tocall meditation---were it not that this word often connotesspiritual or mental gymnastics. But by meditation I do not mean apractice or exercise undertaken as a preparation for something,as a means to some future end, or as a discipline in which one isconcerned with progress. A better word may be"contemplation" or even "centering," for whatI mean is a slowing down of time, of mental hurry, and anallowing of one's attention to rest in the present---so coming tothe unseeking observation, not of what should be, but of what is.It is quite possible, even easy, to do this without the aid ofany drug, though these chemicals have the advantage of"doing it for you" in a peculiarly deep and prolongedfashion. But those of us who live in this driven and over-purposefulcivilization need, more than anyone else, to lay aside some spanof clock time for ignoring time, and for allowing the contents ofconsciousness to happen without interference. Within suchtimeless spaces, perception has an opportunity to develop anddeepen in much the same way that I have described. Because onestops forcing experience with the conscious will and looking atthings as if one were confronting them, or standing aside fromthem to manage them, it is possible for one's fundamental andunitive apprehension of the world to rise to the surface. But itis of no use to make this a goal or to try to work oneself intothat way of seeing things. Every effort to change what is beingfelt or seen presupposes and confirms the illusion of theindependent knower or ego, and to try to get rid of what isn'tthere is only to prolong confusion. On the whole, it is better totry to be aware of one's ego than to get rid of it. We can thendiscover that the "knower" is no different from thesensation of the "known," whether the known be"external" objects or "internal" thoughts andmemories. In this way it begins to appear that instead of knowers andknowns there are simply knowings, and instead of doers and deedssimply doings. Divided matter and form becomes unifiedpattern-in-process. Thus when Buddhists say that reality is"void" they mean simply that life, thepattern-in-process, does not proceed from or fall upon somesubstantial basis. At first, this may seem rather disconcerting,but in principle the idea is no more difficult to abandon thanthat of the crystalline spheres which were once supposed tosupport and move the planets. Eventually this unified and timeless mode of perception"caps" our ordinary way of thinking and acting in thepractical world: it includes it without destroying it. But italso modifies it by making it clear that the function ofpractical action is to serve the abiding present rather than theever-receding future, and the living organism rather than themechanical system of the state or the social order. In addition to this quiet and contemplative mode ofmeditation there seems to me to be an important place foranother, somewhat akin to the spiritual exercises of thedervishes. No one is more dangerously insane than one who is saneall the time: he is like a steel bridge without flexibility, andthe order of his life is rigid and brittle. The manners and moresof Western civilization force this perpetual sanity upon us to anextreme degree, for there is no accepted corner in our lives forthe art of pure nonsense. Our play is never real play because itis almost invariably rationalized; we do it on the pretext thatit is good for us, enabling us to go back to work refreshed.There is no protected situation in which we can really letourselves go. Day in and day out we must tick obediently likeclocks, and "strange thoughts" frighten us so much thatwe rush to the nearest head-doctor. Our difficulty is that wehave perverted the Sabbath into a day for laying on rationalityand listening to sermons instead of letting off steam. If our sanity is to be strong and flexible, there must beoccasional periods for the expression of completely spontaneousmovement---for dancing, singing, howling, babbling, jumping,groaning, wailing---in short, for following any motion to whichthe organism as a whole seems to be inclined. It is by no meansimpossible to set up physical and moral boundaries within whichthis freedom of action is expressible---sensible contexts inwhich nonsense may have its way. Those who provide for thisessential irrationality will never become stuffy or dull, and,what is far more important, they will be opening up the channelsthrough which the formative and intelligent spontaneity of theorganism can at last flow into consciousness. This is why freeassociation is such a valuable technique in psychotherapy; itslimitation is that it is purely verbal. The function of suchintervals for nonsense is not merely to be an outlet for pent-upemotion or unused psychic energy, but to set in motion a mode ofspontaneous action which, though at first appearing as nonsense,can eventually express itself in intelligible forms. Disciplined action is generally mistaken for forced action,done in the dualistic spirit of compelling oneself, as if thewill were quite other than the rest of the organism. But aunified and integrated concept of human nature requires a newconcept of discipline---the control, not of forced action, but ofspontaneous action. It is necessary to see discipline as atechnique which the organism uses, as a carpenter uses tools, andnot as a system to which the organism must be conformed.Otherwise the purely mechanical and organizational ends of thesystem assume greater importance than those of the organism. Wefind ourselves in the situation where man is made for theSabbath, instead of the Sabbath for man. But before spontaneousaction can be expressed in controlled patterns, its current mustbe set in motion. That is to say, we must acquire a far greatersensitivity to what the organism itself wants to do, and learnresponsiveness to its inner motions. Our language almost compels us to express this point in thewrong way ---as if the "we" that must be sensitive tothe organism and respond to it were something apart.Unfortunately our forms of speech follow the design of the socialfiction which separates the conscious will from the rest of theorganism, making it the independent agent which causes andregulates our actions. It is thus that we fail to recognize whatthe ego, the agent, or the conscious will is. We do not see thatit is a social convention, like the intervals of clock time, asdistinct from a biological or even psychological entity. For theconscious will, working against the grain of instinct, is theinteriorization, the inner echo, of social demands upon theindividual coupled with the picture of his role or identity whichhe acquires from parents, teachers, and early associates. It isan imaginary, socially fabricated self working against theorganism, the self that is biologically grown. By means of thisfiction the child is taught to control himself and conformhimself to the requirements of social life. At first sight this seems to be an ingenious and highlynecessary device for maintaining an orderly society based uponindividual responsibility. In fact it is a penny-wise,pound-foolish blunder which is creating many more problems thanit solves. To the degree that society teaches the individual toidentify himself with a controlling will separate from his totalorganism, it merely intensifies his feeling of separateness, fromhimself and from others. In the long run it aggravates theproblem that it is designed to solve, because it creates a styleof personality in which an acute sense of responsibility iscoupled with an acute sense of alienation. The mystical experience, whether induced by chemicals orother means, enables the individual to be so peculiarly open andsensitive to organic reality that the ego begins to be seen forthe transparent abstraction that it is. In its place there arises(especially in the latter phases of the drug experience) a strongsensation of oneness with others, presumably akin to thesensitivity which enables a flock of birds to twist and turn asone body. A sensation of this kind would seem to provide a farbetter basis for social love and order than the fiction of theseparate will. The general effect of the drugs seems to be that theydiminish defensive attitudes without blurring perception, as inthe case of alcohol. We become aware of things against which wenormally protect ourselves, and this accounts, I feel, for thehigh susceptibility to anxiety in the early phases of theexperience. But when defenses are down we begin to see, nothallucinations, but customarily ignored aspects ofreality---including a sense of social unity which civilized manhas long since lost. To regain this sense we do not need toabandon culture and return to some precivilized level, forneither in the drug experience nor in more general forms ofmystical experience does one lose the skills or the knowledgewhich civilization has produced. I have suggested that in these experiences we acquire cluesand insights which should be followed up through certain forms ofmeditation. Are there not also ways in which we can, even withoutusing the drugs, come back to this sense of unity with otherpeople? The cultured Westerner has a very healthy distaste forcrowds and for the loss of personal identity in "herd-consciousness." But there is an enormous difference betweena formless crowd and an organic social group. The latter is arelatively small association in which every member is incommunication with every other member. The former is a relativelylarge association in which the members are in communication onlywith a leader, and because of this crude structure a crowd is notreally an organism. To think of people as "the masses"is to think of them by analogy with a subhuman style of order. The corporate worship of churches might have been the naturalanswer to this need, were it not that church services follow thecrowd pattern instead of the group pattern. Participants sit inrows looking at the backs of each other's necks, and are incommunication only with the leader ---whether preacher, priest,or some symbol of an autocratic God. Many churches try to make upfor this lack of communion by "socials" and dancesoutside the regular services. But these events have a secularconnotation, and the type of communion involved is alwayssomewhat distant and demure. There are, indeed, discussion groupsin which the leader or "resource person" encouragesevery member to have his say, but, again, the communion soachieved is merely verbal and ideational. The difficulty is that the defended defensiveness of the egorecoils from the very thing that would allay it---fromassociations with others based on physical gestures of affection,from rites, dances, or forms of play which clearly symbolizemutual love between the members of the group. Sometimes a play ofthis kind will occur naturally and unexpectedly between closefriends, but how embarrassing it might be to be involved in thedeliberate organization of such a relationship with totalstrangers ! Nevertheless, there are countless associations ofpeople who, claiming to be firm friends, still lack the nerve torepresent their affection for each other by physical and eroticcontact which might raise friendship to the level of love. Ourtrouble is that we have ignored and thus feel insecure in theenormous spectrum of love which lies between rather formalfriendship and genital sexuality, and thus are always afraid thatonce we overstep the bounds of formal friendship we must slideinevitably to the extreme of sexual promiscuity, or worse, tohomosexuality. This unoccupied gulf between spiritual or brotherly love andsexual love corresponds to the cleft between spirit and matter,mind and body, so divided that our affections or our activitiesare assigned either to one or to the other. There is no continuumbetween the two, and the lack of any connection, any interveningspectrum, makes spiritual love insipid and sexual love brutal. Tooverstep the limits of brotherly love cannot, therefore, beunderstood as anything but an immediate swing to its oppositepole. Thus the subtle and wonderful gradations that lie betweenthe two are almost entirely lost. In other words, the greaterpart of love is a relationship that we hardly allow, for loveexperienced only in its extreme forms is like buying a loaf ofbread and being given only the two heels. I have no idea what can be done to correct this in a culturewhere personal identity seems to depend on being physicallyaloof, and where many people shrink even from holding the hand ofsomeone with whom they have no formally sexual or familial tie.To force or make propaganda for more affectionate contacts withothers would bring little more than embarrassment. One can buthope that in the years to come our defenses will crackspontaneously, like eggshells when the birds are ready to hatch.This hope may gain some encouragement from all those trends inphilosophy and psychology, religion and science, from which weare beginning to evolve a new image of man, not as a spiritimprisoned in incompatible flesh, but as an organism inseparablefrom his social and natural environment. This is certainly the view of man disclosed by theseremarkable medicines which temporarily dissolve our defenses andpermit us to see what separative consciousness normallyignores---the world as an interrelated whole. This vision isassuredly far beyond any drug-induced hallucination orsuperstitious fantasy. It wears a striking resemblance to theunfamiliar universe that physicists and biologists are trying todescribe here and now. For the clear direction of their thoughtis toward the revelation of a unified cosmology, no longersundered by the ancient irreconcilables of mind and matter,substance and attribute, thing and event, agent and act, stuffand energy. And if this should come to be a universe in which manis neither thought nor felt to be a lonely subject confronted byalien and threatening objects, we shall have a cosmology not onlyunified but also joyous.

For close to2,000 years the Mystery was performed every year (except one) forcarefully screened initiates in our month of September. Everyonespeaking the Greek language was free to present himself, exceptonly those who had the unexpiated blood of a murdered man ontheir hands. The initiates lived through the night in thetelesterion of Eleusis, under the leadership of the twohierophantic families, the Eumolpids and the Kerykes, and theywould come away all wonder-struck by what they had lived through:according to some, they were never the same as before. Thetestimony about that night of awe-inspiring experience isunanimous and Sophocles speaks for the initiates when he says: Thrice happy are those of mortals, who having seen those rites depart for Hades; for to them alone is granted to have a true life there. For the rest, all there is evil. Yet up to now no one has known what justifies utterances suchas this, and there are many like it. Here lies for us the mysteryof the Eleusinian Mysteries. To this mystery we three haveapplied ourselves and believe we have found the solution, closeto 2,000 years after the last performance of the rite and some4,000 years since the first.

The English language lacks a word to designate the higherfungi. "Toadstool" is an epithet, a pejorativedesignation embracing all those fungal growths that the userdistrusts, whether rightly or wrongly. "Mushroom" isambiguous, covering different areas of the fungal world fordifferent persons. In this little book we will use"mushroom" for all the higher fungi. Now that at longlast the world is coming to know these fungal growths in alltheir myriad shapes and colors and smells and textures, perhapsthis novel usage will answer to a need and come to be generallyaccepted. We are three who have enlisted for this presentation. Dr.A1bert Hofmann is the Swiss chemist renowned for his discovery in1943 of LSD, but his familiarity with the plant alkaloids isencyclopaedic and he will draw our attention to attributes ofsome of them relevant to the Eleusinian Mysteries. As we are dealing with a central theme of Greek civilizationin antiquity, it was obvious that we needed the cooperation of aGreek scholar. At the appropriate moment I learned of ProfessorCarl A. P. Ruck, of Boston University, who for some years hasbeen making notable discoveries in the recalcitrant area of Greekethnobotany. For many months we three have been studying theproposal that we are making and his paper will be the third andconcluding one. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter is thesource for the myth that underlies Eleusis and we offer a newEnglish rendering of it by Danny Staples. It will be my function, in this first of three papers, tostress certain attributes of the cult of inebriating mushrooms inMexico. Early Man in Greece, in the second millennium before Christ,founded the Mysteries of Eleusis and they held spellbound theinitiates who each year attended the rite. Silence as to whattook place there was obligatory: the laws of Athens were extremein the penalties that were imposed on any who infringed thesecret, but throughout the Greek world, far beyond the reach ofAthens' laws, the secret was kept spontaneously throughoutAntiquity, and since the suspension of the Mysteries in the 4thcentury A. D. that Secret has become a built-in element in thelore of Ancient Greece. I would not be surprised if someclassical scholars would even feel that we are guilty of asacrilegious outrage at now prying open the secret. On 15November 1956 I read a brief paper before the AmericanPhilosophical Society describing the Mexican mushroom cult and inthe ensuing oral discussion I intimated that this cult might leadus to the solution of the Eleusinian Mysteries. A famous Englisharchaeologist specializing in the archaeology of Greece, withwhom I had had the friendliest relations for about thirty-fiveyears, wrote me in a letter a little later the following: I do not think that Mycenae had anything to do with the divine mushroom or the Eleusinian mysteries either. May I add a word of warning? Stick to your Mexican mushroom cult and beware of seeing mushrooms everywhere. We much enjoyed your Philadelphia paper and would recommend you keep as close to that as you can. Forgive the frankness of an old friend. I am sorry that he has now joined the shades in Hades, orperhaps I should be happy that he will not be pained by mybrashness in disregarding his well-meant advice. My late wife Valentina Pavlovna and I were the first to usethe term ethnomycology and we have been closely identified withthe progress in this discipline over the past fifty years. Thatthe reader may sense the drama of this our latest discovery Iwill begin by retelling the story of our mushroomic adventure. Itcovers precisely the last fifty years. It constitutes in largemeasure the autobiography of the Wasson family, and it has nowled us directly to Eleusis. Late in August 1927 my bride, as she then was, and I took ourdelayed honeymoon in the chalet lent to us by the publisher AdamDingwall at Big Indian in the Catskills. She was a Russian bornin Moscow of a family of the intelligentsia. Tina had fled fromRussia with her family in the summer of 1918, she being then 17years old. She qualified as a physician at the University ofLondon and had been working hard to establish her pediatricpractice in New York. I was a newspaper man in the financialdepartment of the Herald Tribune. On that first beautifulafternoon of our holiday in the Catskills, we went saunteringdown the path for a walk, hand in hand, happy as larks, both ofus abounding in the joy of life. There was a clearing on theright, a mountain forest on our left. Suddenly Tina threw down my hand and darted up into theforest. She had seen mushrooms, a host of mushrooms, mushrooms ofmany kinds that peopled the forest floor. She cried out indelight at their beauty. She addressed each kind with anaffectionate Russian name. Such a display she had not seen sinceshe left her family's dacha near Moscow, almost a decadebefore. She knelt before those toadstools in poses of adorationlike the Virgin hearkening to the Angel of the Annunciation. Shebegan gathering some of the fungi in her apron. I called to her:"Come back, come back to me! They are poisonous, putrid.They are toadstools. Come back to me!" She only laughed themore: her merry laughter will ring forever in my ears. Thatevening she seasoned the soup with the fungi, she garnished themeat with other fungi. Yet others she threaded together andstrung up to dry, for winter use as she said. My discomfiture wascomplete. That night I ate nothing with mushrooms in it. Franticand deeply hurt, I was led to wild ideas: I told her that I wouldwake up a widower. She proved right and I wrong. The particular circumstances of this episode seem to haveshaped the course of our lives. We began checking with ourcompatriots, she with Russians and I with Anglo-Saxons. Wequickly found that our individual attitudes characterized ourrespective peoples. Then we began gathering information, at firstslowly, haphazardly, intermittently. We assembled our respectivevocabularies for mushrooms: the Russian was endless, never tothis day exhausted; the English, essentially confined to threewords, two of them ill-defined --- toadstool, mushroom, fungus.The Russian poets and novelists filled their writings withmushrooms, always in a loving context. It would seem to astranger that every Russian poet composes verses onmushroom-gathering almost as a rite of passage to qualify formature rating! In English the silence of many writers aboutmushrooms is deafening: Chaucer and Milton never mention them,the others seldom. For Shakespeare, Spenser, William Penn,Laurence Sterne (extensively), Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, forEdgar Allan Poe and D. H. Lawrence and Emily Dickinson,"mushroom" and "toadstool" are unpleasant,even disgusting epithets. Our poets when they do mention themlink them to decay and death. We began to cast our net wider andto study all the peoples of Europe, not only the German andFrench and Italians, but more especially the peripheral cultures,out of the main stream, where archaic forms and beliefs survivelongest --- the Albanian, Frisian, Lappish, Basque, Catalonianand Sardinian, Icelandic and Faroese, and of course the Hungarianand the Finnish. In all our inquiries and travels we looked, notto the erudite, but to the humble and illiterate peasants as ourmost cherished informants. We explored their knowledge ofmushrooms and the uses to which they put them. We were carefulalso to take the flavor of the scabrous and erotic vocabulariesoften neglected by lexicographers. We examined the common namesfor mushrooms in all these cultures, seeking the fossil metaphorshiding in their etymologies, to discover what those metaphorsexpressed, whether a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward ourearthy creatures. A little thing, some of you may say, this difference inemotional attitude toward wild mushrooms. But my wife and I didnot think so, and we devoted most of our leisure hours fordecades to dissecting it, defining it, and tracing it to itsorigin. Such discoveries as we have made, including therediscovery of the religious role for the hallucinogenicmushrooms of Mexico, can be laid to our preoccupation with thatcultural rift between my wife and me, between our respectivepeoples, between the mycophilia and mycophobia (words that wedevised for our two attitudes) that divide the Indo-Europeanpeoples into two camps. If this hypothesis of ours be wrong, thenit must have been a singular false hypothesis to have borne thefruit that it has. But it is not wrong. Thanks to the immensestrides made in the study of the human psyche in this century, weare all now aware that deep-seated emotional attitudes acquiredin early life are of profound importance. I suggest that whensuch traits betoken the attitudes of whole tribes or peoples,when those traits have remained unaltered throughout recordedhistory, and especially when they differ from one people toanother neighboring people, then you are face to face with aphenomenon of deepest cultural implications, whose primal causeis to be discovered only in the well-springs of cultural history. Our card files and correspondence kept expanding and in theend, sometime in the early 1940's, we sat down, Tina and I, andasked ourselves what we were going to do with all our data. Wedecided to write a book, but there were so many lacunae in ourevidence that it would be years before we could put words topaper. In our conversations at that time we found that we hadbeen thinking along the same lines, afraid to express ourthoughts even to each other: they were too fantastic. We had bothcome to discern a period long long ago, long before our ancestorsknew how to write, when those ancestors must have regarded amushroom as a divinity or quasi-divinity. We knew not whichmushroom(s) nor why. In the days of Early Man his whole world wasshot through with religious feeling and the unseen powers heldhim in thrall. Our sacred "mushroom" must have beenwondrous indeed, evoking awe and adoration, fear, yes, eventerror. When that early cult gave way to new religions and tonovel ways emerging with a literate culture, the emotions arousedby the old cult would survive, truncated from their roots. In onearea the fear and terror would live on, either of a particularmushroom (as in the case of A. muscaria); or else, as theemotional focus through tabu became vague, of"toadstools" in general; and in another area, for areason that we cannot now tell, it was the spirit of love andadoration that survived. Here would lie the explanation of themycophobia vs. mycophilia that we had discovered.("Toadstool", incidentally, was originally the specificname of A. muscaria, the divine mushroom, of a beautybefitting its divinity. Through tabu, "toadstool" lostits focus and came to hover over the whole of the mushroom tribethat the mycophobe shuns.) It was in Mexico that our pursuit of a hypothetical sacredmushroom first achieved its goal. On 19 September 1952 wereceived in the post two letters from Europe: one from RobertGraves enclosing a cutting from a pharmaceutical journal in whichthere were quotations from Richard Evans Schultes, who in turncited a number of with century Spanish friars telling of astrange mushroom cult among the Indians of Mesoamerica; thesecond from Giovanni Mardersteig, our printer in Verona, sendingus his sketch of a curious archaeological artifact fromMesoamerica. It was exhibited in the Rietberg Museum of Zurich.The artifact was of stone, about a foot high, obviously amushroom, with a radiant being carved on the stem or whatmycologists call the stipe. Here was perhaps the very cult wewere seeking, well within our reach. Earlier we had resolved thatwe would avoid the New World and Africa in our inquiries: theworld was too large and our hands were full with Eurasia. But ina trice we changed our minds and the course of our studies, andwe concentrated on Mexico and Guatemala. We had been postulatinga wild mushroom as a focus of religious devotion, a fantasticsurmise. Now here it was on our doorstep. All that winter we wentracing through the texts of the 16th century Spanish friars, andwhat extraordinary narratives they give us! We flew down toMexico in that summer of 1953 and for many rainy seasonsthereafter. With wonderful cooperation from everyone in thatcountry, on the night of 29-30 June 1955 we finally made ourbreakthrough: my photographer and friend Allan Richardson and Iparticipated with our Indian friends in a midnight agapeconducted by a shaman of extraordinary quality. This was thefirst time on record that anyone of the alien race had shared insuch a communion. It was a soul-shattering experience. The wildsurmise that we had dared to postulate in a whisper to each otheryears before was at last vindicated. And now, nearly a quarter ofa century later, we are prepared to offer another mushroom, Clavicepspurpurea, as holding the secret to the Eleusinian Mysteries. That there might be a common denominator between the Mexicanmushroom Mystery and the Mystery of Eleusis had struck me atonce. They both aroused an overwhelming sense of awe, of wonder.I will leave to Professor Ruck the discussion of Eleusis but willquote one ancient author, Aristides the Rhetor, who in the 2ndcentury A. D. pulled aside the curtain for an instant when hesaid that what the initiate experienced was "new,astonishing, inaccessible to rational cognition", and hewent on: Eleusis is a shrine common to the whole earth, and of all the divine things that exist among men, it is both the most awesome and the most luminous. At what place in the world have more miraculous tidings been sung, and where have the dromena called forth greater emotion, where has there been greater rivalry between seeing and hearing? [Italics mine.] And he goes on to speak of the "ineffable visions"that it had been the privilege of many generations of fortunatemen and women to behold. This description point by point tallies with the effect onthe initiate of the Mesoamerican mushroom rite, even to the"rivalry" between seeing and hearing. For the sightsthat one sees assume rhythmical contours, and the singing of theshaman seems to take on visible and colorful shapes. There seems to have been a saying among the Greeks thatmushrooms were the "food of the Gods", broma theon,and Porphyrius is quoted as having called them "nurslings ofthe Gods", theotrophos. The Greeks of the classicperiod were mycophobes. Was this not because their ancestors hadfelt that the whole fungal tribe was infected "byattraction" with the holiness of the sacred mushroom, andthat mushrooms were therefore to be avoided by mortal men? Are wenot dealing with what was in origin a religious tabu? I would not be understood as contending that only thesealkaloids (wherever found in nature) bring about visions andecstasy. Clearly some poets and prophets and many mystics andascetics seem to have enjoyed ecstatic visions that answer therequirements of the ancient Mysteries and that duplicate themushroom agape of Mexico. I do not suggest that St. John ofPatmos ate mushrooms in order to write the Book of theRevelation. Yet the succession of images in his Vision, soclearly seen but such a phantasmagoria, means for me that he wasin the same state as one bemushroomed. Nor do I suggest for amoment that William Blake knew the mushroom when he wrote thistelling account of the clarity of "vision": The Prophets describe what they saw in Vision as real and existing men, whom they saw with their imaginative and immortal organs; the Apostles the same; the clearer the organ the more distinct the object. A Spirit and a Vision are not, as the modern philosophy supposes, a cloudy vapour, or a nothing: they are organized and minutely articulated beyond all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce. He who does not imagine in stronger and better lineaments, and in stronger and better light than his perishing eye can see, does not imagine at all. [Italics mine. From The Writings of William Blake, ed. by Geoffrey Keynes, vol. III, p. I08] This must sound cryptic to one who does not share Blake'svision or who has not taken the mushroom. The advantage of themushroom is that it puts many, if not everyone, within reach ofthis state without having to suffer the mortifications of Blakeand St. John. It permits you to see, more clearly than ourperishing mortal eye can see, vistas beyond the horizons of thislife, to travel backwards and forwards in time, to enter otherplanes of existence, even (as the Indians say) to know God. It ishardly surprising that your emotions are profoundly affected, andyou feel that an indissoluble bond unites you with the others whohave shared with you in the sacred agape. All that you see duringthis night has a pristine quality: the landscape, the edifices,the carvings, the animals - they look as though they had comestraight from the Maker's workshop. This newness of everything--- it is as though the world had just dawned --- overwhelms youand melts you with its beauty. Not unnaturally, what is happeningto you seems to you freighted with significance, beside which thehumdrum events of everyday are trivial. All these things you seewith an immediacy of vision that leads you to say to yourself,"Now I am seeing for the first time, seeing direct, withoutthe intervention of mortal eyes." Plato tells us that beyond this ephemeral and imperfectexistence here below, there is another Ideal world of Archetypes,where the original, the true, the beautiful Pattern of thingsexists for evermore. Poets and philosophers for millennia havepondered and discussed his conception. It is clear to me wherePlato found his "Ideas"; it was clear to those who wereinitiated into the Mysteries among his contemporaries too. Platohad drunk of the potion in the Temple of Eleusis and had spentthe night seeing the great Vision. And all the time that you are seeing these things, thepriestess in Mexico sings, not loud, but with authority. TheIndians are notoriously not given to displays of inner feelings--- except on these occasions. The singing is good, but under theinfluence of the mushroom you think it is infinitely tender andsweet. It is as though you were hearing it with your mind's ear,purged of all dross. You are lying on a petate or mat;perhaps, if you have been wise, on an air mattress and in asleeping bag. It is dark, for all lights have been extinguishedsave a few embers among the stones on the floor and the incensein a sherd. It is still, for the thatched hut is apt to be somedistance away from the village. In the darkness and stillness,that voice hovers through the hut, coming now from beyond yourfeet, now at your very ear, now distant, now actually underneathyou, with strange ventriloquistic effect. The mushrooms producethis illusion also. Everyone experiences it, just as do thetribesmen of Siberia who have eaten of Amanita muscariaand lie under the spell of their shamans, displaying as these dotheir astonishing dexterity with ventriloquistic drum beats.Likewise, in Mexico, I have heard a shaman engage in a mostcomplicated percussive beat: with her hands she hits her chest,her thighs, her forehead, her arms, each giving a differentresonance, keeping a complicated rhythm and modulating, evensyncopating, the strokes. Your body lies in the darkness, heavyas lead, but your spirit seems to soar and leave the hut, andwith the speed of thought to travel where it listeth, in time andspace, accompanied by the shaman's singing and by theejaculations of her percussive chant. What you are seeing andwhat you are hearing appear as one: the music assumes harmoniousshapes, giving visual form to its harmonies, and what you areseeing takes on the modalities of music --- the music of thespheres. "Where has there been greater rivalry betweenseeing and hearing?" How apposite to the Mexican experiencewas the ancient Greek's rhetorical question! All your senses aresimilarly affected: the cigarette with which you occasionallybreak the tension of the night smells as no cigarette before hadever smelled; the glass of simple water is infinitely better thanchampagne. Elsewhere I once wrote that the bemushroomed person ispoised in space, a disembodied eye, invisible, incorporeal,seeing but not seen. In truth, he is the five senses disembodied,all of them keyed to the height of sensitivity and awareness, allof them blending into one another most strangely, until theperson, utterly passive, becomes a pure receptor, infinitelydelicate, of sensations. As your body lies there in its sleeping bag, your soul isfree, loses all sense of time, alert as it never was before,living an eternity in a night, seeing infinity in a grain ofsand. What you have seen and heard is cut as with a burin in yourmemory, never to be effaced. At last you know what the ineffableis, and what ecstasy means. Ecstasy ! The mind harks back to theorigin of that word. For the Greeks ekstasis meant the flight ofthe soul from the body. I am certain that this word came intobeing to describe the effect of the Mystery of Eleusis. Can youfind a better word than that to describe the bemushroomed state?In common parlance, among the many who have not experiencedecstasy, ecstasy is fun, and I am frequently asked why I do notreach for mushrooms every night. But ecstasy is not fun. Yourvery soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. After all, whowill choose to feel undiluted awe, or to float through that dooryonder into the Divine Presence? The unknowing vulgar abuse theword, and we must recapture its full and terrifying sense.... Afew hours later, the next morning, you are fit to go to work. Buthow unimportant work seems to you, by comparison with theportentous happenings of that night! If you can, you prefer tostay close to the house, and, with those who lived through thatnight, compare notes, and utter ejaculations of amazement. I will convey to you the overwhelming impression of awe thatthe sacred mushrooms arouse in the native population of theMexican highlands. In the Mazatec tribe where I ingested them forthe first time these particular mushrooms are not"mushrooms": they stand apart. One word --- thain3--- embraces the whole fungal tribe, edible, innocuous butinedible, and toxic, --- the whole fungal world except the sacredspecies. The sacred species are known by a name that in itself isa euphemism for some other name now lost: they are 7nti1xi3tho3.(In Mazatec each syllable must be pronounced in one of four tonesor in slides from one tone to another, 1 being the highest. Theinitial 7 is a glottal stop.) The first element, 7nti1,is a diminutive of affection and respect. The second element, xi3tho3,means "that which leaps forth". The whole word is thus:"the dear little things that leap forth". But this wordis holy: you do not hear it uttered in the market place or wherenumbers of people are assembled. It is best to bring up thesubject at night, by the light of a fire or a vela (votivecandle), when you are alone with your hosts. Then they willdilate endlessly on the wonders of these wondrous mushrooms. Forthis euphemistic name they will probably use yet others, afurther degree of euphemism, the santitos, the"little saints", or again the "little things"in Mazatec. When we were leaving the Mazatec mountains onhorseback after our first visit there, we asked our muleteerVictor Hernandez how it came about that the sacred mushrooms werecalled "the dear little ones that leap forth". He hadtraveled the mountain trails all his life and spoke Spanishalthough he could neither read nor write nor even tell time bythe clock's face. His answer, breathtaking in sincerity andfeeling, breathed the poetry of religion and I quote it word forword as he uttered it and as I put it down in my notebook at thetime: El honguillo viene por si mismo, no se sabe de donde, como el viento que viene sin saber de donde ni porque. The little mushroom comes of itself, no one knows whence, like the wind that comes we know not whence nor why. Victor was referring to the genesis of the sacred mushrooms:they leap forth seedless and rootless, a mystery from thebeginning. Aurelio Carreras, town slaughterer in Huautla, when weasked him where the mushrooms take you, said simply: Le llevanalli donde dios esta, "They carry you there where Godis". According to Ricardo Garcia Gonzalez of Rio Santiago,"To eat the mushrooms you must be clean: they are the bloodof our Lord the Eternal Father." Hay que ser may limpio,es la sangre de Nuestro Senor Padre Eterno. These areSpanish-speaking villagers picked at random. They expressreligion in its purest essence, without intellectual content.Aristotle said of the Eleusinian Mysteries precisely the same:the initiates were to suffer, to feel, to experience certainimpressions and moods. They were not to learn anything. As man emerged from his brutish past, thousands of years ago,there was a stage in the evolution of his awareness when thediscovery of a mushroom (or was it a higher plant?) withmiraculous properties was a revelation to him, a veritabledetonator to his soul, arousing in him sentiments of awe andreverence, and gentleness and love, to the highest pitch of whichmankind is capable, all those sentiments and virtues that mankindhas ever since regarded as the highest attribute of his kind. Itmade him see what this perishing mortal eye cannot see. How rightthe Greeks were to hedge about this Mystery, this imbibing of thepotion, with secrecy and surveillance! What today is resolvedinto a mere drug, a tryptamine or lysergic acid derivative, wasfor him a prodigious miracle, inspiring in him poetry andphilosophy and religion. Perhaps with all our modern knowledge wedo not need the divine mushrooms any more. Or do we need themmore than ever? Some are shocked that the key even to religionmight be reduced to a mere drug. On the other hand, the drug isas mysterious as it ever was: "like the wind that comes weknow not whence nor why." Out of a mere drug comes theineffable, comes ecstasy. It is not the only instance in thehistory of humankind where the lowly has given birth to thedivine. Altering a sacred text, we would say that this paradox isa hard saying, yet one worthy of all men to be believed. If our classical scholars were given the opportunity toattend the rite at Eleusis, to talk with the priestess, whatwould they not exchange for that chance? They would approach theprecincts, enter the hallowed chamber, with the reverence born ofthe texts venerated by scholars for millennia. How propitiouswould their frame of mind be, if they were invited to partake ofthe potion! Well, those rites take place now, unbeknownst to theclassical scholars, in scattered dwellings, humble, thatched,without windows, far from the beaten track, high in the mountainsof Mexico, in the stillness of the night, broken only by thedistant barking of a dog or the braying of an ass. Or, since weare in the rainy season, perhaps the Mystery is accompanied bytorrential rains and punctuated by terrifying thunderbolts. Then,indeed, as you lie there bemushroomed, listening to the music andseeing the visions, you know a soul-shattering experience,recalling as you do the belief of some early peoples thatmushrooms, the sacred mushrooms, are divinely engendered byParjanya, the Aryan God of the Lightning-bolt, in the Soft MotherEarth. Someone has called mycology the step-child of the sciences.Is it not now acquiring a wholly new and unexpected dimension?Religion has always been at the core of man's highest facultiesand cultural achievements, and therefore I ask you now tocontemplate our lowly mushroom --- what patents of ancientlineage and nobility are coming its way!

I replied that thismight well have been the case and I promised to send him, afterfurther reflection, an exposition of our present knowledge on thesubject, which I already suspected would support my tentativeposition. Two years have passed, and here now is my answer. Ergot is the English name for a fungal growth, the"sclerotium" of a mushroom known to mycologists as Clavicepspurpurea (Fr.) Tul. It is a parasite on rye and other cerealssuch as barley or wheat, and also on certain wild grasses. Otherspecies of the genus Claviceps, viz C. paspali Stev. andHall, C. nigricans Tul., and C. glabra Langdon,etc., are parasitical to many species and varieties of grasses.Ergot itself is not of uniform chemical composition: it occurs in"biological" or "chemical" races, differingfrom each other mainly by the composition of their alkaloidalconstituents. (Chemists define "alkaloids" asnitrogen-containing alkaline substances that represent thepharmacologically active principles of many plants.) Thus inSwitzerland there exist three varieties of ergot of rye: (a) inthe Midlands a race containing mainly the alkaloid ergotamine,(b) in the Valais one with alkaloids of the ergotoxine group, and(c) in the Grisons a variety with no alkaloids at all.Furthermore in other kinds of ergot --- growing on wheat, onbarley, on millet, on lolium, etc. --- there are wide variationsin alkaloidal makeup, sometimes depending on geographicallocation. By far the most important of all kinds of ergot is ergot ofrye, purple-brown protrusions from the ears of rye. Ergot of rye(in scientific nomenclature: Secale cornutum) has beencalled in England "horned rye", "spiked rye","spurred rye", but most commonly "ergot ofrye", a translation of the French ergot de seigle.The word ergot is defined in the Petit Larousse as "petitongle pointu derriere le pied du coq", "smallpointed talon behind the cock's foot", but the derivation ofthe French word ergot is uncertain. Other French names arebl� cornu, seigle ergot�, seigle ivre. In German thereseem to be more variants than in other languages: Mutterkorn,Rockenmutter, Afterkorn, Todtenkorn, Tollkorn, and manyothers. In German folklore there was a belief that, when the cornwaved in the wind, the corn mother (a demon) was passing throughthe field; her children were the rye wolves (ergot). In ourcontext we observe that of these names, two, seigle ivre("drunken rye") and Tollkorn ("madgrain"), point to a knowledge of the psychotropic effects ofergot. This folk awareness of the mindchanging effects of ergotshows an intimate knowledge of its properties, at least amongherbalists, deeply rooted in European traditions. Ergot of rye has a storied past. Once a dreaded poison, ithas become a rich treasure chamber of valuable pharmaceuticals. In the Middle Ages bizarre epidemics occurred in Europecosting thousands of people their lives, occasioned by bread madefrom rye contaminated with ergot. These epidemics took two forms,Ergotismus convulsivus, characterized by nervousconvulsive and epileptiform symptoms, and Ergotismusgangraenosus, in which gangrenous manifestations leading tomummification of the extremities were a prominent feature.Ergotism was also known as ignis sacer ("holyfire"), or "St. Anthony's fire", because St.Anthony was the patron saint of a religious order founded to carefor the victims of ergotism. The cause of these epidemics ---bread contaminated with ergot --- was not learned until theseventeenth century, and since then there have been only sporadicoutbreaks of ergot poisoning. Ergot was first mentioned as a remedy by the German physicianAdam Lonitzer in 1582. He said it was being used by midwives toprecipitate childbirth. The first scientific report on the use ofergot as a uterotonic agent was presented by the Americanphysician John Stearns in 1808: "Account of the pulvisparturiens". But already in 1824 Dr. David Hosack, alsoAmerican, recognizing the dangers of using ergot for acceleratingchildbirth, recommended that the drug be used only to controlpostpartum haemorrhage. Since then ergot has been used inobstetrics mainly for this purpose.(1) (This Dr. Hosack was adistinguished man. He was a physician to many of the eminent NewYorkers of his time, and he accompanied Alexander Hamilton toWeehawken heights for his fatal duel with Aaron Burr. This Ilearned from the admirable life of Hosack by Christine Robbins.) The latest and most important chapter in the history of ergotdeals with it as a rich source of pharmacologically usefulalkaloids.(2) More than thirty alkaloids have been isolated fromergot and it is unlikely that many new ones will be discovered.Hundreds of chemical modifications of these natural alkaloidshave been prepared and investigated pharmacologically. Today allthese alkaloids are also available by total synthesis. Medicinally the most useful alkaloids stem from ergot of rye.The first ergot alkaloid that found widespread therapeutic usewas ergotamine, isolated by A. Stoll in 1918. It is the essentialcomponent of pharmaceutical preparations such as"Cafergot" and "Bellergal", medicamentsagainst migraine and nervous disorders. Modern valuable ergotpreparations are "Hydergine" developed by A. Stoll andA. Hofmann in the Sandoz laboratories in Basel, containinghydrogenated ergotoxine alkaloids, used in the treatment of geriatric disorders, and"Dihydergot" with dihydroergotamine as activecomponent, for the therapy of circulatory disturbances. Of special relevance to our problem here are theinvestigations into the alkaloid ergonovine, which is thespecific uterotonic water-soluble principle of ergot. In 1932 H.W. Dudley and C. Moir in England discovered that water-solubleextracts of ergot, containing none of the water-insolublealkaloids of the ergotamine-ergotoxine-type, elicited stronguterotonic activity. This observation led three years later tothe isolation of the alkaloid responsible for this actionsimultaneously in four separate laboratories, which named it"ergometrine", "ergobasin","ergotocine," "ergostetrine", respectively.The International Pharmacopoeia Commission proposed a name to beinternationally accepted to replace these synonyms, viz."ergonovine". In 1937, starting with naturally occurring lysergic acid, Iprepared ergonovine, which by its chemical composition islysergic acid propanolamide. Lysergic acid is the nucleus commonto most ergot alkaloids. It is extracted from special cultures ofergot and could also be prepared today by total synthesis if thisprocedure were not too expensive. I used the method developed forthe synthesis of ergonovine for the preparation of many chemicalmodifications of ergonovine. One of these partly syntheticderivatives of ergonovine was lysergic acid butanolamide. This isused today in obstetrics, replacing to a major extent ergonovine,under the brand name "Methergine" to stop postpartumhaemorrhage. Another lysergic acid derivative that I synthesized in thiscontext aiming to get an analeptic (that is, an agent withcirculation-and respiration-stimulating properties) was lysergicacid diethylamide. Pharmacological examination revealed a fairlystrong uterotonic activity in this compound, nearly as strong asergonovine. In 1943 I discovered in self-experiments the specifichigh hallucinogenic potency of lysergic acid diethylamide, whichbecame known world-wide under the laboratory code name LSD-25. My interest in hallucinogenic agents, originating in 1943from my work with LSD, brought me into personal contact withGordon Wasson, pioneer ethnomycologist and also pioneer in theinvestigation of the ancient Mexican mushroom cult. From RogerHeim, then head of the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie and Director ofthe famous Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris, whomWasson invited to study and identify in the field his sacredmushrooms, I received samples of them for chemical analysis. Withmy laboratory assistant Hans Tscherter I succeeded in isolatingthe hallucinogenic principles of the sacred Mexican mushrooms,which I named psilocybin and psilocin. With my colleagues of theSandoz Research Laboratories, we succeeded in the elucidation ofthe chemical structure and the synthesis of psilocybin andpsilocin. Inspired by my talks with my friend Wasson and encouraged byour success with the hallucinogenic mushrooms, I decided totackle also the problem of another psychotropic Mexican plant, ololiuhqui.With Wasson's help I obtained a large quantity of authentic ololiuhquiseeds of the two morning glories that the Mesoamerican Indianswere using, seeds of Turbina corymbosa (L.) Raf. and Ipomoeaviolacea L. When we analyzed them we arrived at an unexpectedresult: these ancient drugs that we are apt to call"magical" and the Indians consider divine, contained astheir psychoactive principles some of our already familiar ergotalkaloids. The main components were lysergic acid amide andlysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, both water-soluble alkaloids,closely related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), as isevident even to the non-chemist. Another constituent of the ololiuhquialkaloids was ergonovine, the uterotonic principle of ergot. The psychoactive property of these simple lysergic acidamides, closely related to LSD, is well established. The questionpresented itself whether ergonovine, being not only an alkaloidalcomponent of ergot but also of ololiuhqui, possessedhallucinogenic activity. In the light of its chemical structurethis did not seem unlikely: it does not differ much from LSD. Butone may ask why, if it is hallucinogenic, this astonishing facthas not been announced, in the light of its use over recentdecades in obstetrics. Undoubtedly the answer lies in theextremely low dosage of ergonovine used to stop postpartumbleeding, viz 0.1 to 0.25 mg. The effective dose of lysergic acidamide is 1 to 2 mg by oral application. I decided therefore totest in a self-experiment a corresponding dose of ergonovine: 1 April 1976 12.20 h: 2.0 mg ergonovine hydrogenmaleinate, containing 1.5mg ergonovine base, ingested in a glass of water. 13.00 h: slight nausea, same effect as I have experiencedalways in my LSD or psilocybin experiments. Tired, need to liedown. With eyes closed colored figures. 13.30 h: the trees in the nearby forest seem to live, theirbranches moving in a threatening way. 14.30 h: strong desire to dream, unable to do systematicwork, with eyes closed or open afflicted by mollusk-like formsand feelings. 16.00 h: motives and colors have become clearer, but bearingstill some hidden dangers. 17.00 h: after a short sleep I awoke by a kind of innerexplosion of all the senses. 18.00 h: an unexpected visit forced me to become active, butduring the whole evening I lived more in an inner than in theouter world. 22.00 h: all effects worn off, normal feeling. This was an experiment performed without attention to"set and setting" but it proves that ergonovinepossesses a psychotropic, mood-changing, slightly hallucinogenicactivity when taken in the same amount as is an effective dose oflysergic acid amide, the main constituent of ololiuhqui.Its potency is about one-twentieth of the potency of LSD andabout five times that of psilocybin. There is a further finding that may prove to be of utmostimportance in considering Wasson's question. The mainconstituents of the Mexican morning-glory seeds are (a) lysergicacid amide (= "ergine"), and (b) lysergic acidhydroxyethylamide, and these are also the main alkaloids in ergotgrowing on the wild grass Paspalum distichum L. This grassgrows commonly all around the Mediterranean basin and is ofteninfected with Claviceps paspali. F. Arcamone et al (3)were the first to discover these alkaloids in ergot of P.distichum, in 1960. Within the kinds of ergot produced by the various species ofthe genus Claviceps and its many hosts, cereals and wildgrasses, types of ergot do exist that contain hallucinogenicalkaloids, the same alkaloids as in the Mexican hallucinogenicmorning-glories. These alkaloids, mainly lysergic acid amide,lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, and ergonovine, are soluble inwater, in contrast to the non-hallucinogenic medicinally usefulalkaloids of the ergotamine and ergotoxine type. With thetechniques and equipment available in antiquity it was thereforeeasy to prepare an hallucinogenic extract from suitable kinds ofergot. What suitable kinds of ergot were accessible to the ancientGreeks? No rye grew there, but wheat and barley did and Clavicepspurpurea flourishes on both. We analyzed ergot of wheat andergot of barley in our laboratory and they were found to containbasically the same alkaloids as ergot of rye, viz alkaloids ofthe ergotamine and ergotoxine group, ergonovine, and sometimesalso traces of lysergic acid amide. As I said before, ergonovineand lysergic acid amide, both psychoactive, are soluble in waterwhereas the other alkaloids are not. As we all know, ergotdiffers in its chemical constituents according to its host grassand according to geography. We have no way to tell what thechemistry was of the ergot of barley or wheat raised on theRarian plain in the 2nd millennium B. C. But it is certainly notpulling a long bow to assume that the barley grown there was hostto an ergot containing, perhaps among others, the solublehallucinogenic alkaloids. The famous Rarian plain was adjacent toEleusis. Indeed this may well have led to the choice of Eleusisfor Demeter's temple, and for the growth of the cluster ofpowerful myths surrounding them and Triptolemus that still exerttheir spell on us today. The separation of the hallucinogenic agents by simple watersolution from the non- soluble ergotamine and ergotoxinealkaloids was well within the range of possibilities open toEarly Man in Greece. An easier method still would have been tohave recourse to some kind of ergot like that growing on thegrass Paspalum distichum, which contains only alkaloidsthat are hallucinogenic and which could even have been useddirectly in powder form. As I said before, P. distichumgrows everywhere around the Mediterranean basin. During the manycenturies when the Eleusinian Mysteries were thriving and holdingthe antique Greek world enthralled, may not the hierophants ofEleusis have been broadening their knowledge and improving theirskills? For the Greek world as for us, the Mysteries are linkedto Demeter and Kore, and they and Triptolemus are the famedmythical progenitors of cultivated wheat and barley. But in thecourse of time the hierophants could easily have discovered Clavicepspaspali growing on the grass Paspalum distichum. Herethey would be able to get their hallucinogen direct, straight andpure. But I mention this only as a possibility or a likelihood,and not because we need P. distichum to answer Wasson'squestion. Finally we must also discuss an ergot parasitical to a wildgrass called in scientific nomenclature Lolium temulentumL. In English this is most widely known as darnel or cockle or(in the Bible) tares, a weed that plagues grain crops. It issometimes called "wild rye grass", an unfortunate namebecause wild rye has nothing to do with rye: the rye of"wild rye grass" is of utterly different etymology. Inclassic Greek darnel was aira and in classic Latin was lolium.Its name in French is ivraie and in German Taumellolch,both names pointing to a belief in its psychotropic activity inthe folk knowledge of the traditional European herbalists. Acitation for ivraie in A. D. 1236 has been found, and it must goback much further than that. Analysis of Lolium temulentum in my laboratory and anextended botanical, chemical, and pharmacological investigationby I. Katz (4) showed that the plant itself contains no alkaloidsnor does it possess any pharmacological activity. But the Loliumspecies (L. temulentum and L. perenne) arenotoriously prey to the Claviceps fungus. The psychotropicreputation of darnel must therefore be attributed to itsparasitic infection by ergot. Samples of ergot grown on L.temulentum and L.perenne collected in Germany, France, andSwitzerland showed large variation in their alkaloidalcomposition. Some contained substantial amounts of ergonovinetogether with alkaloids of the ergotamine and ergotoxine group.(5) A species of ergot growing on darnel may have existed inancient Greece that contained mainly hallucinogenic alkaloids ofergot such as we have found in ergot of Paspalum. In conclusion I now answer Wasson's question. The answer isyes, Early Man in ancient Greece could have arrived at anhallucinogen from ergot. He might have done this from ergotgrowing on wheat or barley. An easier way would have been to usethe ergot growing on the common wild grass Paspalum. This isbased on the assumption that the herbalists of ancient Greecewere as intelligent and resourceful as the herbalists ofpre-Conquest Mexico. ALBERT HOFMANN (1).

His attempts to repay her favors in some special waywere continually frustrated by the madam, who insisted uponconfiscating all private gifts. To give the girl something thatwould be hers alone, he hit upon the idea of offering her animmaterial, and thereby inalienable, benefit: he would pay theexpenses for her introduction into the blessed community of thosewho had witnessed the secret religious ceremony practiced at thevillage of Eleusis. That sight was generally considered theculminating experience of a lifetime. And so she was allowed totravel to Athens, together with the madam and a younger girl fromthe brothel. The lover lodged them all with a friend while theyprepared themselves by the preliminary rites. The full sequencewould require more than half a year's residence in Athens. Thenat last, amidst the throng of thousands who each autumn for thefirst and only time made the pilgrimage, they too walked theSacred Road, crossing the narrow bridge that still today can beseen, now submerged in the brackish waters of the swamp that oncedivided Athens from the territory of its neighboring village,some fourteen miles distant, a region sacred for its specialaffinity with the realm of departed spirits, who were thought toinsure the fertility of the adjacent plain of grain. Theprocession of pilgrims symbolically passed the frontier betweenworlds, a momentous journey characterized by its difficulty, forthe bridge was expressly constructed too narrow for vehiculartraffic and ahead, just as they arrived at the village itself, itwas traditional that they would be obscenely insulted by maskedmen, who lined the bridge across the final boundary of water. Each year new candidates for initiation would walk thatSacred Road, people of all classes, emperors and prostitutes,slaves and freemen, an annual celebration that was to last forupwards of a millennium and a half, until the pagan religionfinally succumbed to the intense hatred and rivalry of a newersect, the recently legitimized Christians in the fourth centuryof our era. The only requirement, beyond a knowledge of the Greeklanguage, was the price of the sacrificial pig and the fees ofthe various priests and guides, a little more than a month'swages, plus the expense of the stay in Athens. Every step of the way recalled some aspect of an ancient myththat told how the Earth Mother, the goddess Demeter, had lost heronly daughter, the maiden Persephone, abducted as she gatheredflowers by her bridegroom, who was Hades or the lord of death.The pilgrims called upon Iakchos as they walked. It was he whowas thought to lead them on their way: through him, they wouldsummon back the queen Persephone into the realm of the living.When at last they arrived at Eleusis, they danced far into thenight beside the well where originally the mother had mourned forher lost Persephone. As they danced in honor of those sacred twogoddesses and of their mysterious consort Dionysus, the god ofinebriants, the stars and the moon and the daughters of Oceanwould seem to join in their exultation. Then they passed throughthe gates of the fortress walls, beyond which, shielded fromprofane view, was enacted the great Mystery of Eleusis. It was called a mystery because no one, under pain of death,could reveal what happened within the sanctuary. My colleaguesand I, working from hints in numerous sources, have ventured togo beyond that forbidden gate. Ancient writers unanimously indicate that something was seenin the great telesterion or initiation hall within thesanctuary. To say so much was not prohibited. The experience wasa vision whereby the pilgrim became someone who saw, an epoptes.The hall, however, as can now be reconstructed fromarchaeological remains, was totally unsuited for theatricalperformances; nor do the epigraphically extant account books forthe sanctuary record any expenditures for actors or stageapparatus. What was witnessed there was no play by actors, but phasmata,ghostly apparitions, in particular, the spirit of Persephoneherself, returned from the dead with her new- born son, conceivedin the land of death. The Greeks were sophisticated about dramaand it is highly unlikely that they could have been duped by somekind of theatrical trick, especially since it is people asintelligent as the poet Pindar and the tragedian Sophocles whohave testified to the overwhelming value of what was seen atEleusis. There were physical symptoms, moreover, that accompanied thevision: fear and a trembling in the limbs, vertigo, nausea, and acold sweat. Then there came the vision, a sight amidst an aura ofbrilliant light that suddenly flickered through the darkenedchamber. Eyes had never before seen the like, and apart from theformal prohibition against telling of what had happened, theexperience itself was incommunicable, for there are no wordsadequate to the task. Even a poet could only say that he had seenthe beginning and the end of life and known that they were one,something given by god. The division between earth and sky meltedinto a pillar of light. These are the symptomatic reactions not to a drama orceremony, but to a mystical vision; and since the sight could beoffered to thousands of initiates each year dependably uponschedule, it seems obvious that an hallucinogen must have inducedit. We are confirmed in this conclusion by two furtherobservations: a special potion, as we know, was drunk prior tothe visual experience; and secondly, a notorious scandal wasuncovered in the classical age, when it was discovered thatnumerous aristocratic Athenians had begun celebrating the Mysteryat home with groups of drunken guests at dinner parties. To identify the Eleusinian drug, we must first find thepattern of meaning that underlies the Mystery. The sacred myththat narrates the events involved in the founding of the Mysteryis recorded in the so-called Homeric hymn to Demeter, ananonymous poem dating from the seventh century B. C., sevencenturies later than the probable date of the first performanceof the ceremony. In it we are told how the goddess Persephone wasabducted by her bridegroom Hades to the realm of the dead whenshe picked a special hundred-headed narkissos whilegathering flowers with the daughters of Ocean in a place calledNysa. All Greek words ending in -issos derive from thelanguage spoken by the agrarian cultures dwelling in the Greeklands before the coming of the migrating Indo-European Greeks.The Greeks themselves, however, thought that the narkissoswas so-named because of its narcotic properties, obviouslybecause that was the essential nature or symbolism ofPersephone's flower. The marital abduction or seizure of maidenswhile gathering flowers is, moreover, a common theme in Greekmyths and Plato records a rationalized version of such stories inwhich the companion of the seized maiden is named Pharmaceia or,as the name means, the "use of drugs". The particularmyth that Plato is rationalizing is in fact one that traced thedescent of the priesthood at Eleusis. There can be no doubt thatPersephone's abduction was a drug-induced seizure. That fact has never been noticed by Classicists, despite itsabsolute expectability in terms of what we know about thereligions of the agrarian peoples who preceded the Greeks. Thosereligions centered upon the female's procreativity and thecyclical rebirth and death of both plants and mankind. She wasthe Great Mother and the entire world was her Child. Theessential event in those religions was the Sacred Marriage, inwhich the priestess periodically communed with the realm ofspirits within the earth to renew the agricultural year and thecivilized life that grew upon the earth. Her male consort was avegetative spirit, both her son who grew from the earth and themate who would abduct her to the fecundating other realm as hepossessed her upon his death. When the roving Indo-Europeanssettled in the Greek lands, their immortal Father God of the sky,who was Zeus, became assimilated to the pattern of the dying andreborn vegetative consort of the Great Mother. There areindications of this assimilation in the traditions about the Zeuswho was born and died in Crete. Furthermore, archaeologicalremains from the Minoan-Mycenaean period of Greek culturefrequently depict visionary experience encountered by womenengaged in rituals involving flowers. The priestesses orgoddesses themselves occur as idols decorated with vegetativemotifs, accompanied by their serpent consort or crowned with adiadem of opium capsules. Moreover, the myths that narrate thefounding of the various Mycenean citadels show, as we mightexpect, recurrent variations upon the Sacred Marriage enactedbetween the immigrant founder and the autochthonous female inecstatic contexts. Most interesting among these are thetraditions about Mykenai (Mycenae) itself, for it was said tohave been founded when the female of that place lost her head tothe male of the new dynasty, who had picked a mushroom. Theetymology of Mykenai, which was recognized in antiquity but hasbeen repeatedly rejected by modern scholars, is correctly derivedfrom Mykene, the bride of the mykes or mushroom. Fungoidmanifestations of the vegetative consort in the Sacred Marriagecan also be detected in the symbolism of the founding fathers atother Mycenaean sites, perhaps because that particular wave ofimmigrants brought knowledge of the wild and untameable mushroomwith them on their movement south into the Greek lands. At Athensin the classical period, the ancient Sacred Marriage was stillcelebrated annually by the wife of the sacral head of state: inthe month of February, she would unite with the god Dionysus. It was as Dionysus that the Zeus who had been assimilated asconsort to the Mother Goddess survived into the classical period.His name designates him as the Zeus of Nysa, for Dios is a formof the word Zeus. Nysa was not only, as we have seen, the placewhere Persephone was abducted, but also the name for wherever wasenacted that same nuptial encounter involving the passion ofDionysus" birth and death. When he possessed his womendevotees, the maenads or bacchants, he was synonymous with Hades,the lord of death and bridegroom to the goddess Persephone. Themaenads, like Persephone, also gathered flowers. We know thisbecause their emblem was the thyrsos, a fennel stalkstuffed with ivy leaves; such hollow stalks were customarily usedby herb gatherers as receptacles for their cuttings, and the ivythat was stuffed into the maenads" stalks was sacred toDionysus and reputed to be a psychotropic plant. Dionysus, however, could possess his ecstatic brides throughthe agency of other plants as well, for he was the vegetativeconsort residing in all manner of inebriants, includingapparently certain of the fungi. The stipe, by analogy to themaenads" emblem, was also called a thyrsos, with themushroom's cap substituted for the psychotropic herbs. Dionysushimself was born prematurely in the mystical seventh month duringa winter snowfall when his celestial father struck his earthbride Semele at Thebes with a bolt of lightning; in the samemanner mushrooms were thought to be engendered wherever lightningstruck the earth. The father of Dionysus was another Dionysus, aswould be expected in a Sacred Marriage, for the child born at thetime of the earth's renewal is identical with the ingestedconsort who will reunite his mother-bride with the awesome netherrealm from which life must forever be reborn. Thus notsurprisingly we are told that Semele also conceived Dionysus whenshe drank a potion compounded of her own son's heart. So too wasDionysus like his father also called the thunderer, for despitethe gentleness of his infancy and his sometimes effeminateappearance, he could suddenly metamorphose into the virulence ofhis full manhood, in which form he was a bull, rending the earth,as at his birth, announced by a bellowing, the mykema thatsignified the presence of the mykes or mushroom. Hissymbol was the phallos itself, by a common metaphor also calledthe mykes. It was with the vine, however, and its fermented juice thatDionysus was chiefly associated. Mushrooms themselves in factwere considered a fermentation of the earth, a perfect symbol ofrebirth from the cold realm of putrefaction that was the mouldyother world. A similar process was sensed in the frothing turmoilwhereby the fungal yeast converted grapes into wine. In wine thegod had found his greatest blessing for mankind; here hisuntameable, wild nature had succumbed to domestication. Hehimself was said to have first discovered the properties of thisplant that had grown from the spilled blood of the gods when henoticed a serpent drinking its toxin from the fruit, for serpentswere thought to derive their poisons from the herbs they ate,just as conversely it was said that serpents could transfer theirtoxins to plants in their vicinity. Dionysus taught man the wayto calm this gift's violent nature by diluting it with water. Andcustomarily it was mixed with water that the Greeks drank theirwines. This custom of diluting wine deserves our attention since theGreeks did not know the art of distillation and hence thealcoholic content of their wines could not have exceeded aboutfourteen per cent, at which concentration the alcohol fromnatural fermentation becomes fatal to the fungus that producedit, thereby terminating the process. Simple evaporation withoutdistillation could not increase the alcoholic content sincealcohol, which has a lower boiling point than water, will merelyescape to the air, leaving the final product weaker instead ofmore concentrated. Alcohol in fact was never isolated as thetoxin in wine and there is no word for it in ancient Greek. Hencethe dilution of wine, usually with at least three parts of water,could be expected to produce a drink of slight inebriatingproperties. That, however, was not the case. The word for drunkenness inGreek designates a state of raving madness. We hear of some winesso strong that they could be diluted with twenty parts of waterand that required at least eight parts water to be drunk safely,for, according to report, the drinking of certain wines straightactually caused permanent brain damage and in some cases evendeath. Just three small cups of diluted wine were enough in factto bring the drinker to the threshold of madness. Obviously thealcohol could not have been the cause of these extreme reactions.We can also document the fact that different wines were capableof inducing different physical symptoms, ranging from slumber toinsomnia and hallucinations. The solution to this apparent contradiction is simply thatancient wine, like the wine of most early peoples, did notcontain alcohol as its sole inebriant but was ordinarily avariable infusion of herbal toxins in a vinous liquid. Unguents,spices, and herbs, all with recognized psychotropic properties,could be added to the wine at the ceremony of its dilution withwater. A description of such a ceremony occurs in Homer's Odyssey,where Helen prepares a special wine by adding the euphoric nepenthesto the wine that she serves her husband and his guest. The factis that the Greeks had devised a spectrum of ingredients fortheir drinks, each with is own properties. Thus the wine of Dionysus was the principle medium wherebythe classical Greeks continued to partake of the ancient ecstasyresident in all the vegetative forms that were the Earth's child.In social situations, the drinking was regulated by a leader, whodetermined the degree of inebriation that he would impose uponthe revelers as they ceremonially drank a measured sequence oftoasts. At sacral events, the wine would be more potent and theexpress purpose of the drinking was to induce that deeperdrunkenness in which the presence of the deity could be felt. The herbal inebriants that figured in these Dionysian ritesof drinking required magical procedures when the herbs weregathered. As wild beings whose spirits were akin to theirparticular guardian animals, the plants were the objects of ahunt. And the ecstatic rapture they might induce in religiouscontexts inevitably identified them as sexual forces. Thus the female devotees of the god Dionysus appropriatelybore the thyrsos as their emblem as they roamed the wintermountainsides in search of the so-called vine that grew suddenlywith earth-rending thunder and the bellowing of bulls amidsttheir night-long dancing; that beloved child, the age-old serpentconsort, was the object of their hunt, who was suckled, then likea beast torn to pieces and eaten raw; his own mothers, as wasoften claimed, were guilty of cannibalism eating his flesh, forlike mothers the women would have brought the drug into being,harvesting and compounding it with the help of the god'sso-called nurses, in whose loving care he would grow to manhood,eventually to possess them as his brides. Such ceremonies enactedthe sacred nuptials of the city's women, who thereby entered theawesome alliance with the nether lord, upon whose realm dependedthe growth of all this world's fertility of plants and man. Persephone's abduction at Nysa was prototypic of that firstnuptial between the realms, the primal experience of death. Inthe hunting place called Agrai, in the month of February, whichwas called the time of flowers, the candidates for the cominginitiation at Eleusis experienced in some way the death ofPersephone through the ritual mimeses of those Dionysian events.That occurrence was termed the Lesser Mystery and it wasconsidered a preliminary for the vision of the Greater Mysterythat would take place at the time of the autumn sowing inSeptember. The Greater Mystery was the complement of the Lesser, for itcentered upon redemption instead of death, the triumphant returnof Persephone from Hades with the infant son she had conceivedduring her sojourn in communion with the spiritual realm. TheHomeric hymn, after its account of Persephone's fatal nuptialencounter, goes on to tell how Demeter came to establish theGreater Mystery. In grief for her lost daughter, she went toEleusis. Her journey there is a sympathetic imitation ofPersephone's entrance into the citadel of Hades, for Eleusis wasa simulacrum of the other word, where Demeter too wouldexperience the ominous chthonic phase of her womanhood, not assacred queen to the lord of death, but as witch and wet-nurse inhis house, for when Persephone progresses beyond maidenhood, hermother must make way, relinquishing her former role and moving onto the third stage, when a woman's aging womb brings her onceagain into proximity with the powers of death. These chthonic orearth-oriented phases of womanhood were symbolized in the goddessHecate, whose triform body expressed the female's totality asbride, wife, and aged nurse in Hades" realm. At Eleusis, Demeter first attempts to assuage her grief bynegating the possibility of the world of death to which she haslost her daughter. She does this by nourishing the royal princewith immortality. His mother, however, objects, for she cannotunderstand or accept a system that would inevitably alienate theson from his own mother's realm as irredeemably as Persephonefrom Demeter. Demeter again attempts a solution, this time an eternity ofdeath, in which she and the maiden would stay forever in theirchthonic phase. She causes a plague of sterility so that no lifecan emerge from the earth. This solution, however, leaves no rolefor the immortal deities of the sky, whose delicate balance withthe forces of the earth is dependent upon the continuing worshipof mortal men, who share with them the fruits of life. The final solution is to heal the universe into which deathhas now intruded by admitting also the possibility of return intolife. Rebirth from death was the secret of Eleusis. In Hades,Persephone, like the earth itself, takes seed into her body andthereby eternally comes back to her ecstatic mother with her newson, only to die as eternally in his fecundating embrace. Thesign of the redemption was an ear of barley, the risen grain,that following the Mystery would be committed once again to thecold earth in the sowing of the sacred plain adjacent to Eleusis. This was the final mediation that Demeter taught to a secondof the royal princes in the citadel of Eleusis. His name wasTriptolemus, the trifold warrior, and he becomes the apostle ofthe new faith, traveling throughout the world on a serpentchariot spreading the gospel of the cultivation of grain. Hisexact identity was part of the secret of the Mystery, for thevarious traditions about his parentage suggest that the initiateslearned that, like the grain that was his emblem, he was actuallythe son of the trifold females who were the queens in the houseof the lord of death. He was, therefore, another form ofDionysus, who in a similar fashion also was an apostle, travelingin the same manner of cart on his journey teaching man thecultivation of the vine. The pattern indicated in theseEleusinian apostleships clearly signifies the transition fromwild botanic growth to the arts of cultivation upon whichcivilized life must depend. In the various Eleusinian mythical traditions, several othermale figures symbolize a similar transmutation of the wild horrorand loss that is death into the ravishingly handsome young manwho is born from Hades" realm in pledge of the comingredemption. In one such tradition, he is Iakchos (Iacchus), thejoyous Dionysian male who led the initiates toward their visionof salvation; in another, Eubuleus, the serene personification ofthe cosmological plan wherein the celestial immortalscollaborated with the forces of death to show humankind itsproper role; in a third, Zagreus, the enigmatic hunting companionof his ecstatic brides. The fourth and most perfect of thesetransmuted figures is Ploutos, the personification of the wealththat stems from the fertility of man and field. The initiatecould expect that this beneficent representative of death wouldthereafter become welcome in his house as his constant guest,joined by ties of friendship. This Ploutos was originally thevegetative son of Demeter in her more ancient days as GreatMother on Crete, where she conceived him in a thrice plowed fieldwhen she united with her intoxicating mate whose name was Iasion,which means "the man of the drug". Triptolemus, however, was the paramount transmutation,Demeter's special response to the problem of death. It was hissacred barley, solemnly grown in the Rarian plain and threshed onhis floor, that was the principle ingredient in the potion drunkby the initiates in preparation for the culminating vision. Theformula for that potion is recorded in the Homeric hymn. Inaddition to the barley, it contained water and a fragrant mintcalled blechon. The mint initially would seem the most likelycandidate for the psychoactive agent in the potion, except thatall our evidence about this particular mint indicates that it wasunsuitable, being neither sufficiently psychotropic to warrantthe danger of profane usage nor appropriately revered as thesecret drug. Rather, it was openly despised as a sign of theillicit union of man and woman in lustful concubinage without thesacrament of marriage. To just such an unsanctified abductionDemeter had lost her daughter at Nysa and accordingly we are toldthat the mother vented her displeasure by changing the prostituteof Hades into mint, thereupon grinding and bruising her botanicbody. The final Eleusinian solution, on the other hand, willreconcile the mother to the daughter's loss throughlegitimatizing the nuptial abduction in the rite of matrimony,whereby an heir can accede to the dynastic house. Barley and notmint is the revelation at Eleusis, and it is to it that we mustlook for the sacred drug. With the cultivation of grain, man had left his wild, nomadicways and settled in cities, giving to the earth in order toreceive back its harvest. All civilized institutions derived fromthis delicate accord struck with the dark, cold forces of death.Grain itself was thought to be a hybrid, carefully evolved frommore primitive grasses. If not tended with proper care, it couldbe expected to revert to its worthless, inedible avatar. Thatprimitive sibling to grain was thought to be the plant called airain Greek, Lolium temulentum in botanical nomenclature, orcommonly in English "wild ryes, darned cockle, ivray, orfinally "tares" in the Bible. This weed is usuallyinfested with a fungoid growth, Claviceps purpurea, ergotor rust, a reddening corruption to which barley was thought to beparticularly susceptible. Aira, therefore, doublyendangered the cultivated staff of life, first as the renascentprimordial grass and secondly as the host for the encroachingergot infection. The revertive tendency of the infected grain,furthermore, was all too obvious, for when the sclerotia fell tothe ground there grew from them not grain but tiny purplemushrooms, the fruiting bodies of the ergot fungus, clearly areturn to the species of the unregenerate, wild Dionysianabductor. Unlike the seedless mushroom, however, ergot would haveseemed akin to the kernels of grain that were its host. As wellas grain, therefore, it too was Demeter's plant, for she couldwear its distinctive color as her robe or on her feet or be namedwith its epithet, Erysibe. The hallucinogenic properties ofClaviceps were recognized in antiquity, and thus we may surmisethat the parallel apostleships of the barley and the vine wouldhave signified analogous transmutations wherein the chthonicspirits submitted to cultivation. Wine, however, wasDionysus" realm, the liquid that gave sleep like death andforgetfulness, whereas Demeter was the earth, dry with theharvest upon which man fed to live. Grain was her sacrament. Uponfirst coming to Eleusis, Demeter had refused the cup of wine andthe initiates thereafter imitated her abstention in deference tothe superior symbolism of the potion of barley. Clearly ergot of barley is the likely psychotropic ingredientin the Eleusinian potion. Its seeming symbiotic relationship tothe barley signified an appropriate expropriation andtransmutation of the Dionysian spirit to which the grain,Demeter's daughter, was lost in the nuptial embrace with earth.Grain and ergot together, moreover, were joined in a bisexualunion as siblings, bearing at the time of the maiden's lossalready the potential for her own return and for the birth of thephalloid son that would grow from her body. A similarhermaphroditism occurs in the mythical traditions about thegrotesquely fertile woman whose obscene jests were said to havecheered Demeter from her grief just before she drank the potion. This solution to the Mystery of Eleusis is made still moreprobable by a papyrus fragment that was brought to my attentionby our translator of the Homeric hymn. The fragment preserves aportion of the Demes, a comedy by Eupolis written shortlyafter the scandal of the profanation of the Mystery in the fifthcentury B. C. It confirms that the profanation did indeed entailthe drinking of the sacred kykeon and suggests that ouridentification of the drug it contained is correct. In thecomedy, an informer explains to a judge how he had come uponsomeone who had obviously been drinking the potion since he hadbarley groats on his moustache. The accused had bribed theinformer to say that it was simply porridge and not the potionthat he had drunk. By a possible pun, the comedian may evenindicate that the incriminating "crumbs of barley" were"purples of barley". Thus we may now venture past the forbidden gates andreconstruct the scene within the great initiation hall atEleusis. The preparation of the potion was the central event.With elaborate pageantry, the hierophant, the priest who tracedhis descent back to the first performance of the Mystery, removedthe sclerotia of ergot from the free-standing room constructedinside the telesterion over the remains of the originaltemple that had stood there in Mycenaean times. As he performedthe service, he intoned ancient chants in a falsetto voice, forhis role in the Mystery was asexual, a male who had sacrificedhis gender to the Great Goddess. He conveyed the grain inchalices to the priestesses, who then danced throughout the hall,balancing the vessels and lamps upon their heads. The grain wasnext mixed with mint and water in urns, from which the sacredpotion was then ladled into the special cups for the initiates todrink their share. Finally, in acknowledgment of their readiness,they all chanted that they had drunk the potion and had handledthe secret objects that had come with them on the Sacred Road insealed baskets. Then, seated on the tiers of steps that lined thewalls of the cavernous hall, in darkness they waited. From thepotion they gradually entered into ecstasy. You must rememberthat this potion --- an hallucinogen --- under the right set andsetting, disturbs man's inner ear and trips astonishingventriloquistic effects. We can rest assured that thehierophants, with generations of experience, knew all the secretsof set and setting. I am sure that there was music, probably bothvocal and instrumental, not loud but with authority, coming fromhither and yon, now from the depths of the earth, now fromoutside, now a mere whisper infiltrating the ear, flitting fromplace to place unaccountably. The hierophants may well have knownthe art of releasing into the air various perfumes in succession,and they must have contrived the music for a crescendo ofexpectation, until suddenly the inner chamber was flung open andspirits of light entered the room, subdued lights I think, notblinding, and among them the spirit of Persephone with hernew-born son just returned from Hades. She would arrive just asthe hierophant raised his voice in ancient measures reserved forthe Mystery: "The Terrible Queen has given birth to her son,the Terrible One". This divine birth of the Lord of theNether World was accompanied by the bellowing roar of a gong-like instrument that outdid, for the ecstatic audience, themightiest thunderclap, coming from the bowels of the earth. Some Christian bishops, in the last days of the Mystery,thought they had discovered and could reveal the secret ofEleusis. One said that in this pagan rite there was materializeda stalk of barley. How true according to his limited lights, yethow utterly false. The Bishop had not known the night of nightsat Eleusis. He was like one who has not known LSD or themushrooms of Mexico or the morning-glory seeds. For close on totwo thousand years a few of the ancient Greeks passed each yearthrough the portals of Eleusis. There they celebrated the divinegift to mankind of the cultivated grain and they were alsoinitiated into the awe some powers of the nether world throughthe purple dark of the grain's sibling that Dr Hofmann has onceagain made accessible to our generation. The myths of Demeter andPersephone and all their company fit our explanation in everyrespect. Nothing in any of them is incompatible with our thesis. Until yesterday we knew of Eleusis only what little a few ofthe initiates told us but the spell of their words had heldgenerations of mankind enthralled. Now, thanks to Dr Hofmann andGordon Wasson, those of us who have experienced the superiorhallucinogens may join the fellowship of the ancient initiates ina lasting bond of friendship, a friendship born of a sharedexperience of a reality deeper far than we had known before.

Its modern analogue is perhapsthe Salvation Army." We trust that our own comparisons willbe less bizarre than his. In our generation we enjoy theadvantage of having rediscovered the hallucinogenic experience.Moreover, the value of interdisciplinary collaboration is that itgives us access to knowledge otherwise apt to be beyond the reachof scholars. Our joint effort has yielded a radical answer to ourproblem: it sets the stage for much reexamination of traditionalopinions about the classical Greeks and their tragic literaturein celebration of the god Dionysus. The ancient testimony about Eleusis is unanimous andunambiguous. Eleusis was the supreme experience in an initiate'slife. It was both physical and mystical: trembling, vertigo, coldsweat, and then a sight that made all previous seeing seem likeblindness, a sense of awe and wonder at a brilliance that causeda profound silence since what had just been seen and felt couldnever be communicated: words are unequal to the task. Thosesymptoms are unmistakably the experience induced by anhallucinogen. To reach that conclusion, we have only to show thatthe rational Greeks, and indeed some of the most famous andintelligent amongst them, could experience and enter fully intosuch irrationality. Eleusis was different from the convivial inebriation offriends at a symposion or the drunken komos revelat the festivals of drama. Eleusis was something for which eventhe maenadic ecstasy of the mountain women was only partialpreparation. In their various ways, other Greek cults too enactedaspects of the ancient communion practiced between gods and men,between the living and the dead, but it was at Eleusis alone thatthe experience occurred with overwhelming finality: here alonewas the grand design fulfilled of the maiden resurrected with herson conceived in death, and of the ear of barley that like herhad sprouted beneath the earth. By this resurrection wasvalidated the continuance of all that a Greek held most dear, thecivilized way of life that, beyond each city's constitution, wasthe Greek heritage, evolved out of aboriginal primitivism just asall life too came from the beneficent accord with the lord ofdeath. Here indeed is a rich full-bodied myth, filled withcontradictions like all the myths of an unlettered age, onesaying this and another saying that and a third saying somethingelse, but somehow in the end harmonizing into one whole, a myththat for the Greeks explained the beginning and the end ofthings. Months of learning and rituals preceded the revelation on theMystery night, each action programming in further detail themeaning and substance, the full ramifications of the vision thatlay ahead. At last the initiates would sit on the steps in theinitiation hall. It was all done now except for the finale. Theyhad learned the secret version of the sacred myth, they hadbathed in the sea, abstained from various tabu foods and drinks,sacrificed a pig, taken the long walk along the Sacred Way fromAthens, and made the perilous crossing of the final division ofwater before their arrival at the city of their Eleusinian hosts.Outside the sanctuary walls, there was the night- long dancebeside the Maiden's Well on the very ground that the goddess hadvisited. Then there was the fast and the momentous entrance intothe forbidden territory past the cave that was an entrance toHades and the rock where Demeter had sat in grief. In theinitiation hall, there was the final ceremonial dance of thepriestesses carrying the chalice of grain upon their heads asthey mixed and distributed the sacred potion: fragrant blechon,the despised herb associated with the illicit nature of theabduction, immersed in water to which was added a sprinkling offlour from barley grown in the Rarian plain. The barley'spotential as the foodstuff for mankind depended upon keeping atbay the encroachment of the reddening corruption that would drawit back to its worthless avatar, the rust-infested weed. Like theblechon, the weed too was thus associated with primitivismand the ways of life before the institutions of society broughtman to a higher mode of existence. Of these two plants theinitiates drank and then paused expectant for redemption whilethe hierophant chanted the ancient words. Then, suddenly, therewas light and the boundaries on this world burst their bounds asspiritual presences were felt in their midst and the hall wasflooded with glowing mystery. From beginning to end here there was a reenactment of asacred drama in which the initiates as well as the officiants hadtheir role to play, until at last they experienced as actors theineffable, all of their senses and emotions being shot throughwith what would thereafter be forever the unspeakable. As the initiates passed through the lengthy proceedings, theywere admitted to many secrets, but the hierophants may well havewithheld from them the Secret of Secrets: the sacred water of thepotion had already soaked up in the right dosage from theimmersed ergot what it contained of ergine and ergonovine, as wecall them today. But the hierophants were certainly, through thecenturies, seeking ways to improve their technique, theirformulae. In the course of those two millennia may they not havediscovered a kind of ergot that contains solely thehallucinogenic alkaloids such as has been found in modern timesin ergot of Paspalum distichum? Indeed herbalists otherthan the hierophantic families may have shared in this discoveryand it may have been their knowledge that prompted the rash ofprofanations in B. C. 415. The inside story of those events willnever be known but that there was a story to tell is certain. In unlettered cultures the knowledge of the herbalist --- theknowledge of the properties of plants and their use --- waseverywhere a body of secret lore passed on by word of mouth fromherbalist to apprentice and sometimes from one herbalist toanother. The apprenticeship took years before one practiced onone's own, and one never stopped learning. There were questionsof dosage, of side effects, of proper plant ingredients thatbecame poisons when taken to excess. In Mexico Bernardino deSahagun and Francisco Hernandez were gifted Spaniards and theyspent endless effort and time to take down from the Indians thevirtues of various Mexican plants. But they were Europeans whoknew not the American plant world, and in their European worldthey were certainly not what we would call botanists orherbalists. Their intentions were good but their ignorance wascomplete. What they have to tell us about the hallucinogens ischildish. They could have tried the hallucinogens but elected notto do so, spurned the chance. What a different story they wouldhave told us if they had lived for a number of years asapprentices of the Indian sabios. In the Homeric hymn to Demeter, on arriving at Eleusis, tiredand disconsolate over the loss of her daughter Persephone,Demeter was offered a drink of wine, which she declined. Sinceevery act in this narrative had mythic meaning, it seems thatdrinking the alcoholic beverage did not go with the drinking ofthe divine potion called kykeon. The two kinds of inebriationwere incompatible. In Mexico those who will take the mushroomsknow that they must refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages forfour days before the velada, as the mushroom celebrationis called. Alcoholic inebriation would profane, would defile, thedivine draught, alike in Mexico and Greece. The Eleusinian Mysteries were in the exclusive hands of theEumolpus and Kerykes families. For close to two thousand years,these hierophants governed with autocratic authority the rites atEleusis. By contrast, in the sacred mushroom country of Mexicoevery village has its sabios ("wisemen") who arethe custodians of the rite. (In some remote Mixe villages theindividual families take the mushrooms when they feel the need,without the guidance of a sabio. Whether this informal practicein the Mixe country marks a breakdown in the rite or the survivalof an earlier archaic procedure, we do not know.) In Greece the"initiate" took the potion only once in his life, andthus he could not compare successive experiencies. In Mexico onemay consult the mushroom whenever a grave family problem presentsitself. Some Indians choose never to take the mushroom, othersonly once, yet others intermittently. The newcomer to theexperience is constantly warned that ingesting the hallucinogenis in the highest degree delicado, "delicate"with a connotation of grave danger. At Eleusis and in Mexico certain items of food wereproscribed for some time before the big night. It is impossibleto compare the dietary exclusions, so different are the foods,except that in both cases eggs are tabu. Fasting was practiced inGreece and also in Mexico, from the morning throughout the day:in both cases one faced the night on an empty stomach. In Mexicobefore the Conquest it was the practice in aristocratic circlesto drink nourishing chocolate spiked with the inebriatingmushrooms, in this way breaking the fast as the events of thenight were launched on their course. Owing to the silenceenjoined on everyone who had taken part in the Mystery, there arescarcely any hints as to what happened in the writers of theflourishing period of Eleusis, but in the early centuries of theChristian era, with Eleusis breaking down, we discover a fewreferences, obscure, inhibited, that may permit us some uncertainglimpses. We find mention of a collation served to the initiateswhen a large cake called the pelanos, made of barley andwheat harvested in the adjacent sacred Rarian plain, was brokeninto pieces and the portions served to all. In the sources onehears of a bond of alliance and friendship that sprang up amongthe initiates, and some have suggested that this sprang from thecollation they had shared together. It is not incompatible withthe Greek texts to suppose that the collation paralleled thebreaking of the fast in Mexico, the pelanos taking theplace of the chocolate. But surely the bond of alliance andfriendship had nothing to do with the collation: nothing sojejune would have sufficed. The overwhelming effect of the nightunder the influence of an hallucinogen gives natural birth to afeeling of shared supernatural experience never to be forgotten,a feeling of cofradia, of brotherhood. Two of us haveknown this personally in Mexico: those who pass through a velada,in the right set and setting, live through an awesome experience,and feel welling up within them a tie that unites them with theircompanions of that night of nights that will last for as long asthey live. Here we think is the bond of alliance and friendshipof which the Greek sources speak obscurely. Then there is the matter of secrecy. In Mexico nothing hadbeen heard of the sacred mushrooms in sophisticated circles sincethe early friars mentioned them briefly in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries. It has been said that the mushrooms were a'secret" of the Indians living in the highlands of southernMexico. Our own little group flushed them out into the open. Butwe think this 'secret" was never really a secret. In theIndian communities everyone knew about them and also about themorning-glory seeds. Every villager could, if he wished, learnthe art of recognizing the sacred mushrooms and many did so.There was a small trade in the mushrooms, supplying the demandamong the natives who had moved to the cities and who stillwished to "consult" them. The Church had originallyopposed them and the Holy Office of the Inquisition in thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries tried to stamp out the nativeuse of them by vigorous persecutions. They failed, of course, butthe natural mycophobia of the Spanish population, their contemptfor peculiar native practices, and the similar attitude of theFrench, the Germans, and the English who later came to knowMexico led naturally to an absence of communication between thenatives and the occupying races on matters that lay closest tothe Indians" hearts. It is small wonder that the sacredmushrooms, after an abortive spate of notices, hopelesslyinadequate, in the writings of the early friars, have remainedunknown to the world to our own times. The Indians would not takethe initiative in speaking about them. The 'secrecy" was nota conspiracy of silence: it was imposed on the Indians by theWhite Man, owing to the lack of intelligent and sympatheticcuriosity in the elite of the White circles. The secrecy in the ancient Greek world about the EleusinianMysteries was somewhat different. The laws of Athens made it acrime to speak about what went on at Eleusis in the telesterion.Toward the end of the Homeric hymn to Demeter, this silence isexpressly enjoined on all initiates. In B. C. 415 there was aspate of deliberate profanations of the Mysteries by the jet setin Athens and a crackdown followed, harsh penalties beinginflicted. But the secrecy ran far beyond the reach of the lawsof Athens. That secrecy ruled everywhere in the Greek world andwas never seriously violated. It too was self-enforcing. Thosewho knew the superior hallucinogens through personal experiencewere not inclined to discuss with outsiders what was revealed tothem: words could not convey to strangers the wonders of thatnight and there would always be the danger that the effort toexplain would be met with incredulity, with the scoffing andmockery that would seem to the initiate sacrilegious, would woundhim in the very core of his being. One who has known theineffable is loath to embark on explanations: words are useless. So far as we can say, at every point what happened at Eleusisfits in with the hallucinogenic experience in Mexico but in onemajor respect the Mexican rite outdistances Eleusis. They bothshare in the great Vision ("Vision" embracing all thesenses and the emotions), but in Mexico the sacred mushrooms (andthe other superior hallucinogens) serve also as oracles. Thehierophants of Eleusis saw a new crop of initiates every year andthere were many initiates. With the limitations that thisprocedure imposed, they could not serve as consultants either toindividuals or the State on grave problems where these would beneeding advice. In Mexico, on the other hand, the hallucinogen isconsulted from time to time on all kinds of serious matters. Thequestions put to the mushrooms must be serious: if they areunworthy or frivolous, the suppliant is in for a sharp rebuff.Faith in the mushrooms among the Indians where traditionalbeliefs still prevail is absolute. When the suppliant hasobserved all the tabus, when the velada takes place underthe right circumstances of darkness and silence, and when heposes his questions with a pure heart, the mushrooms will notlie. So say the Indians. And such meager evidence as one of ushas suggests that they may be right. Toward the end of the last century the world learned ofpeyotl and early in the middle of this century the hallucinogenicmorning-glory seeds were identified by Richard Evans Schultes. Alittle later the sacred mushrooms of Mexico received their fullmeed of public attention, located and written up by Roger Heimand one of us. They were shown the way by a botanist, Blas PabloReko, and an anthropologist, Robert J. Weitlaner. Now the threeof us are submitting to the modern world what well may be the keyto the mystery of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The tie that bindsthe grain of Triptolemus to the supernal experience of Eleusis,easily and safely attainable from ergot, is so close and naturaland poetically satisfying, complying point by point with the mythof Demeter and Persephone, that are we not virtually compelled toaccept this solution? Further avenues of inquiry open up. For example, the pregnantempresses of Byzantium lived in a porphyry-lined chamber so thattheir progeny would be born "in the purple"("porphyry" = purple). Was this "purple" thecolor of Claviceps purpurea and do we have here aposthumous outcropping of the purple-robed Demeter andHades-of-the-purple-hair? The earliest codices were written onpurple vellum. Was this because only the most exalted color wouldbe fitting, eg, for St. Augustine's De Civitate Dei? By aknee-jerk reflex the values of the Pagan world would thus live onunder the Christian Dispensation.

It is with this second category (of drug use,not of drugs; the drugs themselves may be the same) that I amconcerned. For some reason, there is no generally accepted colloquialdescription. 'Narcotic' is quite familiar, but it has acquireda pejorative tinge, and in any case it should properly be usedonly about a drug used to induce drowsiness or stupor. For a while'dope' did service, but by the time Tom Lehrer was singing aboutthe old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he went, it had begunto slip out of favour, and is now more commonly used to describewhat is taken by athletes to improve their form, or given to racehorsesto upset the odds. I have stuck simply to the term 'drugs'. I have used words like 'addiction' in their colloquial ratherthan their more specialised clinical sense; and I have tried toavoid the jargon of the pharmacologists, except when quoting it.Their term for the mood-altering drugs, 'psychotropic', has establisheditself; but they have yet to agree on how best to describe a drugused to alter perception. The term most often employed, 'hallucinogen',is both ugly and misleading, as the experiences are not necessarilyhallucinatory; but the commonest alternative, 'psychotomimetic',is even uglier and more misleading, as the experiences do notoften resemble psychosis. 'Phantastica', which Louis Lewin triedto popularise, has not caught on; nor, mercifully, have 'psychotogenic'or 'psycholitic'; and Humphrey Osmond's 'psychedelic' has shiftedits meaning, in popular usage. I have preferred 'vision-inducing'. There is another category of drugs which I had intended to include;aphrodisiacs. I found, though, that virtually all the drugs knownto man, not to mention all sorts of foodstuffs and drinks whichare not ordinarily regarded as drugs, have had the reputationat one time or another of stimulating sexual appetite, or improvingsexual performance. As the same drugs, at other times, have oftenhad the reputation of diminishing desire, and spoiling performance,it is doubtful whether the category of aphrodisiac can be accepted,except subjectively. I have also dealt only in passing with the economic consequencesof drug use. For centuries, a vast acreage has been given overto growing the plants which provide the raw material of drugs.Huge sums have been spent on processing, distributing and retailingthe finished products, and on providing the accessories, frompublic houses to hubble-bubbles. States have extracted immenserevenues from drug duties and used them to pay for everythingfrom social services to guided missiles. Obviously the influenceof drugs on the world's economy has been incalculable; but todeal adequately with this aspect of the subject would requireanother, and a very different, book. The reasons for some other omissions will be found in the sectionon sources. But there is also one inclusion, which I find sometimescauses surprise. Alcohol is clearly a drug; the drug, of our civilisationand many before. But it has also long been consumed, often primarily,as a beverage. I have dealt with attitudes to drink, and legislationdesigned to control drinking, only when they have been inspiredby fears of its effects when used as a drug.

IT IS UNLIKELY THAT we willever know for certain; archaeological discoveries—the seedsof drug plants found in pots; cave drawings of the plants themselves—indicatethat the practice must be many thousands of years old, and theinformation is too scanty to justify anything more than speculation.Our main source of evidence about early drug practices comes fromexplorers, missionaries, traders and colonial administrators,and more recently from anthropological field workers, who havedescribed what they have seen in primitive communities. Unluckily,what they saw was often so alien to the preconceptions which theybrought with them from civilisation that they rarely describedit with detachment. Still, certain patterns emerge, with a reasonableconsistency. From the New World The most revealing accounts of drug use by savages, as they werelong described by men accounting themselves civilised, are inthe chronicles of the followers of Columbus, reporting what theysaw and heard in the Caribbean islands, and later in North andSouth America. They found a great variety of plant drugs in usethere: cohoba, coca, peyotl, certain species of mushroom, datura(jimsonweed), ololiuqui (morning glory), caapi, and others—tobacco being the commonest. None of these plants was known inEurope at the time; nor was any drug in use there for the purposefor which they were most widely taken in the New World, to generateenergy. The only drug then in common use in Europe was alcohol;and wine or beer were ordinarily taken mainly for refreshment.The American Indians, the chroniclers reported, chewed tobaccoor coca leaves as a substitute for refreshment—to give themselvesa psychological 'lift', as if into a mild form of trance. This,they claimed, enabled them to work long hours, or travel longdistances, or fight protracted battles, without the need for food,drink, or sleep. Drugs were also taken in America as alcohol was in Europe, forintoxication—but again, with a difference. As Girolamo Benzonireported in one of the early published accounts of life there,an Indian would settle down to fill himself up with tobacco smokeuntil to outward appearances he was hopelessly drunk. But he wasputting himself out of his mind with a purpose; for 'on returningto his senses, he told a thousand stories of his having been atthe council of the gods, and other high visions'; and such storieswere taken very seriously by the tribe. Although the same drug might be taken both for everyday workingpurposes and for intoxication, it would as a rule be used as anintoxicant only by—or with the supervision of—a medicine man,qualified by character and training to interpret what was seenor heard. The visions, the Indians believed, were glimpses ofa world on a different plane of reality, but just as real; inhabitedby spirits who had access to useful sources of knowledge. In particular,they would reveal what was in store for the tribe, or individualmembers of it. The process was described by the chronicler GonzalvoFernando d'Oviedo y Valdez. The Indians of Hispaniola, he wrote, had secret means of putting themselves in touch with spirits wheneverthey wished to predict the future. This is how they set aboutthe matter. When a chief called one of those priests of the desert,this man came with two of his disciples, one of whom bore a vasefilled with some mysterious drink, and the other a little silverbell. When he arrived, the priest sat himself down between thetwo disciples on a small round seat in presence of the chief andsome of his suite. He drank the liquor which had been brought,and then began his conjurations, calling aloud on the spirits;and then, highly agitated and furious, he was shaken by the mostviolent movements . . . He then seemed to be plunged into a kindof ecstasy and to be suffering curious pains. During all thistime one of the disciples rang the little bell. When the priesthad calmed down, and while he lay senseless on the ground, thechief, or some other, asked what they desired to know, and thespirit replied through the mouth of the inspired man in a mannerperfectly exact. The Spanish chroniclers did not doubt the accuracy of the informationcollected. They were quite prepared to believe that the drugsinduced visions, and that in them, the future could be foretold.But the whole process—the convulsions, the strange voices—wasreminiscent of what they knew, and feared, as diabolic possession.Such visions, they were aware, might come from God; but it wasunthinkable that God should have provided such a valuable servicefor the heathen. The only possible explanation was that, as theDominican Diego Duran put it, 'the devil must be speaking to themin that drunken state'. As it was not considered safe to investigatethe devil's handiwork, for fear of falling into his clutches—or,later, the Inquisition's—the opportunity to investigate drug-induceddivination was not grasped. Travellers' tales Ironically, the emergence of a more sceptical attitude also discouragedinquiry; for a reason hinted at by Nicolas Monardes in his JoyfulNews out of the New Found World, which contained the firstattempt at a survey of the American plant drugs. Monardes didnot dispute that the devil was involved. Having knowledge of herballore, the devil must have revealed it to the Indians, 'that theymight see the visions he had prepared for them, and so deceivethem'. But Monardes doubted the authenticity of the informationtransmitted by the medicine men. It was simply their attempt tomake sense of their incoherent visions, he felt—and had oftento be deliberately left obscure, so that whatever happened themedicine men could claim to have predicted it. As a member ofthe Church, in other words, he took divination seriously; as aman of science he was reluctant to do so. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, though reportscontinued to filter back to Europe from time to time of remarkabledivinatory feats by medicine men under the influence of drugs,they attracted attention only as curiosities. A typical examplewas the reaction to the account which Count Filip von Strahlenberg,a Swedish army officer who had spent years as a prisoner of warin Siberia, gave of the Koryak tribesmen, in which he describedhow they used the red-capped amanita muscaria mushroom—the 'flyagaric'—as an intoxicant. Only the better-off families, Strahlenbergexplained, could afford to buy them, and store them for the winter.Whenever they had a feast, they would pour water over them, boilthem, and enjoy the visions. 'The poorer sort', he went on, who cannot afford to lay in a store of these mushrooms, post themselveson these occasions round the huts of the rich, and watch the opportunityof the guests coming down to make water; and then hold a woodenbowl to receive the urine, which they drink off greedily, as havingstill some virtue of the mushroom in it, and by this way, theyalso get drunk. A story like this helped to give 'travellers' tales' their derisoryreputation. It slipped easily into the repertory of the ranconteur—andof the satirist; Oliver Goldsmith used it to lend point to someremarks on the degeneracy of the English nobility. And even whenlater visitors to Siberia—voluntary or involuntary—were toconfirm that it was true, they were interested less in the purposesfor which the drug was taken, than by the fact that it could retainits intoxicating properties even when recycled through urine fouror five times; and that reindeer, too, were susceptible—a discoverywhich the Koryaks had been able to exploit. Gavril Sarychev, whospent from 1785 to 1793 in the region, found that the Chuckchiherdsman kept a sealskin container for his urine; whenever hewanted to round up his reindeer, 'he only has to set this containeron the ground and call out 'Girach, Girach!', and theypromptly come running toward him from afar'. Only rarely did commentators note that the intoxication whichthe fly agaric induced was of a very different kind from thatwhich followed the consumption of alcohol; or that it was usedby the Siberian shamans for the same purpose as the American medicinemen used tobacco or peyotl. But an account by another exile, StephanKraseninnikov, of his enforced residence in Kamchat kaland showedthe similarities. A man under the influence of the fly agaric,he wrote in 1755, could be recognised by the shaking of the extremities, which will follow after an houror less, after which the persons thus intoxicated have hallucinations,as in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifyingor felicitous, depending on differences in temperament; owingto which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors,while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, anda tub of water as deep as the sea. But this applies only to thosewho over-indulge, while those who use a small quantity experiencea feeling of extraordinary lightness, joy, courage and a stateof energetic well-being. Anthropology Travellers' tales merge imperceptibly into anthropology; but oneof the landmarks on that road was Travels in Peru, by therespected Swiss naturalist J. J. von Tschudi. He had read accountsby Pizarro's followers, describing how the Indians could performprodigious feats of endurance by chewing coca leaves; and he wasable to verify them when he arrived in the 1830s, finding thatthe porters he employed could go for five days and nights withno food and very little sleep. Coca was also used by the medicinemen; but datura was preferred, being more potent—as Tschudireported, after watching its effects on an Indian who took it. Shortly after having swallowed the beverage, he fell into a heavystupor. He sat with his eyes vacantly fixed on the ground, hismouth convulsively closed, and his nostrils dilated. In the courseof about a quarter of an hour his eyes began to roll, foam issuedfrom his half-opened lips, and his whole body was agitated byfrightful convulsions. These violent symptoms having subsided,a profound sleep of several hours succeeded. In the evening, whenI saw him again, he was relating to a circle of attentive listenersthe particulars of his vision, during which he alleged he hadheld communication with the spirits of his forefathers. Accounts of this kind, from investigators whose trustworthinesswas not in question, began to be increasingly common—particularlyfrom South America, where new tribes, and new drugs, were continuallybeing discovered. In his geographical survey of Ecuador, publishedin 1868, Manuel Villavicenzio described the effects of ayahuasca—alsoknown as caapi, or yage In a few moments it begins to produce the most rare phenomena.Its action appears to excite the nervous system; all the sensesliven up and all faculties awaken; they feel vertigo and spinningin the head, then a sensation of being lifted into the air andbeginning an aerial journey; the possessed begins in the firstmoments to see the most delicious apparitions, in conformity withhis ideas and knowledge. The savages say that they see gorgeouslakes, forests covered with fruit, the prettiest birds who communicateto them the nicest and the most favourable things they want tohear, and other beautiful things relating to their savage life.When the instant passes they begin to see terrible horrors aboutto devour them, their first flight ceases and they descend toearth to combat the terrors who communicate to them all adversitiesand misfortunes awaiting them. By 1871, when Edward Tylor published his Primitive Culture—thefirst serious attempt at a comparative survey of tribal life andlore—a mass of such information had become available, and itwas remarkably consistent. Almost all communities, in every partof the world, had their medicine men, witch doctors, or shamans,selected mainly on account of their ability to communicate withthe spirits. To visit the spirit world, the medicine man had tobe able to enter a state of trance; and this was frequently attainedwith the help of drugs. In this state he behaved as if he weredrunk, or in a kind of fit; but he would be able to recall hisvisions when he recovered. Or he might appear to be possessed,describing what he was seeing (or hearing) in a voice not hisown. Either way, his function was to bring back information ofuse to his tribe: the answers to such questions as what the enemytribes were planning; where more game might be found; how to detecta witch; and what treatment to give a sick member of the tribe. The evidence presented Tylor with an embarrassing problem. Hisgreat ambition was to divest anthropology of its 'travellers'tales' label, and secure its recognition as an academic discipline(as eventually he was to do; he became the holder of the firstChair of Anthropology at Oxford). He was aware that the scientificEstablishment of the time rejected the validity of divination,and he agreed, describing it as a 'monstrous farrago'. But theyalso refused to admit the existence of the trance state, and possession.Reviewing the evidence, Tylor found it impossible to accept thatthe state of 'ecstasy', as it was then commonly called, in whicha man is transported out of his right mind, was always spurious.But to accept it, let alone to admit its importance to primitiveman, might lead to the anthropologist being classified with themesmerists, hypnotists and spiritualists, all at the time busytrying to batter down orthodoxy's defences; and this would havebeen fatal to his academic prospects. So Tylor skirted round thesubject, with such discreet phrases as 'North American Indiansheld intoxication by tobacco to be supernatural ecstasy, and thedreams of men in this state to be inspired'. In doing so, he setthe fashion followed by Sir James Frazer in The Golden Bough,and by most orthodox anthropologists to this day. Reports from explorers, naturalists and anthropologists, however,continued to pour in, revealing the great respect in which thedrug-induced trance state was held by primitive tribes. In Guianain the 1870s, for example, Everard Im Thurn discovered that beforea youth was initiated into his tribe he had to move away fromit for a period of fasting, and at the same time accustom himselfto drink 'fearfully large draughts' of tobacco juice mixed withwater. Then, 'maddened by the draughts of nicotine, by the terrorsof his long solitary wanderings, and fearfully excited by hisown ravings, he is able to work himself at will into those mostfrantic passions of excitement during which he is supposed tohold converse with the spirits, and to control them'. If he learnedto control them, he could become a medicine man, second only inimportance to the chief of the tribe, and sometimes even moreinfluential.. Was it really possible that these and other primitivetribes, throughout history, throughout the world, had been takenin by a total imposture? At last, in the 1890s, experiments with hypnosis finally convincedthe scientific establishment that the trance state existed; andthe way was opened for a fresh look at the phenomenon. But theinvestigators arrived as blinkered as before; because orthodoxy,in accepting the trance state, classified it as a form of mentaldisorder. In retrospect, this is understandable; medicine menunder the influence of drugs tended to behave in ways which, inany civilised country, would have led to their being certifiedinsane. Russian anthropologists, in particular, investigatingshamanism— a term loosely applied to the whole medicine man/witchdoctor/ shaman complex—lent confirmation by attributing it tothe fearful sub-Arctic living conditions, and dismissing the visionswhich the shamans claimed to see under the influence of the flyagaric as no more meaningful than the pink elephants seen by analcoholic with delirium tremens.1 The 'Arctic mania' was a preposterous theory, in view of the factthat shamanism in one form or another existed wherever primitivetribes were found. But research of a kind which might have ledto a more plausible explanation was hampered not only by continuingscientific scepticism, but by the undisguised hostility of missionaries—hopingto stamp out what they felt were pagan drug cults; and of colonialadministrators, anxious to demonstrate that they, rather thanthe shaman, witch doctor or medicine man, were in command. Inthe early years of the century, therefore, when it would stillhave been possible to investigate drug-induced trances in tribesuntainted by much contact with civilisation, little serious researchwas done, except by a few interested individuals, and they wereoften frustrated. Frank Melland, who in the early years of thecentury was a shrewd observer of African customs in Rhodesia,described in a book about his experiences how he had the goodfortune to hear about some secret native dances. One was namedafter the drug taken by the dancers, which gave them extraordinaryendurance; those who took it, he was told, could travel a hundredmiles in the course of a night. In the other the participants,after taking the drug, were hypnotised by the witch doctor sothat they too could enter the spirit world. But he was unableto verify the information, because the Africans feared that ifthe colonial government came to know the dances were held, theywould be banned; and Melland, as a magistrate, would be requiredto enforce the prohibition. The possessed It was only when young anthropologists began to undertake intensivefield work, which involved staying long enough with a tribe towin its trust and to understand its customs, that drug-induceddivination began to be taken a little more seriously. One of thesefield workers was destined to be influential: Edward Evans-Pritchard,subsequently Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford University.When he went out to the Sudan in the 1920s to study the Azande,he watched the witch doctors at work; and from his observations,he drew a revealing picture of the process, and the part drugsplayed in it. A predecessor there, Monsignor Lagae, had described how the witchdoctor's object was to reach a state where the drug he had taken'glows (brille) through his body, and through it he beginsto see witchcraft clearly'. This, Evans-Pritchard found, was anaccurate description. The 'medicine', as they thought of it—notso much the drug itself, when one was used, but its effect—'goesto their stomachs, and dancing shakes it up and sends it all overtheir bodies, where it becomes an active agent, enabling themto prophesy'. The prophecies were not necessarily verbalised;the witch doctor 'does not only divine with his lips, but withhis whole body. He dances the questions that are put to him.'EvansPritchard's houseboy, who himself qualified as a witch doctor,described the process. While he was dancing, he had to await theverdict of the drugs. 'When the medicines take hold of him, aman begins to dance with reference to someone. He dances in vain,and goes in the soul of the medicine and arrives at another man.He sees him and his heart cools about that man. The witch doctorsays to himself: that man does not bewitch people.' But eventually'his heart shakes about him' and he knows that the man in frontof him IS a witch. Even if the witch should be from his own family,the medicine will stand alert within him', compelling him to revealthe truth. By the time Evans-Pritchard's work on the Azande appeared, in1937, there was more willingness to concede that shamanism mightnot be simply a form of hysteria. Though Freud's theories stillmet with resistance, his basic premise of an unconscious mindhad come to be accepted; and he had surmised that from the unconsciousman could have access to information which was not available tohim through his five senses—a proposition that Jung acceptedand expanded. If so, was it not possible that what the divinerwas trying to explain, when he claimed that the medicine 'stoodalert within him, was that in some way it liberated instinct,which answered the required questions without the interventionof consciousness? In primitive communities, after all, instinctmay well be a surer guide, on many issues, than imperfect reasoningability There seems no reason to doubt', M. J. Field concludedfrom her long experience working in Ghana, 'that the utterancesof a possessed person, concentrating on a narrowed field, mayexceed in wisdom those he can achieve when exposed to all thedistractions of normal consciousness.' However odd such a methodof getting information might appear to the materialist, Fieldfound that it worked—'by their fruits ye shall know them, andthe fruits of most spirit possession in Ghana are wholesome andsustaining' Michael Gelfand came to a similar conclusion fromhis experience in Rhodesia. Irrational though their techniquemight seem, it could be very effective; the practitioner mightbe no scientist— he wrote in his Witch Doctor—'buthe practices his art with superb skill'. In any case, the fact was that most primitive communities useddivination as a guide in their everyday affairs; and anthropologistsbegan to realise that to ignore or depreciate its influence waslike an atheist refusing to study the effect of Christianity onhistory on the ground that he did not believe in God. And gradually,a hypothesis has evolved to account for divination, and to explainits social role. Like other forms of animal life, man originally had instinct ashis guide, supplemented by the five senses. But with the developmentof consciousness, reasoning power, and memory, the capacity toconsult instinct was gradually lost, except when it broke throughas the 'sixth sense', or intuition. For primitive man, the losswould have been serious, had it not been for the fact that certainindividuals retained the ability to dissociate—to throw offconsciousness, and to liberate instinct. Dissociation took various forms. The diviner might dance out therequired answers, as Evans-Pritchard had observed; he might becomepossessed, as if taken over by a disembodied personality; or hemight have visions in which the spirits would show him or tellhim what he wanted to learn. How the information was secured,though, did not much matter, so long as it appeared to be relevantand useful. But as man came to rely more on memory and reasoningpower he found it more difficult to enter the required trancestate; and it was at this point that drugs came to be used, toinduce it—man being guided, perhaps, by instinct to the requiredplant drugs, just as animals are guided to the right plants tomake up for vitamin deficiencies.2 In his Shamanism, published in 1951, Professor Mircea Eliadeinterpreted this development as being a sign of decadence. Narcotics—ashe called them, with obvious distaste, lumping tobacco, alcoholand the fly agaric together—were a recent innovation, 'onlya vulgar substitute for pure trance', and 'an imitation of thestate which the shaman is no longer capable of attaining otherwise'.Recently, however, this verdict has been challenged, notably byR. G. Wasson in his Soma, and by some of the contributorsto the first full scale academic symposium on plant drugs, heldat the University of California in 1970—the proceedings of whichwere subsequently edited by Professor Peter T. Furst and publishedas Flesh of the Gods. Drugs are indeed a substitute forthe ability to enter the trance state voluntarily, but that isnot necessarily a symptom of decadence; if man can find such substitutesfor faculties which he has lost in his evolution, that may beheld to be to his credit. And there is no evidence that the trancestate induced by drugs is necessarily any different from the stateattained by other means. Horizons beyond One question remains unanswered. Until very recently, to takedivination seriously enough even to consider the possibility thatextra-sensory perception might be involved, as a product of thedrug-induced trance state, was to court ridicule. But orthodoxscience has been shifting its stance, moving towards guarded acceptanceof the proposition that some phenomena, formerly regarded as supernatural,may acquire scientific respectability. Certainly the former prejudiceagainst research studies in this field is disappearing. The historical evidence for links between taking certain drugsand the ability to practise divination would fill a book. Constantlymen have believed that they have been on the verge of provingit— like Joseph Kopek, a Polish general exiled to Siberia inthe 1790s, whose experiments with the fly agaric not merely madehim believe he was a diviner, but enabled him to correct the mistakesof the local shaman ('I warned him to improve in those matters;and I noticed that he took those warnings almost as the voiceof revelation'). Could anybody now deny, Kopek went on, that in spite of our vast knowledge of natural phenomena, therestill exist almost countless phenomena about which we can onlyguess? Can one put a limit to nature at a point that delimitsthe possibilities of enquiries and discoveries of human research?Innumerable effects of recently discovered magnetic forces; effectsthat cannot be detected by physical means nor pinpointed withany degree of precision to some specification on the human body,seem to reconcile in some measure the controversy concerning thismushroom. It is possible that in the sleep brought by the influenceof this mushroom, a man is able to see at least some of his realpast and, if not the future, at least his present relations. In the letters and memoirs of travellers, missionaries and colonialadministrators over the past century and a half there are countlessstories, some of them well attested, of witch doctors accuratelydescribing what was happening in distant places, or correctlyforecasting future events. But they were all, by their nature,'anecdotal'; and it was always possible to pick holes in an anecdote—as,for example, in the case of an episode recounted at the turn ofthe century by the respected South African merchant David Leslie,who had decided out of curiosity to test a local diviner. Lesliehad eight native hunters out working for him, searching for elephant;could the diviner tell him how they were faring? The diviner madeeight fires, and threw roots into them; then, he took a drug,and fell into a convulsive trance. When he came round, he rakedout the fires one by one, describing as he did so what was happeningto each hunter; how some had been fortunate; others had done badly;and two had been killed. The account, Leslie claimed, had provedto be true in every particular. But could the diviner not havecheated? Dudley Kidd argued in The Essential Kafir, publishedin 1902, that he could have combined local knowledge with intelligentguesswork. Leslie, though he might be convinced that this explanationwas inadequate, had no way of proving that the diviner reallyhad been using second sight. Tales of the kind that Leslie told have continued to be heardfrom many parts of the world, particularly from those regionsof America where peyotl can be found. Dr. Rafael Bayon, workingin Colombia at the beginning of the century, became convincedthat with its help the local shaman could see and hear distantevents on behalf of a patient, 'consistent with exact observationsof things of which the patient neither has, nor could have, theleast previous knowledge'. Twenty years later the French missionariesassured the pharmacologist Andre Rouhier that shamans who wereasked a question only needed to take peyotl 'and they obtain asolution to the problem before them in an auditory form —a personappearing to them and telling them what they want to know; orvisually—as if, for example, they were to see the landscape,the persons or the plants which would serve them to the end desired'.Recently, Carlos Castaneda has described Don Juan's paranormalfaculties in his books; and in Flesh of the Gods, DouglasSharon—an anthropological field worker—has given a convincingaccount of the powers of the Peruvian shaman Eduardo CalderonPalomino. When Palomino realised that he had a vocation to be a curandero,a healer/diviner, he began to practise with the help of tobacco,which gave him 'very rapid sight, mind and imagination'. (It wasfor this purpose, he surmised, that people had originally takensnuff; the curanderos found it helped to clear their mindsand speed their thoughts.) But when he wanted to induce visions,he took the potent San Pedro cactus. He described the effectsto Sharon: . . . first, a slight dizziness that one hardly notices. And thena great vision, a clearing of all the faculties of the individual.It produces a slight numbness in the body and afterwards a tranquillity.And then comes a detachment, a type of visual force in the individual,inclusive of all the senses; seeing, hearing, smelling, touching,etc.—all the senses, including the sixth sense, the telepathicsense of transmitting oneself across time and matter. The cactus drug, Palomino thought, developed the power of perception,enabling a man to 'distinguish powers or problems of disturbancesat a great distance, so as to deal with them'. This evidence—and there is a great deal more of it—suggeststhat drug-induced divination as practised in primitive communitiesdeserves more serious attention than it has received. If it canbe demonstrated that drugs are capable of liberating the clairvoyantfaculty in certain individuals, so that with the help of theirtraining as shamans they can use it for the benefit of the tribe,there will have to be a radical reappraisal both of shamanismand of the drugs associated with it. R. G. Wasson has even suggestedthat they may have had an evolutionary role, by giving primitiveman a glimpse 'of horizons beyond any that he knew in his harshstruggle for survival'. 1. The anthropologists did, however, fullyconfirm the old travellers' tale. According to Vladimir Jochelson,writing in 1905, reindeer no longer even needed to be summonedwith the call Girach! Girach! (back) Frequently the reindeer come running to camp from a far off pastureto taste of snow saturated with urine, having a keen sense ofhearing and of smell, but their sight is rather poor. A man stoppingto urinate in the open attracts reindeer from afar, which, followingthe sense of smell, will run to the urine, hardly discerning theman, and paying no attention to him. The position of a man standingup in the open white urinating is rather critical when he becomesthe object of attention from reindeer coming down on him fromall sides at full speed. 2.

Shaman to priest As man's reasoning power developed, and his capacity to consultinstinct declined, fewer men could be found who had the ability,with or without a drug, to slip into the trance state; and itbecame progressively more difficult to interpret the pronouncementsof those who could. More powerful doses of whatever drug was inuse could not have helped, as they would have promoted simpleintoxication, without benefit of revealing visions. The medicineno longer 'stood alert' within the shaman, leading him inexorablyto the answer he was seeking, uncovering the identity of witchor thief. He began to need aids, as if to pick up and amplifyinstinct's weak transmissions. Just as there are some water divinerswho search for underground sources unaided, while others needto use a forked hazel twig or a pendulum, so there were (and stillare) some shamans who needed no aids, while others had to employdevices—horns, say, which they could hold, and which seemedto dictate their movements. And in the next stage, they beganto seek their visions in smoke, or in bowls of liquid—much asa present-day fortune teller consults a crystal ball; or to throwbones, and observe the pattern they formed as they fell; or toexamine the entrails of animals. So long as these techniques were employed as a means to inducea trance—so long as the smoke or the entrails were simply away of rousing the unconscious mind to take over—drugs stillhad their part to play in making the process easier. But the timewas to come when divination by such means became standardised.The pattern in which the bones fell, the state of the entrails,were consciously 'read', as were omens; a bird flying past fromone direction meant one forecast; from another direction, a differentforecast. In time, divination was reduced to rote—to routine.Dissociation was then no longer needed; and drugs became superfluous. At the same time, the development of patterns of belief— religions—madedissociation an untrustworthy and unnerving experience, becausethe material pouring out of the unconscious might be at variancewith approved doctrine. A safer way was to employ ritual; theregular repetition of words and actions, designed to break downconsciousness without inducing a full trance. Ritual requiredmore self-control on the shaman's part, in order that he shouldbe able to reproduce the formula exactly, time after time. Dissociationwas no help; and drugs were a positive handicap. As a result shamansbegan to be chosen on other grounds than their ability to inducetrances; and it was at this point that, in effect, they becamepriests. The priest, as the American anthropologist A. L. Kroeber definedhim half a century ago, is an official recognised by the community. He has duties andpowers. He may inherit, be elected, or succeed by virtue of lineagesubject to confirmation. But he steps into a specific office whichexisted before him and continues after his death. His power isthe result of his induction into the office, and the knowledgeand authority that go with it. He thus contrasts sharply withthe shaman—logically at least. The shaman makes his position.Any person possessed of the necessary mediumistic faculty, orable to convince a part of the community of his ability to operatesupernaturally, is thereby a shaman. His influence is essentiallypersonal. The demarcation line, as Kroeber emphasised, cannot always beclearly drawn; in early civilizations, shamanism and religionoften co-existed, particularly where potent plant drugs were available—peyotl,datura, the fly agaric. The most striking example emerges fromthe verses of the Rig Veda—the testimonies of the shaman/priesthoodwhich was one outcome of the Aryan influx into India, three thousandyears ago We have drunk soma, have become immortal Gone to the light have we, the gods discovered What can hostility do against us? These hymns to a plant deity, as Wasson pointed out in his Soma,were composed over a period of centuries, by men who lived farremote from each other, but shared the same experiences from it; . . . In the hierarchy of Vedic gods certain others took precedenceover Soma: but since Soma was a tangible, visible thing, its inebriatingjuice to be ingested by the human organism in the course of theritual, a god come down and manifesting himself to the Aryans,Soma played a singular role in the Vedic pantheon. The poets nevertire of stressing Soma's sensuous appeal . . . The priests, afterimbibing the juice, seem to have known, for the nonce, the ecstasyof existence in the World of the Immortals. The divine elementwas not just a symbol of spiritual truth as in the Christian communion:Soma was a miraculous drink that spoke for itself. It remains uncertain from which plant Soma was extracted. (Wasson'scontention that it must have been the fly agaric makes more sensethan most early theories, which even proffered such unlikely candidatesas rhubarb); and the testimonials cannot be regarded as a whollyreliable source of information about its qualities—a similarcollection of eulogies of beer or tobacco could be collated fromEnglish sources which would be hardly less idolatrous. Neverthelessthe impression left of Soma's transcendental qualities is significant,because it reveals that the drug— whatever it may have been—wasbeing taken for a different end. The purpose was no longer basicallyfunctional—to secure access to useful information. Rather, itwas to lift the mind to a higher plane of perception. The suggestionhas even been made that the shaman priests did not take the drugto try to achieve artificially the exalted state of mind thatmystics achieved through yoga. The mystics, through yoga, mayhave been trying to recapture the exalted states of mind whichformerly had required the assistance of Soma for their attainment. In many other parts of the world, plant drugs which had originallybeen used to facilitate access to the spirits came to be regarded,and later worshipped, as spirits, or deities, in their own right.In Peru, Tschudi reported, 'it was believed that any businessundertaken without the benediction of coca leaves could not prosper,and to the shrub itself, worship was rendered'. Chewed coca wasthrown on veins of ore in the Peruvian mines, in the belief theywould be softened, and easier to work. A few years later the Frenchtraveller H. A. Weddell, exploring Bolivia, found that marriedmen going on a journey would throw a dollop of chewed coca leafon to a rock, in the belief that if it did not still adhere tdthe rock when they returned, it would be proof that in their absencetheir wives had not adhered to their marital vows. Many innocents,Weddell feared, must have suffered a bastonnade, as a result.In the 1920s Alexander Goldenweiser described how the Chuckchitribesmen in Siberia took the fly agaric in the expectation thatthe mushrooms would appear to them in the guise of mushroom men,who would 'lead the dreamer through the world and show him realand imaginary things'. Later, Wasson observed the same processin Mexico, where the mushrooms had begun to take command: They speak through the curandero or shaman. He is as thoughnot present. The mushrooms answer the questions put to them aboutthe sick patient, about the future, about the stolen money orthe missing donkey . . . similarly the eater of the fly agariccomes under the command of the mushrooms, and they are personifiedas amanita girls or amanita men, the size of the fly agaric, The fruit of the vine Drugs, therefore, remained an essential part of shamanism, whereit survived. But wherever religions established themselves inits place, and in particular where the religion was monotheistic,the need for them disappeared, because the kind of divinationthey inspired was regarded as a threat. Rulers did not care foruntamed sources of information, which might turn out to be subversive;and priests, brooding over their entrails, looked with envy onshamans, drawing their information directly from the spirit world—'the priest realises clearly where the danger lies', as Micheletobserved in his study of sorcery; 'an enemy, a menacing rival,is to be feared in this High-Priestess of Nature he pretends todespise'. Divination in such circumstances became regarded asthe devil's doing—unless the diviner's probity or position wassuch that this interpretation was unthinkable, or perhaps unmentionable.It was equated with witchcraft, and the death penalty imposedfor anybody who practised it—except when, as in the case ofthe witch of Endor, it happened to be the State, in the personof King Saul, who needed the prognostication. And drugs whichhad been used to induce the trance state were naturally suspect. There was one drug available, however, which in this respect wasrelatively safe: wine. Whereas other drugs appeared to give accessto information transmitted from a different world, what wine released—thoughit was often revealing: in vino veritas—was mundane.It induced visions only when taken in excess, over a protractedperiod; and they were not of any divinatory value to a shaman,or anybody else. As an intoxicant, in fact, alcohol's functionwas—in the phrase that has been so often echoed—to 'take awayunderstanding'. It removed a man from the cares of the world,without precipitating him into another. Although his behaviourwhen in this condition might be anti-social and dangerous to himselfand his companions, it presented no real threat to the authorityof Church or State. Wine, though, was taken chiefly as a beverage. It was decidedlysafer to drink, in many regions, than water—as well as tastingagreeable. The Old Testament writings demonstrate that wine wasnever, in that era, looked on with suspicion. Drunkenness wascondemned as a sin, but wine was no more held responsible forit than meat was held responsible for the sin of gluttony. Sofar from wine being suspect, it was usually coupled with breadas God's great gift to man. An abundant grape harvest signifieddivine pleasure; a superabundant harvest was taken to herald thecoming of the Messiah. Temperance reformers were later to pointto the existence of tribes or sects who renounced wine; but thiswas not because of disapproval of its intoxicating properties,but because they objected to the cultivation of the grapes. Nomadstended to despise those who settled down to the sedentary lifeof the farmer or town dweller; the Rechabite injunction 'ye shalldrink no wine' was accompanied by 'neither shall ye build house,nor sow seed'. And where ascetic sects emerged, their worry wasthat wine-bibbing was a form of self-indulgence. John the Baptistwould have objected as strenuously to the consumption of agreeablyflavoured non-alcoholic drinks. Wine had two effects, however, which eventually aroused debateon whether it ought to be—in effect—reclassified as a drug.One was the possible consequences for society of intoxication,when it unfitted men to do their jobs. It was up to the individualto regulate his own drinking, Plato's Athenian argued in the Laws;but the State had a right and a duty to protect citizens fromthe effects of that drinking, should it put them at risk: . . . if the practice is treated as mere play, and free licenceis to be given to any man to drink whenever he pleases, in whatcompany he pleases, and when engaged on any undertaking he pleases,I could no longer vote for allowing any indulgence in the wine-cupto such a city, or such a man. I would even go further than thepractice of Crete and Lacedaemon and propose an addition to theCarthaginian law which prohibits the very taste of this liquorto all soldiers in the field, and enforces water-drinking throughoutthe duration of a campaign. I would absolutely prohibit its tastein civic life to slaves of both sexes, to magistrates throughoutthe year of their office, and equally absolutely to captains ofvessels and jurymen when on duty, and likewise to any member ofan important council when about to attend its meetings. FurtherI would prohibit its use during the day absolutely, except underthe orders of a trainer or physician, and at night also to anyperson of either sex contemplating the procreation of children,to pass over the many other cases in which wine is not to be drunkby rational men with a sound law. The Greeks were concerned only about how to prevent drinking frombecoming a security risk. Some early Christian sects, however,began to take the argument a stage further, and suggest that therewas a more serious hazard: that it would imperil men's souls.Gnostics, Manicheans and others argued that as wine was notoriouslyan aphrodisiac, and the occasion of sin, to drink it must be sinful,and wine itself must be inherently evil. Against them were rangedthose fathers of the Church on whom Greek thought still exerciseda decisive influence, and who contended that 'it is not what enterethin that defileth a man'—as Clement of Alexandria put it in thesecond century A.D.—'but that which goes out of his mouth';a view echoed by St. Chrysostom, two centuries later: ... the simple ones among our brethren, when they see any persondisgracing themselves from drunkenness, instead of reproving such,blame the fruit given them by God, and say, 'Let there be no wine'.We should say then in answer to such, 'let there be no drunkenness;for wine is the work of God, but drunkenness is the work of thedevil'. Wine makes not drunkenness, but intemperance producesit. Do not accuse that which is the workmanship of God, but accusethe madness of a fellow mortal. Hashish The knowledge that Jesus had been a wine drinker—and had evenpromised the disciples at the last supper that he would enjoywine with them in Paradise—did not prevent the leaders of earlyChristian sects from arguing that wine was the occasion of sin,because they could claim that as Jesus was without sin, wine hadno power over him. But to the ordinary believer, the argumentsounded specious; and when Mahomet decided to instruct his followersto forgo wine, one of the reasons—it has been suggested —wasthat this would help to distinguish them from the wineloving Christians. As this was the first attempt of its kind to prohibit the consumptionof a popular drug, it would be interesting to know more abouthow the ban worked. Given a zealous priesthood, it would havebeen relatively easy to enforce, because the location of the vineyardswould be known. They could easily have been destroyed; and wineis too- bulky to be easily smuggled in any quantity on camel caravans.The evidence, however, has yet to be sifted, to find what werethe prohibition's effects. Ironically we know more —thanks tothe work of Franz Rosenthal—about one of the side-effects ofMahomet's law: the controversy which followed in the Moslem worldwhether hashish, the drug made from the hemp plant, ought alsoto come under the ban, though it had not been formally indictedin the Koran. In The Herb, published in 1971, Rosenthalpresented an illuminating sample of the opinions of philosophersand priests, public health officials and poets, on the issue ofwhether and how the consumption of hashish should be restricted,or stopped altogether: a foretaste of many a similar campaignto come. To judge from a brief account in Herodotus of the way the Scythiansthrew hemp on heated stones and 'carried away by the fumes, shoutaloud', the hemp plant must long have been known to have intoxicatingqualities; and Moslem sects, such as the Sufis, continued to takeit in traditional shamanist ways. By Mahomet's time, though, itseems to have been utilised chiefly as a medicine for, among otherdisorders, dandruff, diarrhoea, earache, gonorrhea and worms.But then—perhaps because of the ban on wine —hemp came againto be eaten, or drunk in some form of infusion in the Moslem world.There are difficulties, Rosenthal warned, in the way of any assessmentof its precise effects on people, because 'hashish', the termordinarily used, not merely covered a variety of different hemppreparations, but also took in opium and henbane, and was looselyused about herbs in general. Hemp, Rosenthal surmised, must graduallyhave come to be identified with hashish because it was regardedas the herb; 'the most representative and, probably, the mostwidely used of the hallucinatory drugs employed by medieval Muslims'.And when the authorities realised it was being increasingly adoptedas a substitute for wine, they began to cast around for excusesto stop it. The Koran, they argued, banned wine because it couldbe an intoxicant; hashish was being taken as an intoxicant; thereforehashish should be banned. The upper classes tended to agree—particularly employers: hashish-eating was mainly a working classhabit. It was bad for the working man's health, they explained;damaging his complexion, giving him halitosis, and eventuallyleading him to immorality, insanity, and mental exhaustion (muchthe same arguments, in fact, as were later to be used in Englandagainst masturbation). The supporters of hashish argued that it had not been banned inthe Koran precisely because it did not intoxicate—not, at least,in the same way as wine. Wine caused quarrelsomeness; hashishinduced 'languid placidity'—as even its critics appear to haveconceded; in the attacks on the drug, Rosenthal could find nomention of any really violent actions against others under itsinfluence. In some people, it created a pleasant stupor; in othersit excited the imagination; that was all. It could not be condemnedas anti-social. The law should therefore not meddle with it. Asa Jurist put it ingeniously in a verse: Hashish intoxication contains a hidden secret Too subtle for minds to explain They have declared it forbidden without any justification on the basis of reason and tradition Declaring forbidden what is not forbidden is forbidden As hashish was admitted to be less intoxicating than such alternativesas opium and henbane—and even nutmeg, which enjoyed a considerablereputation as a narcotic—any attempt to suppress it, its supportersadded, might only lead its purchasers to more dangerous drugs. These arguments did not impress the authorities, who determinedto try to curb the consumption of hashish. But how? Should itbe banned outright; or should it be permitted for specific purposes,with penalties for misuse? Periodically, outright prohibitionwas attempted; but enforcement proved impracticable. The hempplant grew wild; and even if it had not, it would have been impossibleto stop cultivation, as it was valuable for other purposes—formaking fibre, as well as medicine. It was quite easy to transport,or if necessary to smuggle, to those who wanted it; and becauseit was cheap there was a ready demand even from the poorest classes—'Iam satisfied', as a poet put it: . . . with a morsel of porridge And a round pill of hashish, Why should I reproach time from which individual Destiny proceeds, by complaining about lack of means? The pattern which emerges from Rosenthal's research is significant,because it has recurred again and again up to the present day.Drugs come under attack because they make Church and State uneasy,for fear that they will render people, particularly the young,less amenable to discipline. As the authorities do not care toadmit that this is their real reason for wanting to stop drug-taking,they claim they are only concerned with their subjects' health,morals, and welfare. They then find that prohibition simply doesnot work. The anti-hashish campaigners, according to Rosenthal,were forced to admit that they were 'fighting a losing battlewith the reality of the social environment', and eventually theysank into 'complete resignation'. It was the first in a long lineof such losing battles in authority's protracted war to controldrugs. Witch's brew There are other gaps in the history of drugs in this era whichwill have to await research like Rosenthal's to fill in. Someare unlikely ever to be filled. We will probably never know forcertain what the constituents were of Homer's nepenthe; or whatdrug was used in the shamanist Eleusinian cult in ancient Greece,in which the initiate was given a potion designed to induce delectablevisions, after which he could never be the same again. In general,the information about drugs and their social effects in classicaltimes, and in the Middle Ages, is too scanty and unreliable toserve as the basis for anything more than enjoyable speculation.And although there is plenty of evidence about the attempts tocontrol drunkenness—Solon established the death penalty formagistrates who were found under the influence and numerous regulationswere made to prohibit slaves, or minors, or women from drinking—there is very little evidence how such laws worked in practice. Apart from wine, there does not seem to have been any drug incommon enough use in Europe to disturb the authorities' peaceof mind. Drugs crop up chiefly in connection with witchcraft.Professor Michael Harner has recently argued that they were ofcentral importance to witchcraft in Europe, but that this hasbeen obscured by the fact that so much of the source material,most of it in Latin, has never been studied by anybody with aninterest in this aspect of the subject. From the later evidenceof witchcraft trials, it is clear that witches employed such plantsas henbane and deadly nightshade—sometimes making them intounguents, and smearing them on parts of their bodies—as a wayof liberating themselves. to undertake their Sabbat rides. Itis also clear that, like shamans, they believed that while theywere under the influence of these drugs they really could flythrough the air. One seventeenth-century witch, more fortunatethan many in that she had a shrewd priest dealing with her, boastedshe could prove it; rubbing ointment on herself to the accompaniment of magic incantations,she lay her head back and immediately fell asleep. With the laborof the devil she dreamed of Mistress Venus and other superstitionsso vividly that, crying out with a shout and striking her handsabout, she jarred the bowl in which she was sitting and, fallingdown from the stool, seriously injured herself about the head.As she lay there awakened, the priest cried out to her that shehad not moved; 'for heaven's sake, where are you ? You were notwith Diana and as will be attested by these present, you neverleft this bowl'. Thus, by this act and by thoughtful exhortationshe drew out this belief from her abominable soul. Harner cites a number of similar examples, suggesting that witchcraftwas not, as some historians have suggested, a symptom of masshysteria, having no existence in its own right, but a debasedform of shamanism, which the hostility of the Church had preventedfrom coming out into the open. The prevailing belief in diabolic possession, however, meant thatthe drugs a witch used were not regarded as responsible for herconduct; and there is no indication that drugs were otherwiseemployed, except as medicines. Consequently, they were not anissue. Drunkenness continued to be condemned, and legislated against—butas a social nuisance rather than as a sin. So when Columbus'smen returned with their descriptions of the purposes for whichdrugs were used in the New World, they were too unfamiliar tobe feared as a threat to faith or morals in Europe. They couldbe welcomed, in fact, for the medicinal properties they were believedto possess.

The Spanish colonists soon took to it, inspite of official disapproval. Bartholomew de las Casas foundsome of them on the island of Hispaniola who had been reportedfor smoking; when remonstrated with for indulging in so viciousa habit, they had replied it was 'not in their power to stop'.And sailors brought the habit home. But it gained its initialpopularity in Europe as a medicine. Its value in treating feversand other disorders led Jean Nicot, French Ambassador at the PortugueseCourt, to take tobacco plants to France, when he returned therein 1561, as a present for Catherine de Medici; and by the timeNicholas Monardes published his Joyful News out of the NewFound World, a few years later, it had begun to be regardedas the great cure-all: herba panacea, valuable whethertaken into the lungs, or into the digestive system—or appliedexternally, to wounds; effective alike against headaches carbuncles,chilblains, worms, or venereal disease. This was not illogical, in the prevailing climate of orthodoxmedical opinion, based on the assumption that health dependedon a correct balance of the humours: blood, bile, and phlegm.A medicine which could 'cleanse the superfluous humors of thebrain' could be expected to remove whatever symptoms that superfluityhad brought on, mental or physical; and also to preserve health—thosewho took it, according to the mathematician Thomas Hariot, whowas with Raleigh's expedition to Virginia in 1585, were 'not subjectto many grievous diseases with which we in England are sometimesafflicted'. It was for this reason, presumably, that Raleigh brought tobaccoplants back from Virginia to plant on his Irish estate; his friendEdmund Spenser, who used to stay there, listed 'divine tobacco'in The Faery Queen as one of the herbs Belphoebe gatheredto staunch the flow of blood from Timais's wound. But Raleighbegan to enjoy tobacco in its own right, smoking it in a pipeas the Indians did in Virginia. Friends and acquaintances, introducedto smoking, caught the habit; and soon, it became the fashion. Tobacco caught on not because it induced a trance state, and visions.Young Englishmen of the time would have been terrified if it had.They took to the drug simply because it was fashionable and—assoon as they got over the initial reaction of giddiness or nausea—enjoyable.It provided a mild 'lift', when that was desired; or it assistedrelaxation. But it had one unwelcome consequence. It created acraving so powerful that by the 1890s, the writer of an Englishherbal was complaining that some men could not restrain themselvesfrom having a smoke, 'no, not in the middle of their dinner'. Smoking happened to become fashionable in England at a time whenPuritanism was also establishing itself, based on an ethic closerto that of John the Baptist than of Jesus. The Puritan was notthen in a position to deny tobacco's medicinal virtues, but itdid not escape him that the people who smoked it were rarely concernedfor their health. It was consequently possible to argue that becausetobacco 'drinking' (as it was then often described, in the senseof 'drinking it all in') was not confined to specific doses atcertain times of day, it could actually be harmful— like otherdrugs whose dosage was inadequately regulated: particularly tothe young. Here, the Puritan found allies in the nobility andgentry who, even if they themselves liked to smoke, were apt tobe indignant when their sons insisted on following the fashion.Ben Jonson portrayed the type—the clown Sogliardo in EveryMan out of his Humour, 'so enamoured of the name of a gentlemanthat he will have it, though he buys it. He comes up every termto learn to take tobacco'. The parents suffered—'the patrimonyof many noble young gentlemen', Edmund Gardner, author of theTrial of Tobacco, observed, had 'vanished clear away withthis smoky vapour'. It was this aspect of the dangers of tobacco that 'Philaretes'emphasised in his Work for Chimney Sweepers, which appearedin 1602, denouncing smoking as a 'pestiferous vice'. Still freshin the memory, he recalled, were reports that divers young Gentlemen, by the daily use of this tobacco,have brought themselves to fluxes and dysentries, and of lateat Bath a scholar of some good account and worshipful callingwas supposed to have perished by this practice, for his humoursbeing sharpened and made thin by the frequent use of tobacco,after that they had once taken a course downward, they ran insuch violence, that by no art or physician's skill could theybe stayed, till the man most miserably ended his life, being thenin the very prime and vigour of his age. Philaretes explained how this had happened. Tobacco, he asserted,worked by evaporating man's 'unctuous and radical moistures'—aswas demonstrated in the fact that it was employed to cure gonorrheaby drying up the discharge. But this process, if too long continued,could only end by drying up 'spermatical humidity', too, renderinghim incapable of propagation. Experience also showed that tobaccoleft men in a state of depression, 'mopishness and sottishness',which in the long run must damage memory, imagination and understanding.Nor was it any use the defenders of tobacco arguing that the Indianstook it without such ill-effects; the Indians had accustomed themselvesto taking it from childhood. Tobacco: counterblast Work for Chimney Sweepers was the first of scores of similarpamphlets which were to appear later on the same theme, denouncingthe use of tobacco—and later of other drugs—for non-medicalpurposes. Whatever the drug, the writer was likely to claim thatit was physically and mentally destructive, if not in its immediateeffects, then in the long term; that it put the youth of the countryparticularly at risk—as some scarifying illustration from Bath(or Baden, or Ballston Spa, N.Y.) would demonstrate; and thatit had a sinister past record. As the composer of the prototypicalbroadside, Philaretes could be cited as deserving of some smallniche in the history of drugs. But his offering was to be overshadowedby the more famous Counterblast to Tobacco which came outtwo years later, in 1604—its anonymous author's identity notbeing concealed for long: James I, newly ascended to the Britishthrone. In certain respects, the Counterblast was ahead of itstime. James did not waste time trying to explode tobacco's reputationas a cure-all by citing examples of its failures; he contentedhimself with exposing the contradictions in the claims made onits behalf. It cures the gout in the feet and (which is miraculous) in thatvery instant when the smoke thereof—light—flies up into thehead, the virtue thereof—as heavy—runs down to the littletoe. It helps all sorts of agues. It makes a man sober that wasdrunk. It refreshes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry. Beingtaken on going to bed, it makes one sleep soundly; and yet beingtaken when a man is sleepy and drowsy, it will, as they say, awakehis brain, and quicken his understanding. As for the curing ofthe Pox, it serves for that use only among the poxy Indian slaves.Here in England it is refined, and will not deign to cure hereany other than cleanly and gentlemanly diseases. Omnipotent powerof tobacco! James also emphasised tobacco's most commonly encountered perniciouseffect: 'many in this kingdom have had such a continual use oftaking this unsavoury smoke, they are not now able to resist thesame, no more than an old drunkard can abide to be long sober'.But he spoiled his case by clearly hinting at one of the reasonsfor his dislike of tobacco: his hatred of Raleigh. Nor could heresist the temptation to set out his arguments against tobaccoin the form of literary conceits. Tobacco, he sought to prove,was 'the lively image and pattern of hell', because it had init all the vices for which man might expect hell to await him: to wit; first, it was a smoke; so are the vanities of this world.Secondly, it delighteth them who take it; so do the pleasuresof the world delight the men of the world. Thirdly, it makethmen drunken, and light in the head; so do the vanities of theworld, men are drunken therewith. Fourthly, he that taketh tobaccosaith he cannot leave it, it doth bewitch him; even so, the pleasuresof the world make men loath to leave them, they are for the mostpart so enchanted with them; and further, besides all this, itis like hell in the very substance of it, for it is a stinkingloathsome thing; and so is hell. It was a little too pat, confirming that James was less the shrewdobserver of the effects of the drug that he appeared to be, thanthe diligent collector of all the possible rationalisations whichcould be mustered against it. That autumn, James informed the High Treasurer of England thatall importers of tobacco would have to pay, in addition to thecustoms duty of 2d a pound that Elizabeth had imposed, the sumof 6/8d; an increase of 4,000 per cent. It was the first attemptof its kind to get rid of a drug by indirect prohibition—byimposing a tax so heavy that only the very rich would be ableto afford to buy it. And this discrimination was deliberate. Whentobacco had been discovered, the preamble recalled, it had beentaken 'by the better sort', only as physic. But it had recently,'through evil custom and the toleration thereof, been taken inexcess by a number of riotous and disorderly persons of mean andbase condition who, contrary to the usages of which persons ofgood calling and quality make, spend most of their time in idlevanity, to the evil example and corrupting of others'. They alsospent too much of their wages, which they ought to be spendingon their families, 'not caring at what price they buy'; so thatpeople's health was being impaired, making them unfit for work,and consuming their resources, and also the country's, because'a great part of the treasure of our land is spent and exhaustedby this drug alone'. James, in other words, had been moved toaction less because of the drug's effect on his subjects' health,than because it might make them less loyal and hard-working. Menwho took time off to smoke could be expected to expend much ofthat time in talk; and the talk might turn to gunpowder, treasonand plot . . . To judge by the Counterblast, James would have preferredto ban tobacco outright; but that could possibly have been dangerous,with so many pipe-smokers among the Court circle; and it wouldcertainly have been difficult, with tobacco in such demand asa medicine. So the intention—the preamble continued—was simplyto provide a restraint on consumption, in order to reduce theamount being imported, while leaving 'sufficient store to servefor the necessary use of those who are of the better sort, andhave and will use the same with moderation to preserve their health'.But the new duty, James soon found, had precisely the oppositeeffect to that which he had intended. The people who used tobaccoto cure ailments, finding it so expensive, were forced back onolder herbal remedies which cost little or nothing. Those whohad begun to smoke for pleasure, however, and become addictedcould not bear to do without their pipefuls. And although withso heavy a duty to be paid, merchants did indeed, as James hadhoped, find it less profitable to import tobacco, this only meantthat they found it more profitable to smuggle it. In the decadethat followed the introduction of the duty, tobacco consumptioncontinued to increase, not least among the poor. 'There is notso base a groom'—the pamphleteer Barnabe Rich complained in1614— that comes into the alehouse to call for his pot, but he musthave his pipe of tobacco, for it is a commodity that is now assaleable in every tavern, inn, and ale house, as either wine,ale or beer, and in apothecaries' shops, grocers' shops, chandlers'shops, they are (almost) never without company, that from morningto night are still taking of tobacco; what a number are therebesides, that keep houses, or open shops, which have no othertrade to live by but the selling of tobacco. Tobacco: fund-raiser In ordinary circumstances James, with his sublime intellectualarrogance, would have been likely to try stiffer measures to checksmuggling. But that would have meant increased expenditure, whichhe was in no position to undertake. He was chronically desperatefor funds; and the signs that tobacco smoking was on the increasehad suggested a way to secure them. In 1608 he had ordered a reductionin the duty to a shilling a pound, selling the right to collectit to one of his favourites, Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery.Tobacco imports began to rise so rapidly that James found he hadsold himself short; in 1615 he revoked the deal (paying Montgomerycompensation) so that he could sell the right to collect the dutyfor a sum more closely approximating to what it would be worthto the patent holder—£16,000 a year, by 1620. For the remainder of James's reign solvency was the essentialconsideration. By farming out the duty, he in effect ensured thatit would be kept as high as it could go without causing the importerto switch to smuggling. But the importers were not the only problem.Distributors and retailers, it was found, were stretching theirstocks by adulterating the tobacco with ground up stalks and leavesof other plants, and disguising the thinness of the flavour byadding small quantities of spirits, and spices, to delude thecustomer—unlike Jonson's Abel Drugger: He lets me have good tobacco, and he does not Sophisticate it with sack, lees, or oil Nor washes it in muscadel and grains Nor buries it in gravel, underground Wrapped up in greasy leather, or piss'd clouts. 'Sophistication' was frowned on by the authorities because itlost them revenue. When half of what was sold was no longer puretobacco, this meant, in effect, that duty was being paid onlyon one out of two pipefuls smoked. The practice became so notoriousthat James had to intervene to authorise the inspection of stocksheld by retailers. As a result, before the end of his reign hefound himself setting himself up as guardian of the purity ofthe drug which twenty years before he had tried to suppress. Andthe irony only began there. The British colonists in Virginia,who for some years had almost despaired of being able to survive,experimented in 1611 with growing tobacco. The flavour happenedto appeal to the British smoker. It was very much in James's financialinterest that this taste should be encouraged because, as theHouse of Commons was told in 1620, the amount of sterling leavingthe country in bullion to pay for tobacco had reached six figures.Such vast (for that period) sums were better channelled into Britishcolonies—helping them to become self-supporting, and eventuallyto contribute to the Treasury—than shipped to swell the treasurechests of Portugal and Spain. Without wishing it, therefore—to the end of his life, Jamescontinued to recall 'the dislike which we have always had of theuse of tobacco in general', and to share the uneasiness of theVirginia Company about allowing the colony's economy to rely ona 'deceivable weed', the fashion for which 'must soon vanish intosmoke'—the British Government had embarked upon a course ofeconomic imperialism, based on two assumptions. One was that ascolonies were revenue-raising enterprises—or at least, it washoped, financially self-supporting—they must be allowed, andif necessary encouraged, to produce any commodity which couldbe sold profitably, even if it were not regarded as desirablein itself. The other was that if the commodity were not regardedas desirable in itself, its manufacture and sale could alwaysbe excused by pointing out that people were going to buy it anyway,so they might as well buy a British product. By this means, qualitywould be ensured; and the profits would benefit the British taxpayer. Tobacco: banned Hypocritical though James's attitude to tobacco became, at leasthis policies were flexible enough to be administratively feasible.In other parts of the Old World, the reaction of rulers to theintroduction of tobacco was generally the same, but they oftenpreferred to take what must have appeared to be the simplest course;outright prohibition of the drug, with severe penalties for anybodycaught selling or taking it. Visiting Constantinople in 1611, George Sandys was told that onthe orders of the Sultan Amurath a man caught smoking had beenparaded through the streets mounted facing backwards on an ass,with a pipe drawn through the cartilage of his nose. In Iran,the Sultan's brother Shah Abbas imposed similar penalties; SirThomas Herbert, arriving there with a British delegation in 1628,found that Abbas had sentenced two merchants who had been caughtimporting tobacco to have their noses and ears cut off; and theirconsignment, forty camel loads, was burned—its 'black vapourgave the whole city infernal incense for two whole days and nightstogether'. Both rulers, when such punishments proved insufficientto check smuggling, introduced the death penalty. Jean Tavernier,visiting Iran in the 1670s, was told that some rich merchantsfound smoking in an inn had been punished, by Abbas's heir, asbefitted the nature of their crime, by having molten lead poureddown their throats. In India, the Great Mogul Jehangir Khan decreedthat anybody found smoking should have his lips slit. When ambassadorsfrom the Duke of Holstein arrived in Moscow in 1634, they saweight men and a woman publicly knouted for selling tobacco, andthe death penalty was decreed that year for habitual offenders. The fashion of tobacco-smoking for some reason took longer tospread through Europe; but by the middle of the seventeenth centuryseveral states had laws against it. In the Canton of Berne, wherethe laws were related to the Ten Commandments, tobacco smokingwas put in the same category as adultery, punishable by fines,the pillory, and imprisonment. And when this failed, the Cantonset up a special Tobacco Court, modelled on the Inquisition, withpayments for informers and harsh penalties for those who wereconvicted. These laws and penalties, admittedly, were not based exclusivelyon the objection to tobacco as a drug. The Tsar Michael claimedalso to be concerned about fire hazards; there were objectionsto the fumes and the spitting which accompanied smoking; and therewas the fear that where men smoked together, they might be conspiringtogether. But whatever the motive, and however savage the penalties,the result was everywhere the same; prohibition was an utter failure.Sandys noted that in spite of the warning given by the sight ofthe convicted smoker paraded round Constantinople, people continuedto smoke clandestinely. Tavernier found men and women in Persia'so addicted to tobacco that to take their tobacco from them,is to take away their lives'. Everywhere, eventually, the ban had to be lifted, and tobaccoallowed in. Its consumption was in future to be restricted onlyby a variety of Government expedients to make money out of itby the levying of customs or excise duties—or by a state monopolyof the kind Richelieu introduced in France and which lasts tothis day; and by local by-laws, directed not against tobacco asa drug, but against its unwelcome social side-effects. Tobacco: tamed How did it come about that tobacco, from being the drug most commonlyused to induce visions in the New World, should have soon beendomesticated in Europe; so that, as the flow of tributes fromessayists and poets reveal, it was welcomed as a mild mental stimulant,stirring ideas, and as a mild tranquilliser, soothing away nervoustensions? The tobacco smoked in Europe may not have been as strongas that used by the Indians, and it was probably not taken insuch powerful doses; but that is not sufficient to account forthe difference. The most likely explanation is that the Europeanmind had been carried too far from its moorings in instinct fortobacco to be capable of producing the trance state; and therewas no shamanist tradition which could have been taken up to exploittobacco in the way the medicine man was accustomed to do. When tobacco smokers were seen to be physically no worse off fortheir indulgence—their semen did not dry up, and many of themlived on into old age—suspicions died; and during the GreatPlague, tobacco attained respectability even among those who,like Samuel Pepys, had feared it as a dangerous drug. In the springof 1665 he saw how a cat could be killed by 'the oil of tobacco';but a month later the sight of doors marked with a red cross andthe inscription 'Lord Have Mercy Upon Us' prompted him to resortto it: 'I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell and tochew, which took away the apprehension.' And with a growing senseof Britain's maritime destiny, the tobacco trade attained fullrespectability, coming to be regarded not simply as a commercial,but as a national, asset. When an increase in the tobacco dutywas mooted in 1685, a critic of the project was quick to pointout that in addition to bringing in so much revenue, and providingthe colonists with the wherewithal to buy vast quantities of Englishmanufactures, 'the tobacco trade employed nearly two hundred ships,the breeding ground of many mariners'. In America, too, tobacco-smoking among the colonists followedthe pattern newly established in Europe. Even the Indians beganto use it more for ritual and symbolic purposes—the 'pipe ofpeace'. In some States where tobacco was not grown attempts weremade to curb consumption: Massachusetts banned smoking in company(even among consenting adults) in 1632, and three years latertried to stop its sale by retailers. But such regulations provedunenforceable, and tobacco developed into an industry second onlyin importance to alcoholic liquor. The effects on the health ofthe community cannot now be estimated; but some idea of the socialand economic significance of the development was provided by JosephC. Robert in The Story of Tobacco in America, publishedin 1949. Tobacco not merely saved the Virginia settlement; it created the pattern of the Southern plantation; encouraged theintroduction of Negro slavery, then softened the institution;begot an immortal group of colonial leaders; strained the bondsbetween mother country and Chesapeake colonies; burdened the diplomacyof the post-Revolutionary period; promoted the Louisiana purchase;and, after the Civil War, helped to create the New South . . .Dispute and violence are milestones along this tobacco road; Culpeper'sRebellion marked the seventeenth century, the Black Patch warthe twentieth. Colonial Virginians used tobacco as money; in theconfusion following the Second World War the American cigarettewas currency 'from Paris to Peking'. Tea: coffee Tobacco was the only drug from the Americas which caught on inthe Old World; but in the middle of the seventeenth century twoother drugs which had not been known before in Europe began toappear from the East: tea—which Pepys recorded as a noveltyin 1661—and coffee. Both were originally introduced, as tobaccohad been, for medicinal purposes—the apothecary telling Mrs.Pepys it was 'good for her cold and defluxions'. Both, like tobacco,aroused authority's suspicion when it was found they were beingtaken for pleasure. Coffee came from the Middle East, where its appearance had soalarmed the authorities in Mecca and Cairo that they had triedto prohibit its sale, with regulations that all stocks found shouldbe burned, and all people found drinking it punished. As withIndian hemp, earlier, the accusation was that coffee was an intoxicant—areputation which Sir Anthony Shirley, one of three brothers witha reputation as travellers in far-away lands, confirmed afterhe had tasted it in Aleppo in 1598. So when it was introducedinto Europe, a number of rulers reacted to it as their forbearshad reacted a century before to tobacco, decreeing fines, imprisonmentand corporal punishment for those involved in its distributionor consumption. But the tendency was to regard it as a dangerchiefly to the lower orders; the aristocracy reserved the rightto drink coffee. Inevitably such qualified prohibition provedunworkable; and rulers soon switched to the method King Jameshad pioneered, taxing it instead. Tea did not attract the same hostility because, except in Britain,it continued for two centuries to be sold by druggists, and boughtby the public, chiefly as a remedy for internal disorders (itwas to surprise the town of Angouleme when Balzac's Mme Bargetongave a tea party, as tea was still sold there in chemists' shopsfor indigestion—for which purpose the cure of Yonville was torecommend it to Madame Bovary). In Britain, where it became popularas a pick-me-up, it provoked some virulent attacks from satiristsand from politicians; Henry Savile told Mr. Secretary Coventryin 1678 that it was a base, unworthy and filthy substitute forwine. But by then it was too late. One of Charles II's first actsat his restoration had been to impose a duty on tea; and it hadproved to be one of his most profitable fiscal expedients. Whenthe traveller and philanthropist Jonas Hanway tried to launcha campaign against it a century later, he had against him notonly Dr. Johnson—'a hardened and shameless tea drinker' as hedescribed himself, 'who with tea amuses the evening, with teasolaces the midnight, and with tea welcomes the morning'—butalso almost the entire population of Britain, poor and rich alike,who by this time were consuming it in such quantities that ithad become one of the State's chief sources of revenue.

The reason, the American anthropologist Professor WestonLa Barre has suggested, is simple; that shamanism had survivedin the Americas, and it was 'so to speak, culturally programmedfor an interest in hallucinogens and other psychotropic drugs'.And not only for an interest in them: the medicine man, by trainingas well as by instinct, knew how to exploit drugs. The Europeans,taught as they were to regard divination as the work of the devil,were culturally programmed to regard vision-inducing plant drugsas his instrument. In Europe, this was not a problem; though witchesmight use them, they were not ordinarily encountered in everydaylife, and few people would have thought of experimenting withthem. But the drugs found in use in the New World appeared tobe a direct threat to Church and State—not then differentiated;and the tendency, wherever shamanist drug-practices were found,was to try to suppress them. Coca Drugs came under attack even when they were widely used for secularpurposes, as medicines, or to increase endurance—as in the caseof coca, in Peru. The Inca religion had retained an element ofshamanism, and coca was one of the drugs used by the diviner-prieststo help themselves into a trance; or, where that art had beenlost, the diviner burned the leaves so that he could 'see' comingevents in the curling smoke. Infusions of coca were taken at festivals;corpses were buried with coca, to help them over the Inca equivalentof the Styx; there was a 'Coca Mama'—the equivalent of the CornMother of other cults; and coca was included in sacrifices, onthe principle that whatever was most valued should be given upto the gods. Appalled at these manifestations of idolatry, missionariesand priests were soon denouncing coca. It was formally condemnedat the first Ecclesiastical Council held in Lima in 1551, andagain in 1567 as connected with the work of idolatry and sorcery,'strengthening the wicked in their delusions, and asserted byevery competent judge to possess no true virtues; but, on thecontrary, to cause the deaths of innumerable Indians, while itruins the health of the few who survive.' The civil authorities had their own reasons for mistrusting coca.Anything so closely linked with Inca tradition was likely to becomeidentified with it, in the minds of those who cherished the hopeof overthrowing Spanish rule. There was also a more practicalreason for suppressing the use of the drug. It was taken by workersthroughout the day, pouched in the cheek, and replenished whennecessary. The need for replenishment did not suit employers,who felt it was an unnecessary expense. By a simple device, theyhad ensured that labour in Peru would be both readily availableand cheap; a tax had been imposed on every Indian of working age,which meant that the male population had to find work, in orderto be able to pay it. The tax was nicely judged to leave the workerwith only nominal wages—a penny a day—and his keep. As partof his keep, however, he expected a ration of coca. Why, employersnaturally asked themselves, should they have to provide him notonly with food and water but with a luxury—worse, a drug condemnedby the Church? Prohibition was demanded, and in ordinary circumstances, couldhave been expected to follow. But those Spaniards who had establishedthemselves as the owners of the coca plantations on the slopesof the Andes had quickly made their fortunes. From 1548 to 1551,the Spanish chronicler Cieza de Leon recalled, 'there was nota root, nor anything gathered from a tree, except spice, whichwas in such estimation', and they grew rich on the proceeds. Theywere not inclined to let the source of their wealth be wrestedfrom them; and their profits gave them the means to campaign inLima and in Madrid to save their business from extinction. Prohibition,they claimed, would be impracticable. The coca plantations mightbe ploughed up, but this would not stop the plant from being grownillicitly. And what evidence was there that coca was bad for theIndians? On the contrary, not merely did it help them to worklong hours; it provided them with the necessary stimulus to dothe work—coca being the only currency available to them. These were arguments which could be expected to make some impressionon the Government, in its capacity as an employer. More surprisingly,they also made an impression on the Church. A Spanish priest,Blas Valera, who worked in Peru in the early years of the seventeenthcentury—and who thought highly of coca, particularly as a medicine—describedhow the change of heart came about. Some people, he recalled,had been hostile, 'moved only by the fact that in former timesthe heathen offered coca to their idols, as some wizards and divinersstill do'. Because of this, they had argued that coca should besuppressed. If the Incas had offered coca and nothing else intheir sacrifices, this might have been reasonable. But they hadalso sacrificed cattle; was beef therefore to be banned ? On reflection,it had been decided that it would be best not to ban coca, butinstead, to instruct the natives how to avail themselves of God'sgifts in a Christian fashion. This resolution, Valera noted, hadnot been without its benefits to the Church; 'the income of thebishop, canons and other priests of the Catholic Church of Cuzcois derived from the tithe on the coca leaf'. So the Indians, though they were punished if they were caughtusing coca in religious observances, were allowed to take it whileworking, in order that they might be able to put in still longerhours. The consequences were to be summarised four centuries laterby John Hemming, in The Conquest of the Incas: Coca plantations lay at the edge of humid forests, thousands offeet below the natural habitat of the Andean Indians. This didnot deter Spanish planters and merchants who made huge profitsfrom the coca trade. They forced highland natives to leave theirencomiendas and work in the hot plantations. The changeof climate was devastating to Indians with lungs enlarged by evolutionto breathe thin air. Antonio de Zuniga wrote to the King: 'Everyyear among the natives who go to this plant a great number ofYour Majesty's vassals perish.' There were also ugly diseasesin the plantations. A tiny mosquito-like dipterous insect thatlives between 2,500 and 9,500 feet in the Andean foothills carriesthe destructive 'verruga' or wart disease, in which victims dieof eruptive nodules and severe anemia. Coca workers also caughtthe dreaded 'mal de los Andes' or uta, which destroys thenose, lips and throat and causes a painful death. Bartolome deVega described the native hospital of Cuzco 'where there are normallytwo hundred Indians with their noses eaten away by the cancer'.Those who escaped the diseases returned to their mountain villagesdebilitated from the heat and undernourishment; they were easilyrecognisable, pale, weak and listless. Contemporary authoritiesestimated that between a third and half of the annual quota ofcoca-workers died as a result of their five-month service. Decrees from Lima, and even from King Philip in Madrid, triedto regulate working hours and conditions. The frequency with whichthey had to be repeated—one Viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, issuedover twenty ordinances designed to protect the Indians—suggeststhat they were not obeyed; not, at least, until wastage reducedthe supply of labour to the point when the employers in theirown self-interest had to begin to treat their workers with moreconsideration, or risk having too few of them to harvest the cocacrop. This pattern was to be repeated in colonised territories. Missionariesdisliked shamanism and the drugs associated with it because theywere pagan; the colonial authorities, because they might be afocus for unrest, and for law-breaking. But where a plant drugcould be exploited commercially, farmers, entrepreneurs and traderswould find reasons for permitting, and encouraging, its consumption.They would use their influence to persuade the colonial authoritiesthat it was essential to the colony's economy; and—particularlyif they could extract revenue out of the drug—the colonial authoritieswould usually allow themselves to be persuaded. Peyotl Where commercial considerations were unimportant, either becausethe drug was taken exclusively in shamanist rites, or becauseit could not be cultivated, the Church was more likely to haveits way: as it did with the peyotl cactus. As late as the middleof the seventeenth century, when Francisco Hernandez publishedhis pioneering work on the flora and fauna of Mexico, he was stillcareful to intimate his disapproval of the way certain of theplants he described were used. By eating peyote he noted, theIndians 'can foresee and predict anything; for instance, whetherenemies are going to attack them the following day? Whether theywill continue in favourable circumstances? Who has stolen householdgoods? And other things of this sort.' Far from being impressed,when Hernandez described what peyotl looked like he observed thatit 'scarcely issues forth, as if it did not wish to harm thosewho discover it and eat it'. Similarly with ololiuqui— the 'morningglory'; when the priests wished to commune with their gods, andto receive messages from them, they ate it to induce a delirium,in which 'a thousand visions and satanic hallucinations appearedto them'. A catechism used in Mexico in that period reveals thepriests' attitude. 'Art thou a soothsayer?' each convert wouldbe asked. Dost thou foretell events by reading signs, or interpreting dreams,or by water, making circles and figures on the surface? Dost thousuck the blood of others, or dost thou wander about at night,calling upon the demon to help thee ? Hast thou drunk peyote orhast thou given it to others to drink, in order to find out secretsor to discover where stolen or lost articles were ? In 1620, peyotl was formally denounced: We, the Inquisitors against heretical perversity and apostasy,by virtue of apostolic authority declare, inasmuch as the herbor root called peyotl has been introduced into these provincesfor the purposes of detecting thefts, of divining other happenings,and of foretelling future events, it is an act of superstition,to be condemned as opposed to the purity and integrity of ourholy Catholic faith. The fantasies suggest intervention of thedevil, the real authority of this vice. The civil authorities shared the Inquisition's views. They, too—accordingto the chronicler Fr Joseph de Acosta—were impressed by theevidence that under the influence of peyotl shamans were able'to report mutinies, battles, revolts and death occurring 200or 300 leagues distant, on the very day they took place, or theday after'. That divination could provide such a rapid communicationservice was an excellent reason for banning consumption of thedrug. With characteristic cunning, however, the devil had providedalternatives; as well as ololiuqui, there were tobacco, daturaand certain types of mushroom. All that Church and State coulddo was ban the drug cult ceremonies; and when the risk of holdingthem openly became too great, the cults continued underground. Alcohol: Siberia Suppression was not the only weapon with which colonists couldattack indigenous drug cults. They brought their own substitutedrug with them: alcohol. Along with beer and wine, they introducedspirits: brandy, whiskey, gin and rum. Traders found it convenientto use them to lubricate negotiations, buying and selling; andthen, as merchandise in their own right. The results were often depressing. When the Russians began theconquest of Siberia at the end of the sixteenth century, theydetermined to put down shamanism; and to that end they bannedthe consumption of the fly agaric—a futile gesture; the naturalistNikolai Sljunin observed in 1900 that the law was 'completelyignored'. The introduction of vodka by traders proved a more effectiveweapon. Vodka was cheap—and readily available, unlike mushrooms,all the year round. But not merely did it fail to provide theshaman with visions; it actually blocked them— coming to beregarded, according to Sljunin, as an antidote to the mushroom'seffects. The evidence, in fact, suggests that it was not drugswhich made Siberian shamanism decadent, as Mircea Eliade claimed;it was one particular drug, alcohol, which destroyed the shaman'sability to induce a trance, and tempted him to fake it, and deludethe company with conjuring tricks. Alcohol: Tahiti Traditionally, the saddest story of the effects of alcohol concernsTahiti. When the island was discovered in the 1760s, the crewswho had been there returned with glowing accounts of a paradise,where the people lived free from worldly cares, doing little workbecause most of their wants were provided for by nature; enjoyingsexual relations uninhibitedly because they were untroubled bythe taboos or the guilt which Christianity had attached to them;and in general appearing to lead a wonderfully contented existence.Their only mild intoxicant came from a root which, when groundup, could be made into the drink kava; and was taken only on ceremonialoccasions. Though Captain Cook's crew were told that it couldmake men drunk, they never saw this happen. When first offeredalcoholic drinks, their Tahitian guests took them in all innocence,became drunk, and—after experiencing hangovers—took care notto get drunk again, 'shunning a repetition of it', Joseph Banksobserved in his account of the visit, 'instead of greedily desiringit as most Indians are said to do'. It was as if the islanders,close to nature as they were, had no need of artificial intoxication;they lived in the happy state which Europeans tried in vain toreach with the help of alcohol. Before long, however, as more ships began to call, some Tahitiansbegan to develop a taste for alcohol; particularly members ofthe ruling families, who were recipients of much of the hospitality.The missionaries, who by this time were establishing themselves,abetted the process. On arrival, they had determined to compelthe Tahitians to cover their nakedness, and to cease their uninhibitedsexual play. They were also anxious to put an end to Tahitianreligious rites—among them, the ceremonial drinking of kava—becausethey were pagan. To implement these reforms, however, they hadto win the Paramount Chief's support. The heir, Pomare II, intimatedthat he was willing to back the missionaries, so long as theydid not interfere with his personal pleasures. Arriving in 1802on his voyage round the world John Turnbull found the royal familydemoralised by excess, and Pomare an alcoholic and a public menace.Under the influence of drink, Turnbull feared, he would not scrupleto kill anybody who annoyed him. What possible benefit—Diderot had asked—could Christians withtheir hypocrisy, guilt and ambition, bring to the South Sea islanders?They would arrive, he warned, 'with crucifix in one hand and daggerin the other, to cut your throats or force you to accept theircustoms and opinions'. Gin bottle in the other, would have beennearer the mark; but Diderot's warning—'one day under theirrule you will be almost as unhappy as they are'—was soon shownto be justified. Tahitians lost their childlike innocence, whichmade even their pilfering endearing; they had to wear 'MotherHubbards'; they had to work; they were no longer happy; and theydrank. When William Ellis arrived on Tahiti as a missionary in1817, he found Turnbull's fears had been justified. Under Pomare,intemperance prevailed 'to an awful and unprecedented degree'.On impulse, men would get together to erect a still, and thenover a period of days consume its product, 'sinking into a stateof indescribable wretchedness, and often practising the most ferociousbarbarities'. While the liquor lasted they were more like demonsthan human beings; and after it was finished, sometimes in a deserted still-house might be seen fragments ofthe rude boiler, and the other appendages of the still, scatteredin confusion on the ground; and among them, the dead and mangledbodies of those who had been murdered with axes or billets ofwood in the quarrels that had terminated their debauch. As soon as they had established their authority, the missionariestried to stop the islanders from drinking spirits; but with somany ships coming in, the task was hopeless. Among the arrivalswas the Beagle, in 1835. When Darwin offered the Tahitianguides a drink they 'put their fingers before their mouths anduttered the word "missionary" '—but they did not refuse.'The natives having nothing at all to do', Gauguin reported halfa century later, 'think of one thing only: drinking.' Was alcohol the cause of the destruction of Tahiti's island paradise,or were there more insidious reasons? Other Pacific islands weregiven much the same introduction to colonialism and Christianity;not all of them were so marked by it. Pondering this on his tourof the Pacific, early in the 1890s, Robert Louis Stevenson cameto the conclusion that it was unwise to put the blame for whathad happened there either on gin or on 'Tartuffe insisting onunhygienic clothes'. No single cause, he felt, was responsiblefor decay, where it was to be found. What was decisive was theamount of dislocation involved in the islanders' way of life:'where there have been fewest changes, important or unimportant,salutary or hurtful, there the race survives. Where there havebeen most, important or unimportant, salutary or hurtful, thereit perishes.' J. W. Anderson, who had travelled around among the Pacific islandsin the 1870s, was of the same opinion. He cited the stabilityof Fiji as an example. There, he found, yangona (as kava was known)was still taken in an elaborate ritual. First, young men and womenwith good teeth were employed to chew the root, until it was ofthe right consistency to be put in a bowl of water and its juicessqueezed out. The resulting liquid appeared 'greenish-grey andmuddy-looking'; it tasted to him like 'a mixture of rhubarb, magnesiaand soapsuds'; and it left those who drank it rather unsteadyon their feet. So the missionaries wanted to ban the ceremony—asdid some employers, who disapproved of the time it wasted; islanderswould drop whatever they were doing to attend. But it had notbeen banned; rightly, Anderson felt. The chewing process mightappear to be disgusting (and to spread unmentionable diseases);the kava itself might be debilitating, to anybody who took itto excess. But in moderation it did no harm. The islanders, infact, regarded it as a purifier of the blood. And even those whotook so much of it that they became intoxicated displayed 'neitherunseemly behaviour nor incoherency of speech', but rather showed'an inclination to remain mute in a mood of happy dreaminess'.In the circumstances, Anderson hoped, kava drinking would continue,'for the chances are that by and by, its substitute will be "yangonapapalangi" that is, white man's grog; and we are toowell aware what havoc the fire water plays among savages who oncetake a liking to it'. Alcohol: America As Anderson's reference showed, alcohol had become notorious forits effects on primitive communities; particularly in North America,where distilled liquors had been unknown before the arrival ofthe colonists from Europe. As in the Pacific, it was the traderswho introduced the American Indians to 'fire water'; and the Indians,unaccustomed to intoxication (tobacco was ordinarily used forthat purpose by the shaman, but not by members of the tribe, exceptunder his guidance) developed a craving for it. Towards the endof the seventeenth century missionaries were beginning to reportthe dire consequences, 'Lewdness, adulteries, incest, and severalother crimes which decency keeps me from naming'—Father ChrestienLe Clerq wrote of a tribe on the Gulf of St. Lawrence—'are theusual disorders which are committed through the trade in brandy,of which some traders make use in order to abuse the Indian women,who yield themselves readily during their drunkenness to all kindsof indecency.' The places where the Indians drank brandy, anothermissionary wrote in 1705, were 'an image of hell. Fire flies inall directions, blows with hatchets and knives make the bloodflow on all sides. They commit a thousand abominations—the motherwith her sons, the father with his daughters, and brothers withtheir sisters. They roll about on the cinders and coals, and inblood.' It was stories such as these to which Anderson (and Banks, a centuryearlier) were referring; the assumption then being that alcoholhad been the really destructive influence. But this view has recentlybeen challenged by Craig MacAndrew and Robert Edgerton in theirDrunken Comportment: a social explanation, published in1969. They were able to show that the American Indians, like theTahitians, when they first tried spirits were attracted by thenovelty of the experience—'a merry-go of the brain', as oneof them described it—but for a while were not adversely affected.So long as their experience was 'untutored by expectations tothe contrary'—MacAndrew and Edgerton claimed—'the result wasneither the development of an all-consuming craving nor an epicof drunken mayhem and debauchery'. That epic only came when theirway of life had been destroyed by the settlers, and their culturedebased—another instance of the destructive power of changewhich Stevenson had observed. But there was more to it, MacAndrew and Edgerton decided, thansimple change. The consumption of spirits brought out a traitwhich had already existed in their tribal societies: cruelty.The Red Indians had been notoriously cruel to captured foes, practisingtortures on them of the most savage but sophisticated kind. Theynow learned from the white traders that a man should not be heldresponsible for what he did under the influence of drink. Alcoholtherefore provided them both with the stimulus and the excuseto repeat the kind of behaviour they had formerly indulged in,with tradition's sanction, when they captured a member of an enemytribe. It was not the drug, therefore, that was responsible for the waypeople behaved under its influence. The drug was simply the releasemechanism, the behaviour being largely conditioned by expectations.Where the expectations from an established drug were of gentleintoxication, as with kava, it was in the colonists' self-interestto encourage it, and discourage the sale of spirits; and wherethis became settled policy, as on Fiji, the results appeared satisfactory—asBasil Thomson, who spent many years in Fiji around the turn ofthe century, recalled in his memoirs. Although the missionarieshad continued to wage their campaign against yangona with 'a fieryzeal', the civil authorities had contented themselves with regulationschiefly designed to try to restrict its use to precisely the ceremonialoccasions that the missionaries most deplored. As a magistrate,Thomson had to enforce this policy; and he came to the conclusionit was justified, because the vice of kava drinking 'if it isa vice at all, cannot reasonably be condemned for bringing inits train any of these social evils that are due to alcohol'. But colonial authorities were sometimes less far-sighted; andthey could not, as a rule, stop the introduction of alcohol. Norwas it easy for them to prevent the erosion of traditional culturesand beliefs. Shamanism had been based on certain assumptions whichChristianity and, later, the even more powerful force of rationalismchallenged. Inexorably, the shaman's authority was eroded. Hemight still get his visions from tobacco, or other drugs. Butthey were of little comfort to the tribe if they predicted, correctly,that it was futile to oppose the superior power wielded by thewhite man—and disastrous when they incorrectly roused expectations,as occasionally they did, that the white man was going to be destroyedby a whirlwind, or some other form of divine retribution. WhenSitting Bull smoked, and gave a hundred pieces of his flesh, beforedancing the Sun Dance, his aim was to receive a vision; and hehad one, which revealed that white soldiers were coming, and thatthe Sioux would slaughter them. The Sioux duly did, when Custerand his force appeared. But the vision had not revealed what wasto follow: the massacre of the Indians at Wounded Knee, whichbanished their last hope of successful resistance. In such circumstances, vision-inducing drugs were a hazard; andshamanist observances came to rely more upon ritual—or on alcohol.Where alcohol was involved, they often came to resemble saturnalia,of the kind Ruth Underhill described in her study of the religionof the Papago Indians. At the annual rainmaking ceremony the shamanwas still employed, but only as a subordinate. The most importantrole was that of the brewer, who made the fermented liquor fromcactus fruit; the shaman being required simply to protect thebrew from harmful influences. If he failed, he rather than thebrewer would suffer for it. The principle which had attached itselfto the ceremony was that 'the saturation of the body with liquortypifies and produces the saturation of the earth with rain';the aim was to get everybody concerned 'full', without any expectationof visions, let alone of clairvoyance. Neophytes, admittedly,were encouraged to 'dream' songs which could be added to the tribalrepertoire: but to judge by the samples Underhill obtained suitabilitywas not equated with any great originality of insight. Come and sing! Come and sing! Sing for the evening! The sun stands there. Sing for it! For the liquor delightfully sing! And in the traditional songs and speeches, the emphasis was onthe pleasures of inebriation for its own sake. To each recipientof the brew, the cup-bearer would say Drink, friend ! Get beautifully drunk Hither bring the wind and the clouds. Nor did the use of the term 'beautifully' mean that the Papagoswere under any illusions as to the effects of the liquor—asone of the songs sung during the progress of the ceremony indicated: On the morning of the second day They come hastening from all directions They grow drunk, they stagger, they grow very drunk They crawl around in their vomit Much dizziness, Much dizziness Within me is swelling And more and more Every which way I am falling Chapter 5 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Psychedelic LibraryWT01-B35-73IA031-000652-B038-135http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/lsd/inglis5.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122125542 text/html 24209HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 12:55:29 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 01-Jan-97 22:35:17 GMTContent-length: 23990 The Forbidden Game - Chapter 5 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Psychedelic Library 5 Spirits Gin IT WAS NOT, THEN, ALCOHOL AS SUCH WHICH WAS THE DESTRUCTIVE influence,but the fact that a potent variety—spirits—was introducedto communities suffering from social dislocation after the lossof their old stability. And Britain, in the early seventeenthcentury, was taught the same lesson by gin. Until 'Geneva', as it was originally known, began to become popular,distilled liquors had not been drunk in Europe on any substantialscale—except among the rich, who enjoyed their brandy. But inthe seventeenth century Geneva drinking spread to Holland, andamong those who acquired a taste for it was William of Orange.Chronically in need of funds to finance his campaigns againstthe French, he had become aware of the value of drugs as a sourceof revenue; part of the price he demanded for consenting to oustJames II was that he should be awarded the revenue from the tobaccoduties; and when he and Mary ascended the throne, one of his firstactions was to break the London Distillers' Guild monopoly, andallow anybody to manufacture spirits on payment of a duty. Theconflict with France, checking the import of brandies, provideda further inducement to British distillers; and production beganrapidly to increase. That spirits could have the attributes of a drug was remarkedupon by the economist Charles D'Avenant in 1695. Brandy-drinking,he wrote, was becoming a growing vice among the common people(he was presumably using brandy as a synonym for spirits, as fewof the common people could have afforded cognac), 'and may intime prevail as much as opium with the Turks, to which many attributethe scarcity of people in the East'—opium having won the reputationof diminishing sexual appetite, and eventually of weakening sexualperformance. So far as Government and Parliament were concerned,though, the new taste for spirits was a godsend. 'It pays rentfor our land, employs our people', Daniel Defoe noted in his Reviewin 1713; distilling had become 'one of the most essential thingsto support the landed interest' (which happened to be supportinghim, at the time; he was working as an undercover agent for theGovernment). It should consequently, he urged, be 'specially preserved,and tenderly used'. Distilling was tenderly used—more tenderly even than brewing.Gin cost around 18p a gallon to manufacture, so it could be soldat a price which would enable anybody who wished to get drunkto do so for less than it would cost to get drunk on beer. Itbegan to replace beer as the tipple of the poor, at least in London;and the results alarmed the London magistrates. A committee theyappointed to investigate reported in 1726 that gin was sold inone house in ten in some London parishes (one house in five, inone parish); that as a result of its availability and cheapness,the poor were giving themselves over to vice and debauchery; andthat even in the workhouses, where the sodden creatures endedtheir days, gin was smuggled in. The inmates were prepared tosuffer any punishment 'rather than live without it, though theycannot avoid seeing its fatal effects by the death of those amongthem who had drunk most freely of it'. The fate of the poor in workhouses was of little concern to Membersof Parliament. What was disturbing to them about the report wasthe suggestion that soldiers and, worse, servants were being dailysuborned by gin; it was scarcely possible for them to go anywhere'without being drawn in either by those who sell it or by theiracquaintances, whom they meet with in the street, who generallybegin by inviting them to a dram'. M.P.s, though, shared a landedinterest. Distilling from grain pushed up their income. The PrimeMinister, Robert Walpole, did not want to lose his majority; nordid he care to sacrifice the revenue from the duty paid by thedistillers. Even when increasingly horrifying reports drove himin 1729 to put a curb on the sale of gin, the outcry from thefarmers, coupled with the fact that enforcement proved impossible,soon led to its being withdrawn. The London magistrates—responsible for the city's health, aswell as for law and order—began again to warn that the situationwas deteriorating; and in a further report in 1736 they presenteda picture of the degeneration of the poor too ugly to be ignored.Spirits were clearly responsible. The workers were being encouragedto drink the whole week 'upon score', and 'too often without mindinghow fast the score runs against them, whereby at the week's endthey find themselves without any surplusage to carry home to theirfamilies, which must of course starve, or be thrown on the parish'.Their wretched wives were also becoming gin drinkers 'to a degreehardly possible to be conceived. Unhappy mothers habituate themselvesto these distilled liquors, whose children are born weak and sickly,and often look shrivel'd and old as though they had numbered manyyears. Others again daily give it to their children.' Gin: prohibition The worry was not that gin made men and women drunk. Drunkenness,as distinct from what people might do when they were in that condition,was not in this period regarded as a heinous offense: 'an honestdrunken fellow', Defoe had noted in 1702, 'is a character in man'spraise'. If the Londoner had got roaring drunk on gin the waythe Irish and the Scots were reputed to get drunk on whiskey—becausethey liked to get drunk on whiskey, from time to time—he wouldhave caused the magistrates little concern. But he was using ginas a quick, cheap way of escape—not as an intoxicant, but asa narcotic. This was, in fact, the prototype of future drug scares,presenting many of the features which were to become so familiar;among them, the first reported parliamentary debate on the issueof prohibition. Appalled by the evidence, Sir John Jekyll proposed in the Commonsthat a duty of 20 shillings a gallon should be put on spiritssold by retail. The motion was opposed by Sir William Pulteney.This was not, Pulteney emphasised, because he had anything tosay in favour of the consumption of spirits, which had becomeexcessive and mischievous, sapping the people's health and morals.His criticism was that the measure amounted to prohibition. Prohibition, Pulteney explained, was doubly unjust; in principle,because it struck at spirits, rather than at their misuse (nobodyhad argued that spirits consumed in moderation did harm, so tostop them being sold for consumption in moderation was 'carryingthe remedy much farther than the disease'); and in practice, becauseit was the Government itself which had encouraged men to sinkcapital in distilleries and in shops—'it is a dangerous, itis, Sir, a terrible thing to reduce many thousands of familiesat once to a state of despair'. But the essential objection toprohibition was that it did not work—as the earlier experienceof the Walpole government had shown. The spirits which had previouslybeen available were simply replaced by an illicit liquor 'which,I believe in derision of the Act, they called "ParliamentBrandy"'. If legal channels dried up, spirits would inevitablybegin to flow in through other, illegal channels. Parliamentary debates were not at the time legally reported andonly the outline of the prohibitionists' reply to Pulteney survives,but it indicates why they were not prepared to listen to his warning.He had concluded by saying that in so far as the measure did notamount to total prohibition—spirits could still be bought bythe hogshead—this too was unjust, because it would allow therich to buy and drink as much as they liked, when they liked,while stopping the poor from buying a glass of gin over the counter.This, Jekyll's supporters made clear, was precisely their aim.As one of them put it, the justification for the Bill was thatit would keep spirits out of the reach of 'persons of inferiorrank', who were 'the only sort of people apt to make a customof getting drunk with such liquor'. Nor was it possible to caterfor those who would, if allowed to drink, drink in moderation.Where spirits were available in the shops, 'few would keep themselveswithin any bounds, because a small quantity deprived them of theirreason, and the companions they usually met with at such placesencouraged them to drink to excess'. The only concession the supportersof the measure were prepared to make was that spirits should stillbe available when prescribed by a physician, in cases of illness.Otherwise, if the law was found to amount in practice to prohibitionso far as the poor were concerned, so much the better. Against Walpole's advice—he was mainly concerned with the lossof revenue, but he agreed with Pulteney that prohibition wouldnot work—the measure was passed. The consequences were to bedescribed by Walpole's biographer, Coxe. The people, he recalled,reacted in the usual mode of riot and violence. Numerous desperadoes availedthemselves of the popular discontents, and continued the clandestinesale of gin in defiance of every restriction. The demand of penalties,which the offenders were unable to pay, filled the prisons, andremoving every restraint, plunged them into courses more audaciouslycriminal. It was found that a duty and penalty so severe as toamount to an implied prohibition, were as little calculated tobenefit the public morality, as the public revenue. The Act failed partly because the Government's enforcement officers,the excisemen, were universally hated. When they were active,they were in danger of their lives; but frequently they were inactive,because they preferred to come to terms with the lawbreakers.Where demand was strong enough, as Walpole had warned after hisearlier experience, the smuggler could afford 'to blind the officerwith a large bribe', especially as he knew that once a bribe hadbeen accepted, the officer 'is, and must be, his slave for ever'. The means which were adopted to enforce the Act also had unfortunateconsequences. To catch those who manufactured, sold, or purchasedillicit spirits, a reward of £5 had been offered for informationleading to a conviction. The preliminary results were gratifying:over four thousand such convictions were secured, and paymentsmade for them, in the first two years. By that time, though, itwas becoming apparent that an unascertainable but substantialproportion of the convictions had been obtained by perjury, toget the £5 which, to an unskilled labourer, represented almostthree months' wages. And many other people who had been detectedconsuming drink purchased illicitly had paid the standard blackmailfee of £10 to avoid prosecution. Gin: licensing After Walpole's fall, his successors decided to repeal the Act.As Lord Bathurst [as reported from memory by Samuel Johnson, thenworking for the Gentleman's Magazine] explained to theHouse of Lords in 1743, perjuries had become so common and flagrant,'that the people thought all informations malicious; or at least,thinking themselves oppressed by the law, they looked upon everyman that promoted its execution, as their enemy'. Intimidationand violence—some informers had been murdered in the streets—hadmade it impossible to bring offenders to court, 'so that the law,however just might be the intention with which it was enacted,or however seasonable the methods prescribed by it, has been nowfor some years totally disused'. Experience, therefore, had shown that it was impossible to preventthe retailing of spirits. 'What then'—Bathurst asked the House— are we to do? Does not common sense point out the most propermethod, which is to allow their being publicly retailed but tolay such a duty upon the distillery and upon licenses as withoutamounting to a prohibition will make them come so dear to theconsumer that the poor will not be able to launch out into anexcessive use of them? The expedient was not new; James I had resorted to it with tobacco,when prohibition failed. And the motive on this occasion appearedto Opposition peers to be the same: the Treasury's need for morerevenue, to pay for Britain's contribution to the war on the Continent.This was deplorable, Lord Chesterfield thought. If spirit-drinkingwere a vice, it ought to be punished as such. Would you lay a tax upon a breach of the Ten Commandments ? Wouldnot such a tax be wicked and scandalous because it would implyan indulgence to those who would pay the tax ? No reasonable manwould suppose you intend to discourage, much less prohibit, thisvice, by giving every man that pleases an indulgence to breakout himself, or to promote it in others upon condition of hispaying a small tax annually. Lord Hervey was equally scathing. All that was wrong with thelaw, he insisted, was that it had not been enforced. Now, instead,they were to have a duty whose proceeds were being mortgaged topay for the war. In other words, they were establishing the worstsort of drunkenness to pay for an expense which in his opinionwas both unnecessary and ridiculous, 'like a tradesman mortgagingthe prostitution of his wife or daughter, for the sake of raisingmoney to supply his luxury or extravagance'. And he went on toinveigh against drunkenness, 'of all vices the most abominable'. Drunkenness happened not to be one of Hervey's vices; drink gavehim gall-bladder trouble. But when Lord Sandwich, who entertainedhis Hell Fire Club friends to drunken orgies at which the BlackMass was celebrated, told the House that his regard for the moralsof the people compelled him to oppose the Bill, Bathurst couldnot resist remarking that he hoped that all public houses werenot going to be regarded as chapels of the devil, simply becausea man might eat or drink too much in them. 'According to thisway of reasoning, I am afraid, many of your lordships' own houseswould come under the same denomination, and you yourselves wouldnot be quite free from the character of being devils.' Patiently, Bathurst explained that though the Government hopedto make money from the duty, the measure must at the same timereduce spirit-drinking, because spirits would cost more. To thosecritics who wondered whether, if the price rose, the measure couldbe enforced, he replied that this time the Government would haveallies; if, as had been surmised, 50,000 publicans took out licencesto sell spirits, 'there will likewise be 50,000 informers againstunlawful traders'. In any case, as spirits would now be legallyavailable, the public would no longer side with the sellers ofillicit liquor. So it was eventually to prove. For a while the distillers, fearingfor their profits, managed to secure a modification of the Act;but by 1751 the consequences were so manifestly shocking—reflectedin Henry's Fielding's Reasons for the Late Increase in Robbers,and Hogarth's 'Gin Lane'—that the Act's original provisionswere reimposed. The dire warnings of Chesterfield and Hervey werequickly shown to have been unjustified. The consumption of spiritsin Britain, which had been estimated at eight million gallonsin 1743, fell to two million in the 1760s and to around one millionin the 1780s. Only one of Chesterfield's forecasts proved correct;that if Governments once began to enjoy the considerable revenuewhich would accrue to them from the duty, they would never letit go. They never did. Gin: scapegoat Gin-drinking had spread 'with the rapidity and the violence ofan epidemic', the historian Lecky was to write: 'small as is theplace which this fact occupies in English history, it was probably,if we consider all the consequences that have flowed from it,the most momentous in the eighteenth century—incomparably moreso than any event in the purely political or military annals ofthe country.' And in a celebrated passage, he went on to describethe degradation that gin had wrought, with the retailers 'accustomedto hang out painted boards announcing to their customers theycould be made drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence, andhave straw for nothing; cellars strewn with straw were accordinglyprovided into which those who had become insensible were dragged,and where they remained until they had sufficiently recoveredto renew their orgies'. Contemporary accounts suggest that Lecky did not exaggerate. Speakerafter speaker in the 1743 debate, regardless of his politics showedhow appalling the effects of drinking spirits had become producing'not only momentary fury', Lord Lonsdale claimed 'but incurabledebility and lingering diseases; they not only fill our streetswith madmen, and prisons with criminals, but our hospitals withcripples'. The statistical evidence points the same way. The birthrate in London fell, in the early part of the century; so didthe expectation of life among young children. Nearly ten thousandchildren under the age of five were dying annually, the Commonswere told in 1751, because of the effects of 'the grand destroyer'on their parents. 'Inquire from the several hospitals in thiscity' Corbyn Morris wrote the same year, 'whether any increaseof patients, and of what sort, are daily brought under their care? They will all declare, increasing multitudes of dropsical consumptivepeople arising from the effects of spirituous liquors.' Yet those spirituous liquors were not really to blame for whathad happened in England—any more than for what was to happenon Tahiti. It was the way that gin had been virtually thrust downLondoners' throats which had been responsible; coupled with thecondition of London's poor at the time. Gin drinking was not merely,as Dorothy George described it in her London Life in the EighteenthCentury, 'essentially a disease of poverty'; it was a diseaseof the ugly kind of poverty portrayed by Fielding, Morris andmany another writer. The picture that emerges is of a squalorand degradation far worse even than in the London of the GreatPlague; and it was from this that the London poor were seekingescape. Even so, had spirits come gradually into use Londoners might havelearned to come to terms with them, as the Dutch had. But notonly were they a novelty in Britain; their sale was relentlesslypushed by the distillers (whose trade, Hervey complained, becamethe most profitable of any in the kingdom—'except that of beingbroker to a Prime Minister'). And the distillers themselves hadbeen given every encouragement by the Government, hungry for morerevenue—and by the landowner M.P.s, hoping for higher rents. It was the way gin was introduced, coupled with the environment,that made its effects destructive. When Bishop Berkeley boastedthat Britain was the freest country in Europe, the Bishop of Gloucesterwrote to him to say there was indeed freedom of a kind—forunbounded licentiousness: 'there is not only no safety livingin this town' he wrote from London, 'but scarcely in the countrynow, robbery and murder are grown so frequent . . . Those accursedspirituous liquors which, to the shame of our government, areso easily to be had, and in such quantities drunk, have changedthe very nature of our people.' The crimes which so disturbedthe Bishop, though, were not as a rule committed in drink—oreven for drink, in the sense of a man robbing to pay for it, thoughthat must have been common enough. The worst crimes were committedby those who worked for the illicit distiller and the smuggler,because the demand for his illicit goods was sufficient to enablehim to pay them well enough not merely to work for him, but ifnecessary to commit crimes of violence, even murder, for him.Nor was it simply the London gin-drinkers who had provided thedemand. Long before they had begun to worry the magistrates, theBritish ruling class had shown that they were determined to continueto buy their claret and their cognac, regardless of whether theGovernment wanted to exclude them, as when Britain was at warwith France. And at other times, when they were admitted legallyon payment of duty, the M.P.s who voted for the tax had no compunctionin buying their own supplies more cheaply, knowing they must havebeen smuggled in. The lesson the gin plague taught, in fact, was not so much thatprohibition was futile, as that it was futile unless the Governmentenjoyed public confidence and support. Where it was known thatthe members of the ruling class—Walpole himself being notoriouslyone of them—did not feel that prohibition should apply to them,the law fell into contempt. Efforts to enforce it, therefore,tended simply to inflame the public; often even those citizenswho were not spirit drinkers, and would have liked to see consumptionstopped, but were more deeply concerned about the corruption thatattempts to stop it involved. That was why, as Bathurst had realised,prohibition had been unworkable. It was impossible to find anybodywilling to undertake 'a task at once odious and endless, or topunish offences which every day multiplied, and on which the wholebody of the common people—a body very formidable when united—wasuniversally engaged'.

A plant drug which grew in Britain's new colonialterritory in India was to prove even more profitable; and as thebulk of it was sold away from British territory, there was noneed to worry what the consequences might be. Opium had long been manufactured from the sap of the poppies grownin the Middle East and in India; and traveller after travellerin those regions had reported that unlike in Europe, where itwas employed mainly as a sedative, it was taken as a stimulant,particularly when Dutch courage was required. 'There is no Turkwho would not buy opium with his last penny', the French naturalistBelon noted in the sixteenth century, 'because they think thatthey become more daring, and have less fear of the dangers ofwar.' In India, John Fryer observed in the 1670s, wrestlers tookit to help them to perform feats ordinarily beyond their strength,and warriors, 'to run up on any enterprise with a raging resolutionto die or be victorious'. Had the British arrived in India as colonists, they would probablyhave felt bound to try to suppress opium consumption as a dangerto law and order—and to health; it could create a powerful craving,as Robert Clive, who became addicted to it, was to find. But apartfrom the risk of addiction, opium represented no threat to theEast India Company, so long as it remained primarily a mercantilebody. The Moguls possessed a monopoly of opium production in Bengal,and they were disposed to restrict consumption, as far as possible,to themselves and their circle. They were willing, though, tosell it to the Company; and the Company's ships began to takeit to the East Indies and to China. Warren Hastings Opium had long been used in China medicinally; and in the seventeenthcentury people had begun to burn small quantities of it in theflame of a candle, to inhale the fumes—the idea presumably derivingfrom seeing tobacco smoked. Disturbed by reports of the spreadof the new fad, the Emperor decreed in 1729 that opium must nolonger be imported, except under licence. But by this time ithad won too many adherents. The flow continued in defiance ofthe ban, just as with tobacco in those countries which had triedto enforce prohibition a century before. Most of the opium was brought in from the Middle East by the Portuguese,through Macao; but when the East India Company inherited the Mogulempire after Clive's victory at Plassey, they also inherited theMogul's opium monopoly, and the prospect of selling more of itin China, with her estimated 300,000,000 population, was attractive.There was a snag, however: foreigners were permitted to tradewith China only through Canton. The Company enjoyed a monopolyof British trade there—including opium brought in under licence.Its rights might be forfeited if it were caught smuggling. TheCompany therefore began to sell its opium in India to the ownersof merchant ships who were prepared to smuggle it into China;and these 'country ships', as they came to be called, took itto Macao. For a while, the operations were on a very small scale; but whenWarren Hastings took over the management of the Company in 1772,becoming Governor-General of British India, he soon grasped thetremendous potential of the traffic and set about expanding itfor the benefit of the Company's finances. Hastings had no illusionsabout what he was doing. He described opium as a 'pernicious'commodity, 'which the wisdom of the Government should carefullyrestrain from internal consumption'— that is, from consumptionin British India. Foreign commerce was a different matter. Whenwar with the Dutch temporarily closed the opium market in theircolonies in the East Indies, Hastings switched a consignment toCanton, in a privateer armed at the expense of the Company. Theventure was not a success. Blackmailed by the Canton merchants'guild with the threat of disclosure, the Company's Canton agentshad to sell the opium to them for a derisory price. But the 'countryships' continued to provide a safe and increasingly lucrativemethod of distribution. Shortly before the end of the century another imperial edict againstopium was promulgated; and it was to be followed by many more,pleading, warning, threatening. Far from paying any attention,the 'country ships' began to extend their activities; 'some ill-disposedindividuals', the Emperor was informed in 1807, had even begunto carry the opium they brought over the mountain passes intothe interior. Soon, it reached Pekin. In 1813 he discovered tohis horror that members of his bodyguard, and some of the courteunuchs, had become enslaved by the habit. Stiffer penalties weredecreed, flogging and the wearing of the cangue— a kindof portable pillory; but without success. The lower classes, itwas found, were taking to the habit; 'vagabonds clandestinelypurchase and eat it' a further edict complained in 1815, 'andeventually become sunk into the most stupid and besotted state,so as to cut down the powers of nature and destroy life.' The situation was unprecedented. Doubtless the French Governmenthad been very willing, a century earlier, that French wine andbrandy should continue to be smuggled into Britain, the proceedsgoing to help the French wine industry, and at the same time deprivingthe British Government of needed revenue. But the French Governmenthad not itself acted as a principal; whereas the Government ofBritish India—as the Company had virtually become—were bythis time purchasing the entire poppy harvest in their territories,with the deliberate intention of processing the opium and sendingthe bulk of it to China. To avoid jeopardising their legal commercialundertakings—in particular, the tea trade, which had reachedmassive proportions—they still had to pretend that they werenot engaged in smuggling. Nor, technically, were they, as the'country ships' did not sail under the Company's flag. But theywere licensed by the Company—no ship could take opium out ofIndia without such a licence. Their operations, too, were financedby the Company, whose Canton agents received the price for theopium from the Chinese merchants who purchased it. The Company'smoney was also laid out, where necessary, in bribes. When a newGovernor from Pekin arrested some of the Cantonese who were involvedin the traffic, and compelled them under torture to confess, theCompany's Canton agents warned that sales might be subject tosome delay; but they made it clear that this would be only untila new bribery scale had been agreed with the 'officers and policepeople employed to prevent the sales', to compensate them forthe additional risk they had run. If criticised for this involvement in drug smuggling, the Company'sline was that it was up to the Chinese, if they wanted, to enforcetheir own laws; and in this the Company was doing its best tohelp by restricting production, and keeping up the price, so thatmost people would not be able to afford it. 'Were it possibleto prevent the use of the drug altogether', the Governor-Generalvirtuously claimed in 1817, 'except strictly for the purpose ofmedicine, we would gladly do it in compassion to mankind'. TheCompany's directors in London expressed their approval, but addedthat restriction of the supply was a policy which would be acceptableonly so long as it meant higher profits; otherwise, 'the expediencyof proportionately increasing the annual provision will naturallyengage your attention'. Very soon, the Indian Government's attention was duly engaged.Attracted by the rising price of opium, Princes in the IndianNative States were beginning to encourage production; and in quantityand quality 'Malwa', as it was known, began to rival the Company'sopium from Bengal. The Company hastily abandoned its policy ofrestricting consumption, reduced its prices, and in 1827 resortedto what was described as a policy of 'voluntary persuasion' ofthe Princes to sell their opium only through the Company, in Calcuttaor Bombay. The voluntary persuasion took the form of telling thePrinces that they had to make a choice between keeping the friendship,or incurring the enmity, of the British Government. Past experiencehad shown that an Indian ruler who incurred the enmity of theBritish Government was liable to lose his throne, and sometimeshis life. Friendship, on the other hand, meant a subsidy to compensatefor the loss of revenue from opium. It was not long before thegreat bulk of the Malwa opium produced in the Native States wasunder the Company's control. The Napier incident At the Canton end the Company had also had a setback; but it,too, had turned out in the end to be an advantage. By 1820 thesystem of bribery had become so well-established that the 'countryships' were actually sailing up the Canton estuary to Whampoa,the port of Canton, confident that officials would look the otherway when the consignments were unloaded. Once again, however,a new Governor, determined to carry out Pekin's instructions—orat least appear to be carrying them out—arrested a number ofthe Chinese involved. He also ordered that all ships coming upthe Canton river must be searched; any ship found carrying anyopium would have not merely the opium, but its entire cargo confiscated,and would thereafter be banned from the China trade. The smugglers departed—but only as far as Lintin island, atthe mouth of the estuary. There, they set up what was in all butname, a British base. The opium clippers were fast and well-armed,more than a match for Chinese junks which were sent to interceptthem. They brought their cargoes to Lintin, packed in chests-of-drawers,containing about 140 lbs of opium made up into balls about thesize of a small grapefruit; discharged the chests in depot ships;and returned to India for more. From Lintin, the opium was eithertaken by country ships farther along the coast, or transferredlocally to 'fast crabs', or 'scrambling dragons'— the namesby which the Chinese authorities denounced them, in a proclamationin 1826—shallow-beamed boats manned by thirty or forty oarsmen,designed so that they could skim over bars and shallows, and alongremote creeks. The penalty for being caught was death; but thisactually helped the traffic, because the smugglers had no hesitationin fighting it out if, owing to some breakdown in the briberychain, they were intercepted. Lintin was ideally suited to 'fastcrab' activities. It also saved port dues for the larger ships;and it was free from Chinese interference. During the 1 820s,as a result, the amount of Indian opium imported into China quadrupled. There was no question, as yet, of the Company's trying to justifythe opium traffic on any other ground than caveat emptor.The taking of opium for pleasure was still regarded as a destructivevice—and not just in India; Stamford Raffles denounced it asa malign influence on the people of Java, 'degrading their characterand enervating their energies'. De Quincey's Confessions,too, when they were published in 1821, alerted public opinionat home to the agonies of addiction. So when the House of CommonsCommittee was set up to investigate the affairs of the East IndiaCompany in 1830, the Company's line was that it must be allowedto retain its opium monopoly, because only in that way could productionbe restricted, and consumption kept down by 'making the priceas high as possible'. It would have required little research bythe Committee to find that so far from trying to keep the priceup and consumption down, the Company was selling four times asmuch opium to the Chinese at a considerably lower price than ithad ten years before; but the Company had another argument inreserve, which was to prove decisive. The value of the opium soldin China amounted to well over two million pounds—getting onfor half the amount then annually devoted to paying for the Crownand the Civil Service in Britain. If the Government of India wasdeprived of the revenue from opium, it would have to be raisedfrom other sources, and the British taxpayer might have to becalled upon. It would not be desirable, the Committee recommended,'to abandon so important a source of revenue as the opium trade,the duty upon opium being one which falls principally on the foreignconsumer'. The Government gratefully accepted the recommendation;and although the Company was stripped of its other privileges,the opium monopoly was retained. This meant, in effect, that the British Government was now directlyresponsible for the opium traffic, through the Government of India,'the Company' being hardly distinguishable from the Indian civilservice. Even the pretence that production was being kept downto keep prices high and consumption low was abandoned. The Company'sagents were instructed to put pressure on the Bengal peasantsto sow more poppies; as the agents were paid on a commission basis,they needed no inducement, using various forms of blackmail tobring recalcitrant peasants into line. Largely due to the pioneer efforts of Jardine Matheson's 'opiumclippers', too, new areas were opened up to the smuggling trafficalong the Chinese coast to the north of Canton. Language was adifficulty; William Jardine shrewdly solved it by employing amissionary, Charles Gutzlaff, as interpreter. 'We look up to theever-blessed Redeemer, to whom China with all its millions isgiven', Gutzlaff wrote; 'in the faithfulness of His promise weanticipate the glorious day of a general conversion, and are willingto do our utmost to promote the good work'; the good work beingthe introduction of the Chinese to the bibles, tracts, and ointments,which he distributed wherever his duties as interpreter, in thehaggling over opium prices—which brought much satisfaction andprofit to Jardine Matheson—permitted. Some members of the Whig Government, though, were uneasy aboutthe traffic. It did not pass unnoticed abroad that the Governmentwhich, in 1833, had paraded its devotion to the cause of humanityby abolishing the slave trade, had now taken over the role ofprincipal in the most massive smuggling operation the world hadever known, designed to keep the Chinese people supplied witha notoriously dangerous drug, consumption of which was generallyrestricted, and in some places prohibited, on British territory.The remedy, Lord Palmerston decided, was to persuade the ChineseGovernment to end the Canton monopoly, and to open up other portsto foreign trade—which would be accompanied, the expectationwas, by the legalisation of opium. In 1834 he despatched LordNapier to China, to negotiate the deal. A naval officer turned sheep farmer, Napier knew nothing of Chinaor the Chinese, and succeeded only in irritating the Canton authorities.Recriminations followed; and the viceroy put a ban on trade ofany kind by British ships. Napier's reply was a show of force:two British frigates managed to fight their way up the river toCanton. The Chinese blocked their way back, with stakes and fireships.Napier realised he was trapped. Harassed, and suffering from fever,he had to accept the offer of a Chinese boat for his return journeyfrom Canton down to the sea. It deposited him at Macao where,a few days later, he died. The prohibition debate Up to this point, information about the effects of the opium onthe Chinese had been scanty; and it was never to be wholly reliable.But in 1832 two American missionaries founded the Chinese Repository,a monthly magazine which, amongst other things, provided translationsof Chinese documents ranging from imperial decrees to fly-posters;and the evidence pointed to growing alarm about the drug. Thearmy, in particular, had succumbed. Of a thousand soldiers sentas reinforcements to help put down a rising in the province ofCanton, the commanding officer had had to reject two hundred asunfit for service; and opium was blamed when the rebels defeatedthe imperial force. The son of the Governor of Canton, it alsotranspired, had been smuggling it through to his friends in Pekinin the equivalent of the diplomatic bag. Chinese historians havesuggested that this attraction opium smoking had for the sonsof men of wealth and position may have been decisive, in whatwas to follow: for the Emperor himself— Tao-Kwang, who had succeededto the throne in 1820—was a victim; his three eldest sons alldied of opium addiction. The difficulty which confronted the Emperor was how to suppressthe opium traffic, now that it had obtained such a hold. The storyof the opium in the diplomatic bag had come out only because itturned out to be of such poor quality that the merchant concernedwas to be proceeded against, just as if it were legal merchandise;and how deeply both merchants and civil authorities were involvedwas revealed again in 1834. The Repository reported that the newGovernor of Canton (the old one having been sacked for his failureto suppress the traffic), angry at finding that he had been overchargedfor his opium supply, had attempted to arrest the suppliers, onlyto find they had already absconded. When the authorities did takeaction against smugglers—the Repository explained—itwas not to stop smuggling, but to ensure that it was kept in existingchannels: 'it would seem that the smuggling trade is becominga monopoly of the Government.' The fact, too, that so many respectable citizens—or their sons—wereopium smokers encouraged extortion and blackmail. Since the beginningof the century, the American merchant Charles W. King—one ofthe very few merchants of any nationality in Canton who had refusedto have anything to do with the traffic—complained in a letterto the British Superintendent of Trade: the British merchants, led on by the East India Company, havebeen driving a trade in violation of the highest laws and thebest interests of the Chinese empire. This cause has been pushedso far as to derange its currency, to corrupt its officers, andruin multitudes of its people. The traffic has become associated,in the politics of the country, with the axe and the dungeon;in the breasts of men in private life, with the wreck of property,virtue, honour and happiness. All ranks, from the Emperor on thethrone to the people of the humblest hamlets, have felt its sting.To the fact of its descent to the lowest classes of society, weare frequent witnesses; and the Court gazettes are evidence thatit has marked out victims for disgrace and ruin even among theimperial kindred. Law-abiding citizens were not necessarily safe as Gutzlaff wasto lament, when he came to write the life of the Emperor. Thegreat bane of China, Gutzlaff—of all people—argued, had beenthe introduction of opium by foreigners. The rewards offered toinformers in the attempt to suppress it made them 'both numerousand unscrupulous; whoever had a grudge against his neighbour,denounced him as a transgressor of the laws against the drug';and the excuse 'searching for the drug', had been used by officialsto commit thefts, and other outrages. Thousands of innocent people,Gutzlaff lamented, had been the victims. The failure of the prohibition policy, and the disastrous consequencesarising out of the effort to enforce it, had attracted the attentionof some of the teachers at an academy which had been founded in1820 in Canton. Perhaps because it had not settled into the traditionalacademic grooves, the possibility of legalising opium imports,subject to a duty, had been discussed; and among those influencedby the arguments in favour of that course was Hsü Nai-chi,who had later become an imperial official in the province of Kwantung,and seen for himself the effects of the failure of prohibition.In May 1836 he addressed a memorial to the Emperor, putting thecase for admitting opium legally, on payment of duty. Hsü did not dispute that 'so vile a practice', and the evilsarising out of it, should if possible be stopped. His argumentwas that prohibition not merely had failed to stop the evils,but had created many more; and the severer the interdicts againstit became, 'the more widely do the evils arising therefrom spread'.When it had first been found that prohibition was not working,flogging and the cangue had been introduced; then, exile,imprisonment, and even death. Yet 'the smokers of the drug haveincreased in number, and the practice has spread almost throughthe whole empire'. Supporters of the prohibition policy had beenforced back on the argument that it was not the regulations, buthow they were carried out, that was the trouble; 'it is said,the daily increase is owing to the negligence of officers in enforcingthe interdicts!' But this negligence, Hsü insisted, was thefault of the interdicts. The more severe they became, the greaterthe incentive to criminals to employ violence, or corruption,or both. In its general approach, the memorial was remarkably similar inits line of argument to Bathurst's in the House of Lords nearlya century before. But Hsü's analysis went a little deeperin its recognition of why the severity of a penal code, so farfrom helping in the effort to suppress a drug, must make it easierfor the importer. As he was not himself at risk, the penaltiesdid not matter to him. At worst, all that he had to worry aboutwas having to pay out more in bribes. But even that could be,in the end, to his advantage. The higher the payment offered,the easier it became to find officials who would succumb. The Emperor was sufficiently impressed by Hsü's memorandumto refer it, in June, to the Governor of Canton, Teng T'ing-chen,who had taken office earlier that year. Teng had already beenconverted to the legalisation policy: his recommendations followedthe line Hsü had laid down. But other advisers expressedhorror at the proposal—in much the same terms as Hervey andChesterfield had used about the Spirits Licensing Bill. 'Whenhave not prostitution, gambling, treason, robbery, and suchlikeinfractions of the laws afforded occasion for extortionate underlingsand worthless vagrants to benefit themselves, and by falsehoodand bribery to amass wealth?', Chu T'sun, Sub-Chancellor of theGrand Secretariat, asked. 'But none, surely, would contend thatthe law, because in such instances rendered ineffectual, shouldtherefore be abrogated!' The consequences of such a step wouldbe disastrous: The laws that forbid the people to do wrong may be likened tothe dykes which prevent the overflowing of water. If any one,then, urging that the dykes are very old, and therefore useless,should have them thrown down, what words could express the consequencesof the impetuous rush and all-destroying overflow! The damage, Chu feared, might already have been done, simply bythe knowledge that there was a move in favour of legalisation:'the instant effect has been, that crafty thieves and villainshave on all sides begun to raise their heads and open their eyes,gazing about and pointing the finger, under the notion that whenonce these prohibitions are repealed, thenceforth, and forever,they may regard themselves as free from every restraint'. Another memorialist added a recommendation which may well havebeen decisive. The opium sellers, he pointed out, were actuallyliving in Canton: even Jardine himself. Why? Why not arrest them,for breaking the imperial law? Why not send all their ships back,and allow no resumption of trade of any kind until all opium smugglingactivities had ceased? 'If commands be issued of this plain andenergetic character, in language strong, and in sense becoming,though their nature be the most abject—that of a dog, or a sheep—yet,having a care for their own lives, they will not fail to seekthe gain, and to flee the danger.' This was the policy that the Emperor elected to follow. For havingraised the hopes of the opium smokers that the drug might be legalised,Hsü Nai-chi was removed from his post. An official who hadsent in detailed plans showing how prohibition could be enforced,Lin Tse-Hsü, was despatched early in 1839 to Canton as ImperialCommissioner, charged with the suppression of the opium traffic. The first Opium War The story of Lin's commissionership, which provoked the firstOpium War, has often been told; in recent years by, among others,Maurice Collis, in Foreign Mud; Arthur Waley, in TheOpium War through Chinese Eyes; and Hsin-Pao Chang in CommissionerLin and the Opium War. It represents the classic example ofthe limitations of honesty, integrity and assiduity in carryingout a campaign to suppress the traffic in a drug. Yet Lin felthe was well-placed to achieve his aim. He had a half-Nelson onthe British merchants, because he knew they could not afford torisk the loss of the tea trade, through Canton; and he determinedto exploit the hold this gave him. The British merchants, he announcedafter his arrival, must surrender all their opium stocks. When,thinking to placate him, they offered to surrender a thousandchests, he took the opportunity to show that he knew exactly howmuch more opium they had, and to inform them that until they handedit over, all trade with British vessels, and all movement of Britishshipping up and down the Canton river, would cease. At this point the Chief Superintendent of Trade, Captain CharlesElliot, managed to get up to Canton. As Chief Superintendent,he was a kind of unofficial British Consul in China; and he hadwritten time after time to Palmerston to warn him that if theopium traffic was allowed to develop unchecked, a crisis mustdevelop. It now had; and, though he had no official powers, hedecided there was no help for it but to hand over all the opium:more than 20,000 chests. Lin put an end to the blockade, tookdelivery of the opium, and personally supervised its destruction.It was mixed with salt and lime, dissolved in water, and flushedaway into the sea. Lin had achieved his first objective; but it availed him nothing.Elliot ordered all British subjects and all British ships outof the Canton river, so that they could no longer be held virtuallyas hostages—the American merchants, most of whom had been involvedin the opium traffic, staying in Canton to act as agents for theBritish, so that the tea trade would not be disrupted. The opiumarriving from India was simply switched to points along the coast,as an Imperial Censor, Pu Chi-t'ung, had warned would happen,in a memorial to the Emperor. And Lin found himself unable tocheck the smuggling. After the destruction of the opium, he intendedto have a purge of the customs officials; but too many of them,he found, were implicated in the traffic. Even where he managedto stir them to action, this only—as he explained to the Emperorin the spring of 1840—led to the smugglers adopting more ingeniousruses to circumvent them. Sometimes opium would be hidden in therear apartments of houses, where the women lived, their presenceembarrassing the searchers. Sometimes it was buried in forests,or in the precincts of temples. It had even been put into chestsdisguised as coffins, and laid to rest, until required, in tombs.And Lin was finding it hard to get informers, because they wereno use to him unless they knew the traffic—in which case theywould work for the smugglers, who could afford to pay them more. What was being demonstrated, for the first time on such a largescale, was the impracticability of prohibition as a way to suppressthe traffic in a drug, particularly in a drug as addictive asopium. Addicts, who felt they had to have it, would pay whateverthe smugglers charged. If supplies dwindled owing to more effectivecustoms work, the price rose, allowing a bigger margin of profitout of which to bribe the customs officials into connivance. Andas smuggling was so extensive, many thousands of people, fromthe rowers of the fast crabs to the opium smokers, had a commoninterest in breaking the law, and protecting others who brokeit. Where respectable citizens or officials were involved, therewere opportunities for extortion and for blackmail; and the higherthe legal penalties for opium offenses, the greater the risk thatthose involved would commit acts of violence and even murder,rather than allow themselves to be caught. All this, Lin was to learn in the months which elapsed betweenthe departure of the British from Canton, and the arrival of theexpeditionary force which Elliot had asked for, to punish theCommissioner for his presumption. Elliot had not altered his viewsabout opium. 'No man entertains a deeper detestation of the disgraceand sin of this forced traffic', he wrote to Palmerston, in November1839 'than the humble individual who signs this despatch. I seelittle to choose between it and piracy.' But British propertyhad been extorted by compulsion, and destroyed; that, he felt,was 'the most shameless violence which one nation has ever yetdared to perpetrate against another'. While awaiting Palmerston'sinstructions, he used the small naval force he had at his disposalto protect the British merchant fleet, which lay at anchor offHong Kong, and to inflict some punishment on presumptuous Chinesenaval junks. The British force arrived in June 1840; including what Lin describedas 'cartwheel ships, that can put the axles in motion by meansof fire, and can move rather fast'. Still more important, thenew steamships could move in a flat calm, or directly up wind.They did not, however, waste any time trying to move up the riverto Canton. They went north, to put more direct pressure on Pekin.Lin, who had been basking in the Imperial favour, was abruptlyremoved from his post, and sent into exile. His mistake—as theCensor, Pu, had realised—lay in imagining that the threat ofclosure of the legitimate British trade would suffice to bringthe opium traffic to an end. It mattered little to the Britishmerchants that instead of picking up their tea at Canton, theyhad to leave the Americans to collect it there, and receive itfrom them at Hong Kong. What was vital was that the flow of theirimports of opium should continue; and Lin had been unable to stopit. It was not seriously impeded even by the hostilities which followed,as militarily the resistance was insignificant. By some judiciousdiplomatic manoeuvres and some injudicious attempts at deception,the Chinese managed to avoid capitulation until the summer of1842, when they were finally compelled to accept the British terms.By then, the opium traffic was back to normal. The treaty of Nanking The war had not, admittedly, been fought exclusively to legitimisethe opium traffic. Palmerston could claim that he was mainly concernedwith compelling the Chinese to accept free trade. But opium happenedto be by far the most profitable commodity involved. 'Had therebeen an alternative', Commissioner Lin's biographer Hsin-pao Changcommented, '—say, molasses, or rice—the conflict might havebeen called the Molasses War, or the Rice War'. But there wasno alternative. Not merely was opium the only British import forwhich there was any substantial demand in China: the demand hadgrown enormously. In the late 1820s the Company exported an averageof less than 10,000 chests annually to China; that figure hadincreased, in the year before Lin was appointed, to 40,000. Palmerstonwas fully aware of the situation; Sardine, who had returned toEngland just before Lin arrived at Canton, had been called into brief him, 'I have to instruct you'—Palmerston accordinglyinformed Captain Elliot—'to make some arrangement with the ChineseGovernment for the admission of opium to China as an article oflawful commerce.' Palmerston knew, though, that it would be unwise to make thisinstruction public. The Chinese plenipotentiaries, he went on,must not be given the idea that it was 'the intention of H.M.Government to use any compulsion'. Had H.M. Government been seento be forcing the Chinese to legalise opium, its enemies abroadand at home would have been handed a serviceable weapon; and itsshaky majority, which had narrowly survived a debate on its Chinapolicy in the Commons in 1840, would have been again imperilled.The line to take to the Chinese, Palmertson suggested, was thatthey should offer to legalise opium in their own interest. Theyshould be reminded that they could not stop it coming in, foreven if the supply of opium from India could be checked, 'plentyof it would be produced in other countries, and would thence besent to China'; and they should allow themselves to be gentlypersuaded to profit out of necessity by taxing it. When Elliot was sacked in 1841, similar instructions were givento his successor, Sir George Pottinger. The British Government,the Chinese plenipotentiaries were to be told, did not insist;but it must be impressed on the Chinese how very much in theirown interest the legalisation of opium would be. Pottinger dulypresented Palmerston's view, only to be met with a blank refusaleven to discuss the possibility of legalisation. Opium, they toldhim, was an evil, growing daily worse. They could not, even ifthey wanted to, countenance the proposal, as the Emperor wouldrepudiate them. Pottinger's instructions left him no room to manoeuvre;and the change of Government in Britain in 1841 promised to makehis task still more difficult—the Tories in Opposition havingcome out strongly against the opium traffic in a debate in theCommons the year before. In the event, though, the Tories' principles underwent a rapidchange when they crossed the floor of the House. They did notcare to put any further pressure on the Chinese to admit opium;Pottinger was told he could accept the continuance of the ban.But he was instructed to warn the Chinese that, so far as Britishshipping was concerned, they 'need not trouble themselves whetherour vessels bring opium or not'. In other words, British shipssuspected of smuggling must not be searched. As the Chinese wouldpresumably ask the British Government, in these circumstances,not to allow British ships to be used for smuggling, Pottingerwas told he should instruct their owners to conform— leavingthe traffic to 'Chinese fast boats and other craft', as before.And it was this system—'mutual connivance', as Pottinger's successorSir John Davis tetchily described it—that came into operationafter the peace settlement. The Arrow War Mutual connivance was an unsatisfactory basis for peace. It survivedonly because in the immediate post-war period, the Chinese werein no mood to risk a resumption of hostilities. In 1850 the newEmperor, Hsien-feng, issued a fresh edict against opium smoking,giving offenders a brief period of grace in which to break thehabit, after which anybody caught would be beheaded, and his familysent into slavery. But a few months later the Taiping—the 'long-hairedones'—rose in rebellion; and although they were opposed to theuse of drugs of any kind—tobacco smoking, even, was punishableby death—their victories benefited the opium traffic. The leadersof the Taiping were too preoccupied with the struggle againstthe imperial troops; and at the same time, it became difficultfor the Emperor to enforce prohibition, even in those regionswhich still nominally adhered to his cause. The traffic, too, was greatly facilitated by the fact that underthe terms of the Treaty of Nanking the British had taken HongKong. Pottinger had assured the Chinese plenipotentiaries thatthe exportation of opium from Hong Kong to China would be forbidden;and it was. But the ban was never enforced. There was nothingto prevent opium from being smuggled out to the mainland. As soonas the smugglers realised that the Canton authorities, ratherthan risk precipitating another war, were not searching Britishvessels, they began to register the smuggling craft as British,and sail them openly up the Canton estuary, with the Union Jackas their flag of convenience. Opium also poured into Northern China through Shanghai which,as the northernmost of the ports opened to foreigners by the Pottingertreaty, served a hitherto largely inaccessible region. In theten years following the treaty, the opium traffic to China doubled.This roused British hopes that the Emperor, realising his banhad failed and needing funds to mount more effective operationsagainst the Taiping, might be converted to the policy of legalisation,as some of his courtiers desired. But he remained determined tostamp out opium smuggling. To this end, he had sent Yeh Ming-Chen,a disciple and friend of Commissioner Lin's, to Canton to resumeLin's policies. Caution, and the need to deal with the Taiping,meant that there was no immediate confrontation of the kind Linhad precipitated; but Yeh cleverly fanned the anti-British feelingwhich had arisen since the war among the Cantonese. There wereugly incidents, and the British merchants began to realise thatthey and their commerce were in growing danger. An excuse would be needed, though, for a new campaign. Yeh providedit in the autumn of 1856, when Mandarins arrested the crew ofthe lorcha Arrow, lying off Canton. Lorchas were a hybridspecies, with a Western-style hull and eastern-style sails; theyhad been found convenient for smuggling, and the Arrowwas one of many which, though Chinese-owned, had been registeredas British for that purpose in Hong Kong. For form's sake, themaster was British; but the crew were Chinese, some of them beingcriminals known to the Chinese authorities. So far as the Britishauthorities were concerned, this made no difference. Criminalsor not, they were under the protection of the British flag. (Thediscovery that the Arrow's registration had expired, sothat it was no longer a British vessel, caused only momentaryembarrassment; it could legally have re-registered, the explanationwas, the next time it arrived in Hong Kong.) When Yeh refusedto apologise, the navy was called in, and proceeded to shell hisofficial residence in Canton. The Tory Opposition were outraged. The Arrow affair, theycomplained, was a shoddy excuse for the war which Palmerston nowclearly proposed to wage; and in an impassioned debate in theCommons, they did what they had failed to do in 1840, winningthe Radicals to their side and defeating the Government in a vote.It was just the opportunity Palmerston had needed. He held a generalelection, taking care to ensure it was fought on the issue ofthe insult to the British Crown. 'An insolent barbarian wieldingauthority at Canton,' he told the electors of Tiverton, 'has violatedthe British flag, broken the engagement of treaties, offered rewardsfor the heads of British subjects in that part of China, and plannedtheir destruction by murder, assassinations and poisons.' Theelectorate, their patriotic passions aroused, enthusiasticallyvoted him and his supporters back into office. The Emperor managed to delay the final capitulation, as his predecessorhad, by some judicious stalling, and some injudicious deception.Lord Elgin, leading the British expeditionary force, had to occupyPekin and burn down the Emperor's Summer Palace, to convince himthat when terms were accepted, even under duress, they must bekept. And one of the terms imposed, on this occasion, was thatin future imports of opium would be legally permitted, on paymentof a duty. As before, it was possible to maintain that this wasnot what the war had been fought about—a view which suited Elgin,who personally thought the flimsy Arrow pretext scandalous,and was so disgusted with what he saw of the effects of opiumin China that he declined to treat it as a significant item onthe negotiation agenda. It had, in fact, by this time become partof a much wider set of objectives: shared by the French, who hadcommercial designs on China, and had joined in the fighting, andthe Americans, who had helped in spite of their neutrality. Thecommon aim was to compel the Chinese to conform to the ways ofthe West in diplomacy and in trade. Nevertheless opium was still,for the British, the main consideration. The returns of the yearsbetween the wars had shown no great improvement in legal exportsto China; the East India Company and the opium merchants, notBritish manufacturers, had been the chief beneficiaries of theopening of Shanghai to foreigners. How much importance the Britishdelegation attached to opium was demonstrated when they persuadedthe American plenipotentiary, William B. Reed, who had been formallyinstructed to accept the right of the Chinese to maintain prohibition,to repudiate his brief. As expected, legalisation produced a rapid increase in the demand,which the manufacturers in India were ready to meet. From fewerthan 60,000 chests in 1859-60, the figure rose almost to 90,000ten years later, and to over 105,000 in 1879-80. And as it wasno longer possible to hope that opium could be kept out, the Chinesehad a powerful incentive to cultivate poppies, from which to manufacturetheir own. There had been occasional reports since the early 1830sof illicit poppy cultivation, but not on a scale sufficient tocause the Imperial government much alarm. Now, farmers who grewpoppies could feel they were performing a patriotic duty, helpingto reduce the drain of currency out of the country. For a while,though, the home product did not pose any threat to imports. Inthe Treaty negotiations the Chinese plenipotentiaries, anxiousto demonstrate that there had been no change of view—that thedrug was still objectionable on moral grounds —had argued fora high import duty, to reduce consumption. The British, determinedto keep the price of their product competitive, demanded the rightto decide what rate of duty should be levied, and reduced by halfthe rate the Chinese had proposed, so that when the cost of smugglingoperations was taken into account, the new selling price neednot be substantially higher than the old. As the Indian productwas considered greatly superior, there need be no immediate fearof any abatement of demand. For form's sake, the Government's argument was that the Chinesehad voluntarily abandoned prohibition; but few who were in a positionto know their attitude were deceived. 'Nothing that has been gainedwas received from the free will of the Chinese', Sir Thomas Wade,one of the British negotiators, was to write ten years later;'the concessions made to us have been from the first to the lastextorted against the conscience of the nation—in defiance, thatis to say, of the moral convictions of its educated men.' AndWade was in no doubt that the consequences for the Chinese hadbeen terrible. In all the cases in his experience, opium had ledto 'the steady descent, moral and physical, of the smoker'. Opium: bane or benefit? Up to this point, the assumption that opium was injurious to thehealth and morals of the Chinese had hardly been questioned. Themost commonly cited authority on the subject was the missionaryW. H. Medhurst, who had gone out in 1816, and whose book Chinawas published in 1840. By his reckoning, the amount of opium smuggledin at that time was enough to demoralise nearly three millionpeople When the habit is once formed, it becomes inveterate; discontinuanceis more and more difficult, until at length, the sudden deprivationof the accustomed indulgence produces certain death. In proportionas the wretched victim comes under the power of the infatuatingdrug, so is his ability to resist temptation less strong; anddebilitated in body as well as mind, he is unable to earn hisusual pittance, and not infrequently sinks under the cravingsof an appetite which he is unable to gratify. Thus they may beseen, hanging their heads by the doors of the opium shops, whichthe hard-hearted keepers, having fleeced them of their all, willnot permit them to enter; and shut out from their own dwellings,either by angry relatives or ruthless creditors, they die in thestreets unpitied and despised. The opium habit, Medhurst estimated, reduced life expectationby about ten years, destroyed health while life lasted, and atthe same time ruined countless families because of the drain onthe smoker's resources. In the 1840 Commons debate, a few voices had been raised in opium'sdefence, but the contention had been simply that its evils hadbeen greatly exaggerated, and that its effects were no worse thanthose of over-indulgence in ardent spirits, all too familiar inthe West. Between the opium wars, however, there were occasionalintimations that opium need not have dire effects. The commentsfrom Chinese sources remained implacably hostile, and so did thebulk of the reports from missionaries; but Dr. Benjamin Hobson,who had worked for years as a doctor among the poor in Canton,was one of those who realised that there was not necessarily anyinevitability about the process of degeneration, even for addicts.'I have found' he wrote, the habitual use of opium even compatible with longevity . . .though its tendency is to undermine the constitution, and onlysupport the system by a false and dangerous stimulus, yet, ifit can be taken regularly and of good quality, it does not abridgethe duration of life to the extent that might reasonably be expectedthat it should do. The opium merchants took their cue. The ending of prohibitionafter the second Opium War relieved them of their worries in China;but they still had to watch public opinion in Britain. The Palmerstonera was ending; the Conservatives had always been hostile to hisChina policy; and the anti-opium campaign, led by Lord Shaftesbury,was gaining influential non-party support. It was time, the merchantsrealised, to present their wares in a more positively favourablelight; and on November 28th, 1867, Jardine Matheson put them ina letter to the Governor of Hong Kong. The ugly picture formerlydrawn of the effects of opium on the Chinese, they claimed, hadbeen forgotten; 'since 1860 it has been rendered abundantly clearthat the use of opium is not a curse, but a comfort and a benefitto the hard-working Chinese'. Had it been only Jardine Matheson who took this line, it couldsafely have been ignored. And when similar views were expressedby British consuls in the Treaty Ports in China, and transmittedto the Foreign Office, it was possible to suspect that they mightbe more concerned with British trade than with British moral prestige.But the cause was eventually supported by men who had no directinterest in opium, and who were unlikely to have been deludedor suborned; including Sir George Birdwood, a former Professorof Materia Medica in Bombay. Opium smoking, he told thereaders of The Times in a letter published on December26th, 1881, was 'almost as harmless an indulgence as twiddlingthe thumbs, and other silly-looking methods of concentrating thejaded mind'. The following year a book by William Bretherton,a retired Hong Kong solicitor, cited a number of testimonialsto opium from men of standing on the island; and in 1892, an evenmore impressive array of its supporters was paraded by G. H. M.Batten, a former Indian civil servant, in a paper read in Londonto the Society of Arts. The opportunity to solve the mystery came in 1893, when the pressureof public opinion in England, and a motion in the House of Commons,pushed the Government into setting up a Royal Commission to investigatethe subject. Their verdict was that opium in general was usedin moderation, and led 'to no evident ill effects'. One memberof the Commission, admittedly, dissented in a scathing minorityreport; and later, Joseph Rowntree was able to produce quite adamning critique of the report itself—showing, for example,that although forty-nine out of the fifty-two missionaries fromChina who had given evidence had condemned opium, the report hadquoted only the opinions of two of the three who had been lesscritical. Nevertheless the minutes of evidence showed that aswell as merchants and colonial civil servants, many doctors andsome missionaries believed that the opium habit was on balanceharmless, and could even be regarded as socially desirable. How was it possible that two such mutually contradictory setsof evidence could each be supported by so much knowledgeable andtrustworthy testimony? There was one obvious clue. Most of thewitnesses who condemned opium had worked in China. In India, wherethe Commission had held most of its sittings, most witnesses werein opium's favour. Could it not be—some of them had suggested—thatthe explanation was simple; the Chinese smoked opium, whereasthe Indians ate it, or drank it? But evidence from other colonies failed to support this proposition.In the Malay peninsula, the colonial authorities agreed, the reversewas the case; 'Opium eating in all its forms', the Auditor-Generalof the Straits Settlements claimed, 'when once established asa habit, produces an invariable bodily and mental condition whichimperatively calls for a constant, if graduated, increase of thedrug. Now, this is not the case with opium smoking.' And evidencefrom the same region upset another hypothesis; that the Chinesemight be in some way hereditarily susceptible to addiction. Inthe Straits Settlements, Major McCullum informed the Commission,only the 'indolent Malays' suffered ill-effects from the drug.For the Chinese it was 'a harmless, even a beneficial stimulant'. Reading between the lines it is clear that the Royal Commission,baffled, came to assume that the explanation must be looked forin the circumstances in which opium addiction was observed. The'anti-opiumists', as they were described, must have seen the effectsof the abuse of opium; they must have seen, or heard about, onlythe addicts, and been thereby misled into thinking that addictionwas inevitable. Again and again, in the reports from China, theemphasis was on the inescapable nature of the perdition awaitingthe opium smoker. As the Rev. A. Elwin, a missionary in Chinafor over twenty years, put it, there was no such thing as a moderatesmoker; 'the dose is always, I believe, increased by degrees'.But there were scores of witnesses in India to demonstrate thiswas nonsense—including missionaries; Dr. H. Martyn Clark testifiedthat he knew of no 'hardier, thriftier or more careful people'than the peasants of the Punjab, where he had worked; yet mostof them regularly took opium, a habit which 'seems to interfereneither with their longevity nor with their health'. The mostreasonable explanation, therefore, was that the missionary, analien in China, had been dealing with the cast-offs, the derelicts;whereas in India, he was familiar with all levels of the community. Although there was a measure of truth in this, it would not accountfor the whole range of different reactions to opium describedover the course of the century, in different regions—or in thesame region, in different periods. When opium had been introducedinto Assam, along with cheap labour for the new tea plantations,an official had protested in 1839 that in the course of a fewyears the opium plague had 'depopulated this beautiful country,turned it into a land of wild beasts'; and in the process, ithad 'degenerated the Assamese from a fine race of people to themost abject, crafty and demoralised race in India'. Yet fiftyyears later, though the consumption of opium there was higherper head than in any other part of India, it was giving no trouble.'They take their opium', Commissioner Driberg reported, 'justas a good Englishman would take his "peg".' Again, R. L. Stevenson's surmise—that it was the rapidity ofthe social changes which was disruptive, leading as it did tothe abuse of drink or drugs—seems the most likely explanation.Opium had come suddenly into Assam, along with an influx of cheaplabour, disrupting the community's old way of life. It did thesame in Burma, the only British colony where it gave serious trouble.And it was a menace in China, in those regions which the smugglerscould reach to 'push' the Indian produce. But in India itself,it posed no problem, being used mainly not as a narcotic, but,like coca in Peru, as a way of 'enabling the taker to undergosevere and continuous physical exercise'—Dr. Francis Anstienoted in his treatise on drugs in the 1860s—'without the assistanceof ordinary food'. It was for this purpose, Dr. W. Myers toldthe Royal Commission, that the chair-bearers, couriers and cooliesof Formosa took opium. He had been forced to alter his 'preconceivedprejudices with reference to the universally baneful effects ofthe drug', when he found that they used it every day, as a matterof course, rarely needing to increase the amount. Significantly, where the Chinese were allowed to smoke opium,outside their own country's jurisdiction, they did nothing todisturb the authorities. The opium smoker learned to discriminate,choosing his own brand, and savouring it with the relish of aconnoisseur. In a book describing his experiences as an attachéin Pekin, published in 1900, A. B. Freeman Mitford—the futureLord Redesdale—could seriously claim that to deprive the Chinamanof his Indian opium, and to condemn him to the 'miserable substitute'grown in China, 'would be like forbidding the importation of champagneand Chateau Lafitte into England, and driving our epicures andinvalids to the necessity of falling back on cheap and nasty stimulants'. Mitford, though, had lived in a region where the inhabitants hadcome to terms with opium. He had never seen, as missionaries hadseen, the destruction and misery that the drug could cause beforeit was domesticated. In any case, the British Government couldnot claim that it had only been trying to keep the Chinese suppliedwith an agreeable pastime, because it had not made that its excuse.Throughout the century, its aim had been to make the maximum profitfrom the drug, regardless of its effect on the Chinese. For abrief period at the beginning production had been restricted,but this was to increase profits; the pretence that it was tokeep down consumption was abandoned the moment profits began tofall. Two campaigns—three, if Napier's is included—had beenundertaken mainly to compel the Chinese to take the drug, preferablylegally. The reasons given, that they were designed to punishthe Chinese for seizing British property, and for insulting theBritish flag, were transparently spurious; the property was asmuggled drug, in the first instance, and the flag was flown bya drug smuggler in the second. It was the most protractedly sordidepisode in British Imperial history; and it was also an intimationthat where revenue was involved, a government could be just asgrasping, and just as unscrupulous, as any entrepreneur. Governmentshave since often thundered out denunciations of the men who manufactureand sell opium and heroin. It was a Government which taught themhow.

When the Governmentwas compelled by the vote in the House of Commons to concede aRoyal Commission into opium, there was an immediate protest: whysingle out opium when there were other drugs in common use inIndia? For many years, the opium lobby had contended that hempwas the more dangerous of the two. In 1840 the banker W. B. Baringhad told the Commons that if the traffic were suppressed, it mightsimply lead to the adoption in the Far East of drugs 'infinitelymore prejudicial to physical health and energy than opium', citingas an example 'an exhalation of the hemp plant, easily collectedat certain seasons, which was in every way more injurious thanthe use of the poppy'. Reminded of hemp's existence, the Governmentdecided on what appears to have been a diversionary tactic. OnMarch 2nd, 1893 the Member of Parliament for Bradford East, W.S. Caine—a persistent antidrug campaigner—asked for an enquiryinto the use of hemp drugs in India; and the Under Secretary ofState for India was able to assure him that the Viceroy was settingit up, and would be glad if the results 'show that further restrictioncan be placed upon the sale and consumption of these drugs'. There was a mass of evidence available about their effects, butlittle of it which could be described as scientific, apart fromsome experiments conducted in the 1840s by Dr. W. B. O'Shaughnessy,Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College of Calcutta. Hehad begun with animals, finding that they reacted in much thesame way as humans. A middling-sized dog, given ten grains ofhemp, 'became stupid and sleepy, dozing at intervals, startingup, wagging his tail, as if extremely contented; he ate some foodgreedily; on being called to, he staggered to and fro, and hisface assumed a look of utter and helpless drunkenness. These symptomslasted about two hours, and then gradually passed away.' Findingthat no harm came to the animals, O'Shaughnessy next tried thedrugs on patients suffering from disorders for which there wasno effective remedy—rheumatism, tetanus, cholera, convulsions—with results which led him to claim in the Transactionsof the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta that 'in hemp,the profession has gained an anti-convulsive remedy of the greatestvalue'. With hemp, though, as with coca, it was difficult to makeup pills or potions which were of consistent purity and strength;and the essential drug element in the plant eluded researchers.It remained in general use in medicine in India, particularlyat the village level; but it did not elsewhere establish the reputationO'Shaughnessy expected. In Britain, the drug—hashish, as it was loosely described—tendedto be thought of as sinister; not on the basis of experience orexperiment, but because of the reputation it had derived fromlegends. One had come down from Marco Polo, who had heard it onhis voyage to China in the thirteenth century. The 'Old Man ofthe Mountain', he was told, had desired that his people shouldbelieve that a valley which he had enclosed, and made into a garden,was Paradise; 'so he had fashioned it after the description thatMahomet gave of his Paradise, to wit, that it should be a beautifulgarden running with conduits of wine and milk and honey and water,and full of lovely women for the delectation of all its inmates'.A selected youth would be given a drug to put him to sleep, andcarried into the valley, so that when he woke up he would findhimself, as he thought, in Paradise, and would enjoy its sybariticdelights. He would then again be put to sleep, and transportedback out of the valley, 'whereat he was not over well pleased'.All he had to do if he wished to return, the Old Man of the Mountainwould tell him, was to perform the service required of him: 'gothou and slay so-and-so; and when thou returnest, my angels shallbear thee into Paradise. And shouldst thou die, nevertheless evenso will I send my angels to carry thee back into Paradise.' Sogreat was the desire to get back that the initiates would faceany peril to do so; 'and in this manner the Old One got his peopleto murder any one whom he would get rid of'. In Marco Polo's account, therefore, the drug featured only asa way to enable the Old Man of the Mountain to transport the youthsto and from the valley. But the legend became embroidered in thetelling; the drug used to put the youths to sleep was given avery different role. The murderers used it—the story ran—tonerve themselves to carry out the Old Man's commands. When, earlyin the nineteenth century, the French etymologist Sylvestre deSacy identified hashish, the drug, with haschishin—assassin—this was taken to be conclusive evidence that the members of theOrder of Assassins had derived their name from the drug they tookbefore committing their atrocious crimes. And the idea that hashishcould be taken for this purpose appeared to be confirmed whenit was learned that the 'whirling dervishes' used it, and whenLivingstone reported that the 'pernicious weed' was used by Africantribes to help them work themselves up into 'a species of frenzy'. It was difficult, though, to reconcile the effects of the drugin the legend, with the effects of the drug as actually observedin most of the countries of the Middle and Near East, where itwas in common use. The drinks which the Arabs made from the hempplant, the French traveller C. S. Sonnini noted on his tour inthe late eighteenth century, throw them into a sort of pleasing inebriety, a state of reveriethat inspires gaiety and occasions agreeable dreams. This kindof annihilation of the faculty of thinking, this kind of slumberof the soul, bears no resemblance to the intoxication producedby wine or strong liquors, and the French language affords noterms by which it can be expressed. The Arabs give the name ofkid to this voluptuous vacuity of mind, this sort of fascinatingstupor. Most observers echoed Sonnini; but this did not do much to redeemthe reputation of the drug. To the English, as they entered uponthe Victorian era, it was no recommendation to say that hashishinduced 'voluptuous vacuity', the secondary reputation it nowbegan to acquire—nourished, doubtless, by Dumas's account ofits effects on the Baron Franz d'Epinay, in The Count of MonteChristo . . . there followed a dream of passion like that promised bythe Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone turned to flame, breastsof ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz, yielding forthe first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow andvoluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to histhirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. Themore he strove against this unhallowed passion, the more his sensesyielded to the thrall, and at length, weary of the struggle thattaxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless andexhausted beneath the enchantment of his marvellous dream. The translators of The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Nightconfirmed the reputation of hashish, not simply as a drug by whichhusbands could be put to sleep so that lovers could enjoy theirwives, but also as an aphrodisiac—as illustrated in the translationby Sir Richard Burton in the story of the lover who was aboutto consummate his design when he woke up to find that it was alla hashish-induced dream, and that he was surrounded by a crowdof people laughing at him, 'for his prickle was at point and thenapkin had slipped from his middle'. The versions which circulatedin England might omit or bowdlerise such episodes, but the reputationof hashish spread by hearsay, leaving the impression that evenif some doubt might remain about what precisely its effects were,they were certainly deplorable. Perhaps because of this reputation, the British Raj tended tobe more suspicious of Indian hemp drugs, as they were describedthere, than of opium. They had been subjected to an enquiry onmore than one occasion in the past, the latest investigation havingbeen conducted as recently as the 1870s. Its report had claimedthat hemp drugs were less dangerous than their reputation suggested,and that in any case prohibition was impracticable. The LiberalGovernment decided to ignore these inconvenient findings, andset up a fresh enquiry. The members of the Commission were appointed in July 1893, underthe Chairmanship of the Hon. W. Mackworth Young, first FinancialCommissioner for the Punjab. Their terms of reference indicatedwhat was expected of them. They were to examine the trade in hempdrugs; its effect on the social and moral condition of the people;and 'the desirability of prohibiting the growth of the plant'.The Commission was composed of three British colonial officials,three 'native non-official gentlemen', and a Secretary, H. J.McIntosh—to whom much of the credit for the eventual reportwas probably due. Hemp drugs: enquiry The Commission had been warned that it might have difficulty infinding witnesses willing to come forward and tell what they knewabout the use and abuse of hemp drugs. No such difficulty wasexperienced. Civil servants, army officers, magistrates, doctors,lawyers, and business men filled in the questionnaire which wascirculated, and a gratifying number of them agreed to give verbalevidence in amplification. One group only, the Commission wassurprised to find, appeared reluctant to offer their services.A significant proportion of the missionaries who were sent thequestionnaire returned it without their answers. Their commonexcuse was that they did not have a sufficient knowledge of thematter. This was in striking contrast to the attitude of the missionariesto opium, particularly in China, where they had been in the forefrontof the agitation to suppress the traffic. Why—the Commissionerswondered—should the Indian missionary show such little concern?Pondering that question, they picked up an early clue. If themissionaries, of all people, disclaimed knowledge of the effectof hemp drugs, the drugs could hardly be a very serious threatto the social and moral condition of the Indian people. The terms of reference had referred to 'drugs' in the plural;and the Comrnissioners' first task was to try to sort them out—whichwas not easy. There was ganja, made from the dried floweringtops of cultivated plants; charas, the resinous matterscraped off them; and bhang, the dried leaves. But as Watthad just pointed out in his study of Indian plants, and as witnesseswere to confirm, the distinctions in practice had little meaning.One man's charas was another man's ganja, and thedrink made out of either was commonly called bhang. TheCommissioners heard witnesses who assured them that smoking bhangwas more dangerous than smoking ganja; 'but there are many otherswhose experience is precisely the reverse'. Some witnesses thoughtsmoking less harmful than drinking; 'but there is a great dealof evidence to a precisely opposite effect'. In the end the Commissioncautiously accepted the common opinion that the flowers and resinmight produce a more powerful drug than the leaves, but for thepurposes of its enquiry it seemed simpler to take them togetherunder the general label, hemp drugs. How extensively—the Commissioners next had to consider—werehemp drugs consumed? Putting this question to witnesses revealedjust how sparse the information was on the subject, even amongthose whose duties were 'believed to bring them into close andconstant contact with the people'. It was possible to make a tentativeestimate of the minimum quantity of ganja and charasused, because a duty was payable on the manufactured product;but it could safely be assumed that far more was used illicitly.As for bhang, made from the leaves, much of it came fromthe wild hemp plant, and there was no way of telling how muchof it was smoked, eaten and drunk, except observation—and observation,the Commissioners found, was a highly unreliable guide. Men whooffered themselves as knowledgeable witnesses might turn out tobe relying on hearsay; and those who claimed to have observedtheir use and effects had often derived their information onlyfrom visits to shops and shrines where smokers congregated—theequivalent, the Commissioners felt, of a man claiming to be knowledgeableabout the use and effects of alcohol in England, who had derivedall his knowledge from visits to pubs. From the evidence, however, one thing was obvious; that hemp drugswere far more extensively used than the average British, or evenIndian, official realised. They were taken as medicine, not onlyfor specific disorders, on prescription, but as tonics, and aidsto digestion. Drunk with meals, bhang was the equivalent of theEnglish labouring man's glass of beer. They were also generallytaken among the Hindus on family party occasions, and in connectionwith religious observances—particularly those linked with Shivawho, according to legend, had greatly appreciated the effectsof hemp. But by far the commonest use was by workers to give themstaying power. 'Gymnasts, wrestlers and musicians, palkibearersand porters, divers and postal runners are examples of the classeswho use the hemp drugs on occasions of especially severe exertion. . . all classes of labourers, especially such as blacksmiths,miners and coolies, are said more or less generally to use thedrugs, as a rule in moderation, to alleviate fatigue.' A medicine; an aid to endurance; a drink on family or religiousoccasions: in none of these capacities, the Commissioners felt,could the effects of hemp drugs be regarded as menacing. Evenwhen used as an intoxicant, its consequences generally appearedinnocuous—where they could be assessed: the Report quotedan unnamed writer as saying, 'the action of hemp on a man is sovarious that when we read the several descriptions given, differingso widely, we would scarcely suppose we were considering the sameagent'. In so far as they could be summarised, though, the immediateeffect of a hemp drug was refreshing and stimulating, and alleviates fatigue, giving riseto pleasurable sensations all over the nervous system, so thatthe consumer is 'at peace with everybody'—in a grand wakingdream. He is able to concentrate his thoughts on one subject;it affords him pleasure, vigour, ready wit, capacity for hardwork, and sharpness for business; it has a quieting effect onthe nervous system and removes restlessness and induces forgetfulnessof mental troubles; all sorts of grotesque ideas rapidly passthrough the mind, with a tendency to talk; it brightens the eyesand, like a good cigar, gives content. In young men, too, it might give rise to sensual thoughts. Butconsidering the drugs were so widely used, there was no evidenceto justify their ugly reputation. How had it spread? The reason,the Commissioners decided, was because the drugs had no observableeffects when they were taken in moderation. Even those witnesseswho most disapproved of them had had no conception just how extensivethat consumption was. It was only the rare examples of immoderateuse that were seen by doctor or magistrate; 'the ruin wroughtin certain cases by excess has alone attracted their notice. Theyfeel towards drugs as a man feels towards alcohol, whose experiencehas been mainly gained among the social wrecks of the lowest partsof a great city.' The evidence obtained from replies to the questionnaires revealedthat the proportion of men who took hemp drugs immoderately mustbe very small. It was nevertheless desirable, the Commissionersdecided, to investigate the allegations that had been made abouttheir effects on this minority; in particular, that the drugswere responsible for much of the insanity in India, and for muchof the crime. Hemp drugs and insanity There was no shortage of witnesses to testify to the way hempdrugs caused insanity; a few even expressed the view that to reopenthis particular line of enquiry was stupid, implying 'wilful blindnessto what has been abundantly proved'. And so the evidence at firstsuggested. Statistics sent in from mental hospitals all over Indiashowed that for years, hemp drugs had been one of the chief causesof mental breakdown. The foremost expert on the subject, SurgeonLt. Col. Crombie, had already shown in an article in the IndianMedical Gazette that a third of the inmates of the Dacca hospitalof which he had been Superintendent had smoked ganja; andin a very large proportion of cases, he believed, it had been'the actual and immediate cause of their insanity'. The 1871 Commission,which in other respects had tended to play down the danger ofthe drugs, had accepted that their habitual use did tend to produceinsanity; and the Government of Burma had just put a ban on hempdrugs largely for that reason. There was no reason to doubt the validity of the statistical evidence;nor was it challenged. Nevertheless the Commissioners decidedthat it ought to be checked. Taking the last year for which fullstatistics were complete, they ordered a re-examination of therecords of every patient admitted to a mental hospital in India,where that admission had been attributed to hemp drugs, in order'to ascertain how far the statistics were reasonably correct,and, if possible, also to arrive at some conclusion as to whetherhemp drugs have any real connection with insanity'. The first discovery the check provided was that what was enteredin the asylum records of admission as the 'cause' of insanitywas not derived from a diagnosis made at the asylum. It was simplytaken down by a clerk from the description given by the policemanor whoever was responsible for bringing the patient to the asylum,at the time. Examining magistrates, whose duty it was to checkthe admissions book, insisted that some specific cause shouldbe shown; and it had become standard procedure—Major Willcocks,of the Agra asylum, admitted—to enter 'hemp drugs' as the cause,wherever it was found that the patients took them; 'I cannot sayprecisely why it has come down as the traditional practice.' Hehad seen no reason to worry about the attribution, he explained,as he had assumed the drugs were poisonous; 'my ordinary medicalpractice did not bring me into contact with them at all. I onlycame into contact with them in the asylum. I had no idea theywere used so extensively as I find on enquiry to be the case.' Of all the asylum superintendents, only three claimed responsibilityfor the diagnosis entered in the admission books—one of thembeing the acknowledged authority, Surgeon Crombie. But when theyexamined the admissions book for the Dacca asylum in the lastfull year when he had been superintendent there, the Commissionersfound that it did not bear out his claim. In Dacca, as elsewhere,the entries had been based on whatever explanation had been givenby the people who brought the man to the asylum. The Commissiontherefore decided to check each individual patient's record. Innine out of the fourteen cases of insanity attributed to hempdrugs that year, and accepted as such by Crombie, the check showedthat hemp drugs could not have been responsible, as Crombie himself,confronted with the results, had to admit. The idea which he hadpublicised from his original figures—that hemp drugs were responsiblefor a third of the insanity cases in asylums in India—had thereforeto be revised; the proportion was fewer than one in ten. Crombiehad apparently formed the view, the Commission observed, thathis experience had given his evidence about the danger of hempdrugs a special value. This view had not been borne out by theirenquiry. Charitably, however, they ascribed his lapse to 'a mistakeof memory'. When the follow-up was complete, it was found that insanity couldbe related to hemp drugs in only forty cases from the whole ofIndia, in the year chosen—less than seven per cent of admissions;and even then, there was usually another possible cause. And 'cause',the Report added, was a risky term to apply; 'intemperanceof any kind may sometimes be not the cause of insanity, but anearly manifestation of mental instability'. In such cases, over-indulgencein hemp drugs could be regarded not as a cause but as a symptomof some underlying predisposition to insanity. Here, then, was evidence given by expert witnesses, accepted foryears, used as the justification for campaigns in other countriesto ban hemp drugs—in the case of Burma being accepted as responsiblefor the success of such a campaign—now shown to be worthless.How had the mistake been made ? The explanation, the Commissionersdecided, was simple. There was a natural tendency to look for,and blame, a specific physical cause. Hemp drugs had been an obviouschoice, because as intoxicants they could sometimes produce symptomssimilar to those of insanity. This popular idea has been greatly strengthened by the attitudetaken up by asylum superintendents. They have known nothing ofthe effects of the drugs at all, though the consumption is soextensive, except that cases of insanity have been brought tothem attributed with apparent authority to hemp drugs. They havegeneralised from this limited and one-sided experience. They haveconcluded that hemp drugs produce insanity in every case, or inthe great majority of cases, of consumption. They have accordinglywithout sufficient enquiry assisted, by the statistics they havesupplied, and by the opinions they have expressed, in stereotypingthe popular opinion and giving it authority and permanence. Hemp drugs and crime There remained the other charge to be considered: that hemp drugsbred crime. They did so, witnesses assured the Commission, inthree ways: by driving men to steal so that they could affordto buy the drug; by releasing criminal instincts; or by destroyinga man's self-control, so that he 'ran amok'. Hemp drugs users, some witnesses explained, progressed inexorablyfrom moderation to excess; excess made them too lazy to earn theirliving; and when addicted, they had to steal to maintain theirsupply. The Commissioners were unimpressed. The evidence theyhad collected had established that of the vast number of hempdrug users, only a tiny proportion used them immoderately. How,then, could it be claimed that the slide from moderation to addictionwas inexorable? As for releasing criminal instincts, hemp drugsappeared to have precisely the opposite effect; they 'tended tomake a man timid, and unlikely to commit a crime'. But the ideathat the drugs could cause men to run amok was not so easy todispose of, based as it was on common knowledge. Witness after witness confirmed its truth. R. D. Lyall, with overthirty years of varied experience as an official and as a magistratein India, told the Commission about the cases of such temporaryhomicidal frenzy, which he had personally had to deal with. Sodid W. C. Taylor, a veteran of almost half a century's experienceof Bengal. Surgeon Crombie treated the Commission to a descriptionof how a Bengali babu, 'as the result of a single debauch, inan attack of ganja mania slew seven of his nearest relativesin bed during the night'. And an Assam tea planter described anothersuch ganja-induced frenzy which he had good reason to remembervividly, as it had happened on his own estate. Again, the Commissioners decided to check the information, andasked the witnesses to provide the relevant records or references.Some immediately admitted that their information had been at second-hand,and could not be checked. Others promised to send along the details,from newspaper files; and then could not find them. R. D. Lyallwas unable to trace a single case of those he had had to dealwith; and the only one which W. C. Taylor was able to recall ofthe 'numerous cases' he had claimed to have been concerned with,turned out when checked to have had no connection with hemp drugs.An investigation of the records about Crombie's babu disclosedthat he had indeed been taking ganja, but he had also been takingopium; that he had a history of insanity before drugs were implicated;and that he had not been on a debauch before the murder, whichhad been committed in a state of 'mere insane despair'. And whenthe records of the case which the Assam tea planter had describedwere re-examined, it was found that his account to the Commissiondiffered materially from the one he had given at the time; notleast in that he had made no mention, at the time, of ganja. In the end, the Commission were able to find only twenty-threecases of homicidal mania which it was possible to check; and ineighteen of them there was nothing to suggest that hemp drugshad been responsible. 'It is astonishing', the Report commented, to find how defective and misleading are the recollections whichmany witnesses retain even of cases with which they have had specialopportunities of being well-acquainted. It is instructive to seehow preconceived notions based on rumour and tradition tend topreserve the impression of certain particulars, while the impressionsof far more important features of the case are completely forgotten. . . the failure must tend to increase the distrust with whichsimilar evidence, which there has been no opportunity of testing,has been received. Hemp drugs: verdict The Report concluded with the Commission's verdict on theissue which they had been brought together to consider: shouldhemp drugs be banned, in India, as they were in Burma? The answerwas an emphatic no. The drugs were not a serious hazard—exceptfor a tiny majority of the idle and dissolute whose excessiveconsumption endangered only themselves. Banning them would bepolitically dangerous, because it would constitute an unpopularinterference with Hindu religious and family observances. In anycase, prohibition would be unworkable—for reasons which Watthad just pointed out; it would be impracticable to hold a manresponsible for the existence of a wild plant growing near hishut, 'and it would be impossible to prohibit him from gathering,from such a plant, the daily quota used by him and his family'.And even if prohibition could be enforced, it would lead onlyto the increased consumption of more dangerous drugs, opium andalcohol. Why—a Madras missionary had asked—should the Governmentof India be concerned about hemp, rather than about 'the widespreadand rapidly increasing and much more injurious habit of alcoholicdrink?' Other witnesses had suggested an answer: it was a ploton the part of the liquor manufacturers. Graphs of sales figures,the Commission found, lent confirmation to the view that consumptionof the hemp drugs and of alcohol were intermeshed. If hemp drugsceased to be so readily available, the sales of alcoholic liquorcould be expected to rise. Summing up, the Commissioners in their Report could claimthat they had carefully examined the physical, mental and moraleffects of hemp drugs used in moderation, and that no observableadverse effects had been discoverable. There was no evidence thathemp drugs were habit-forming, in the way alcohol and opium were.A man who consumed the drugs even in moderation might feel uneasiness,or even a sensation of longing, if deprived of them. But thatwas not in itself a reason for depriving him of them—any morethan it would be in the case of tobacco. The Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission was laterto be rescued from oblivion by the campaigners against the prohibitionof cannabis in America and Britain, in the 1960s; but its verdicton that drug of 'not guilty' is of less importance than its analysisof the remarkable irrelevance of accepted opinions about a drug,even when they are supported by men who are supposedly expertson the subject. Surgeon Crombie was a notable example of the kindof man who has so often helped to translate public preconceptionsand prejudices on to Statute Books by lending the weight of hisauthority to them, when in fact he has never bothered to examinethe evidence in front of him, in his job; he has simply rationalisedit to fit those preconceptions and prejudices. By painstakingly going behind such opinions, and scrupulouslychecking the records, the Commission were able to acquit hempdrugs of the charges laid against them—as they were used inIndia. It does not follow that a similarly honest committee wouldhave come to the same conclusion in, say, the Cameroons, whereGerman officers in the 1880s reported that they found hemp beingtaken for its 'stimulating effect on the nervous system, so thatit is highly valued on long tiring marches, on lengthy canoe voyages,and on difficult night watches'—where, in other words, it wasbeing used for the same purpose as coca in Peru, or opium in Formosa.And Livingstone may perhaps have been right when he reported thatcertain tribes in Africa took it to work themselves up into asuitable state of frenzy before going into battle—though thisis more doubtful, because his description of the process suggeststhat they may have been taking it to calm their nerves. Indianhemp drugs were taken for very different purposes, in differentparts of the world; and they appear to have performed whateverservice was expected of them.

In the 1790s Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had beenprescribed laudanum—opium in an alcohol solution—for the reliefof pain, found that it altered his perception; it could give himoptical illusions—about distances, say: The poet's eye in his tipsy hour Has a magnifying power Or rather, the soul emancipates the eyes Of the accidents of size Laudanum could also start reveries in which his imagination appearedto carry him away, as if in a dream, but leaving him with sufficientconsciousness to be able to direct, to some extent, the coursethey were taking. In one of them, he composed Kubla Khan. Laudanum and laughing gas Why comparable experiences had not been familiar before, remainsa mystery. Opium had been used in Europe since medieval times;chiefly as a sedative, but doctors had come to realise that itseffects could vary greatly. 'It causes sleeping, and watching'—Dr.John Jones wrote, in a treatise published at the beginning ofthe eighteenth century—'stupidity and promptitude in business,cloudiness and serenity of mind. It excites the spirits, and yetquiets them; it relaxes, and weakens, yet it enables us to undergolabours, journeys, etc.; it causes a furious madness, yet composesthe spirits above all things.' But its vision-inducing potentialwas not grasped until Coleridge's experience, and not generallyknown until the publication in 1822 of Thomas de Quincey's Confessionsof an English Opium Eater, with his description of what happenedwhen he first took laudanum—tincture of opium in alcohol—for rheumatic pains in the head: in an hour, O heavens! What a revulsion! what a resurrection,from its lowest depths of the inner spirit ! What an apocalypseof the world within me! That my pains had vanished was now a triflein my eyes; this negative effect was swallowed up in the immensityof those positive effects which had opened up before me, in theabyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed. Here was a panacea. . . here was the secret of happiness, about which philosophershad disputed for so many ages, at once discovered; happiness mightnow be bought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat pocket;portable ecstasies might be had corked up in a pint bottle; andpeace of mind could be sent down by the mail. Agony of mind was soon to follow—as Jones had warned; 'greatand even intolerable distresses, anxieties and depression of spirits'.So intolerable were the withdrawal symptoms that many respectedcitizens who had begun to take opium as Coleridge and de Quinceyhad done, for the relief of pain, were unable to break the habit.Some, laudanum destroyed; others, like William Wilberforce andWilkie Collins, managed to come to terms with it, taking largebut not increasing doses. But laudanum did not provide them withvisions. It merely kept the distresses, anxieties and depressionsat bay. Might there not be other drugs, though, which could expand anartist's horizon, without enslaving him? Shortly before the turnof the century Humphry Davy, the discoverer of nitrous oxide,found that 'sniffing' gave him a feeling of ecstasy; 'nothingexists but thought' he told himself as he awoke; 'The universeis composed of impressions, ideas, pleasures and pains!'. Soon,'the laughing gas' and ether were being dispensed at 'frolics',which became a popular pastime. In parts of Ulster, ether becameso popular that its consumption took on the proportions of anepidemic, whose consequences were entertainingly described byK. H. Connell in his Irish Peasant Society, from contemporaryaccounts. The atmosphere of some towns 'was "loaded"with ether. Hundreds of yards outside Draperstown, a visitingsurgeon detected the familiar smell; market days smelt "notof pigs, tobacco smoke or of unwashed human beings"; eventhe bank "stove" of ether, and its reek on the DerryCentral Railway was "disgusting and abominable".' The Ulstermen appear to have been using ether as a cheap alternativeto alcohol; a tablespoonful—enough on which to get pleasantly,though briefly, inebriated—cost one penny. But some people usedit as a vision-inducer. 'You always heard music, and you'd becocking your ears at it', as an ether-taker put it; or you would'see men climbing up the walls and going through the roof, orcoming in through the roof and down the walls, nice and easy'.What a man experienced after taking it was limited, apparently,by his capacity for experience. As De Quincey put it, if a mantook opium whose talk was of oxen, he would dream about oxen—'ifhe were not too dull to dream'. For a few individuals, though,ether or laughing gas provided sensations which they would treasurethroughout their lives. In his Varieties of Religious Experience,William James was to recall how they could 'stimulate the mysticalconsciousness to an extraordinary degree', and though the truthsmight fade, 'the sense of a profound meaning having been therepersists'. The forbidden game The gases, however, could be dangerous in inexperienced hands;and many experimenters could get little but hilarity out of them.An alternative possibility as vision-inducer was Indian hemp,introduced into France by the men of Napoleon's army of the Nile,and taken up for experimental purposes in the 1840s by JacquesMoreau, a Parisian doctor who thought it might help in the treatmentof patients suffering from mental illness. Trying it out on himself,he found it put him into paroxysms of uncontrollable laughter,and then gave him visions of an entirely pleasurable kind. 'Itis really happiness which is produced', he wrote, and by this I mean an enjoyment entirely moral, and by no meanssensual, as might be supposed—a very curious circumstance, fromwhich some remarkable inferences might be drawn . . . for thehashish eater is happy, not like the gourmand or the famishedman when satisfying his appetite, or the voluptuary in the gratificationof his amative desires—but like him who hears tidings whichfill him with joy, or like the miser counting his treasures, thegambler who is successful at play, or the ambitious man who isintoxicated with success. Dr. Moreau shared the delights of his discovery with the membersof the Club des Hachichins, founded in 1844, Dumas, Gautierand Baudelaire being among its members. Gautier described hisreactions to the drug two years later in the Revue de deuxmondes: 'frenetic, irresistible, implacable laughter' succeededby grotesque hallucinations, fantasies of droll dreams confusedly danced about; hybrid creations,formless mixtures of men, beasts and utensils; monks with wheelsfor feet and cauldrons for bellies: warriors, in armours of dishes,brandishing wooden swords in birds' claws; statesmen moved byturnspit gears; kings plunged to the waist in salt-cellar turrets. . . Baudelaire's account was more clinical. People trying hashishfor the first time, he observed, would complain that it had littleeffect, which might be attributed to their resistance. But itwould suddenly hit them with 'a sort of irrelevant and irresistiblehilarity . . . as painful as a tickle'. Occasionally this ledon to weakness and stupor, but for some people, 'a new subtletyor acuity manifests itself in all the senses', and this was whenhallucinations set in. 'External objects acquire, gradually andone after another, strange new appearances; they become distortedor transformed. Next occur mistakes in the identity of objects,and transposals of ideas. Sounds clothe themselves in colours;and colours contain music.' Such experiences could be very satisfying; 'the universality ofall existence arrays itself before you in a new and hitherto unguessedat glory'. But in the end, for Baudelaire, they were regressivein their effects. The hashish-eater, he decided, 'completely confoundsdream with action, his imagination kindling more and more at thespectacle of his own nature corrected and idealised, he substitutesthis fascinating image of himself for his real individuality—sopoor in strength of will, and so rich in vanity'. And, the morrow! the terrible morrow! All the body's organs lax andweary, nerves unstrung, itching desires to weep, the impossibilityof applying oneself steadily to any task—all these cruelly teachyou that you have played a forbidden game . . . The especial victimis the will, that most precious of the faculties. It is said,and it is almost true, that hashish has no evil physical effects;or, at worst, no serious ones. But can it be said that a man incapableof action, good only for dreaming, is truly well, even thoughall his members may be in their normal condition ? Other experimenters with hashish were to reach a similar conclusion;among them the American Fitzhugh Ludlow—though he stressed thatit was not the drug, but man's reliance on it, that caused theproblems: 'the soul withers and shrinks from its growth towardsthe true end of its being beneath the dominance of any sensualindulgence', so that though the bondage might continue to be golden,there was all the while erosion of strength. Not all the devotees of hashish experienced Baudelaire's 'terriblemorrow'. A few were able to smoke it and examine its effects asdispassionately as they might have examined the effects of tobacco;among them the young Charles Richet, later to be a Professor ofPhysiology in Paris, and a Nobel prizewinner. Richet observed,as others had done, that for anybody under the influence of hashish,time could appear to stand still—or at least to pass more gradually;and in 1877 he presented a plausible explanation. Man's mind,he pointed out, is full of indetermined and incomplete ideas,intertwined. Disentangling them took time; and 'as time is onlymeasured by the remembrance of ideas, it appears prodigiouslylong'. What hashish did was speed up the process: in the space of a minute we have fifty different thoughts; sincein general it requires several minutes to have fifty differentthoughts, it will appear to us that several minutes are passed,and it is only by going to the inflexible clock, which marks forus the regular passage of time, that we perceive our error. Withhashish the notion of time is completely overthrown, the momentsare years, and the minutes are centuries; but I feel the insufficiencyof language to express this illusion, and I believe, that onecan only understand it by feeling it for himself. But such detachment was rare among the members of the Clubdes Hachichins and their successors; and they had given hashisha reputation as a vision-inducer which experience, for the majorityof people who tried it, failed to justify. It had been the atmosphereof the Club des Hachichins, and the personalities of itsmembers, which had lent Indian hemp its potency, rather than anyquality in the drug.

Their discoveries had begunto elevate chemistry to the status of an exact science; and pharmacologistshad naturally begun to look forward to the day when their branchof the faculty would share in the distinction. For a while it looked as if their ambition was going to be realised.One by one, plant drugs began to deliver up their secrets—thealkalis which, it was assumed, constituted the essential drugelement. Morphine was derived from opium in 1803, and other similardiscoveries followed: caffeine, quinine, nicotine. More reliableevidence began to be available, too, about the purposes for whichdrugs were used throughout the world; and it became possible toinvestigate the subject not, as before, primarily from the standpointof the botanist or the chemist, but with a view to assessing therole of drugs in society. And the first serious attempt at a generalsurvey was made by James Johnston in his Chemistry of CommonLife, which was published in 1854. James Johnston Johnston, who was Professor of Chemistry at the University ofDurham, had the breadth of outlook of a Benjamin Franklin or aHumphry Davy; he was interested in chemistry not for its own sake,but for what it provided for mankind. He was not thinking in termssimply of the chemical processes by which bread, or wine, wereprovided, but of what gave bread its flavour, and wine its bouquet.How significant he felt drugs were can be gauged by the fact thathe devoted almost half the book to them; a chapter each to teaand coffee; two chapters to alcoholic liquors; and no fewer thaneight chapters to 'the narcotics we indulge in', ranging fromtobacco to deadly nightshade. Johnston was disturbed by what he felt was the irrational prejudiceagainst the use of narcotics of any kind, reflected in the effortsthat had been made in countries all over the world to suppressthem. It was absurd, he argued, to think of them as strange andsinister, considering the vast number of people who regularlytook them. Precise estimates of the number of drug-takers wereimpossible to come by; but tobacco, he estimated, was used by800 million people; opium by 400 million; Indian hemp by 200 300million; betel by 100 million; and coca by 10 million. No nation so ancient but had its narcotic soother from the mostdistant times; none so remote and isolated but has found withinits own borders a pain-allayer and care-dispeller of native growth;none so savage which instinct has not led to seek for, and successfullyto employ, this form of physiological indulgence. The cravingfor such indulgence, and the habit of gratifying it, are littleless universal than the desire for, and the practice of, consumingthe necessary materials of our common food. Nor was it any more reprehensible; on the contrary, Johnston argued,man's recognition of the value of narcotics should be consideredas forming 'one of the most wonderful chapters in his entire history'.In the first of the three stages of that history, man had foundhow to provide for his material needs—'beef and bread'. In thesecond, he had sought ways to 'assuage the cares of his mind andbanish uneasy reflections', which he did with the help of alcoholicbeverages. And in the third, his object was to multiply his enjoyments, intellectual and animal, and for thetime to exalt them. This he attains by the aid of narcotics. Andof these narcotics, again, it is remarkable that almost everycountry or tribe has its own, either aboriginal or imported; sothat the universal instinct of the race has led, somehow or other,to the universal supply of this want or craving also. Johnston cited tea and coffee as examples. Tea, in particular,could be a dangerous drug; 'green tea, when taken very strong,acts very powerfully on some constitutions producing nervous tremblingsand other distressing symptoms, acting as a narcotic, and in inferioranimals even producing paralysis'. But men had learned to useit more discreetly, so that 'it exhilarates without sensibly intoxicating'.Even the poorest took it, preferring the 'luxury' of a cup oftea to an extra potato or a larger loaf—a choice which Johnstonwholeheartedly approved; 'he will probably live as long underthe one regimen as the other; and while he does live, he willboth be less miserable in mind, and will show more blood and spiritin the face of difficulties, than if he had denied himself thistrifling indulgence'. It was not the chemical properties of the plant—Johnston argued—butthe uses to which man put it, that mattered; a point which comesacross even more forcibly when his book is read today, as manyof the plants which he included are no longer considered to bedrugs. The English beer drinker esteems hops for imparting flavour;to Johnston, the hop was 'the English narcotic', justly celebratedas a sleep inducer, and 'unquestionably one of the sources ofthe pleasing excitement, gentle narcotic intoxication, and healthytonic action which well-hopped beer is known to produce on thosewhose constitutions enable them to drink it'. Even more surprisingis Johnston's description of lettuce. The juice of these plants, when collected and dried, has considerableresemblance to opium. If the stem of the common lettuce, whenit is coming into flower, be wounded with a knife, a milky juiceexudes. In the open air, this juice gradually assumes a browncolour, and dries into a friable mass. The smell of this driedjuice is strongly narcotic, recalling that of opium. It has aslightly pungent taste but, like opium, leaves a permanent bitternessin the mouth. It acts upon the brain after the manner of opium. . . eaten at night, the lettuce causes sleep; eaten during theday, it soothes and calms and allays the tendency to nervous irritability. There are other reminders in the Chemistry of Common Lifethat the classification of what is, and what is not, a plant drugmay vary from country to country, and from period to period. Buteven more significant, in the light of what was to happen later,was Johnston's realisation that drugs could not be classifiedby their observed pharmacological action on man, because thataction varied so greatly. Moslems, for example, took tobacco becauseit soothed the mind to sleep, while leaving the body alert andactive. But, that such is not its general action in Europe, the study of almostevery German writer can testify. With the constant pipe diffusingits beloved aroma around him, the German philosopher works outthe profoundest of his results of thought. He thinks and dreams,and dreams and thinks, alternately; but while his body is soothedand stilled, his mind is ever awake. From what I have heard suchmen say, I could almost fancy that they had in this practice discovereda way of liberating the mind from the trammels of the body, andthus giving it a freer range and more undisturbed liberty of action.I regret that I have never found it act so upon myself. To some extent, Johnston realised, individual reactions to a drugcould be accounted for by observing how the individual took it.A glass of whiskey would have a different effect if it were tossedoff neat than if it were sipped, with water, for an hour. Butthis, he felt, was not enough to account for the remarkable differencesin the effects of the same drug on different individuals—andeven on different communities. Could it be, he wondered, thatthe use of a particular drug over a long period gradually changedthe disposition and temperament of a people—in turn changingtheir reactions? There was no way of telling, with any certainty;but 'the fate of nations has frequently been decided by the slowoperation of long-acting causes, unthought of and unestimatedby the historian, which, while the name and the local home ofthe people remain the same, had gradually changed their constitution,their character, and their capabilities'. In view of all this evidence, Johnston argued, to think in termsof trying to prohibit drug-taking by legislation was futile: A tendency which is so evidently a part of our general human nature,is not to be suppressed or extinguished by any form of mere physical,fiscal, or statutory restraint. It may sometimes be discouragedor repressed by such means, but even this lesser result is notalways obtainable ... an empire may be overthrown by inconsideratestatutory intermeddling with the natural instincts, the old habits,or the growing customs of a people, while the instincts and habitsthemselves are only strengthened and confirmed. Francis Anstie Johnston's thesis made an impression on Francis Anstie, a physicianat the Westminster Hospital who had been specialising in toxicology,hoping—as he explained in his Stimulants and Narcotics,published in 1864—to be able to remove the study of the subjectfrom the metaphysical to the physical level. To this end he hadexperimented on himself, and on some patients, with a varietyof drugs; his original intention being to put them into categories,such as the one suggested by the title of his book. To the patient,as well as to the doctor, the distinction seemed clear; some drugswere 'stupefying poisons'—narcotics; others, 'grateful restoratives'—stimulants.But the result of his researches had upset his expectation thathe would be able to clarify the distinction for textbook purposes.'To the philosophic student', he ruefully admitted, 'who desiresto arrange in orderly classification the weapons of his art, andthereby to multiply his resources, the accurate definition ofthese two classes of remedies offers a problem at once of greatinterest and of extreme difficulty.' Chloroform, for example,was regarded as a narcotic. But his experiments had shown himthat in certain circumstances, it could be a powerful stimulant.The action of alcohol was even more confusing. At first sight,it appeared to be a stimulant; 'but on analysing the symptomswe are at no loss to perceive that it is the emotional and appetitivepart of the mind which is in action while the intellect, on thecontrary, is directly enfeebled'. It was at least possible, Anstiespeculated, that the outbreak of the passions which alcohol couldinduce was due, 'not to any stimulation of them, but to the removalof the check ordinarily imposed by reason and will'. To most Europeans, Anstie went on, opium was a narcotic; to Orientals,a stimulant. They were able, 'sometimes without any previous practice,to take large quantities of opium without suffering stupefaction;on the contrary, they appear much exhilarated in spirits, andtheir minds work with much freedom. In some cases, muscular powerand the disposition for exertion seem actually to increase'. Thelikely explanation, Anstie thought, was that opium prevented otheractivities from interfering with mental processes, which gavethe appearance of an increase of intellectual power. And thiscould also be an explanation of another mystery. Pain, he suggested,was not relieved by sedatives and depressants— except wherethey poisoned the system, as when a man took enough alcohol torender himself insensible. What relieved pain was the stimulatingeffect of opium, or other drugs, in small doses. It was the stimulus,he concluded, that mattered, and that might be given by some substancewhich was not, in the strict sense, a drug, but which had theappropriate effect; 'I have seen one patient suffering from severeagony with peritonitis who developed rapid relief from the carefuland gradual injection of a pint of rich soup into the rectum'. Like Johnston, Anstie had been compelled to recognise what a minorpart the pharmacology of a drug might play in determining man'sreactions to it, compared with the part played by man's responses.It was a matter of common observation that the same amount ofalcohol which would enliven one man, would depress another; or,according to his circumstances make the same man jolly, one evening,and sad, the next. But to the new generation of scientifically-mindedchemists, toxicologists and pharmacologists this was a thoroughlyunsatisfactory state of affairs. It left their discipline uneasilysuspended, like a hammock slung between one solid tree—chemistry—andsome young saplings—biology, neurology, psychology—which bentand swayed in every scientific breeze. Throughout the century, therefore, pharmacologists continued toengage in a search for certainties; and in this they were naturallyencouraged by further discoveries of alkalis. These, it continuedto be assumed, represented the essential drug element in a plant.When they were extracted they would obviate the wastage involvedin consumption of the rest of the plant; when refined, impuritieswould be removed. And it would be easier to measure out the prescribedstrength of dosage. So it came about that morphine, the derivative,began to replace opium and laudanum as a sedative and a painkiller. The outcome was the first of a succession of cruel disillusionments.So long as morphine continued to be taken strictly on prescription,for specific medical purposes, it fulfilled expectations. Butsome of the people for whom it was prescribed came to rely onit for release from everyday cares, and others took it for a 'lift'.It began to enslave addicts as effectively as laudanum had enslavedde Quincey. The medical profession—the doctors by this timehad formed themselves into a profession, and had begun to exercisea closer supervision of drugs—reacted with alarm, and for atime addicts were treated by enforced deprivation. The withdrawalsymptoms, though, could be dangerous, as well as painful; caseswere reported of addicts, deprived of morphine, who had had hallucinationsand delirium, and some of them died under the treatment. Whatwas needed, clearly, was some drug which would do the work ofmorphine, but without creating addiction. Any medical scientistwho found one would have his fortune made—as the young SigmundFreud realised, when he first began to experiment with the alkaliwhich pharmacologists had extracted from the leaves of the cocaplant: cocaine. Cocaine Unlike tobacco, coca had not established itself as a drug in Europe—oreven in South America, among the colonists. For a young Spaniardto begin to take it was regarded as a sign that he was rebellingagainst his class; he would be repudiated, and forced either toleave or to live with the Indians, and adopt their ways. Occasionallytravellers would return from voyages in the Andes with storiesof the feats of endurance which the Indians performed under itsinfluence; but although they were noted by Abraham Cowley (inwhose mind, Dr. Johnson was to recall, 'botany turns into poetry') Endowed with leaves of wondrous nourishment Whose juice succ'd in, and to the stomach ta'en Long hunger and long labour can sustain its possibilities do not appear to have been recognised untilthe Jesuit Don Antonio Julian lamented in his Perla de Americathat it was not used in Europe alongside tea and coffee ('it ismelancholy to reflect that the poor of Europe cannot obtain thispreservative against hunger and thirst; that our working peopleare not supported by this strengthening plant in their long continuedlabours'). The author of a treatise published in 1793 suggestedthat the sailors in European navies would benefit from a cocaration; and in 1814 a writer in the Gentleman's Magazineelaborated on the proposition. It was not yet clear how the SouthAmerican Indians achieved their feats of endurance, he admitted;but it is certain they have that secret, and put it into practice.They masticate coca, and undergo the greatest fatigue withoutany injury to health or bodily vigour. They want neither butcher,nor baker, nor brewer, nor distiller, nor fuel, nor culinary utensils.Now, if Professor Davy will apply his thoughts to the subjecthere given for his experiments, there are thousands even in thishappy land who will pour their blessings upon him, if he willbut discover a temporary anti-famine, or substitute for food,free from all inconvenience of weight, bulk and expense, and bywhich any person might be enabled, like the Peruvian Indian, tolive and labour in health and spirits for a month now and thenwithout eating. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, and the employmentof men, women and children in the mills twelve hours a day, sixdays a week, there was an incentive to examine the claims forcoca more seriously; especially after von Tschudi's observationsin the 1830s convinced him that coca's reputation was well-founded.When he took an infusion of the leaves of the plant, while hewas on a hunting expedition at 14,000 feet up in the Andes, hefound it worked for him, too: 'I could then during the whole dayclimb the heights, and follow the swift-footed wild animals.' Taken in excess over a protracted period, Tschudi realised, cocacould have unwelcome effects; the inveterate chewer could be detectedfrom 'his unsteady gait, his yellow-coloured skin, his dim andsunken eyes encircled by a purple ring, his quivering lips, andhis general apathy'. But this was unusual. Ordinarily, the drugappeared to have no adverse effects. Even when it was taken invery large amounts, there was no loss of consciousness; and manyof those who took it every working day (and doubled their intakeon festival occasions) lived on to a great age, in perfect health.'Setting aside all extravagant and visionary notions on the subject',he concluded, 'the moderate use of coca is not merely innocuous,but it may even be conducive to health.' Tschudi's Travels in Peru was followed by accounts fromother travellers, most of them in agreement with him; and in the1850s an Italian doctor, Paolo Mantegazza, experimented on himselfby chewing dried coca leaves. He experienced an increase in physicaland mental energy, and when he tried an infusion of the leaves,he found that not merely did the inclination to take exercisebecome irresistible; he also had an odd feeling of becoming isolatedfrom the external world, which would enable him to perform featswhich ordinarily he would not have attempted. On an impulse hejumped up on his writing table, without smashing the lamp or otherobjects on it. Nor did he suffer any reaction, comparable witha hangover: following the activity he felt only quiet comfort.And increasing the dose—to the amount commonly consumed by thenatives of Peru—only increased his sense of exhilaration. Joyouslyhe told his colleagues that he preferred 'ten years with cocato a million centuries without'. In a treatise on the subjectpublished in Milan in 1859 he wrote, more sedately, that the principalproperty of coca, 'not to be found in any other remedy, consistsin its exalting effect, calling out the power of the organismwithout leaving any sign of debility'; and he recommended itsuse for nervous disorders. Gradually, coca began to win adherents in other countries. Inthe early 1870s Sir Robert Christison tried it out on medicalstudents in Edinburgh, and was impressed by the results; the chewingof coca leaves, he reported, 'not only removes extreme fatigue,but prevents it', and the only effect it had on the mental facultieswas to eliminate the dullness ordinarily associated with fatigue.In France racing cyclists began to take it, to increase theirpowers of endurance; so did the Toronto Lacrosse Club, in Canada,who with its assistance won the title 'Champions of the World'. From the time of its foundation half a century before, the Lancethas enjoyed exposing nostrums as quackery; and the budding reputationof coca gave it yet another opportunity to live up to its reputation.In 1876 it carried a report of an investigation by G. F. Dowdeswell,a member of the staff of the University College Physics Department,into the properties of coca and its action on the human body.Dowdeswell claimed that he had been concerned solely with themeasurable effects on a human subject—changes in pulse rate,temperature, and so on; and he had demonstrated they were negative.But consumption of coca had also failed to produce any of thesubjective effects 'so fervently described, and ascribed to it,by others; not the slightest excitement, not even the feelingof buoyancy and exhilaration which is experienced from mountainair, or a draught of spring water'. Although Dowdeswell was notprepared to claim that coca, in this capacity, was pharmacologicallyinert, his experiments, he argued, demonstrated that its actionwas so slight 'as to preclude the idea of its having any valueeither therapeutically or popularly'. Whatever might be the virtueof the coca leaf in South America, the Lancet commentededitorially, 'it seems to have lost much of its marvellous virtuewhen used in this country.' Laboratory trials of that kind had not then acquired the authoritythey were later to command; and even the Lancet's reputationwas not sufficient to stem coca's growing popularity as a stimulant.The following year, it was admitted to the U.S. Pharmacopeia;soon afterwards, to its British counterpart; and from the varietyof disorders for which it began to be prescribed it looked asif it might be following the same triumphant clinical course thattobacco had taken three centuries earlier. But it was just toolate. Pharmacologists succeeded in identifying what was assumedto be the narcotic element of the coca leaf: cocaine. It seemedself-evident that it would be absurd to ask a patient to chewcoca leaves, or drink infusions of them, when it was possibleto give him accurately measured doses of its essential ingredient. But first, it was necessary to demonstrate that cocaine worked;and in 1883 a German army doctor tried the drug out on soldiersto see if it did the same for them as the leaves did for the nativesof Peru. It did. Cocaine, Dr. Theodor Aschenbrandt was able toreport, greatly increased their energy and endurance. The reportattracted Freud's attention. He had just become engaged to MarthaBernays, and was looking for some medical discovery which wouldmake his name, and his fortune, so that they could afford to marry.'I am procuring some myself', he wrote to tell her, 'and willtry it with cases of heart disease and also of nervous exhaustion,particularly in the miserable condition after withdrawal of morphine',a possibility which had been suggested in an American medicaljournal. Having taken some cocaine—it altered his mood fromdepression to cheerfulness, he was delighted to find, withoutimpairing his ability to work—he tried it on his friend Dr.Fleischl, a morphine addict, with immediately gratifying results. 'The temperament of an investigator'—Freud had told Martha inthe letter describing his research into cocaine—'needs two fundamentalqualities: he must be sanguine in the attempt, but critical inthe work'. He failed to heed his own advice. Cocaine, he decided,was 'a magical drug'. He took it himself against depression andindigestion; sent some to Martha; recommended it for a varietyof disorders; and wrote an essay on it published in 1884, whichwas an extended eulogy. Cocaine provided 'exhilaration and lastingeuphoria'; 'an increase of self-control'; 'more vitality and capacityfor work'. Whether mental or physical, work could be performedwithout any fatigue; there were none of the unpleasant after-effectsassociated with alcohol; and 'absolutely no craving for the furtheruse of cocaine appears after the first, or even repeated, takingof the drug; one feels, rather, a curious aversion to it'. The following year, the first warnings were sounded. To some persons,nothing was more fascinating than indulgence in cocaine—a writercommented in the Medical Record for November 28th, 1885— It relieves the sense of exhaustion, dispels mental depression,and produces a delicious sense of exhilaration and well-being.The after-effects are at first slight, almost imperceptible; butcontinuous indulgence finally creates a craving which must besatisfied; the individual then becomes nervous, tremulous sleepless,without appetite, and he is at last reduced to a condition ofpitiable neurasthenia. By the spring of 1887 a Brooklyn doctor, J. B. Mattison, had compileda formidable dossier to show that cocaine was highly addictive—asFreud himself, who had passionately defended cocaine, now realised.He had to watch Fleischl suffering from the agonies of chronicintoxication, delirium tremens, and 'white snakes creeping overhis skin'. There was no reason, in theory, why the unmasking of cocaine shouldhave had an adverse effect on the reputation of coca—any morethan the discovery that tobacco's alkali, nicotine, was highlypoisonous had deterred people from smoking. But because the earlyexperimenters with cocaine had argued that, as Freud put it, cocainewas 'the essential constituent of coca leaves', there was an understandabletendency for coca to be found guilty by association; and it hadnot been on the market for long enough to become established inthe way that tobacco had been before nicotine was found. Coca had its defenders: chief among them W. G. Mortimer, a Fellowof the New York Academy of Medicine. In 1901 he published hishistory of the 'divine plant of the Incas', a rambling, repetitive,but exhaustively researched defence of the use of the plant, asdistinct from its alkali. The pharmacologists, he asserted, haddeceived the public; cocaine no more represented coca than prussicacid, found in minute quantities in peach stones, 'representsthat luscious fruit'. The analogy might not be precise, but theproposition he derived from it was of fundamental importance:that the action of cocaine on the human system, though in somerespects similar to that of coca, must not be considered as identical:'each gives a peculiar sense of well being; but cocaine affectsthe central nervous system more pronouncedly than does coca; not—ascommonly presumed—because it is coca in a more concentratedform, but because the associated substances present in coca, whichare important in modifying its action, are not present in cocaine'.As proof he was able to cite the discovery of Dr. Henry Rusbythat the Andean natives, making their careful selection of leavesfor chewing, did not, in fact, choose the leaves with thehighest cocaine content. And in the entire literature on the subject,Mortimer claimed, before the attacks on cocaine, there had beenno serious criticism of coca. Nor was there any known case ofcoca addiction or coca poisoning ('What it does for the Indianat fifteen', one authority had asserted, 'it does for him at sixty;a greatly increasing dose is not resorted to.') Not merely wasit as innocent as tea or coffee, 'which are commonly acceptedpopular necessities—but it is vastly superior to those substances'. But how was it—if the authorities Mortimer cited were correct—thatthe findings of scientific experimenters like Dowdeswell had beennegative? Perhaps, Mortimer surmised, they had used the wrongkind of leaves. Or the explanation might be along the lines putforward in 1881 by a New York physician, W. S. Searle: that notonly was coca's action so gentle that it could escape detection:it might not take place at all in experiments, because the appropriatemechanism would not be brought into action. While no other known substance can rival coca in its sustainingpower, no other has so little apparent effect. To one pursuingthe even tenor of his usual routine, the chewing of coca givesno special sensation. In fact the only result seems to be a negativeone, viz.: an absence of the customary desire for food and sleep.It is only when some unusual demand is made upon mind or bodythat its influence is felt. And to this fact is to be attributedmuch of the incredulity of those who have carelessly experimentedwith it and who, expecting some internal commotion or sensation,are disappointed. Mortimer himself felt that the explanation probably also lay inthe different circumstances in which coca was consumed in SouthAmerica, where it affected the body's capacity for work by moreefficient conversion of food into energy. Coca helped the AndeanIndians to avoid fatigue by acting upon the stored-up carbohydratesto which they were accustomed. It might have no affect—the implicationwas—on a Westerner accustomed to a different diet. Whatever the explanation—Mortimer concluded—the evidence fromclinical experience was irrefutable. He had himself circulariseddoctors all over America about their experiences with coca; over350 had replied and a large majority of those expressing opinionswere agreed that coca improved the digestion, strengthened theheart, stimulated the mind, and improved sexual performance. Alldoctors who agreed with him, he urged, should accept the needfor a long and persistent campaign to explain coca's value, 'andso reflect credit upon themselves through the advocacy and useof a really marvellous drug'. It was to no purpose. Coca might be all that Mortimer claimed,but it lost caste; the medical profession gradually losing interest.Cocaine, like morphine, continued to have a limited range of clinicaluses; but they would soon, it was hoped, be replaced for mostpurposes by a new drug. Heroin had been derived from opium in1898; soon it was being enthusiastically promoted by manufacturers,and enthusiastically welcomed by doctors, as more effective thanits predecessors, and carrying—the assurance was —no riskwhatsoever of promoting addiction. Mescaline After the disappointments with laudanum and Indian hemp, the searchfor a safe and effective vision-inducing drug had languished fora time; but towards the end of the century it was revived, largelythrough the efforts of a young Berlin pharmacologist, Louis Lewin.Lewin first made his reputation by some research into morphine;then, he went on to make the first scientific study of kava. Missionaries,Lewin had read, were inclined to regard kava as a powerful intoxicantwhich ought to be banned; yet Europeans who took it generallyfound that it had little or no effect on them. Why? Lewin decidedto find the active chemical principle, test it, and settle theissue one way or the other. The tests convinced him that kavawas a mild stimulant, improving muscular efficiency and endurance;and though it could be taken as an intoxicant, its effects wererelatively gentle, compared with alcohol. At least people underits influence did not become noisy and aggressive. Up to this point, Lewin was following Anstie's course; but whereasAnstie's findings compelled him to give up the attempt to distinguishdrugs by their effects on man, Lewin remained sublimely confidentthat it was only a matter of time before he could unravel thestrands sufficiently to allow him to categorise drugs accordingto their effects. And he was greatly encouraged in this view bypeyote which came into his possession on a visit to America. Thebotanical Museum in Berlin decided the cacti were a new species;four alkaloids were extracted from them, including mescal—mescaline;and Lewin had his monument— the sub-species was named afterhim, anhalonium lewinii. In Lewin, however, peyotl induced no vision. He found it onlytoxic (as did William James. It made him vomit; 'I will take thevisions on trust', he told his brother Henry). But another American,the pioneer psychiatrist Weir Mitchell, was delighted with theresults, when he tried peyotl in the lE90s, finding it a powerfulphysical and emotional stimulus. He could climb to the fourthfloor of his hotel two steps at a time without puffing; and later—'deliciouslyat languid ease, I was clearly in the land where it is alwaysafternoon'—he had a sense of heightened intellectual power.In retrospect he had to admit that a reading of what he wroteunder the influence failed to justify it; but he could not findwords to express the 'beauty and splendour of what I saw'. After reading Mitchell's account in the British Medical Journal,Havelock Ellis took mescaline, with very similar results. Hisfirst symptom was an access of energy, and of intellectual power;then visions, the colours indescribably vivid and delightful,so reminiscent of Monet's paintings that Ellis decided to offersome mescal to an artist he knew, to observe the effect. The artistduly had fantastic visions—but they were accompanied by paroxysms,pain, and the fear he was dying. 'It may at least be claimed,'Ellis wrote, 'that for a healthy person to be once or twice admittedto the rites of mescal is not only an unforgettable delight butan educational influence of no mean value.' But he realised thatmore research was needed; and the fact that Weir Mitchell hadalso had unfortunate results when he tried it out on a colleaguedid not encourage more orthodox medical scientists to carry iton. Mescaline had been discovered at the wrong time. Pharmacologistswere looking for drugs which had measurable effects; not drugswhich induced unquantifiable delight. And Lewin, though he hadno doubt that divine inspiration could account for such visionsas that of the prophet Ezekiel—'a great cloud, and a fire unfoldingitself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereofas the colour of amber'—felt that visionary experiences wereordinarily 'transitory states caused by substances produced inthe organism'. This was a view that was becoming increasinglypopular among scientists: that the visions of the alcoholic, theschizophrenic and the mystic reflected biochemical changes inthe body. The chemical processes interested them. The visions,they felt, were of no significance. Chapter 10 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Psychedelic Library
