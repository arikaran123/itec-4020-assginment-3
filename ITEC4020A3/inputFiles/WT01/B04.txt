Five other generic drugs currently are in development. The Company believes that early commercialization of its generic drugs will assist it in developing its reputation and presence in the market while it continues to develop its supergeneric and proprietary products. Generic drugs currently being marketed by SuperGen are as follows: Pentostatin Pentostatin is indicated for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, for which it has been granted Orphan Drug status in the U.S. Orphan Drug status also has been granted for its use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The total U.S. market for these two diseases is estimated at $65 million for 1996. While the patent for the drug has expired, SuperGen's exclusive rights are protected by Orphan Drug status until October, 1998. Methotrexate Methotrexate, manufactured for SuperGen under a license from Barr Laboratories, is used in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, breast cancer, head and neck cancer. Estimated U.S. sales of Methotrexate were approximately $70 million in 1995 and $78.5 million in 1994. Megestrol Acetate Megestrol acetate, manufactured for SuperGen under a license from Barr Laboratories, is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast and endometrium, with an estimated U.S. market of $39 million in 1995 and $35 million in 1994. Leucovorin Calcium Leucovorin calcium, manufactured for SuperGen under a license from Barr Laboratories in two different tablet dosage forms, is used as a rescue treatment for high dose methotrexate therapy. The estimated U.S. market for this drug was approximately $9 million in 1995 and also in 1994. The Company's generic drugs currently under development are as follows: Mitomycin Mitomycin, with estimated sales in the U.S. of approximately $36.4 million in 1995 and $41.5 million in 1994, is indicated for gastric and pancreatic carcinoma. The patent for mitomycin expired in 1987, and as of December 31, 1995 only one generic version of mitomycin had been approved for commercial sale in addition to the original version produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Cisplatin Cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors, metastatic ovarian tumors, and advanced bladder cancer. Sales of Cisplatin in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $41.4 million in 1995 and $42.4 million in 1994. A patent for cisplatin is expiring in December, 1996. Therefore, no generic versions of Cisplatin have been approved for commercial sale to date.. Etoposide In combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, etoposide is indicated for the management of refractory testicular tumors and small cell lung cancer. Sales of Etoposide in the U.S. were estimated to be $104.9 million in 1995 and $140.9 million in 1994. The patent for Etoposide expired in November 1993. There are currently three generic versions of Etoposide that have been approved for commercial sale, in addition to the original version produced by Bristol Myers-Squibb. Vincristine Vincristine is used to treat Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas, acute leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilm's tumor. Sales of Vincristine in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $5.8 million in 1995 and $7.9 million in 1994. The patent for Vincristine expired in 1982 and there are other generic versions of Vincristine that have been approved for commercial sale, in addition to the original version produced by Eli Lilly and Company. Vinblastine Vinblastine is indicated for the palliative treatment of generalized Hodgkin's disease (Stages III and IV) and Kaposi's sarcoma. Estimated U.S. sales currently are approximately $2 million. Bleomycin Bleomycin is indicated for palliative treatment in the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, Hodgkin's disease, reticulum cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, and testicular carcinoma. Sales of bleomycin in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $43.5 million in 1995 and $43.5 million in 1994. The patent for bleomycin expired in 1989 and one generic version has been approved for commercial sale to date.

Some anticancer generic drugs are available only in a powder form and have to be mixed and dissolved in the correct liquid prior to administration. The Company's supergeneric technology enables certain anticancer drugs to be made in ready-to-inject, stable solutions. The ready-to-inject stable solution not only increases the ease of administration and saves time by eliminating the mixing procedure, but also increases the safety for the person administering the dose by minimizing the risk of exposure to these toxic drugs. Moreover, the Company believes that certain of its ready-to-inject, stable solutions may have a significantly longer shelf-life at room-temperature than the mixed generic solutions. In addition, the Company believes that its supergeneric technology may increase the safety of certain existing anticancer drugs by minimizing the problem of ulceration associated with extravasation. Extravasation is accidental leakage of the drug into a patient's muscle or skin from a blood vessel. Many existing anticancer pharmaceuticals, including those under development by the Company, can cause serious ulceration if extravasated. The resulting damage can be extensive and can require plastic surgery to repair. As a result, the Company believes that its supergeneric products may have a significant competitive advantage over their generic counterparts currently on the market. The Company has filed an application for worldwide patent protection for certain of its anticancer supergeneric products. The U.S. patent for these applications has been allowed. The Company's supergeneric drugs currently under development are as follows: MitoExtratm Mitomycin is currently available commercially in powder form only. The Company has completed its formulation and preclinical testing for its Mitomycin Extratm for injection and has filed an IND with the FDA and begun Phase I/II trials PacoExtratm Paclitaxel is indicated as second-line therapy to treat ovarian cancer. It is the fastest growing anticancer agent, with sales in the U.S. of approximately $386.5 million in 1995 and $262.2 million in 1994. The current paclitaxel formulation has numerous problems because the high level of Cremophor®EL solvent used for the injection concentrate causes hypersensitivity reactions, leaching of plasticizer from PVC infusion bags, haziness of diluted solutions and the need for in-line filters. The Company believes that its potential product may eliminate or minimize these problems. DoxoExtratm Doxorubicin is indicated to treat major cancers including acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, breast and ovarian carcinoma, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, neuroblastoma osteosarcoma, Wilms' tumor and others. Doxorubicin is currently sold as a powder by four companies, and in solution form by two of these companies. Sales of Doxorubicin in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $55.3 million in 1995 and $60.9 million in 1994, of which sales of the solution form represented 75.8% and 76.7%, respectively. DaunoExtratm Daunorubicin is indicated to treat acute nonlymphocytic and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Sales of daunorubicin in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $10.9 million in 1995 and $10.3 million in 1994. Daunorubicin is currently sold in powder form only. The Company believes that daunorubicin represents a niche market with limited competition from large pharmaceutical companies due to its relatively small market size. However, the Company believes the use of daunorubicin may increase substantially in the future, as recent experimental studies suggest that daunorubicin may be used in an increasing number of combination drug protocols treating a number of cancers. Cisplatin Extratm Cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors, metastatic ovarian tumors and advanced bladder cancer. Sales of cisplatin in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $41.4 million in 1995 and $42.4 million in 1994. The Company currently intends to develop other supergeneric products, such as VP-16 Extra, to complement its anticancer product portfolio. The Company continues to research other applications to use its supergeneric technology to enhance existing anticancer drugs.

Anemia is the destruction of white and/or red blood cells, which weakens the immune system, leaving patients susceptible to infection that could result in serious illness or death. Anemia frequently results as a side effect of existing anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation, and from renal failure. The Company believes that its products under development may have improved therapeutic benefits relative to existing drugs available commercially, and may be used in conjunction with existing drugs or, in certain cases, may replace existing drugs. The Company's products under development in this area consist of the following: RF 1012 Chemoprotective and Radioprotective Agent. Chemotherapy and radiation, used in the treatment of cancer, deplete the patient's white blood cell supply, thereby weakening the patient's immune system. This side effect, which can be life-threatening itself, requires the extension of the period between chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which may reduce their effectiveness in combating the cancer. As a result, therapeutic agents that effectively and speedily treat the side effect of anemia may significantly enhance the effectiveness of anticancer treatments. Sales in the U.S. of such drugs, estimated to be approximately $617.0 million in 1994, as reported by Medical Advertising News, is dominated by Amgen's product GCSF/Neupogen. Patients using this product typically require 14 to 21 days to recover in the hospital, and until they have recovered they are generally not able to have another treatment of chemotherapy or radiation. The Company's preclinical tests indicate that its proprietary chemoprotective and radioprotective agent may reduce the patient recovery period, and may also reduce the side effects associated with existing drugs. As a result, the Company believes that its product may have significant market potential and that its use may enhance or replace existing drugs. The Company has received an IND and has commenced Phase I/II clinical trials on this potential product. RF 1017 Aplastic Anemia Agent. Aplastic anemia is a disease that depletes white and red blood cells, platelets and neutrophils. The disease affects an estimated patient population of 2,000 people per year. No current therapeutic agent in the market effectively treats all symptoms of aplastic anemia. The Company believes that its proprietary aplastic anemia agent has the potential to be to be the first therapeutic agent to treat all symptoms of aplastic anemia. The Company believes that the potential market size opportunity for such a product is $20 million. The Company received an Orphan Drug Grant for its potential aplastic anemia product from the FDA in June 1995 and an Orphan Drug Designation for this product in November 1995. The Company has received an IND and commenced Phase I/II clinical trials. RF 1010 Renal Agent. Anemia associated with kidney disease is the depletion of red blood cells. The market for U.S. sales of therapeutic agents treating anemia associated with renal failure, estimated to be approximately $721.0 million in 1994, as reported by Medical Advertising News, is dominated by Amgen's EPO/Epogen. Current therapeutic agents do not result in complete patient recovery of the red blood cell supply and further have the negative side effect of depleting white blood cells, rendering the patient more susceptible to infection. The Company's preclinical tests indicate that its proprietary renal agent may enable complete patient recovery of the red blood cell supply without the negative side effect of depleting white blood cells. As a result, the Company believes that its renal agent may offer significant benefits over existing therapies. The Company has received an IND and commenced Phase I/II clinical trials.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 28% or 36 million of U.S. adults (20-74 years of age) are defined as obese and that effective prevention of obesity could save $50 billion annually in health care costs. Obesity drugs currently on the market are dependent on targeting the brain for their mode of action which is to suppress the appetite or accelerate the metabolism by amphetamine-like activity. While many of these drugs have demonstrated an ability to assist short-term weight loss, the long-term effects of their use have been less satisfactory as users tend to regain the weight initially lost ("bounce back effect"). RF 1051 The Company is developing a proprietary oral product for the treatment of obesity. Based on preliminary results from animal studies, the Company believes that the product's activity is not based on appetite suppression or on stimulating increased metabolic activity but on modification of the energy balance equation. This means that for the same amount of food intake, the body may store less fat in the presence of the product. Additionally, the product may also increase the amount of fat used to produce a given amount of energy. In animal studies conducted at Jackson Laboratories, genetically obese and diabetic mice were given the Company's proprietary product and were compared against a control group which was not given the product. Both groups ate the same amount of food. Test results showed that the mice that were given the product appeared normal (no longer obese) while the control group remained obese. Under a Physician's IND, in a randomized, double-blind crossover study with 17 obese human subjects over a 20-week period, subjects lost significantly more weight when given the Company's obesity drug than during placebo administration, and preliminary results indicated that the subjects maintained such weight loss over an extended period (10 weeks). The Company in 1994 completed under its own company-sponsored IND a Phase I tolerance and safety study that showed no adverse effects resulting from the obesity drug. The Company is augmenting significant existing animal and human data by sponsoring several additional animal studies and Phase I/II clinical human studies, as well as Phase II human studies with a less stringent dosing schedule for general obesity. SuperGen also is investigating RF 1051 for related genetic diseases in which the major cause of morbidity and mortality is massive obesity. The drug currently is in Phase I/II human studies for Prader-Willi Syndrome, for which The Company has received Orphan Drug status.

(Nasdaq: SUPG & SUPGW) and Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc., both emerging pharmaceutical companies, announced they have agreed to a strategic collaboration aimed at the discovery and development of new anticancer drugs based on natural products. SuperGen will make an equity investment giving it a minority interest in Galenica, as well as payments based on milestones achieved by Galenica during the collaboration. SuperGen obtains exclusive worldwide rights to anticancer drugs discovered under Galenica’s program with the Peruvian University of Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) to screen plants in Peru’s rain forest, mountain and coastal regions for therapeutic biological activity. SuperGen also gains rights of first refusal to drug candidates for prostate and colon cancer being developed in other Galenica programs. SuperGen will be responsible for clinical development and commercialization efforts following mechanism of action and safety studies by Galenica for promising anticancer drug candidates. Galenica also will receive a royalty payment on all eventual product sales by SuperGen. According to published reports, approximately 25 percent of all prescription drugs in the U.S. contain a plant-derived compound, yet less than two percent of the world’s higher plant species have been studied exhaustively for therapeutic value. Galenica and UPCH use indigenous "folk medicine" knowledge and bioassays together with chemical analysis in their search for plant-derived bioactive compounds. Numerous plants used in indigenous medicine have been collected, identified and are being studied in the program. "SuperGen is the ideal complement as a partner for our anticancer efforts," said Dr. Dante Marciani, Chief Executive Officer of Galenica. "Our focus is on the vast potential of plant-based drug discovery and adjuvant development. Their focus is at the clinical level, and they have become a commercial presence in the U.S. oncology market." "We are absolutely committed to expanding our portfolio of anticancer drugs, especially in the area of prostate cancer, and building on our philosophy of making strategic investments in myriad potential sources of future products" said Dr. Joseph Rubinfeld, Chief Executive Officer of SuperGen. "We are excited about the possibilities we see in Galenica’s novel adjuvant technologies, natural product approach and expertise. Our goal is that this collaboration will add SuperGen drugs to the impressive list of blockbusters already derived from plant-based compounds." Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is an emerging pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products intended to treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and blood cell disorders, as well as other serious conditions such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its anticancer portfolio of ten generic products and five enhanced or "supergeneric" products. Blood cell disorder products under development currently target anemias associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, renal failure and aplastic anemia. The company's obesity pill currently is in Phase II human clinical trials. Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an emerging biopharmaceuticals company based in Frederick, MD. The company is developing preventive and therapeutic pharmaceuticals based on natural products. Galenica’s initial product focus is on its proprietary adjuvants for use in vaccines, for both the animal and human health markets. Galenica’s Adjuvant Program is developing novel synthetic and semi-synthetic immunotherapeutics for cancer, viral infections and other indications in conjunction with its academic collaborators. In a program with the Peruvian University of Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru, Galenica is screening natural products for anticancer, wound healing and antibacterial activity. The privately held company was founded by Dr. Dante Marciani, who previously was the first Chief Scientist at Cambridge Biotech Corporation, where he developed the following products: QS-21 (Stimulon), considered to be the "gold standard" adjuvant, now in Phase III clinical trials; the world’s only commercial serological recombinant HIV test; and the only commercial recombinant subunit vaccine against a retrovirus.

(Nasdaq: SUPG & SUPGW), a development stage pharmaceutical company, today announced it has received a U.S. patent allowance for its proprietary ExtraTM technology for use in the reformulation of anticancer drugs. SuperGen currently is applying this technology to five existing anticancer drugs: mitomycin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel and cisplatin. The company's first drug in this area, MitoExtraTM, currently is in Phase II human clinical trials. SuperGen believes its ExtraTM technology may significantly enhance the safety profile and handling characteristics of certain existing anticancer drugs by providing stable, ready-to-inject solutions that diminish the handling risks for health care providers that are associated with mixing current powder formulations prior to injection, and by diminishing the ulceration risks to patients by "shielding" the drug at the injection site. "Supergenerics are the second tier of our three-tiered product strategy and this patent allowance solidifies our dominant ownership of the product area," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., SuperGen's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "With our strong proprietary position we intend to expand the use of this technology beyond our initial five product targets."

(Nasdaq: SUPG & SUPGW), a development stage pharmaceutical company, today announced it has acquired exclusive rights to the anticancer drug pentostatin in the United States, Canada and Mexico from Warner-Lambert Company. SuperGen acquired pentostatin, sold under the trade name NIPENT, for an undisclosed cash payment and shares of SuperGen common stock. While precise terms were not disclosed, SuperGen said the equity payment is significantly below one percent of the company’s outstanding shares. Pentostatin currently has regulatory clearance in the U.S. and elsewhere for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, for which the drug has been granted Orphan Drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Orphan Drug status also has been granted for its use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The total U.S. market for drugs used in the treatment of these two diseases is estimated at $65 million of 1996. Pentostatin also currently is in Phase II human clinical studies for rheumatoid arthritis, the most prevalent autoimmune disease. "This is an extremely positive development for SuperGen on a number of levels," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., SuperGen’s Chairman and Executive Officer. "Pentostatin becomes the fourth drug we can immediately market through our oncology sales force. Senior members of our clinical development team previously had been intimately involved with the development of the drug, and see enormous promise in its full potential. Finally, this acquisition fits SuperGen’s model of taking time out of the equation in bringing products to market."

(Vancouver Stock Exchange: IZP) and SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG & SUPGW) jointly announced today that the two companies have signed a letter of intent that grants SuperGen exclusive worldwide rights to anti-cancer and all other applications, except inflammation, of certain Inflazyme technologies and drugs. Inflazyme stated that preclinical studies of its drugs have shown effectiveness against lung, colon and skin cancers, as well as lymphomas and leukemias. Additionally, certain of the drugs target multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancers that no longer respond to available therapies. Based on results to date, the companies said U.S. human clinical trials could begin as early as 1997. While the terms of the agreement have been defined, they were not specifically disclosed. The companies said the license granted to SuperGen is based on a combination of equity investment in Inflazyme's common stock, milestone payments and royalties to Inflazyme on net product sales. The final licensing agreement between the companies remains subject to mutual review, which is expected be completed within 60 days. "We are convinced that SuperGen is an excellent partner for Inflazyme's oncology opportunities since that is one of SuperGen's primary areas of focus," said Hassan Salari, Ph.D., President and CEO of Inflazyme. "Our primary focus remains inflammation, and we retain those rights. We are confident that due diligence for the final agreement can proceed quickly." "Inflazyme's compounds can be a strong addition to our growing pipeline of anti-cancer drugs, expanding our existing tier of proprietary, value-added products," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., President and CEO of SuperGen. "The value Inflazyme has already built into these drugs is consistent with our strategy of entering the game at the 50-yard line and allows us to leverage our core strengths in clinical development."

The company's obesity pill currently is in Phase II human clinical trials. Inflazyme Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the design, discovery and commercialization of novel generations of drugs which combat such major diseases as asthma, allergies, arthritis and numerous other illnesses categorized as inflammatory diseases. The company's proprietary small-molecule pharmaceuticals are the products of its own Transcription Factor-based drug development programs involving the utilization, synergistically, of a variety of combinatorial chemistry, molecular modeling, and structural synthesizing and screening techniques. Inflazyme's existing world-patented 50-compound family of drugs, capable of functioning as both therapeutics and preventatives, have exhibited efficacies, potencies and durations-of-action which are significantly greater than steroids, yet cause none of the pervasive side effects which steroids typically produce. Because of their universal applicability and ready adaptability to delivery via inhaler or in pill, powder or syrup form, the company's proprietary compounds are projected to replace steroids as first-line therapies for the management of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Inflazyme's current lead drugs are Apanol for asthma, Tiesole for allergies, and Bispan for arthritis. In its search for anti-inflammatory drugs, the company has also discovered a novel generation of small molecules that may provide treatment for various cancer types, which are the subject of the license agreement with SuperGen.

(Nasdaq: SUPG & SUPGW), a development stage pharmaceutical company, announced it has received orphan drug status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its antiobesity pill, RF 1051, in the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The drug currently is in Phase I/II human trials for PWS, a rare chronic genetic disease characterized by extreme obesity, short stature and mental retardation affecting an estimated 15,000 persons in the U.S. RF1051 also currently is in Phase II human trials for general obesity. Previously, the company also received orphan drug status, as well as an orphan drug grant for development expenses, from the FDA for its drug RF1017 for the treatment of aplastic anemia. Orphan drug status grants the company seven years of market exclusivity, independent of patent protection, upon clearance of the drug for the U.S. market. Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products intended to treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and blood cell disorders, as well as other serious conditions such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its anticancer portfolio of six generic products and five enhanced or "supergeneric" products. The company currently anticipates marketing clearance of its first generic drug, mitomycin C, in late 1996. In April, 1996 the company announced the initiation of Phase I human trials with MitoExtra, its first supergeneric reformulation of an anticancer drug. SuperGen's blood cell disorder products under development, all in Phase I/II human trials, target anemias associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, renal failure and aplastic anemia. The company's obesity pill currently is in Phase II human clinical trials. This press release contains forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties associated with a development stage pharmaceutical company. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors discussed in the company's reports on file with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (including but not limited to the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1996).

Reports First Quarter Results EMERYVILLE, CA (May 13, 1996) -- SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG & SUPGW), a development stage pharmaceutical company, today reported financial results from the quarter ended March 31, 1996. Total operating expenses for the quarter decreased to $1,216,464 in 1996 from $1,244,092 for the same period in 1995. Revenues were $10,047, compared to $73,499 in the same quarter last year. The net loss for the quarter was $1,158,960 ($0.09 per share), compared to $1,138,035 ($0.09 per share) in last year's period. As of March 31, 1996, SuperGen had approximately $19,588,000 in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, SuperGen completed an initial public offering of 3,500,000 units (each consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant), which netted the company approximately $18,600,000. In April, 1996, the underwriter's exercise of its overallotment option resulted in additional net proceeds of approximately $2,900,000 (which is not reflected in the currently reported cash balance). "The successful IPO was a significant financing milestone that allows us to proceed confidently in meeting our clinical and product development milestones," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., SuperGen's Chief Executive Officer. "We already have met two of those milestones in the beginning of the second quarter, with Phase II clearance for our obesity pill and Phase I clearance for our supergeneric MitoExtra."

BEGINS HUMAN TRIALS OF NEW ANTICANCER DRUG EMERYVILLE, CA (April 18, 1996) -- SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG) announced the initiation of human safety and bioequivalency trials of MitoExtraTM, under a company-sponsored Investigational New Drug application cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The trials will be conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Center in Houston, Texas. MitoExtraTM is a proprietary reformulation of the approved anticancer drug Mitomycin C, which is used primarily to treat gastric and pancreatic cancers. SuperGen's reformulation is based on technology designed to improve the handling characteristics and safety profile of Mitomycin and other anticancer drugs by enhancing the drugs' stability in solution form and "shielding" it at the injection site. Mitomycin and many other cytotoxic agents can cause ulceration and local tissue damage. The current studies will focus on a comparison of MitoExtra's biological availability, activity and distribution with that of the currently available formulation. "This is an important milestone in an expanding portfolio of 'supergeneric' products being developed at SuperGen," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., the company's Chief Executive Officer. "We will continue to add to the data needed to demonstrate the value we see in our ExtraTM technology for oncologists and patients." SuperGen previously has filed an application with the FDA to market a generic version of Mitomycin C in finished form. Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products intended to treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and blood cell disorders, as well as other serious conditions such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its anticancer portfolio of five generic products and four enhanced or "supergeneric" products.

GAINS IND FOR NEW PHASE II STUDY OF OBESITY PILL -- New Human Studies Will Focus On Intermittent Dosing -- EMERYVILLE, CA (April 16, 1996) -- SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG), a development stage pharmaceutical company, announced today that its Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a new Phase II human clinical study of its proprietary antiobesity drug has been cleared. The drug, "RF 1051", is administered in pill form. RF 1051 currently is in ongoing Phase I/II human clinical studies, under a separate IND, based on a daily dosage schedule. The new IND was filed for concurrent trials with an intermittent schedule of dosing every two days. The new study will involve approximately 80 patients at two sites, Evanston Hospital in Illinois and the Orlando Clinical Center in Florida. RF 1051 is an orally administered formulation of a human steroidal hormone which also has been successfully tested in the ob/ob (obese) mouse and the db/db (diabetic) mouse models. SuperGen believes that RF 1051 plays a role in the intake and output of energy, rather than relying on appetite suppression or the stimulation of increased metabolic activity. Under a Physician's IND, in a randomized, double-blind crossover study with 17 obese human subjects over a 20-week period, patients lost significantly more weight during RF 1051 administration than during placebo administration. Their weight loss was maintained for an additional 10-week follow-up period. "While we believe an oral rather than injectable drug will be critical to the success of long-term antiobesity treatment, we also believe the least stringent dosing schedule will have the most advantage," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer of SuperGen. "Results from previous human studies suggest that RF 1051 has a serum half-life that may support administration on less than a daily basis, and our ultimate goal is a twice-weekly dosage regimen," Dr. Rubinfeld continued. "No clinical side effects from RF 1051 have yet been observed. This trial was designed to obtain preliminary efficacy results from intermittent dosage, concurrent with ongoing daily dosage trials, and to help us plan later-stage clinical trials with the optimal dosing schedule." Dr. Rubinfeld cautioned that, while recently lauded injectable approaches to obesity have garnered enormous public attention even prior to any human data, SuperGen's obesity pill still is in early human studies. He said that results to date are scientifically and clinically encouraging to the company, but that long-term patient benefit cannot be established without further trials. He added that initial results in humans, ob/ob mice and db/db mice have established RF 1051 as a top priority for SuperGen. Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products intended to treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and blood cell disorders, as well as other serious conditions such as obesity.

Koepsell, 1996) The Internet promises to open up a wide new market for informationvendors. It is estimated that online services and the Internet will comprise anearly 14 billion dollar industry within a year or two. The growth of publicconsumption of online services and the Internet has been geometric.Entreprenuers and established content providers, software companies and boldnew start-ups are clamboring for domain names and Internet connections. Theonce-wide-open frontier is being settled and these pioneers are looking tobuild their fortunes on the information industry that is replacing ourindustrial past. But this frontier has been lawless for some time. Some groups have revelledin the Internet's lawlessness in the understandable belief that governmentalinterference should be avoided at all costs. "That government is best whichgoverns least, or not at all." However, frontiers are not as hospitable toindustry as they are to civil liberties. The result in cyberspace is vastareas of uncharted legal wilderness of which those who seek their fortunes onthe net are probably ill informed. The law of intellectual property is, as it stands, ill-equiped to protectcontent and information providers seeking to peddle their wares on the net.There is a dangerous ambiguity in the statutory and common law of copyright asit applies to the net. This ambiguity threatens the integrity of providers'property claims to information distributed on networks. BACKGROUND Advances in technology have had a phenomenal impact upon copyright law sinceits inception. In order to safeguard the exclusive rights to reproduction,distribution and first-sale of works granted to authors under copyright law,sweeping changes in statutory implementation and interpretation of copyrighthave ocurred as reproduction and distribution of works has become easier. Forexample, the photocopying machine and recordable audio cassettes posedpotential challenges to the security of intellectual property rights, but theseadvances were only a minor threat to written works and a somewhat more seriousbut still negligible threat to audio works given the inherent limitations ofthe technologies. The relatively low fidelity of photocopies and analog audioand video tapes present little threat to a copyright owner that her works willbe unlawfully reproduced beyond one generation (typically a user's own archivalor delayed viewing purposes for audio and video). However, with the advent ofdigital reproduction, new measures such as the Audio Home Recording Act of1992[1] were deemed necessary. A new threat to copyright owners' control over their works looms in the sameadvance which promises a great new market for such works. The Internet ("net")and the proposed National Information Infrastructure ("NII") pose both such athreat and promise. The Internet exists now. It is the name given theinterconnected computer networks which grew around the U.S. Army's Arpanetdeveloped in the late sixties and seventies.[2] Over the Internet countless pieces of e-mail and software travel betweencomputers in nearly every conceivable corner of the earth. The NII which isnow "under construction" is the name given the foreseen nexus of currenttechnologies such as cable television and telephones and the Internet.[3] The NII is being constructed now by privateentities and will be run by cable, telephone and perhaps entirely newindustries. The NII or "information superhighway" will carry all sorts ofcontent ranging from entertainment to raw data. A broadband network combinedwith television set-top boxes or tied into personal computers will allow usersto view movies, download books, browse countless information databanks, conductfinancial transactions, videoconference and enjoy numerous other as yetunforeseen services.[4] Clearly, such a futureholds many possible conflicts in the area of copyright law. Some of thesources of these conflicts are already becoming apparent through disputesregarding the Internet. What follows is a discussion of some of those disputeswhich center around the issues of reproduction, distribution, the first saledoctrine and transmission of copyrighted materials over the net. TRADITIONALLY COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS AND THE NET The net poses a number of challenges to traditional legal notions and termsconcerning copyrighted materials. Such materials include written works such asbooks and magazines, audio recordings, motion pictures, and photographs. Aproducer of any of these works may, under copyright law, reserve for herselfcertain exclusive rights.[5]subject to sections107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusiverights to do and authorize any of the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work ... (2) to prepare derivative works ... (3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work ... The rights of a holder of a copyright may be infringed by, interalia, unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the copyrightedworks. For books, photos and motion pictures, infringement is not acomplicated matter to assess. Photocopies of books are easy to spot and oflower quality than originals and it is too expensive and risky for a smallprinting company to pirate an entire book profitably. Analog audio tapes alsodegrade in quality from generation to generation and illegal copies are lessdesirable to consumers than originals. Moreover the unauthorized reproductionof books, motion pictures and audio tapes is an act which is easy to locate intime and space. That is, a book is reproduced when it is photocopied ortypeset. An audio tape is reproduced when it is dubbed. Each of these isdistributed when an unauthorized reproduction is sold. The moment of saleimplicates the distribution and the moment of copying, the reproduction. Theseconcepts of reproduction and distribution are not so easily applied totransactions over the Internet. Take, for instance, "browsing" on the World Wide Web ("Web"). When one usesthe Mosaic or Netscape software to browse on the Web one may view text andgraphics on one's own computer the originals of which reside on anothercomputer which may be physically located far away but connected to the net.The originals are [6]reconstructed in the localcomputer's memory as it was on the server site. This information may furtherbe transferred through phone lines to a user's computer through a modem. Theinformation, in such a configuration exists simultaneously and identically atthe server (original site), host (the computer the user has called with hismodem), and the terminal (the user's own computer). An author couldconceivably have a Web "site" containing an electronically typeset version ofher novel which could be browsed page-by-page on the Web. Such a site mightlook to the browser who is connecting to the site just like a page of actuallytypeset text yet be entirely virtual.[7] Whenwould such a novel be reproduced or distributed? This question is even morecomplicated if our hypothetical cyber-author decides to make the entire textdownloadable. The browsing of the Web site involves reproducing the binarycode of the original document on the browser's computer. It may actuallyinvolve more than one reproduction if the user is tied into a host computer aswell as a terminal. If such browsing is deemed to be reproduction then the lawmust clarify this so that such reproductions may be liscenced as need be. DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS: THE FIRST SALE DOCTRINE What is more problematic is the question of distribution. Ordinarily,distribution in copyright law involves the changing of hands of physical copiesof a work. The owner of a copyright has an exclusive right in the firstdistribution of a work pursuant to the so-called "first sale doctrine".[8] Once an authorized copy of a work isdistributed, however, the copyright holder has no control over subsequentre-distribution of a work. This doctrine protects the right of purchasers ofcopyrighted works to freely alienate such legally obtained copies. If ourhypothetical Web-novel browser is actually reading a licensed reproduction of adistributed work may he then freely alienate that reproduction pursuant to thefirst-sale doctrine? This is an issue which remains as-yet unresolved in thecourts, but it is one which will soon need addressing as the NII takes shape. In fact a Federal District court in the Eleventh Circuit recently ruled thatan owner of an electronic bulletin board system ("BBS") was liable for unlawfuldisplay and distribution of copyrighted materials when he made digitizedcopyrighted photographs which he unlawfully reproduced available fordownloading from his computer over the phone lines.[9] This decision made no mention of unauthorizedreproduction. Rather, the only mention made of copying in Frena isdefendant's digitization of the photographs which was easily inferred throughcircumstantial evidence.[10] The Frenacourt proceeded to inquire into defendant's violation of plaintiff's exclusivepublic distribution and display rights. The court glossed over thedistribution issue finding only that "[t]here is no dispute that DefendantFrena supplied a product containing unauthorized copies of a copyrightedwork."[11] This was enough to convince the courtthat plaintiff's distribution rights had been infringed. The Frena court, inreaching this conclusion, may have opened a can of worms given the currentstate of copyright law. Returning to our hypothetical Web-novel scenario, the Frena decisionwould make our browser the recipient of a lawful distribution of the electronicnovel. As such a lawful recipient, she would be able to re-distribute thelawfully obtained copy pursuant to the first-sale doctrine.[12] This result should make prospective producersof copyrighted materials reluctant to take advantage of the net as a new andpotentially profitable marketplace because, under the Frena decision,any information provided on the net may be deemed a distribution which, ifauthorized by the copyright holder, would comprise a "first-sale" of thecopyrighted work. Following such a distribution, it must be remembered, thepurchaser may freely alienate the lawfully obtained copy. The problem withthis scenario is, given the ease with which information may be transferred onthe net, a content-provider's control over its product should extend as far aspossible. An information transaction on the net rarely involves the destruction of theoriginal copy. When content is transferred from one site to another, asdescribed in the hypothetical used above, the orginal copy is generallymaintained by the producer. Transferring information like this is more likereproduction than distribution. By treating these transactions asreproductions, a copyright holder's rights over these transactions may be morecarefully safeguarded. The plaintiffs in Frena probably pursued their distribution claim inlieu of a reproduction claim because defendant's only act of reproduction wasthe copying of the photographs into digitized form onto the hard drives of hissystem. The subsequent reproductions over the phone lines into other people'scomputers occurred not by the acts of the defendant, but by those of thenumerous people who chose to download the pictures. By making the distributionclaim, plaintiffs could allege that every transfer over the phone lines to thepublic was an infringing act by one specific defendant rather than allegingviolations by perhaps hundred of infringers. But the distribution analysisputs the burden on information providers instead of where it belongs, theconsuming public. It is like making a library liable for the unauthorizedreproductions of a borrower. This situation will stifle the content providingmarket on the Internet. By treating such transactions as reproductions, the use of the NII andInternet may be encouraged without the first-sale alienation problemsassociated with treating such transactions as distributions. If Web browsersare treated as recipients of lawful distributions then, without the furthertreatment of such transactions as reproductions, the recipients couldpresumably establish their own Web sites which may include their lawfullydistributed copies of copyrighted information. Others could then browse thefirst-sale recipient's Web site and receive further lawful copies pursuant tothe first-sale doctrine without compensating the producer of the work. Such ascenario would involve the proliferation of countless lawful copies withoutbenefitting the original producer. This would clearly be a disincentive forproducers of copyrighted materials to take advantage of the Internet or the NIIas a medium for their works. Information transactions such as thoseoutlined in the hypothetical and described in Frena should be treated asreproductions. The only practical problem with treating these transactions asreproductions is the fact that the recipients will most reasonably beinterpreted as the reproducers. In Frena, this would mean plaintiffsshould have sued the recipients as well as the supplier of the infringinginformation. For most net transactions tracking down the recipients ofunlawfully reproduced information will be a herculean task compared with suingthe distributors. But, as the law stands, the distribution of lawfullyobtained copies is legal pursuant to the first-sale doctrine while reproductionof such copies is not.[13] To guard against this loop-hole which could result in the lawful proliferationof copies without compensation to the producers as noted above, the WorkingGroup on Intellectual Property Rights, a sub-group of the InformationInfrastructure Task Force established by President Clinton, has proposed thatSection 109 of the Copyright Act, which embodies the first-sale doctrine, beamended as follows: (a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of aparticular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any personauthorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyrightowner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy orphonorecord. (2) This subsection does not apply to the sale or other disposal of thepossession of that copy or phonorecord by transmission.[14] This amendment is proposed pursuant to the Task Force's recognition thattransactions on the net frequently involve both the reproduction anddistribution of the reproduction simultaneously.[15] It would adequately resolve the difficultieswhich might arise under the current copyright law as applied to the Internetand, eventually, the NII. CONCLUSION It is clear that, if content providers are to be encouraged to use theInternet and the forthcoming NII to develop the emerging information economy,the law as it stands is inadequate to protect their interests. Softwareauthors and creators of other digital content must be wary of the loop-holedescribed above. They should lobby for the adoption of the Task Force'sproposed amendment. But this amendment is a compromise of sorts. It does notrecognize the simple fact that apparent distributions over the net are actuallyreproductions. Recognition of this fact alone would solve the dillema posed bythe law as it stands and pave the way for content providers to safely staketheir claims on this narrowing frontier.

Altreuter Although little noticed by the trade community, an important trade policy debate has been raging between the Clinton Administration and the computer industry. Because Government regulators are able to cite "law and order" and "national security" in support of a policy which treats software which incorporates meaningful privacy protection as the equivalent of a Claymore Mine, US software developers -- and the US computer industry as a whole -- are being denied an opportunity to compete in what may be the most meaningful segment of the coming Internet economy. Before meaningful commerce can occur in cyberspace, there must first be a method of insuring that transactions over the Internet are secure. Encryption offers the only feasible method for protecting the privacy of such transactions. US law, however, bars the exportation of "strong" encryption software, and in fact treats the exportation of such software in the same manner as munitions. The reasoning behind this policy is, in essence, that strong encrypted communications would not be accessible to legitimate governmental surveillance, and might therefore be used to plan terrorist activities, or commit criminal acts such as money laundering. As a compromise, several proposals have been floated, most recently a plan to allow software makers to export encryption programs with up to 56-bit code keys in exchange for an industry commitment to develop a system which would provide law enforcement officials with the encryption key in appropriate circumstances. A previous proposed policy, "key escrow", would have placed the encryption key under the control of either a governmental agency, or some designated private agent, which would turn the key over to law enforcement authorities on demand. The flaws with either policy should be immediately obvious and go beyond the fact that the Administration's proposal for exportation of 56-bit encryption is technologically outmoded (Netscape Communications, for example, distributed a 128-bit system to US users of the Internet in July but cannot market it overseas). As is so often the case, this wrong-headed policy is best understood by considering what US reaction would be to such a policy were it to be implemented by another nation. Obviously, the US would never stand for an international standard for encryption which placed the key to the code in anyone else's hands, and plainly the US's trading partners feel the same way. As a purely practical matter, there is little difference between the current proposal and its predecessor. The dilemma here is that this is simply not an area where US law will succeed in jamming US policy down the throats of the rest of the world. Because the Internet knows no international borders, powerful encryption programs are already widely available. By artificially hobbling the ability of US software developers to compete in this area, US policy is effectively cutting off its own manufactures' ability to be competitive in a growth segment of the global economy. Ironically, this is occurring because the most trade-friendly Administration the US has seen in years has adopted, on this issue, a police-state mentality that would earn outspoken condemnation from the same Administration were it to be enacted by any other government. Encryption policy is unlikely to be the sort of issue which will ever excite heated debate in the halls of Congress, since the specter of bomb-carrying terrorists using the Internet to undermine national security is easier to explain than is the importance of confidentiality in business communications. As a purely practical matter, however, the effect of this policy is to badly undermine the use of the Internet as a tool for international trade. For example, current encryption standards seriously compromise the ability of lawyers and clients to communicate privately via E-mail, even though the lawyer-client principle is a bedrock concept in American jurisprudence. More importantly, the Administration's policy on encryption hamstrings the ability of US software developers to compete internationally by imposing an artificial constraint on a technological problem. Assuredly, the vacuum that is created by this short-sighted thinking will be filled. It is almost as certain that this vacuum will be filled to the detriment of a segment of the economy where the US has long held dominance. The Clinton Administration has demonstrated that it is both technologically savvy, and in favor of open trade. This is clearly not an issue where Congress is likely to be helpful, since it is plainly complex, and susceptible to the sort of negative spin which legislators abhor. We are not likely to attend any pancake breakfasts where our congressional representatives will boast of making the Internet secure, but it is a safe bet that a vote against strong encryption will be presented as a vote which gives terrorists and criminals a new tool to defeat law enforcement efforts. Just because this is a patently absurd argument doesn't make it any less likely to be used as a fear-mongering electoral gambit. Altreuter & Habermehl invites all interested readers of International Focus to E-mail a copy of this essay, along with your own thoughts to Vice President Gore at agore@whitehouse.gov in the hope that a demonstration of our concerns will compel a re-thinking of a policy which is antithetical to the principles of free trade, economic development, and privacy which are essential to the development of electronic commerce.

R. Weisbin, Program Manager Charles.R.Weisbin@jpl.nasa.gov INTRODUCTION The JPL Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), responds to opportunities presented by NASA space missions and systems, and seeds commercial applications of the emerging robotics technology. The primary goals of the JPL program, listed below, are derived from the overall NASA Telerobotics Program goals. Develop, integrate, and demonstrate the science and technology of remote telerobotics leading to increases in operational capability, safety, cost effectiveness, and probability of success of NASA missions Develop and demonstrate the required technology so that a significant number of operations in Earth orbit and on planetary surfaces may be conducted telerobotically. The scope of the JPL Rover and Telerobotics Technology program ranges from basic research, through synthesis of complete systems, and to evaluation in realistic ground and flight experiments. Emerging technologies have important dual uses in support of NASA thrusts in space and in such commercial areas as medical robotics. The Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program comprises four major segments of activity: robotic systems for planetary exploration, robotic systems for on-orbit servicing tasks, robotic systems for terrestrial and commercial applications, and technology for non-NASA sponsors, Significant technical achievements have been reached in each of these areas, including complete telerobotic system prototypes that have been built and tested in realistic scenarios relevant to prospective users. In addition, the program has conducted complementary basic research and created innovative technology and terrestrial applications, as well as enabled a variety of commercial spin-offs. The Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program is an element of NASA's ongoing research program under the Office of Space Access and Technology. Universities and industrial partners are major participants in the JPL program. An operating division of the California Institute of Technology, JPL performs research, development, and related activities for NASA and plays a key role as NASA's lead center for the robotic exploration of space. This summary provides selected highlights of the technical achievements of the JPL program. Planetary Robotics:This segment of the Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program develops robots to satisfy the planned requirements for exploring planetary surfaces: Exploring potential landing sites and areas of scientific interest, placing science instruments, and gathering samples for analysis and possible return to Earth. the robots for such operations will require high levels of local autonomy, including the ability to perform local navigation, identify areas of potential scientific interest, regulate onboard resources, and schedule activities --all with limited ground command intervention. These robots must be low-cost and miniaturized to satisfy stringent mass and volume constraints. Specific applications include the Mars Pathfinder Project and the Mars surveyor Program. Technology developed for planetary rovers will also enable technological options for other efforts such as inner-planet and small-body exploration. Exploration Robotics: Archive Platform Robotics:This segment of the Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program develops technology for application to on-orbit satellite and large-platform servicing by both free-flying and platform-attached servicing robots. The target applications emphasize ground control and include such tasks as remote surface inspection of Earth-orbiting platforms using telerobotic systems, and dual-arm autonomous manipulator control for free-flying servicing (such as the Ranger Flight Experiment). On-orbit servicing: Archive Technology Commercialization:This segment of the Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program provides a means to test and demonstrate space-targeted technologies in realistic terrestrial settings and additionally includes tasks intended to rapidly move program-developed technology to commercial applications. These tasks are jointly conducted by JPL and industrial partners to create and demonstrate full-system prototypes that offer solutions to terrestrial problems; such solutions can positively impact significant areas of the national economy. Illustrative initiatives include a micromanipulator for retinal surgery and advanced manipulator control methods for high-precision robots. Terrestrial and Commercial Applications: Archive Non-NASA Tasks:This segment of the Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program --typically about 20 percent of the total program-- develops technologies in areas of national importance, in support of non-NASA sponsors. Examples are machine vision for autonomous ground vehicles, and biologically inspired vehicles. These technologies have important concurrent applications to NASA missions. Component technology: Archive Spin-offs and Commercialization: Archive CONCLUSIONS While the JPL Rover and Telerobotics Program has built a record of substantial achievement, important technical and programmatic challenges remain. The ultimate goal is to build autonomous robots that can significantly assist humans in space and that can, with little direct human intervention, explore remote planetary surfaces. Near-Term Technical and Programmatic Goals Enable next-generation affordable rover missions to Mars (for example, as part of Mars Surveyor Program) Reduce landed mass over Mars Pathfinder rover of at least a factor of two (demonstrate feasibility of a less-than-5-kilogram rover). Achieve higher science return in rover missions by enabling many short-to-medium range traverses, active and passive power management, and effective science site exploration and sampling. Such tasks would include confirming and mapping science targets, retrieving fresh rock and other samples, and accurate deployment and pointing of instruments. Enable ground controls of dexterous telerobotics operating in Earth-orbiting missions and flight experiments, such as teh space shuttle and the space station. Long-Term Challenges Develop a robot explorer with the ability to autonomously confirm goal success, combine skills to achieve complex tasks, and learn and discover new and important information. Fly a human-like robot that can autonomously retrieve, service, and repair satellites in Earth orbit, incorporating the capabilities of three-dimensional autonomous navigation, vision- and touch-guided rendezvous and docking, and satellite grappling. An important future goal is to broaden the range of applications of telerobotics in space. Emphasis on manipulators for servicing tasks and mobile robots for surface operations has resulted in significant opportunities for flight experiments and missions. Telerobotics technology can however enable a much broader range of missions, such as Venus flyer robotis, and robotic devices for asteroid sample retrieval. Synthesizing new classes of robot configurations for such missions, and evaluating the corresponding benefits also pose an important future challenge. In addition, terrestrial and commercial applications will continue to be important program thrusts.

The Microrover flight Experiment on the Mars Pathfinder mission (scheduled to arrive at Mars in 1997) is a focused rover flight demonstration program. In parallel, research and technology development are being conducted to expand the current capabilities of these microrovers, while further reducing their mass and power consumption. The rover technology efforts have two major thrusts: Science rover development and miniaturized rovers. JPL-26482 Ac Rocky 7, a next-generation microrover with low-power stereovision. The Mobile Science Laboratory task develops technologies that enable 20-kilogram-class microrovers to autonomously traverse many kilometers on the surface of Mars, perform scientist-directed experiments, and return relevant data back to Earth. Present microrover technology has several limitations precluding more ambitious science-rich missions. Current microrovers have very limited traverse capability (tens of meters), are not capable of sample acquisition and manipulation --that is, soil and rock acquisition, subsurface access, and burial of instruments-- have limited science packages on board, are designed for short-term (10-day) missions, and require careful and repetitive ground monitoring and control (limited autonomy). A complementary activity involves autonomous acquisition of multiple science targets and sites. Given specified goal locations for daily operations, new capabilities are being developed to maximize the number of science activities that the rover system can perform between cycles of communication with Earth. Primary among three new capabilities is autonomous goal identification, together with autonomous performance of the designated science sample acquisition task. Onboard machine intelligence provides capabilities for autonomous search and recognition of potentially interesting targets, as well as capabilities for sensor platform planning and utilization. Acquisition of scientific samples requires miniature sampling devices and autonomous control of them. New robotic mechanisms are being developed to enable the performance of science tasks such as Sensor pointing, emplacement, or burial. Soil and rock sample acquisition and transport. Fresh rock Exposure. Camera positioning for scientific imaging, navigation, and vehicle self-inspection. Recent experimental tests conducted in the JPL MarsYard reflect the status of the technology under development by the Mobile Science Laboratory task. One such test involved an experimental microrover named Rocky 7, which has low-power stereovision, a manipulator arm, and the ability to autonomously recognize designated targets. Rocky 7 performed a survey of a 20- x 20-meter area, in variable terrain ranging from 0.6 to 2 large obstacles per square meter. Executing 10 science sorties, the microrover performed site imaging and soil sampling with only five command uplinks. In each sortie, the microrover identified at least one scientific target or acquired at least one sample at designated sites, then returned to the vicinity of the lander. As part of the test, recovery from selected major failure modes was demonstrated. One additional goal of the Mobile Science Laboratory task is to enable and enhance rover-based scientific exploration of planetary surfaces by integrating science instruments on small rover platforms for field testing of terrestrial prototypes. The task involves collaboration with planetary scientists to identify science instruments important to future missions, and science data reduction methods. Two main areas are being explored: Science instrument usage --the identification and integration of science instruments on small rover platforms for experimentation and demonstration of capabilities. Science data analysis --computer-based characterization of data via heuristics and data analysis methods, allowing confirmation of science objectives as well as prioritization of data returned to Earth. Closely related to these two areas is research in intelligent vision and touch-guided grasping being done in collaboration with researchers (K. Salisbury is the principal investigator) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal is to develop the technology required for the autonomous onboard selection of interesting rock samples, and for autonomous execution of the subsequent rock-grasp and -retrieve operation. The capability will allow a human controller to command and operate the remote system using only relatively easy-to-use high-level commands, while relying on the remote system itself to perform the desired operation reliably. Rover-mounted spectrometer for analysis of rock and soil samples Computer-generated model of a planetary surface and rover The Mobile Science Laboratory task is also developing a ground-based operator interface and associated enabling technologies for control of planetary science missions. The interface will enable multiple mission scientists at various locations to view downlink science and terrain data and interactively and simultaneously input desired mission tasks for the next command cycle. These commands will be merged into a daily mission command sequence by the mission sequence planner module based on task priorities and terrain traversability. Point of Contact: Samad.A.Hayati@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Rover Miniaturization and Survival Technology The basic goal of this work is to shift the 5-kilogram microrover paradigm to one of higher-yield, longer-duration science --for both equatorial and polar Martian extremes. Fundamental issues include Reducing mass and volume of rover structural and actuator design. Achieving high-density power delivery over wide thermal ranges. Maintaining a stable thermal environment, which will facilitate use of more conventional, mass-and-volume-efficient commercial electronics. Creating new classes of ultra-light, environmentally resistant miniaturized robotic sampling devices, including active tooling. Controlling force-contact tasks of an ultra-light rover-manipulator platform on uneven terrain. Integrating broad-capability science instruments into these rover architectural innovations. In fiscal year 1996, the goal is to develop and demonstrate in ground operational configuration a new collapsible mobility architecture enabling approximate doubling of the wheel diameter of the Mars Pathfinder rover (named Sojourner), while allowing rover stowage in a smaller flight volume. The overall design will be consistent with a target flight rover mass of 5 kilograms. The Rover Miniaturization and Survival Technology task will evaluate the ability of the new rover to traverse up to 10 meters in simulated Mars Viking Lander-1 and -2 scenarios while using onboard navigational guidance and hazard-detection capabilities. The task will benchmark against relevant Sojourner and Rocky 7 characteristics. Under 5-kilogram rover prototype, using Mars Pathfinder heritage. The technology products resulting from the Rover Miniaturization and Survival Technology task will be valuable both to breakthrough microrover design for local operations, and the larger-scale science rovers dedicated to long-distance traverse and orbiter-based communications. If most of these objectives can be addressed, a 5-kilogram rover would become a viable vehicle for extended-duration Mars Surveyor Program science under line-of-sight (10-100 meters), and could also provide a major technology option for a sample-return mission around 2005, particularly in the context of a likely precision landing capability by that time. In fiscal year 1995, an intensive effort was established to examine the feasibility of providing a viable near-term, low-mass, low-cost 5-kilogram rover that could be available for the Mars '98 mission of the Mars Surveyor Program. This paradigm allows for sophisticated instrumentation on the lander, with the small rover obtaining samples and returning them to the lander. Led by W. F. Zimmerman and B. H. Wilcox, the effort addressed the following key issues: Mass reduction over Sojourner of at least a factor of two. Cost reduction over Sojourner of a factor of five. Providing minimal soil/rock retrieval and return-to-lander capability. Providing minimal mobility capability to deploy science instruments away from the lander, on the order of 5-30 meters maximum. Examining viable rover deployment and sample-delivery concepts. Demonstrating target selection, sample retrieval, and return to lander using a prototype system that is within the mass and functionality envelopes. Providing instrument/vehicle packaging concepts. As a follow-up to this initial FY'95 effort, a longer range thrust toward miniaturization and survival technology was --- for future missions. Point of Contact: Pauls.S.Schenker@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Nanorovers Nanorover prototype with 25-gram mobility chassis. Nanorovers are small planetary surface explorers with a mass of 10-100 grams. The principal objective of such explorers is to move about on the surface of another planet such as Mars in search of scientific and engineering resources like water ice or other volatiles, or to take photomicrographs of surface features. The large number of such systems that can be accommodated help to enhance the overall robustness of the mission to individual failures. One concept for a nanorover is a small tracked vehicle, like a tank. It is powered by solar cells on the top surface and has an ultra-miniaturized sensing and control package combining vision, planning, and control in a package of 1 gram or less. It moves about in a "reactive" mode on the surface, much the same way as an insect does. That is, if there is an obstacle on the left, it moves right, and vice versa. If it begins to move out of the sunlight and is losing power, it changes course. If it senses more of what it is seeking (e.g., water vapor) on one side than the other, it turns toward its goal. Solid-state adsorption-based chemical sensing will be the principal means of scientific exploration with these devices, in addition to imaging. Point of Contact: Brian.H.Wilcox@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== JPL MarsYard The MarsYard is a simulated Mars landscape developed by the JPL Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program for testing and evaluation of rovers and robotics technology for future Mars surface exploration. Rover undergoing testing in MarsYard's simulated Mars landscape. An Important part of rover and robotics development is testing of prototype systems in relevant environments. Outdoor evaluation is particularly important as it provides natural lighting conditions and large test areas. In the past, rover testing was done in the Arroyo Seco east of JPL but this was less than ideal as the terrain was not representative of Mars' and excessive time was spent in setting up and breaking down the equipment each day. Development of a large outdoor test area within the bounds of JPL seemed most desirable. The MarsYard, located at the corner of Explorer and Surveyor roads near the center of the JPL Oak Grove facility, has an area of approximately 450 square meters (about 24 by 18 meters). Decomposed granite fines (sand) material was selected as ground cover because its spectral qualities are similar to those expected on Mars. (This is the same material used by scientists at the University of Arizona Mars Garden.) To provide approximately 20 centimeters of cover over the entire area, 200 tons of decomposed granite were used. A hill or sand dune was developed in the middle of the area to add variety. To populate the area, 20 tons of volcanic rocks of different types (different colors, textures, and densities) were used. On a concrete retaining wall along the west, north, and east sides of the MarsYard is a mural depicting the Red Planet. The mural, based on Viking Lander-1 and -2 imagery, shows a rocky plain extending to the horizon. One of the most important features of the MarsYard is the distribution of rocks based on actual Viking Lander data. The Moore's model, a probabilistic rock density for a given rock size based on Viking Lander-1 and -2 imagery, was used to generate the rock distribution map required to lay out the volcanic rocks in the MarsYard --recreating areas like those associated with both landing sites, as well as a Mars nominal environment with theoretical average Mars rock density. Having good models of rock distribution is critical for testing rovers of all sizes to ensure that they are able to effectively maneuver and carry out scientific exploration.

NASA's planned Mars Surveyor Program missions of 1998-2005 are possible applications, in which lander-based robots may acquire soil and rock specimens, deploy and retrieve surface instrumentation, and microscopically view and spectroscopically scan surface features of interest --often working over large lander near-field areas of 2-3-meter radius and carrying end-effector payloads over 1 kilogram. To gain a sense of this application scale, note that the Mars '98 mission lander science package is limited to 20 kilograms, 70 liters, 25 watts (daytime average), and $20 million, and the science payload allocates 25 percent or less of these resources to a robot giving good 2-3-meter near-field coverage (a large arm) or beyond (viz., a small rover). New high-strength lightweight, composite-material robot arm. Correspondingly, the Mars Lander Dexterous Manipulator task focuses on coordinated innovation in structural, electromechanical, and materials designs and their integration into minimum mass/volume/power flight engineering concept robots of potentially large reach. One important development, in cooperation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, targets new flight-qualifiable miniature solid-state motors (piezoelectrically driven); another technology thrust develops new robot-arm architectures based in high-strength, lightweight composites. The fiscal year 1995 effort has demonstrated the first such 3-degrees-of-freedom laboratory arm design. This novel telescopically deployed arm has been utilized in a realistic laboratory simulation of Mars lander-based sample access and analysis, enabling such functions as sample microviewing, point spectrometry, and physical sample acquisition via an instrumented end-effector. A derived flight concept for use in the Mars '98 mission has been proposed and approved. Flight design goals include a 3.5-kilogram mass (arm and actuation), 1.5-kilogram arm payload, 2-meter reach, and gas-deployable segmented linkage allowing arm launch stowage in a volume of 10 liters or less. Point of Contact: Paul.S.Schenker@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Aerobots Planetary aerobots are an innovative, new type of lightweight and low-cost telerobot, on that can fly and navigate in planetary atmospheric environments. The challenges of flying a planetary aerobot are providing mobility and autonomous navigation in a constantly changing three-dimensional environment --one in which the robotic vehicle is almost never stationary. JPL has recently developed and demonstrated a balloon buoyancy control concept applicable to several planets. This altitude control concept employs phase change fluids such that a planet's atmosphere is used as a giant heat engine to provide the mobility energy to ascend and descend at will. There are potential flight experiment opportunities as early as 1999 for Venus, 2001 for Mars, and 2000-2004 for Saturn's moon Titan. Planetary Aerobots will enable the acquisition of surface and atmospheric science at multiple sites designated by scientists and mission designers providing possibly global coverage over a planet surface. there are, however, challenging technical problems in vehicle mobility, onboard perception, and autonomous control and navigation. Technology in these areas will be demonstrated in a series of gradually more ambitious terrestrial flights. There are also concurrent terrestrial applications to global climate and pollution studies as well as to autonomous ocean exploration. P-46531Ac Artist's rendering of an aerobot a flying robot, for exploring Titan A proposed vehicle concept for Venus, Titan, and the outer planets is a closed-system reversible-fluid balloon that uses the atmospheric temperature difference as a function of altitude as a heat engine to provide the motive power to effect altitude change. A reversible fluid is either a gas or a liquid, depending on pressure and temperature. It is this phase change that can be used to control the buoyancy of a balloon system. When the reversible fluid is in the gas phase, the balloon has a lower average density than the surrounding atmosphere, thus providing a net increase in lift. Conversely, when the fluid is in the liquid phase, the balloon has a higher average density than the surrounding atmosphere, thus providing a negative lift. The choice of reversible fluid determines the equilibrium altitude about which the balloon system oscillates indefinitely. However, if the liquid is sealed in a pressure vessel before the balloon drops below this equilibrium altitude, the balloon will descend to the surface or a deep atmosphere of a planet. To control altitude range and equilibrium level, a primary balloon filled with helium or hydrogen can be combined with a secondary buoyancy-control balloon filled with a reversible fluid that allows the vehicle to go to a high equilibrium altitude. P-46531 Ac Aerobot designed with balloon buoyancy control for vertical mobility By controlling vertical mobility, aerobots can select altitudes where wind speeds and directions provide them with a wide range of horizontal mobility. This is especially true at Mars and Venus where rich altitude-variable wind gradients enable near-global planetary access. The objectives of the fiscal year 1996 program are to Develop telerobotic control of aerobots, including vertical and horizontal mobility with landing ability and autonomous navigation using onboard flight dynamics models and sensory perception. Construct a Planetary Aerobot Testbed vehicle for conducting a series of Earth-based demonstrations beginning with teleoperation and leading to long-range autonomous mobility. Transfer telerobotics technology to emerging flight opportunities. Testing of the Planetary Aerobot Testbed vehicle will exploit the fact that Earth's troposphere at an altitude between 0 and 6 kilometers has similar temperature-versus-pressure gradients as the Venus atmosphere at an altitude of 50-60 kilometers. Several passive, free-flight terrestrial experiments have been conducted using prototype vehicles developed by some of the researchers in a program funded by the JPL Director's Discretionary Fund.

The Exploration of Small Bodies task is therefore focusing on developing the technologies enabling in situ scientific studies of these interplanetary objects. This multiyear task explores three key technology areas: Surface and subsurface sampling. The gathering of surface and subsurface samples for scientific exploration is an important part of such missions. Low-mass/low-power mechanisms for sample acquisition are explored as well as concurrent development of sensors and control methods enabling autonomous operation in materials of unknown composition. Sample manipulation. Once a sample is acquired, it must be delivered to onboard science instruments for in situ analysis. Systems for sample handling and sample preparation in a microgravity environment will therefore be developed. Landing and anchoring. The low-gravity environment of small bodies allows for free-fall and unpowered landing but requires ways of absorbing impact energy as well as attaching the lander to the surface and reacting to sampling forces. Passive energy absorption systems such as crushable materials, as well as anchoring systems such as rocket-deployed spikes, are explored. Device for obtaining samples from the surface and subsurface of a comet. In fiscal year 1995, work began by developing and testing sampling systems specific to comets to meet the technology needs of the NASA-Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales Champollion comet lander (part of the European Space Agency's International Rosetta Mission). The comet-sampling system is required to gather several cubic centimeters of material from up to a meter beneath a comet's surface and deliver that sample to multiple onboard instruments within an extremely challenging mass/power budget. A prototype system has been developed that incorporates multiple sensors --not only allowing autonomous operation but also gathering data on material properties as sampling is done. A cryogenic test chamber enabling testing of a prototype sampling system in cryogenic comet facsimile materials of various densities has also been assembled. Point of Contact: Donald.R.Sevilla@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Electrostrictive Polymer Muscle Actuators This research program is dedicated to the development of actuation technology based on electrostrictive polymers (ESP). Efficient ESP materials and actuation mechanisms are being developed in the form of "muscles." The goals of the program are as follows. Demonstrate the unique and superior actuation capabilities of ESP compared to those of electrostrictive ceramics. Establish muscle-drive mechanisms for potential application to powered space suits and for future technology transfer to meet medical requirements. ESP materials will be developed and fabricated using a polymer combination of a backbone and a pendant group. The pendant group, which is a polymer having a high polarity, is needed to produce the desired strong electrostriction effect. The backbone polymer provides a large free-volume to allow easy alignment of the pendant groups in response to an activating electric field. The application of ESP involves technical challenges being addressed by this program. Muscle drivers are currently being configured, and their performance will be demonstrated in a series of rigorous tests. i-PMMA, reported to have a relatively high electrostriction effect, is being studied as a baseline. To demonstrate the performance of ESP, the program will design and fabricate an arm that will be driven by ESP muscle actuators. This arm will be designed to represent technology relevant to a flight experiment.

Mars Rovers for Sample Return: 1980's View Robby: Robby is a six-wheeled, three-body, articulated vehicle that offers enhanced mobility compared to a conventional four-wheeled, single body vehicle. The three-cab design allows the front and rear cabs to steer and roll with respect to the vehicle center-line, and the vehicle hinges about the center axle as well to allow the six wheels to comply to complex terrain geometry. Figure 1 illustrates Robby navigating in outdoor terrain. This vehicle provided a substantial technology base in navigation and remote control to support development of the microrovers which are currently the focus of this program. Some of these control strategies are outlined below. P-35715 Bc Fig. 1 Robby, A Planetary Rover Testbed Navigating in Outdoor Terrain Point of Contact: B. H. Wilcox, wilcox@robotics.jpl.nasa.gov Rover Control Strategies: Rover control and navigation is one the key technologies where JPL has made significant contributions. Operation of rovers with some form of remote or semi-autonomous control is desirable to reduce the cost and increase the capability and safety of many types of missions. However, the long time delays and relatively low bandwidths associated with radio communications between planets preclude a total �telepresence� approach to controlling the vehicle. Different control implementations with varying degrees of human supervision can be contrasted; three of these developed at JPL are illustrated by Computer Aided Remote Driving (CARD), Semiautonomous Navigation (SAN), and Behavior Control. Each of these represents points on a continuous spectrum of human-machine interaction. With CARD, stereo pictures from the rover are sent to Earth, where they are viewed by a human operator using a stereoscopic display. The operator designates a path using a 3-D cursor, giving a safe path for the vehicle to follow as far ahead as the operator can see accurately in three dimensions. A ground based computer computes the turn angles and path segment distances that correspond to the designated path. The information is then up-linked to the rover for execution, and the process repeats. With Semiautonomous Navigation, local routes are planned autonomously using range information obtained on the vehicle, guided by global routes planned on Earth using a topographic map which is obtained from images produced by a satellite orbiting the planet of interest. Expectations are monitored, and a perception-planning-monitoring-execution cycle is instantiated. In Behavior Control, an approximate range and heading to a goal location is up-linked to the vehicle which attempts to reach it�s destination by autonomously instantiating sensor- based reactive behaviors of varying complexity. These might include obstacle avoidance, search for specific features, sample acquisition, etc. Behaviors can be combined and layered to give more robust and richer overall system performance. Important considerations in choice between alternative control techniques concern robustness, predictability, and validation for mission use on one hand, and computational, sensor, and other resource requirements on the other. B. Microrovers In response to NASA's goals of implementing more affordable, faster, better missions, the JPL Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program has a thrust in miniature rovers to do science and exploration missions which can serve as precursors to larger robotic and possibly manned missions. This includes a complete system (i.e. microrover, lander, and control station) developed from the outset using science requirements and potential flight constraints as drivers (plausible mass, power, communication, and computation). Rocky-4: The Rocky-4 chassis is a springless suspension system called the �rocker-bogie,� which consists of two pairs of rocker arms or �bogies.� Each pair consists of a main rocker arm and a secondary arm whose pivot point is at the front end of the main arm. The two rocker-arm assemblies are connected through a differential gear at the center of gravity. The main body of the robot is mounted on the differential. The pitch of the main body is thus the average pitch of the two rocker-arm assemblies, providing a stable mount for instruments and sensors. Rocky-4 is 61 cm long , 38 cm wide and 36 cm high. The rover has six 13 cm diameter wheels made of strips of steel foil and cleats to provide traction. It weighs about 7 kilograms but eventually may have to be scaled down to 5 kg for inclusion in future missions (e.g. Mars Surveyor). There is a motor in the hub of each wheel so the vehicle can be steered by its front or rear wheels. The suspension system is unique in that it does not use springs and provides a great degree of stability for traversing rocky, uneven targets including rocks as high as 18 cm. Proximity and tilt sensors are used to prevent rollover. Mars Science Microrover Demonstration. A ground based demonstration of relevant capability was performed at JPL in June 1992 using Rocky-4. The experiment demonstrated the (a) ability to deploy a small(<150 gm) seismometer within 5-10 meters from the lander, (b) ability to acquire a soil sample and return it to the lander, (c) ability to integrate and operate a small (<500 gm) spectrometer to determine mineralogical composition, (d) ability to conduct visible imaging (camera < 150 gm) of local terrain, (e) ability to navigate in a field with rock distribution similar to that seen in the Viking 1 mission, and (f) ability to remove 10-30 microns from a weathered rock to perform spectrometry. This experiment suggested further study, several of which are currently being conducted. These include safe operation of the rover without line-of-sight to the lander. This involves the addition of proximity and ranging sensors on the microrover, fusion of ranging at the lander with imagery captured directly on the rover, addition of low-cost machine vision on the rover for terminal corrections, etc. A number of technology and design measurements quantify the paths taken by the rover under various scenarios, determine designation accuracies, test macro-commanding options, measure the traversability of terrain, etc. In addition, manipulation capability is being tested for instrument emplacement capability, surface grinding, and sample acquisition. Improved algorithms for data compression can make a significant contribution. Finally, tradeoffs of tether management vs. autonomy and flight electronic/software constraints needs to be further evaluated.

Cutts, james.a.cutts@jpl.nasa.gov MFEX: Microrover Flight Experiment The success of the rover technology development and demonstration program led to a plan to incorporate a microrover with roughly the same size and control approach into the Mars Pathfinder mission. This mission calls for a small landed package to arrive at Mars in July, 1997 with a lander and a microrover. The MFEX is a focused rover flight demonstration program (distinct from the Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program) responsible for developing, building and operating the Mars Pathfinder microrover. MFEX is part of the Office of Mars Exploration which is managed by Donna Shirley. The current development model for the Mars Pathfinder microrover builds upon the technology provided by the Rover and Telerobotics Technology Program, but equips it with flight-like processors and sensors and deals with such other disciplines as telecommunications, power, and data compression. The MFEX program offers the prospect that small rovers and small missions will accomplish the science objectives which were once believed to be possible only with larger rovers and multi-billion dollar missions.

Shirley, donna.l.shirley@cc:mail.jpl.nasa.gov Microrovers Beyond Pathfinder An active research and development program aimed at significant capabilities beyond the Pathfinder microrover is in place at JPL. This technology base will greatly expand the current MESUR/Pathfinder micro-rover performance in the areas of goal identification, increased vehicle mobility, intelligent terrain navigation with in-situresource management, and manipulation of science instrumentation. The goal is to combine both research and system demonstrations to advance the state of rover technologies while maintaining flight program relevance. Specific goals over the next four years are: (1) Performance characterization of multiple short traverses over Viking I type terrain within sight of lander; (2) Fresh rock sampling mechanism integrated on rover, single science target confirmation, traverse variable terrain (VL I and VL II), deployable or pointable solar array; (3) 9-10 kg vehicle, thermal insulation, multiple science target confirmation, multiple sampling and instrument pointing/deployment modes, traverse with return to lander; (4) Miniaturized vehicle (goal is 5 kg); non line of sight traverse, component capabilities tested in vacuum chamber. A series of rover vehicles are being used to conduct these tests. Rocky 3.2 is a research vehicle shown in Fig. 4 that is being used to test and demonstrate the advanced rover technologies. The Rocky 3.2 vehicle has been equipped with CCD imagers and laser stripe projectors which allow a wide range of plausible terrain hazards to be detected prior to a possible catastrophic engagement with the vehicle. This rover is currently used for research in the rover technology program, which is developing hardware and algorithms for advanced science sampling, dense-hazard navigation, and further miniaturization of these rover systems. P-43160 Ac Fig. 4 Rocky 3.2 Microrover Technology Beyond Pathfinder The rover technology program is being implemented with extensive university and industrial involvement in such areas as: Sensor suites for long distance navigation on planetary surfaces; legged vs. wheeled vehicle mobility; virtual environment operator interfaces; robotic grasping devices; and behavior based obstacle avoidance and fault-tolerance.

A research and development program is being conducted to develop supervised inspection techniques for tedious tasks as an aid to the operator. The telerobotic system would perform inspection relative to a given reference (e.g., the status of the facility at the time of the last inspection) and alert the operator to potential anomalies for verification and action. One example is the inspection of truss struts for micrometeoroid damage and visible cracks on thermal radiator surfaces. In the research being conducted, simulation of realistic dynamic lighting conditions is included. In addition, configuration control of manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom, pioneered by JPL, has been implemented to assure dexterous manipulation near complete structures. Teleoperated robotic arm carrying a pair of miniwrist cameras Surface Inspection robot control station The baseline inspection task is to teleoperate a robotic arm carrying a pair of miniwrist cameras. The operator uses a pair of 3-degrees-of-freedom joysticks and can control the lighting to better view the scene. Additional cameras with pan/tilt and zoom/focus control are controlled by the operator to observe the arm's motion and to inspect objects that are far away from the arm. A local-remote architecture is employed so that space and time distances can be effectively treated. Multisensor-based inspection of gas leak, temperature, and damage is conducted. Subsequently, inspection tasks requiring contact, such as eddy current-based crack detection, are performed. Technologies developed for the application include: Simulation of realistic dynamic lighting conditions Teleoperation and automated inspection Configuration-control redundant-arm kinematics and automated manipulator base placement Force control Multisensor inspection - vision, gas, temperature, and eddy current Serpentine manipulator development Multisensor integrated gripper development Virtual-window viewing Technology is currently being transferred to prospective Space Station applications at the NASA Johnson Space Center. Point of Contact: Won.S.Kim@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Dexterous Arm Control for the Ranger Flight Experiment The NASA Ranger Flight Experiment, led by the University of Maryland, is aimed at the development and demonstration of robotic technologies for executing manipulation tasks in space. The Ranger robot incorporates two dexterous 7-degrees-of-freedom manipulator arms mounted on a free-flying base. These arms will be used, both individually and cooperatively, to perform a variety of manipulation experiments and servicing operations. Based on a recent trade study on dexterous arm control, the configuration-control approach developed at JPL has been adopted for implementation on the Ranger dexterous arms. Ground-controlled Ranger robot for servicing operations in space The goal of the JPL task is to augment the operational capabilities of the dexterous arms in the Ranger Flight Experiment within the configuration-control framework. There are two specific objectives of the task. The first is to develop the capability of on-line collision detection and avoidance for the Ranger dexterous arms. This capability does not currently exist in the Ranger baseline control system, and erroneous operator commands can use collision between the dexterous arms and the camera and grapple arms, the base, or the task board. This added capability will enable collision-free motions of the arms throughout the work space. It will also cause a reduction in the Ranger operation time, since several possible motions with potential collision are not executed. In addition, this capability will increase the safety of the Ranger during the operation of the arms, a feature vital to the success of the Ranger mission. The second objective of the task is to provide the ground operator with a software tool for optimal placement of the Ranger base. This algorithm will ensure that both dexterous arms can reach the task site and that the useful work space volume is maximized. The algorithm will take into account the fact that the Ranger base is attached to the spacecraft by the grapple arm. Therefore, the configuration of the grapple arm will also be taken into consideration. At present, the placement of the Ranger base is done by the ground operator in an iterative trial-and-error fashion. The collision avoidance and base placement capabilities will considerably enhance the robustness and reliability of the Ranger control system and will significantly expand the range of tasks that can be accomplished in the Ranger Flight Experiment. A series of technology experiments will be conducted at JPL to demonstrate the efficacy of the collision avoidance and base placement algorithms.

A Ranger inspection taskboard will be fabricated and used in both ground-based preflight and actual flight tests. Onboard and ground-site requirements for this task --including task scenario, user interface, command sequences, arm motion control, lighting control, and image capture/down-link-- will be defined. A standalone automated inspection software package based on the JPL inspection technology will be developed and evaluated by analyzing Ranger inspection flight data.

Performance of payload alignment and mating often requires the use of multiple cameras. However, the objects being manipulated are not always seen completely by the available cameras. Inadequate viewing camera coverage is a major concern. The objectives of the Calibrated Synthetic Viewing task are to Develop and evaluate a computer-vision-assisted calibrated synthetic viewing software environment to resolve the problem of visual occlusion and limited camera viewing during the performance of telerobotic operations. Demonstrate reliable model/payload alignment and berthing operations under limited camera-viewing conditions for space station telerobotic onboard and ground control.

The thrust of these activities has been to learn how to operate a remote system from a local control site. A series of laboratory telerobotic systems have been built at JPL, and experiments have been conducted, since the early 1980's. The spectrum of human machine interaction varies from direct operator control (i.e. teleoperation) with computer assistance to more autonomous operation with fail-safe back to a human operator to cope with conditions beyond our current technological capability in autonomous operations. The term telerobotics refers to system capability which integrates both of these approaches. Advanced teleoperation is particularly well suited for non-repetitive, less well modeled tasks, such as repair operations. For more autonomous systems, the objective is to embed enough intelligence in the remote robot so that it can respond correctly to high-level commands from the operator. The operator then assumes a supervisory role in commanding the remote robotic system. A. Surface Inspection Robot(Movie) Complex missions require routine and unscheduled inspection for safe operation. The purpose of research in this task is to facilitate structural inspection of the planned Space Station while mitigating the need for EVA, and giving the operator supervisory control over detailed and somewhat mundane, but important tasks. The telerobotic system enables inspection relative to a given reference (e.g. the status of the facility at the time of the last inspection) and alerts the operator to potential anomalies for verification and action. One example might be the inspection of truss struts for micrometeoroid damage and visible cracks on the thermal radiator surface. Simulation of realistic dynamic lighting is included. In addition, configuration control of manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom has been developed and implemented to assure dexterous manipulation near complex structures. To assure safe operation, collision detection and avoidance algorithms are used to monitor the arm motion while the operator commands the arm during the inspection.

This end-effector also houses two proximity sensors to provide collision avoidance and a force/torque sensor for safe contact with the environment. Algorithms for flaw detection based on real-time image differencing with appropriate registration to account for variable lighting and manipulator/camera position have been developed and validated. Several of the developed technologies within this task have successfully been transferred to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for realistic tests in a high fidelity robotics laboratory with evaluation by astronauts. Point of Contact: S. Hayati, (818) 354-8273, hayati@telerobotics.jpl.nasa.gov B. Ground Operator Environment There are two primary objectives of this project: To develop technologies that enable well-integrated NASA ground-to-orbit telerobotics operations, and to develop a prototype common architecture workstation which implements these capabilities for other NASA technology projects and planned NASA flight applications. This task develops and supports three telerobot control modes which are applicable to time delay operation: Preview teleoperation, teleprogramming, and supervised autonomy. Preview teleoperation provides a graphical robot simulation which moves in real time according to the operator�s motion input to a hand controller. This same teleoperation motion is sent to the real robotic system for execution. In teleprogramming, the operator�s manual interaction with a 3-D virtual environment (physically identical to preview teleoperation) is symbolically interpreted by computer software (e.g. for a grasping operation) to a low-bandwidth, low-level sequence of autonomous commands that are synchronously transmitted to the remote site, which has a simple sensor-referenced behavioral control capability. The best features of dexterous teleoperation are preserved, while providing greatly increased operational robustness against extended (2-10 secs.) and possibly intermittent time delay. The operator�s graphical workstation environment can be automatically updated based upon modeled sensor data feedback from the remote site, and robot sensor data is used instantaneously at the remote site to behaviorally compensate operator motion errors and positioning uncertainties. Finally, supervised autonomy provides capability to generate high-level autonomous command sequences via either a graphically programmed operator interaction with the modeled environment, or using conventional menus. The ground control capability is targeted to support as a first user, the Dexterous Orbiter Servicing System (DOSS), a dexterous manipulator for the Orbiter payload bay. It is a sidewall mounted robot that operates from a fixed base or from the end of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). This arm will provide the crew and mission controllers with an alternative to EVA for performing payload bay operations. These activities include EVA worksite setup, payload operations, and many contingency operations (e.g., repairs). The DOSS is designed for repetitive flights and can be used as a baseline operational capability similar to the RMS. It can also function as a testbed for future telerobotic experiments. The DOSS will utilize many technologies developed within NASA�s Telerobotics Program, including robot control from Langley Research Center, remote surface inspection from JPL, and ground operator control from JPL. Point of Contact: S. Hayati, hayati@telerobotics.jpl.nasa.gov C. Distributed Space Telerobotics This effort is being developed as a cooperative research and development activity between NASA-JPL and MITI-Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) of Tsukuba, Japan. The main technical thrust of the project is safe ground control of orbital robots under operational uncertainties caused by impaired remote viewing, communication time delay, and tasking contingencies. Each of these technological areas manifest themselves in respective application interests; the main Japanese application interest is in space assembly, while the U.S. focus is in space servicing. There are two key research areas currently under development. Intelligent Viewing Control (IVC) involves computerized planning and sequencing of multi-camera views which are fused with calibrated 3-D virtual workspace presentations. This capability includes software facilities for interactive modeling, i.e., the capture of new workspace features, their rendering/presentation, and calibration, intended to improve workspace perception and facilitate camera management. Intelligent Motion Control (IMC) or teleprogramming has already been mentioned in the previous section. The teleprogrammed mode is intended to extend time-delay teleoperation to useful LEO applications, and provides a mission resource for contingency tasking in partially structured environments (having geometric uncertainties). Initial interface specifications have already been developed resulting in successful remote operation of robots in the collaborating country. Point of Contact: P.

Important lessons learned during this period are: Near-term system demonstrations are needed to build user confidence Robust performance is a prerequisite to acceptance Rapid prototyping yields faster investment return and stimulates use of cutting edge technology Prime examples of telerobotic systems built during the 1980's include: the JPL Telerobotics Testbed; the Supervised Telerobotics Laboratory; and the Advanced Teleoperation Laboratory for Satellite Repair. 1. Telerobotics Testbed: The JPL telerobotics testbed was one of the most complete research telerobotic systems ever built. Its main goal was to augment teleoperation with semi-autonomous capabilities at the robot site. Typical demonstrations conducted with this system included that of satellite grappling with two arms and ORU replacement, as shown respectively in Fig. 7. Technical areas of emphasis included: Coordinated dual arm manipulation, force-reflecting operator control, and use of AI tools for task sequence planning and execution. Major accomplishments included: Synthesis of one of the most complete laboratory telerobots ever built; integration of AI and robot control techniques in control architecture; fast robot motion planners for collision avoidance; execution of dexterous tasks targeted to space; performance evaluation and demonstration in realistic servicing scenarios.

Its main accomplishments were: Development of a complete system for dual arm supervisory control operations, a generalized-compliant-motion primitive for dual arm robot programming, and a modular control architecture for ground remote operations. It demonstrated several complex tasks in ORU replacement during telerobotic satellite servicing. It also produced experimental data for use in design of Space Station robotics operations.

The NASA 1984 Solar Maximum Satellite EVA Repair operation was used as the basis for an experimental paradigm. Tasks that were performed in 1984 by two astronauts were duplicated in the laboratory. These tasks included replacement of the modular attitude control subsystem and the main electronics box on the Solar Max Satellite. The research revealed information about suitable tasks for teleoperated repairs, training in virtual environments, and teleoperation of redundant manipulators. from P-42661 Ac Fig. 9 Solar Max Repair Ground Demonstration Using Teleoperation The system is illustrated in Fig. 9.

Advances in small manipulators, miniaturized in situ sensors, dexterous teleoperative controls, virtual-reality/telepresence displays, and real-time three-dimensional imaging --and their integration into robotic and computer-assisted surgical systems-- promise to extend surgeons' capabilities, improve operative outcomes, minimize patient recovery times, and lower the compounded costs of overall health-care delivery. P-46531 Bc Novel telerobotic system for dexterity-enhanced microsurgery. Working through a Technology Cooperation Agreement with the Memphis-based MicroDexterity Systems (MDS), Inc., JPL is developing a novel telerobotic system for dexterity-enhanced microsurgical procedures of the brain, eye, ear, face, hand, and spine. The JPL task effort, entitled Robot-Assisted Microsurgery (RAMS), is funded by NASA and performs robotic technology design, development, and engineering benchtop evaluation. MDS carries out complementary work in medical requirements, system concept definition, and medical testing under independent funding. A NASA-convened medical advisory board periodically reviews the overall JPL-MDS effort. MDS, with end-market distributor participation, plans to have its first clinical trials in two-three years and seeks widespread market availability of dexterity-enhancement microsurgery system/tooling within this decade. The RAMS concept is a master/slave, motion-and-force-scaling telemanipulator with user-programmable controls. JPL has completed design, fabrication, and preliminary testing of a new 6-degrees-of-freedom slave robot, as well as a new master hand controller with force reflection in the three Cartesian axes. The primary system mode is teleoperative positioning. The surgeon will also be able to interactively designate and "share" automated presentation and control of robot trajectories --e.g., implement virtual force boundaries/constraints on motions (in position, velocity, or acceleration) or program supervisory motion controls referenced to three-dimensional medical imagery. The RAMS system, as currently configured, will enable highly gifted surgeons to teleoperatively refine the physical scale of their unaided manual procedures by two to five times. The RAMS controls also provide a "tremor compensation" function to smooth input positioning in the face of myoclonic jerk and tremor that limit most individuals' fine-motion skills. The 6-degrees-of-freedom slave has a body consisting of a torso, shoulder, and elbow, with a non-intersecting three-axis wrist (the kinematic design of which is based on Ross-Hime Designs, Inc., "Omni-Wrist" and related patents licensed to MDS). The slave is approximately 40 centimeters full extent, including the base with drive-train --the motors of which are fully enclosed and easily detached and reattached to facilitate sterilization of the remaining assembly. Slave actuation is based on a new JPL revolute joint and cable-drive mechanism design providing near-zero backlash, constant cable-length excursions, and minimized joint coupling. The robot electromechanical design and associated controls are conceived to ultimately allow relative positioning of surgical tools to within 10 micrometers of a target throughout a continuous hemispherical work space of more than 400 cubic centimeters. In the first engineering laboratory experiments, repeatable, smoothly resolved motions as fine as 25 micrometers were achieved.

These robotic arms are anthropomorphic and have the potential to perform complex tasks that demand human-like dexterity and versatility unavailable in standard 6-degrees-of-freedom industrial robots. The 7-degrees-of-freedom arm is sold with a rudimentary controller that provides only basic capabilities that do not exploit the arm's intrinsic dexterity. Personal computer-based control of RRC seven-jointed robot arm. Since 1987, JPL has been developing for NASA advanced control techniques for seven-jointed arms such as the RRC arms. A new approach to configuration control of redundant manipulators with seven or more joints has been developed at JPL. The research leading to this development has evolved from analysis and simulation to full-scale implementation and experimentation. The configuration -control approach provides a general framework in which the user can utilize arm redundancy to accomplish a variety of additional tasks beyond the basic task of end-effector placement. This research has been reported in many publications and patents and has been implemented at a number of universities and research and development centers. RRC has been very interested in transferring the JPL-developed configuration-control techniques and algorithms to its next-generation commercial products, since these techniques will enhance the functionality and capability of RRC products considerably. A Joint Technology Cooperation Agreement was signed by JPL and RRC in 1993 for commercialization of the JPL configuration-controls methods. At the present time, JPL is achieving this transfer into a real-time system, based on a personal computer, that will be the new platform for RRC;s next-generation products. The JPL configuration-control software was successfully integrated into the first RRC new commercial product, which was delivered to the Army Research and Development Laboratory in New Jersey in May 1995.

JPL recently developed such a technique that enables high-fidelity preview/predictive displays with reliable, accurate calibrated graphics overlay on live video for telerobotic applications, and demonstrated its effectiveness in the May 1993 JPL-NASA Goddard Space Flight Center remote servicing task. Within NASA's recent thrust for industrial collaboration, in September 1993, JPL established a Technology Cooperation Agreement with Deneb Robotics, Inc. Through this agreement, JPL has been transferring the virtual-reality calibration technology and its evolving additions to Deneb, and Deneb has been inserting this technology into its commercial product. This joint technology collaborative work enables Deneb to commercialize an upgraded industry product that will greatly benefit both space and terrestrial telerobotic applications. System that calibrates robot-arm simulation with actual video image. Deneb recently completed the beta version of the operator-interactive virtual-reality calibration option for the new release of TELEGRIP 2.4 and already shipped three copies to customers. This option allows a multiple windows display of graphics, video, and calibrated graphics overlay on video, as shown in the figure above. Seen in the figure are three views of a robot arm: A calibrated video overlay in the lower-left window, a simulation in the large main window, and a video image in the right window. The buttons on the right side of the main window provide the interface for the operator-interactive virtual-reality calibration consisting of camera calibration and object localization.

In parallel with the ongoing technology development focusing on planetary missions, a Technology Cooperation Agreement has been established between JPL and International Space Enterprises, Inc., to explore the latter's concurrent, dual-use application of this technology in the commercial sector. The near-term goal of this agreement is the development of technology required to support commercial applications of rover and control products for schools and science centers. The longer-term goal is the development of technologies to support low-cost lunar and Mars missions that may be partially supported commercially. A closely related objective of the Technology Cooperation Agreement is that of educational and public outreach, intended to stimulate and inspire student and public interest in space exploration in general, and more specifically, in planetary rover technologies and missions. To this end, a series of demonstrations are being conducted: Planetary rover prototypes are operating in simulated Mars terrain at JPL with the rovers being commanded remotely from a school or museum site participating in the Technology Cooperation Agreement Program. In June 1995, such a demonstration was conducted from the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. This demonstration involved an integrated system consisting of a planetary rover prototype and a command and control workstation at the school. Students at the school, drawing from JPL's technology base in planetary rovers, assisted in the setup of the workstation and in conducting the remote control operations. International Space Enterprises plans to use this initial demonstration system as a baseline for development, in fiscal year 1996 and beyond, of a commercial product consisting of the rover and the corresponding command and control workstation. In addition to the development of commercialization opportunities, the Technology Cooperation Agreement is also contributing to NASA missions. The demonstrations and tests conducted as a part of the agreement increase the robustness and reliability of the planetary rover technology to be used in space. A particular technical challenge is to guarantee robustness and reliability while testing with unspecialized operators (e.g., students). Another challenge is that of repeated operations from various control sites. In the longer term, it is anticipated that the Technology Cooperation Agreement-supported demonstrations will increase public interest in the JPL rover technology base, and in planetary missions in NASA's short-term and long-term horizons Point of Contact: Guillermo.Rodriguez@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu WT01-B04-45IA080-000557-B034-383http://lmooradian.jpl.nasa.gov:80/TerrComm.html 137.79.14.197 19970103071341 text/html 3988HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: MacHTTP/2.2Message-ID: Date: Friday, 03-Jan-97 07:18:46 GMTLast-Modified: Monday, 29-Jan-96 18:07:15 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3744 TERRESTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS TERRESTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: ARCHIVE - DEC. 1994 A. Ground Emergency Response Vehicle Following four years of research, this effort has prototyped a teleoperated mobile robot enabling the JPL HAZMAT (hazardous material) response team to remotely explore sites where hazardous materials have been accidentally spilled or released rather than risk entry team personnel. JPL robotic researchers, engineers, Fire Department and Safety personnel have worked in close cooperation to develop the system. The primary mission of the robot, called HAZBOT, is first entry and reconnaissance of an incident site; the most dangerous part of a response since the type of materials involved and the magnitude of the spill may not be fully known. During such missions, HAZBOT must first gain entry into the incident site which may involve climbing stairs, unlocking and opening doors, and maneuvering in tight spaces. Once the spill is located, an on- board chemical gas sensor is used for material identification. The robot can also be used to aid in remediation or containment of the incident by, for instance, closing a leaking valve, deploying absorbent material, or placing a broken container in secondary containment. HAZBOT has been specially designed to enclose all electrical components and provide internal pressurization, enabling operation in atmospheres that contain combustible vapors. Other system features include a track drive base with front and rear articulating sections for obstacle/stair climbing, a six DOF manipulator with five foot reach and 40 pound payload capacity, custom tools for unlocking and opening doors, and 2 color CCD cameras. To date, the robot has been used by the JPL HAZMAT team in three simulated response missions to test and demonstrate system capability. HAZBOT is currently being used in the field for reconnaissance missions. Future work includes the integration of on-board sensors as well as improvement to the operator control station.

Satellite Test Assistant Robot (STAR): A Robotic Inspection System for Thermal/Vacuum Environments. STAR is a remote inspection robot which has been developed to assist engineers in the ground testing of spacecraft in simulated space environments. STAR is designed to operate inside JPL's 10-ft and 25-ft thermal/vacuum test chambers where temperatures range from -190 C to +100 C and extremely high vacuums can be achieved. STAR consists of a 25 ft vertical axis and an Azimuthal axis which provides mobility around the inside diameter of the chamber. A 2-axis scanning platform is instrumented with two high resolution video cameras, controlled lighting and an Infrared Imaging Camera. At an Operator Control Station engineers remotely control the position and orientation of STAR's lighting and camera instrumentation allowing close-up real-time visual inspection and infrared thermal mapping of a spacecraft under test in the simulated space environment inside the chamber. STAR will help engineers by improving test reliability and reducing overall test costs. STAR is installed and operational in the test chamber. Its first application to a JPL flight project will be for the Mars Pathfinder Spacecraft which begins test in FY 95.

Regular inspection of aircraft is critical for safety and to determine what and when repairs are needed. Aircraft inspection can be both time consuming and difficult because of the size of aircraft, such as external inspection of the C-5A, and because of difficult access, such as internal engine and fuel tank inspection. Recent advances in miniaturization technologies have produced technologies enabling development of new inspection systems to enhance aircraft inspection. The four objectives of the Miniaturization Technologies for Aircraft Inspection task are to Determine aircraft inspection application areas that could most greatly benefit from the application of miniaturization technologies. Evaluate the current state of the art in aircraft inspection technologies with primary focus on small and miniature technologies. Identify for development promising candidate miniaturization technologies that would benefit aircraft inspection applications.

Point of Contact: Paul.G.Backes@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Obstacle Detection for Autonomous Ground Vehicles Autonomous ground vehicles are being developed for a variety of applications in the military, in hazardous waste remediation, and in planetary exploration. Such applications often involve limitations on communications that require such a vehicle to navigate autonomously for extended distances and extended periods of time. Under these circumstances, the vehicle must be equipped with sensors for detecting obstacles in its path. JPL is developing obstacle detection sensors for the "Demo II" Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Program, which is sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Testbed vehicle with stereovision system for real-time obstacle detection. The goal of the Demo II Program is to develop technology enabling ground vehicles to perform autonomous scouting missions. In its full generality, this application will require operating during the day or night, in clear or obscured weather conditions, and over terrain that will include a variety of natural and human-made obstacles. Obstacle detection sensors must be able to perceive terrain geometry and the material type of any ground cover (terrain type), an do so at night and through haze. The JPL task has been addressing the problem of perceiving daytime and nighttime terrain geometry and is beginning to address the problem of perceiving terrain type by day. For sensing geometry, stereovision is being used; its properties of being nonemissive, nonscanning, and nonmechanical make it attractive for military vehicles that require a low-signature sensor performing well while jostling over rough terrain. In collaboration with other laboratories, the JPL task has recently begun experimenting with stereovision and thermal imagery to address night operations. For sensing terrain type, preliminary investigations have been conducted that use visible, near-infrared, and polarization imagery to discriminate soil, vegetation, and water. Elevation map of a road, generated by stereovision system. Over the past five years, the JPL task has developed a real-time stereovision system that currently produces range imagery from a 256- x 45-pixel window of attention in about 0.6 second per frame, using a Datacube MV-200 image-processing board and a 68040 central-processing-unit board as the sole computing engines. This vision system is installed on a roboticized modern military jeep that serves as a testbed UGV. Enhancements currently in progress on this system include the addition of algorithms for real-time obstacle detection, focus of attention, and software-based lens aperture control. The vision system has been used to drive the jeep autonomously at speeds up to 10 kilometers per hour. This work has been the first to show that stereovision can provide range data of sufficient quality, at sufficient speeds, and with sufficiently small computing resources to be practical for autonomous vehicle navigation. Future work will attempt to increase the quality of the range data, miniaturize the computing system, and integrate terrain classification with range imaging. Point of Contact: Larry.H.Matthies@jpl.nasa.gov Return to Segment Menu ======================================== Biologically Inspired Robotics This task explores the use of legged robots in environments typical for various military missions. It is supported by a basic research grant from the Office of Naval Research and is a part of that office's Perceptual Sciences Program. Focusing on issues related to the control of legged robots that perform extended autonomous operations, the task investigates the feasibility of such concepts for Navy operations in shallow waters, such as surveillance and mine discharging. the resulting technologies also address some f the issues related to planetary exploration on surfaces that might be more rocky than the Viking Lander-1 and -2 sites and provide the design tools and test data necessary for the investigation of legged rovers for future NASA missions. The problem of controlling legged robots has been perceived as a complex one, possibly requiring extensive computation. This is, perhaps, one of the reasons for the choice of wheeled rovers over legged rovers in many military, civilian, and space applications, where the constraints on mass, power, and/or computational requirements often have a compelling impact on vehicle design. On the other hand, there exists a rich spectrum of simple biological systems that perform stable locomotion with relative ease in the presence of large amounts of uncertainties. It is therefore natural to seek biological principles that might simplify control and improve mechanical design, so that legged concepts may become competitive enough for serious consideration in a variety of applications. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of biological locomotion is the notion of a gait, and the study of underlying mechanisms used for choosing, modifying, and maintained gaits. A gait is quantified by the phase relationship maintained between the motions of individual legs and appears to be related to the overall stability of the animal performing locomotion. The premise of the research conducted in this task, therefore, is that a systematic study of gait modeling and gait control could result in computationally efficient locomotion controllers. To date, a simple gait model has been developed for the emulation of two-, four-, and six-legged gaits, and a locomotion control architecture has been determined for choosing, adapting, and maintaining gaits. JPL has built a six-legged robot, about 0.4 meter long, 0.25 meter wide, and about 0.1 meter in height. The control programs that drive the legs have been developed and tested. Programs are being developed to enable coordinated movement of the legs for stable locomotion on rough terrain. Currently, experiments are being performed indoors to be followed by a series of outdoor tests in the near future.

Illustrative examples of these component technologies are provided below. Telepresence/Exoskeleton This project augments telemanipulation capabilities through the development and evaluation of a unique force-reflecting master-slave exoskeleton anthropomorphic arm-hand system, with the emphasis on the use of EVA-rated tools and on minimum training requirements. There is also strong interest for the backdriveable glove as a physical therapy aid to rehabilitate stroke patients paralytic hands. JPL-23094 Fig. 14 Exoskeleton Controlled by Human Operator The focus of this task involves the augmentation to telemanipulation capabilities through the development of human-equivalent dexterity of remotely operated hands, with emphasis on minimal training and use of human rated tools. The technical objective is to prototype a force-reflecting master-slave arm-hand system in exoskeleton form with a 7-DOF arm and 16-DOF four fingered hand. This includes integration with a visual telepresence system. The programmatic objective is to determine how far an exoskeleton alternative can perform EVA-glove rated manipulative activities without changing EVA tools or adding new ones to the existing repertoire. Point of Contact: A. K. Bejczy, bejczy@telerobotics.jpl.nasa.gov Wide Field-of-View Stereo WFOV, the Wide Field-of-View stereo system, is a JPL-based technology developed for the DOD's Unmanned Ground Vehicles Project, UGV. It is a real-time system which produces dense range maps from a stereo pair of cameras mounted on a HMMWV ("Hum-Vee"), the military's modern-day Jeep equivalent. The range data is being used by higher-level vehicle-control systems for autonomously navigating around local obstacles encountered during battlefield maneuvers. Below is a sample image. In the lower-right corner is the left image from a stereo pair taken in the Arroyo next to JPL. The upper-right shows range data as distance from the cameras. The upper left contains the subpixel disparity image, produced by the stereo system, from which the range data was computed. The lower-left shows confidence data. In all cases the colors span the rainbow, with red being low values and violet being high values. Robotic vehicles have important applications in planetary exploration, hazardous waste handling, battlefield operations, and factory material transportation. To enable these applications, robotic vehicles must be equipped to automatically detect obstacles in their path. Obstacle detection can be achieved by using range sensors to observe the geometry of the environment, then by analyzing the geometry to find passable routes for the vehicle. However, range sensors have not been available that meet the cost and performance requirements of most applications. JPL has taken a major step forward in this area by demonstrating a practical range sensing system to be based on stereo vision. Stereo vision uses two cameras to observe the environment, finds the same object in each image, and measures range to the object by triangulation; that is, by intersecting the lines of sight from each camera to the object. Finding the same object in each image is called matching and is the fundamental computational task underlying stereo vision. Matching objects at each pixel in the image produces a range estimate at each pixel; together, these range estimates form a range image of the scene. Geometric analysis of the range image identifies passable routes. For robotic vehicle applications, the primary alternatives to stereo vision-based range estimation use acoustics, radar, or scanning lasers. Compared to these alternatives, stereo vision has the significant advantage that it achieves high resolution and simultaneous acquisition of the entire range image without energy emission or moving parts. The key issue in making stereo vision practical was to find a combination of algorithms and processors that led to reliable, real-time range estimation with a computer system small and cheap enough to use on robotic vehicles. The stereo vision algorithm (1) re-samples the input images to correct for geometric nonlinearities, (2) reduces the resolution of the re-sampled images by computing image pyramids, (3) applies cross-correlation to the low resolution images to find matching objects at each pixel, and (4) performs triangulation with the result of the matching process to generate range estimates. Steps (1) through (3) involve low-level, integer operations on the image pixels and are implemented on one special-purpose image processing board. Step (4) involves floating functions and coordinate transformations and is implemented on a general purpose CPU. The entire computing system occupies five slots in a dual-height VME card cage, including the image processor, the CPU, and two analog-to-digital conversion boards for video acquisition. The system currently produces 64x60-pixel range images in one-third of a second, which is a speedup of three orders of magnitude over what was possible prior to this work. In a major demonstration performed in 1990, for the NASA planetary rover program, JPL used a version of this vision system to show that a robotic vehicle could perform autonomous obstacle avoidance while traversing 100 meters of off-road terrain. This demonstration established the viability and practicality of stereo vision-based range imaging for robotic vehicle applications. The impact of this work is reflected by the adoption of similar approaches for subsequent, NASA-funded robotic expeditions to volcanoes in Antarctica and Alaska, by the potential use of these algorithms in upcoming robotic missions to Mars, and by the transfer of this technology to military robotics programs funded by the Department of Defense.

Matthies, matthies@telerobotics.jpl.nasa.gov Serpentine Robot P-44487 Fig. 16 a Small, light-weight, and highly dexterous serpentine robot or visual inspection A telerobotics inspection system has been developed to perform remote inspection experiments in realistic space-like environments. The main application focus of this task is the Space Station. The Space Station is a large space platform with complex mechanical, electrical, thermal, fluid and gas interfaces, and a changing suite of internal and external scientific experimental apparatus. On-orbit maintenance of such a complex, changing facility requires periodic as well as "on demand" inspection capabilities. The inspection system consists of two seven-degrees-of-freedom (7-DOF) Robotics Research Corporation manipulator arms which are mounted on two one-degree-of-freedom mobile platforms. The arms carry cameras and lights for inspection. These arms, however, are too large to enter the small truss structure openings. A smaller and more dexterous arm was needed to perform inspection tasks in highly restricted regions. JPL has developed a serpentine robot to test the feasibility of robotic inspection of such restricted areas. The robot is 3.8 centimeters in diameter, approximately 90 centimeters long, weighs 2.7 kilograms, and has 11 degrees of freedom. All joints are direct-drive motor controlled, and all motors are mounted internally. Inspection capability is provided by a fiber-optics borescope embedded inside the arm. This borescope transfers images to a camera at the base of the arm and illuminates the inspection site. The goal is to use this robot as an inspection tool to be picked up by one of the large manipulators. The combined macro/micro arm will have 21 degrees of freedom. Algorithms have been developed to guide this arm through small openings in such a way that the rest of the arm automatically follows the tip's path, thus avoiding collisions with the environment. This technology can be used in industry and medical applications.

Building from its established NASA technology base in teleoperations and telerobotics, JPL is developing a new robotic microdexterity platform with important applications to medicine. Through a cooperative NASA-Industry effort, the Robot Assisted Microsurgery (RAMS) task develops a dexterity-enhanced master-slave telemanipulator enabling breakthrough procedures in micro/minimally invasive surgery. A cooperative commercial development agreement with Micro Dexterity Systems, Inc. is in place to bring the JPL technology to the point of application. The applicable medical practice includes eye, ear, nose, throat, face, hand, and cranial surgeries. As part of planned task activities, the resulting NASA robot technologies will be benchmarked in actual operating room procedures for vitreous retinal surgery. The primary objective of this task is to provide an integrated robotic platform for master-slave dual-arm manipulation operational in a one cubic inch work volume at features in the 100 micron range (our goal is to extend these capabilities to features in the 20 micron range). The research is a natural evolution of our extensive experience in force-reflecting teleoperation with dissimilar master/slave. Capabilities will include force-reflection and textural tactile feedback, and in situ multiple-imaging modalities for improved surgical visualization and tissue discrimination. Potential NASA applications may include EVA/IVA telescience, bioprocessing, materials process and micro mechanical assembly, small-instrument servicing, and terrestrial environmental testing in vacuum.

This technique enables high-fidelity preview/predictive displays with calibrated graphic overlay on live video for telerobotic servicing applications. Its effectiveness was successfully demonstrated in a recent JPL/NASA-GSFC ORU (Orbital Replacement Unit) change-out remote servicing task. With NASA's recent thrust toward increased collaboration with industry, JPL and Deneb Robotics, Inc., have established a technology cooperation agreement. JPL transfers the virtual reality calibration software technology to Deneb, and Deneb inserts this software technology into its commercial product, thus enabling Deneb to commercialize an upgraded product. Key new features of the JPL calibration technique include; 1) An operator-interactive method is adopted to obtain reliable correspondence data. 2) A robot arm itself is used as a calibration fixture for camera calibration, eliminating a cumbersome procedure of using external calibration fixtures. 3) The object localization procedure is added after the camera calibration as a new approach to obtain graphic overlay of both the robot arm and the object(s) on live video and enable effective use of the computer-generated trajectory mode in addition to the teleoperation mode. 4) A projection-based linear least-squares algorithm is extended to handle multiple camera views for object localization. 5) Nonlinear least-squares algorithms combined with linear ones are employed for both camera calibration and object localization. The enhanced product, including the JPL-developed technology, will be in market in early 1995. Point of Contact: kim@telerobotics.jpl.nasa.gov C. Commercialization of Redundant Arm Control Algorithms: Robot Control Schemes are Transferred to Commercial Products Robotics Research Corporation (RRC) manufactures a family of dexterous 7-DOF arms that are used extensively at JPL, JSC, LaRC, GSFC, as well as by a number of government agencies, private companies, and universities. These robotic arms are anthropomorphic and have the potential to perform complex tasks that demand human-like dexterity and versatility unavailable in the standard 6-DOF industrial robots. The 7-DOF arms are sold with a rudimentary controller that provides only basic capabilities that do not exploit the intrinsic dexterity present in the 7-DOF arms. Since 1987, JPL has been developing for NASA advanced control techniques for seven jointed arms, such as the Robotics Research Arms. A new approach to "Configuration Control" of redundant manipulators with seven or more joints has been developed at JPL. The research leading to this development has evolved from analysis and simulation to full-scale implementation and experimentation. The configuration control approach provides a general framework in which the user can utilize the arm redundancy in order to accomplish a variety of additional tasks beyond the basic task of end-effector placement. Typical additional tasks that have been implemented and demonstrated are: Elbow placement, joint limit avoidance, singularity robustness, base placement, and collision avoidance. This research has been reported in many publications and patents, and has been implemented at a number of universities and R & D centers. The Robotics Research Corporation has been very interested in transferring the JPL developed configuration control techniques and algorithms to their next generation commercial products, since they have realized that it will enhance the functionality and capability of their products considerably. A Joint Technology Cooperation Agreement was signed in 1993 between JPL and RRC for commercialization of the JPL configuration control methods. At the present time, JPL is achieving this transfer into a PC-based real-time system which will be the new platform for their next generation products. The enhanced product will be in the market in 1995. P-36299 Ac Fig. 13 Robotics Research Arm Under Configuration Control Point of Contact: H.

Some of the important goals of this exploration are (1) the search for life and understanding of the evolution of the planet, (2) the discovery of accessible water, (3) understanding how the climate has changed, and (4) developing an inventory of useful resources precursor to further human exploration. While many useful scientific investigations can be done in situ on the surface of Mars, there seems to be agreement that the main scientific objectives of exploration can only be achieved with the return of samples to Earth for analysis. For example, Ref. 1 says: It has been the stated position of the Mars science community for some time that a Mars sample return mission is the highest priority science objective for Mars. Ref. 2 says in reference to in situ analysis: However, it must be recognized that these are lower priority goals, and that they cannot be allowed to compromise the primary objective of returning scientifically interesting samples from the surface of Mars. Ref. 1 also says: The first priority goal of intensively understanding the details of the diversity of local materials at the surface of Mars can best (and perhaps only) be addressed by a mission that carefully samples Martian materials and returns them intact to Earth for intensive, detailed analysis. However, a sample return mission from Mars is a very significant undertaking. Vigorous attempts are now being made to develop new programmatic approaches to lower the cost of such a mission, with an eye toward a potential return in 2005. NASA plans a series of nearer-term exploration missions involving landers which will provide important in situ data on Martian materials, but not as much as a sample return. These planned nearer-term affordable missions will be vital in solidifying capabilities for a series of evolving Mars missions with ever increasing capabilities. In formulating a program emphasis for the Mars Exploration Technology Program, we were guided by several important factors: A MSR mission appears to be of highest importance in the scientific exploration of Mars. Past MSR mission plans do not appear to be affordable, and although new concepts are now being explored to reduce cost, the need for new technology to reduce cost appears necessary for there to be a MSR mission. It is unlikely that there ever will be a MSR mission unless near and mid-term Mars surface exploration gets off to a strong and successful start to provide a foundation for an eventual MSR mission, and therefore the development of technology to strengthen these missions has very high priority. Return to menu Program Emphasis In view of the arguments presented in the previous section, it was decided that the thrust of this Technology Program will be divided between: developing technology which will contribute to enabling a MSR mission, and developing critical technologies for near-term and mid-term Mars lander projects. The choice of specific research topics for inclusion in this Technology Program is not a simple task. The NASA programmatic format for a future MSR mission will undoubtedly undergo a great deal of evolution over the next several years. At present, a system study led by Richard A. Wallace of JPL (Ref. 3) is exploring a number of possible alternate scenarios for a low cost MSR mission, and depending on the results of this study, the prioritization of various technologies for a MSR might be significantly altered. Although there is considerable previous literature on plans and needs for MSR missions, it is likely that funding limitations will dictate use of very different approaches than had been contemplated in the era 1970-1994. It is also difficult to prioritize technology for near-term and mid-term lander missions because the nature of these missions depends significantly on responses obtained from future requests for proposals. Also, there is not much time to develop technology for the first of these missions. However, the JPL Mars Exploration Office provided important analysis and advice in this regard. A number of generic needs were identified. These include a miniaturized telecommunications system, autonomous sample acquisition, in situ instruments, and various aspects of lander survivability and versatility, such as low temperature flight electronics, low temperature batteries and improved thermal control. Return to menu Program Content The Mars Exploration Program is planning a series of missions involving landers launched in 1998, 2001, and 2003, and a sample return mission (if feasible) in 2005. The technology addressed in this Mars Exploration Technology Program is divided in its intent to provide technology products in time for these various missions. The longest term task is In Situ Propellant Production (ISPP) which is aimed at the sample return mission in 2005, although a prototype demonstration system could conceivably fly as a technology demonstration on an earlier mission. All the other tasks in the Mars Exploration Technology Program are aimed at either the 1998 lander or the 2001 lander, although in some tasks, such as autonomous sampling and instrument deployment, it is intended to seek an evolutionary development plan. In terms of missions and timing, the various tasks are aimed at readiness on the time scales shown in Table 1. Return to menu Strategy The strategy of the Mars Exploration Technology (MET) Program is to place high priority on development of the core technologies for a sample return mission, while at the same time developing the most vital expected needs for near-term and mid-term lander missions. The program plan will follow a path toward demonstrating significant new technological capabilities at NASA Readiness Level ~5 to 6 in several years. At each yearly step along the way, it is planned to consistently integrate these technologies into laboratory prototypes to assure that they function together as systems. At intervals, these prototypes will be demonstrated in a more developed form to foster transfer to projects. Wherever possible, the near-term demonstrations will be configured in such a way as to serve needs for near-term lander missions. Thus, we will steer a course, always following a beacon representing the shortest path toward the longer term goals, but branching activities off from this path to provide shorter term needs wherever they are compatible.

This, in turn, requires familiarity with Mars mission plans, and in some cases, detailed analyses of the impact of technologies on the Mars missions. As program planning for a Mars Sample Return mission progresses outside this RTOP, it is anticipated to eventually establish technology readiness benchmarks to measure relative levels of technology readiness for the determined cost, mass, and reliability drivers in a Mars Sample Return mission. This will be combined with an approach to select and prioritize technologies for the duration of the program, as well as an investment return analysis to provide continuous feedback that we are not only =doing things right= but also =doing the right thing=. Return to menu Precision Landing Point of Contact: David L. Farless Viking Lander 2, Camera 1 Picture (21F243) So, you want to land on Mars? Mars landing site selection is based primarily on science objectives and landing safety but is complicated by the current inability to navigate to an actual landing location close to the desired location. Precision landing is an important and perhaps enabling capability for several future Mars missions because many interesting areas of scientific investigation on Mars are either small in extent or lie within regions of hazardous terrain (see for example the picture below). Also, precision landing may be crucial to Mars sample return scenarios in which a sample is left from a previous mission to be acquired by a return vehicle via a rover or a lander manipulator. This task will advance the state-of-the-art in specific precision landing technologies, building upon the work of others, and utilizing resources of other organizations wherever appropriate. For example, contacts have already been established with Johnson Space Center, Lockheed-Martin Company, Phillips Laboratory, and Draper Labs. These relationships will be continued and formalized as appropriate. LANDING ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT ILLUSTRATION Definition of Terms For purposes of this task, precision landing is defined as safely setting a craft down on the surface of Mars, next to a predetermined site, with some small error in position. This error is variable, dependent on specific mission requirements, but will be defined here to be less than 1 km. The reference to a predetermined site in this definition presumes an accurate landing, as well as a precise landing. That is, it is not sufficient to land precisely (using a high precision terminal descent system to avoid rocks and land softly with no horizontal drift) at an arbitrary location on Mars. The landing must be near a pre-defined target location. The Mars Landing Mission The Mars landing mission begins with launch and escape from the Earth onto a Sun-centered trajectory (heliocentric). The spacecraft travels about half way around the Sun while moving outward from the Sun. When it reaches the distance of Mars, it is moving slower than Mars so the planet overtakes it from behind. On arrival at Mars, the spacecraft may impact (i.e., land) directly or it may establish an orbit about Mars first, and then descend to land. This task is primarily concerned with the direct Mars landing mission because it is less complex and shorter in duration. However, the use of an orbital phase will be optional, and the development work done for each of the other mission phases will be largely applicable in the case of descent from orbit. The table below defines a set of mission phases for the Mars lander mission: Based on todays technology, as represented by the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Surveyor 98 lander mission designs, landing location errors can be more than 150 km. Most of this error derives from two sources: Navigation errors on the approach to Mars, and corruption of the trajectory during the entry phase by aerodynamic uncertainties. It is also in these two mission phases, the Planetary Approach Phase and the Atmospheric Entry Phase, where the control power exists to correct errors of this magnitude. In the subsequent mission phases, the Parachute Phase and the Terminal Descent Phase, landing location correction is very expensive in terms of landed mass, and so will be limited to a few km at best. Navigation on the Approach Phase of the interplanetary trajectory (the last 15 days before arrival), using current-technology Earth-based radio tracking, provides position errors at the entry point of 10-30 km (entry flight path angle error of 0.5-1.5 deg). These values are the navigation knowledge at 10-15 days before entry, where the final correction maneuver is traditionally performed. After this time, knowledge accuracy continues to improve slowly until the last few hours before entry, when it rapidly improves to about 3 km (0.15 deg entry angle error). Maneuvers late in the Approach Navigation Phase could convert these knowledge errors to control errors at entry. Another option for improving these errors is the use of optical navigation on the approach to Mars (imaging the Mars moons, Phobos and Deimos) and/or the use of new radiometric data types (e.g.; Differenced Doppler, multi-s/c tracking). These techniques could potentially reduce the entry error to the 3-km level earlier on the approach trajectory, perhaps as early as 2-4 days before entry. Even if the approach navigation were perfect, errors and unknowns in the atmosphere of Mars and in the aerodynamic behavior of the entry vehicle would corrupt the trajectory during the entry phase so that the landing point error would be on the order of 100 km. The actual error is highly dependent on the nominal entry angle (shallower entry angles lead to higher landed dispersions) and on the real (but unknown) variability in the atmosphere. The only way to correct these large errors is to provide active control of the trajectory during the Entry Phase of the mission. This can be done most effectively by the use of aerodynamic lift, modulated either by changing the pitch angle of the vehicle to change the magnitude of the lift vector or by rolling the vehicle to point the lift vector up, down, left, or right. Current Mars entry vehicle shapes (i.e., Pathfinder and Mars 1998) could generate a lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of only about 0.3. This may provide enough control authority to correct for atmospheric variations and small entry errors (i.e., the 3 km errors discussed above). To correct for the current approach navigation errors (i.e., 10-30 km), a higher L/D may be required, probably 0.8 or greater. This could be provided by a new technology entry shape (e.g., a symmetrical bi-conic). In either case, residual dispersions at the end of the entry phase are expected to be less than 10 km. At the conclusion of the Approach and Entry phases of the Mars landing mission, the lander is left at a position a few km above the surface, and a few km away from the intended landing location (distance and direction perhaps unknown), probably hanging on a parachute. To get from there to a safe landing near the target point, the lander will need to perform a propulsive Terminal Descent Phase, navigating to the desired landing site location. The (unknown) distance and direction to the target site at the initiation of the Terminal Descent Phase are primarily functions of the navigation and control errors of the previous mission phases, but will also include additional components from parachute drift in the local wind and from map-tie errors. (Map-tie errors are errors or uncertainties in connecting the local coordinate frame of the map identifying the landing site with the coordinate frame of the rotating globe defined in the approach and entry trajectory model.) Navigation to this target site requires a system to sense and measure the distance and direction to the target. The only reasonable systems for this measurement are on-board systems which sense and measure the local environment directly. For example, optical systems (cameras) could image the terrain below the lander at visible or infrared frequencies and process the image to compare it with stored map data and match the imaged terrain to a known map location. With a known location on a map which also contains the desired landing site location, the direction and distance to the site are known. The descent system will almost certainly include a radar altimeter as a requirement for soft landing. The available altitude measurement can be of significant help in solving the target recognition problem by providing a scale for the optical image. An imaging system like this could also provide hazard avoidance information late in the descent with some different image processing algorithm to look for smooth terrain. Landing Accuracy Improvement Strategy As part of the FY95 work accomplished to date, a strategy has been developed for improving the accuracy and precision of landings on Mars. This strategy is outlined below: The Approach and Entry Phase and the Parachute and Terminal Descent Phase can be considered as separate and distinct portions of the landing mission, with an interface at parachute deployment. That is, landed accuracy down to a few kilometers depends only on what happens in the Approach and Entry Phases, while landed accuracy below the level of a few km depends only on what happens in the Parachute and Terminal Descent Phases. For the Approach/Entry Phase, the goal is to reduce the position error at parachute deployment below the current value of ~ � 150 km. Reduction to � 50 km would be of use, but reduction to less than � 10 km is needed before precision landings can be accomplished. For the Terminal Descent Phase, the goal is to navigate over several km, correcting for; 1) errors at parachute deployment left over from the approach/entry phase, 2) wind-induced errors while on the parachute, and 3) map-tie errors. It is assumed that a propulsion system and radar altimeter are required, regardless of precision landing requirements, just to provide a soft landing with no horizontal motion. Both accuracy and precision in this phase require the ability to sense target-relative location and/or to sense hazards. The following chart illustrates this gradation in landed accuracy and how the application of specific technology advances can enable precision landing at Mars. FY 95 Milestones Quantify errors in landing site location and develop a strategy to reduce these errors. Determine approaches to error reduction through the use of technologies in on-board guidance, navigation and control, vehicle configuration, propulsive maneuverability, and remote sensing. Include approach navigation in this investigation. Evolve vehicle configuration from Mars 98 baseline. The study will compute: 1) the entry angle accuracy achievable from ground tracking versus on-board optical navigation; 2) aerodynamic error reduction using lifting body control; and 3) map-tie error reduction based local terrain navigation. The study will identify technologies that can be progressed to detailed computer simulations and selected hardware experiments and demonstrations in FY 96. Define potential opportunities for demonstration of technology in the 98 Lander mission (or possible Code X experiment). Focus on demonstrations of software only, with minimal effect on mission operations. FY 95 Level 1 Milestone Accomplishments Contributions to the error in landing site location from all mission phases have been quantified and assessed for the potential to contribute to improvement in the landing error. The current landing error is in the range from 100 km to 300 km, depending on mission specifics and environmental assumptions. The error resulting from the Approach Navigation Phase using standard Earth-based radio navigation is about 30 km in position (about 0.15 deg in flight path angle). This error could realistically be reduced by an order of magnitude by using optical navigation techniques in conjunction with radio navigation. However, subsequent corruption of the trajectory during the Atmospheric Entry Phase still leaves a landing error of from 50 km to 100 km. Active aerodynamic maneuvering during the Atmospheric Entry Phase may reduce this error to less than 10 km, but this is still to be demonstrated. A next-generation entry vehicle configuration with a lift-to-drag ratio of 1.1 was demonstrated to have the control authority to correct for expected atmospheric variability and the current radio-only approach navigation entry errors. Use of a low-lift Mars 98 entry vehicle configuration severely limits the control authority available for aerodynamic maneuvering and will require the use of optical approach navigation and less conservative assumptions about atmospheric variability to achieve an accuracy of less than 10 km. During the Parachute Phase an additional error of up to 2 km may be accumulated due to wind drift. There is no capability to control the trajectory in this Phase Reduction of these last few km of error will require the ability to navigate during the powered Terminal Descent Phase relative to the local terrain. Guidance and control errors in this phase are small, on the order of meters, so the final landing error will depend on the quality of the navigation information. This terminal navigation process will likely involve imaging of the surface for comparison with a terrain map stored on the lander. A landing accuracy improvement strategy has been developed and used to identify two areas of the Mars Landing Mission where development of new capabilities is necessary before a precision landing mission can be attempted. Autonomous aerodynamic maneuvering in the Entry Phase is found to be the only way to compensate for the large errors introduced in this phase, and autonomous acquisition and analysis of terrain-relative position data is needed to allow navigation during the powered Terminal Descent Phase. The two specific technologies identified for future work are: 1) control system design for active trajectory control in the Entry Phase and 2) terrain matching for terminal navigation using real-time visible light images. FY 95 Level 2 Milestone Accomplishment The Mars 98 lander mission and systems were examined for opportunities to demonstrate some aspects of precision landing technology. The only potential uncovered is in the Approach Navigation Phase where it may be possible to do independent ground processing of new radio data types to try to improve the approach trajectory knowledge error. The recent selection, as one of the lander science instruments, of a camera for terrain imaging during the Parachute and Terminal Descent Phases may open new opportunities. FY 96 Milestones Develop and demonstrate via computer simulation a six degree-of-freedom flight control system concept for autonomous aero-maneuvering for flight path control during the Entry Phase. This concept will use a low lift-to-drag ratio entry vehicle configuration, a nonlinear inversion control scheme, and state-of-the-art characteristics for on-board systems (i.e., sensors, attitude control, computers, etc.). The computer simulations will evaluate the control authority and terminal errors of this concept for a wide range of variations in the environment and in the initial state control and knowledge (i.e., Approach Navigation Phase errors). Develop and test techniques for terrain-matching of visible-light images of Mars-like terrain. Images of California desert terrain (Amboy Crater in the Mojave desert and Mars Hill, in Death Valley) are available from previous Mars landing studies and these data will be used to develop specific terrain-matching techniques to demonstrate the viability of the concept. Low-altitude images will be correlated to locations in high-altitude images with similar lighting conditions. The correlations will be performed autonomously in computer simulations. Algorithms which are successful in cases of similar lighting angles and look angles will then be tested for robustness with images at differing lighting and look angles. The computer power and time constants required for successful terrain-matching will be documented.WT01-B04-51IA080-000557-B035-64http://lmooradian.jpl.nasa.gov:80/ISPP.html 137.79.14.197 19970103071502 text/html 23030HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: MacHTTP/2.2Message-ID: Date: Friday, 03-Jan-97 07:19:56 GMTLast-Modified: Friday, 02-Aug-96 20:23:48 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 22785 ISPP In Situ Propellant Production (ISPP) Point of Contact: Donald Rapp Use of the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen propellant for a return trip to Earth can dramatically lower the mission payload and hence the cost and launch requirements of a Mars Sample Return mission. A figure of merit for this technology is the mass that must be launched in order to return a sample of any given weight and diversity of Mars materials to Earth. The degree to which In Situ Propellant Production (ISPP) reduces this mass is the main value of ISPP. There is also a less tangible value in that this use of ISPP provides a precursor to the more general need for In Situ Resource Utilization for human exploration. The total value must be pitted against the additional complexity and risk associated with use of ISPP, as well as the cost of developing and implementing ISPP. Various elements of prototype hardware to demonstrate these processes have been developed by several organizations, notably Lockheed Martin and the University of Arizona. The object now is to take these beginnings, and demonstrate that viable systems can be produced from them. Ultimately, these chemical conversion systems must be integrated and combined with storage/cryogenic systems, energy systems, and propulsion systems. The potential for ISPP to reduce the mass of a direct entry/direct return (DE/DR) MSR mission is significant, although the benefits will be mission-dependent, and proper account must be taken of the mass of the ISPP system including its power system. Whether the actual mass reduction will be enough to reduce the required launch vehicle size remains to be seen. Ultimately, other mass reduction steps may need to be taken in conjunction with ISPP in order to secure a significant reduction in launch vehicle size (and cost). ISPP will have to be made essentially self-regulating and autonomous, including the capability of dealing with off-design conditions. Nevertheless, ISPP is clearly the single step with by far, the greatest leverage for mass reduction of a DE/DR MSR mission, and on this ground should be pursued further. On the other hand, other approaches than a DE/DR mission, if developed and verified in space, may reduce the need for ISPP. However, schemes which depend on autonomous rendezvous, docking and sample transfer in heliocentric space with time delays is a very difficult technology that will require considerable further development and expensive verification in space. If they also depend on pinpoint landing, that adds another major element of risk to such an approach. Regardless of how vital ISPP will be for a 2005 MSR mission, ISPP is one of the technical cornerstones for human exploration of Mars and the Moon. Human exploration sources might provide additional funds to speed up development of ISPP. A typical Mars ISPP process includes many steps ranging from carrying propellant tanks to Mars surface, to compressing the Martian atmosphere, chemically converting CO2 to O2 and possibly a hydrocarbon propellant, compressing, cooling and liquefying product gases and storing in empty propellant tanks and lifting off using thrusters specifically designed for the propellants produced. There are two overall processes for ISPP which are the most mature. One process uses the Sabatier/Electrolysis (S/E) process, in which hydrogen (brought from Earth) is reacted with compressed CO2 in a heated chemical reactor: [1] CO2 + 4 H2 -----> CH4 + 2 H2O The methane so formed is collected and saved for use as a propellant. The water is collected, deionized, and electrolyzed in an electrolysis cell: [2] 2H2O + electricity ------> 2H2 + O2 The oxygen is saved for use as a propellant. Under support from this RTOP, the S/E process has been studied in some detail ("In Situ Propellant Production Demonstration," Final report, Report No. MCR-95-561, JPL Contract 960247, LMA, April 3, 1996) at a lab bench level. The great advantage of this process is that it is fairly well understood and seems to work well as a system. There do not seem to be any fundamental technological challenges ahead in further perfection of the conversion plant system, although a number of engineering improvements are necessary. There are two potential problems with the S/E process. One is that the process is fairly complex and requires a number of vessels and considerable plumbing, which could drive the mass up and increase system risk. The other, which appears to be more serious, is the requirement of bringing hydrogen from Earth. This is a potential mass/cost driver for a mission, and at this juncture, it is not clear how to transport and store hydrogen on Mars within acceptable mass and power limits. If the S/E process is to be developed to a flight system, it will be important to investigate hydrogen storage. The second process, typically known as the "zirconia approach," partially dissociates Martian CO2 and utilizes a solid state electrolyte (typically yttria-stabilized zirconia at ~ 900oC) to transport oxygen ions across a membrane in order to remove O2 from the partially dissociated mixture. This requires a suitable catalyst/electrode at the surface of the electrolyte to convert gaseous oxygen to oxygen ions. The great attraction of the zirconia process is the conceptual simplicity of the oxygen separation process and the potential for a compact cell. However, in practice, the tradition has been to rely on tubular ceramic cells for test purposes. These are not compact, and appear to be structurally flimsy and liable to failure under launch or landing loads. A new concept for combining planar fuel cell geometry with the use of rugged single crystal sheets of zirconia interspersed with platinum electrodes holds promise for simple, inexpensive, rugged zirconia assemblies. However, these must be proven by experiment. Other ISPP approaches have been proposed. These are under review. They include use of the Reverse Water Gas Shift reaction to enhance oxygen production, possible use of a gas discharge front-end for Zirconia, and possible use of diborane and carbon dioxide as propellants. The JPL Program Plan for ISPP Technology Development In developing ISPP, our goal is to demonstrate a viable technology in the form of a compact, flight-like unit which can be tested in a relevant environment, consistent with sample return programmatic objectives. 1st Year's Work Plan (April 1995 - April 1996): After reviewing the funding available and the state of the technology, it was decided that the following constraints would apply to the first year's work: initial work was concentrated on determining the performance characteristics and general viability of the S/E and Zirconia processes in laboratory bench scale prototypes. It was decided that when sufficient data become available to indicate with reasonable probability that at least one of these processes is indeed viable, the more attractive of these will be selected for demonstration as a compact, flight-like unit which can be tested in a relevant environment. Technology development on the interface technologies which tie directly to ISPP: (i) thermal and power management, (ii) compatibility with designs and configurations of descent and ascent vehicles, and (iii) gas pressurization, liquefaction and cryogenic storage, and (iv) compatibility with propulsion systems (gas-feed, and thruster performance) will follow after demonstration of compact, processing unit in later years. We will stay alert to new ideas in ISPP as they arise, but only as a distant secondary priority behind developing S/E or Zirconia to the demonstration stage (unless a new idea arrives which is so overwhelmingly attractive as to cause us to change this Plan). In the first year, the two competing processes (S/E and Zirconia) were developed over a 12 month period, having starting in April 1995, with a comprehensive review and decision point on April 3, 1996 as to how to proceed with further development (select one process, go with both in parallel, or start anew). This program began in January 1995, when requests were made to important players in the ISPP community to make proposals for research. Ten proposals were received. Two contracts were issued. One contract was issued to Lockheed-Martin to upgrade their S/E brassboard and carry out medium duration testing to assure that we understand its performance prior to building a compact end-to-end system. The other contract was issued to the University of Arizona to build a prototype multiple electrode zirconia cell system using flat plate (fuel cell) geometry with new approaches for seals and materials, and with an single crystal zirconia, which does not suffer from crumbling problems associated with ceramics. An all-metal system completely eliminated ceramics from the system. This system is intended to demonstrate that zirconia systems can be built rugged, resistant to thermal shock, and with adequate performance, as a precursor to a compact end-to-end system. Review of 1st Year's Accomplishments (April 1995 - April 1996): The following conclusions are based on a full day review of the two competing processes held at JPL April 3, 1996. Several unsettled major issues loom over any potential ISPP process, including the need for: a sorption pump for carbon dioxide acquisition which can function in the Mars environment on a diurnal cycle, acquiring carbon dioxide at night with atmospheric filtering, while remaining insulated during the day, integrable with reactor waste heat; all with acceptable power requirements liquefaction and cryo-storage of oxygen, and an adequate power system based on demonstrated long term performance of large solar arrays in the Mars environment. The Lockheed Martin development of the Sabatier/Water Electrolysis (S/E) process represents an outstanding achievement in terms of quality and quantity of progress made on a minimal budget. They have gone a long way toward demonstrating that an ISPP conversion system utilizing an S/E reactor and electrolyzer system is a viable process under controlled laboratory conditions. They have also made impressive progress in raising the conversion efficiency, hydrogen recovery, and automation and control of the process, as well as acquisition of carbon dioxide by a sorption pump. We also acknowledge the vital help received from Hamilton-Standard by Lockheed Martin, particularly in electrolysis unit, catalyst materials and in the hydrogen recovery pump. Hamilton-Standard has been a major contributor to this program. However, several critical issues specific to the S/E process remain: transport and long-term storage of hydrogen, definition and analysis of the operating modes on Mars including a materials inventory profile including tankage use, rate of production of water, storage of water, etc., procedures for start-up and shut-down, purging of lines and filters, and sensors and control system to handle off-design conditions liquefaction and cryo-storage of methane purity of gases produced. The University of Arizona development of a unique zirconia process reactor design is based on two very good ideas: single crystal zirconia and an all-metal rugged structure. This design approach is worth developing further. However, this concept will not work unless several fundamental problems are solved: a reliable method for applying Pt electrodes of desired thickness and porosity to single crystal zirconia a reliable method for providing uniform current density across an entire zirconia wafer (spoked electrodes, metal inserts, ...) a credible analysis to demonstrate reasonable gas flow and temperature uniformity in the various plena between cells a credible mechanical design for series connection of the cells which provides a context and configuration for the design of small experiments to verify issues 9, 10 and 11 above a comprehensive coupled electro/thermal/mass model must be developed which provides an understanding of the gas flows, heat flows and electrical current distribution in a cell, which provides a framework for defining acceptable gas inlets and outlets and current carrying elements attached to the wafers to achieve acceptable cell efficiency and reliability. Concomitant with this is a credible analysis of requirements for initial heating in the morning and time delays before processing can begin. Future work must deal directly with these problems as well as quantification of leak rates and sealing requirements, and further vibration and shock testing. The S/E chemical conversion system is clearly more mature than the zirconia chemical conversion system. However, we are still dubious about the S/E process as a system because it requires three cryogenic subsystems: methane, oxygen and hydrogen as opposed to zirconia which only requires oxygen there is no satisfactory definition and analysis of the operating modes on Mars including a materials and mass inventory profile of tankage use, rate of production of water, storage of water, etc., procedures for start-up and shut-down, purging of lines and filters, and controlling the system under off-design conditions, and separation of products need to be clarified of its general complexity and reliance on many valves and plumbing elements, as well as sensors and controls Financial constraints and programmatic imperatives toward a 2005 MSR launch dictate that the JPL ISPP Program should limit itself to only one process: S/E or zirconia; and at this stage the choice has been reluctantly made for zirconia. The S/E process has been demonstrated to be viable in a laboratory breadboard, but there remain deep-rooted concerns about the S/E process' need for hydrogen, the need to liquefy two propellants, the general complexity of the process, and uncertainties about the materials inventory profile of tankage use, rate of production of water, storage of water, etc. Although there have been significant problems in the initial development of the zirconia system, the ultimate potential product has great appeal because of its innate potential simplicity, compactness, ease of control, freedom from hydrogen, and lesser need for cryogenics. We have therefore opted for putting all of the program's 2nd year resources into a concerted effort to verify that a zirconia cell system is viable. Most of the testing of ISPP systems can be done on Earth in Mars simulation chambers. However, it is almost certain that some aspects of ISPP technology will need to be verified via a flight demonstration (probably on the 2001 Lander) through the sequence of transport to Mars, entry, landing and operation on the surface. The leading candidates for flight experiments or demonstrations are: either an experiment to characterize the dust environment for purposes of designing filters for intake into the sorption pump, or a direct demonstration of an atmospheric filter operating as the front end of a sorption pump for carbon dioxide acquisition a typical solar array element operating for extended periods in the Mars environment heat rejection measurements to characterize the ability of surfaces to exchange heat with the dusty Mars environment entry and landing accelerometer measurements These demonstrations can be done on a small scale, with minimal mass and power impacts on the Landers. It is hoped to find funds external to the RTOP to develop a flight package to demonstrate these capabilities on Mars. 2nd Year's Work Plan: A new design concept was received from Arizona for a modified approach to zirconia This was reviewed favorably by JPL engineers The design provides good gas flow, even voltage distribution and series connection of cells A new proposal was received from Arizona to build and test an improved version of the zirconia MOXCE device. It has been accepted. A plan to develop an improved sorption pump for CO2 acquisition was developed and is now being implemented through the contract process. ISPP Roadmap: In order for ISPP to be ready for use on a Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, a number of technical and systems issues must be addressed to a level of completeness and satisfaction that a hard-nosed project manager would be willing to rely on this technology for the successful completion of the mission. A critical decision would presumably be made around June 2002, 36 months before launch. Four phases of development and demonstration are described in Table I which must be achieved prior to acceptance for a 2005 MSR mission. Each phase should be essentially completed before investing in the next level. These four levels are spread across the time period June, 1996 to June 2002, providing six years for development and demonstration. With these assumptions, Table I shows the elements that can be funded from the combination of the JPL ISPP Task within the Mars Exploration RTOP plus HEDS funding of Row #5. The unshaded blocks represent tasks that require additional funding. Figure 1. RTOP and HEDS/Mars Project Funding for ISPP. Table I. Phased Development Showing Shaded Regions for those Elements Which Would be Funded by the JPL ISPP Task within the Mars Exploration RTOP plus HEDS funding of Row #5 Appendix I. How much leverage is there in an ISPP MSR mission? A crude estimation has been made of the mass of an ISPP version of the above Baseline MSR mission, assuming that oxygen only is produced by the Zirconia Electrolysis process and propane is brought from Earth. The mass saving compared to the baseline mission is 550 kg for the injected mass, or approximately 37%. Table A1-1. Masses (kg) of the sub-spacecraft estimated for an ISPP MSR mission as estimated by D. Rapp ** Need not be brought from Earth - made from Martian atmosphere Note that even a hypothetically perfect ISPP conversion system with zero mass cannot reduce the mass of the mission by more than roughly a factor of two because ascent propellants amount to less than half the total mass of the Baseline MSR mission. Therefore, the oft-discussed "leverage" of various ISPP processes is only of remote importance. Even if this ratio is infinity, the maximum possible leverage for the mission mass is less than a factor of two. On the other hand, roughly 600 kg of the ~1490 kg total mass of the Baseline MSR mission (see Table 2) is allocated to space storable propellants. The ISPP system reduces this in two ways (the higher Isp requires less propellant, and only ~20% of the propellants (propane) need be brought from Earth). The net result is that the total mass of the ISPP system and its concomitant power system and chemicals brought from Earth is only about 175kg, resulting in a saving of 432 kg. Furthermore, a ripple effect will reduce many other masses (structure, propulsion for Mars entry, parachutes, etc.) because one does not have to land all this propellant on Mars. This has been taken into account in the mass assessments, and saves about another 50 kg of dry mass and 70 kg of entry propellants, so that the total mass savings from ISPP is roughly 550 kg. Note that the guess of 40 kg for the ISPP power system is a wild guess, and may not be accurate at all. This estimate is based on the assumption that an ultra-lightweight inflatable array can be developed. Appendix II. Mars Scenario for ISPP The first step in any ISPP process is usually compression of the indigenous carbon dioxide from its natural pressure of roughly 7 millibars to roughly 1 bar. After that, chemical conversion may take place. It appears likely that radioactive thermal generators (RTGs) will not be permitted on future Mars landers and therefore the probable scenario for operation of the S/E process will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at night in cold sorbents, while the reactor is shut down. When the sun comes up, the initial available power is first used to pre-heat the sorption pump and generate high pressure (~1 bar) CO2. Then the reactor is pre-heated. Finally, power is used to operate the ISPP system and the cryo-coolers. At night, absorption of carbon dioxide is repeated, etc. This pump is a non-trivial part of an ISPP system, and is likely to require a canister perhaps 0.7 m high by 0.2 m in dia, weighing perhaps 10 kg. A significant portion of the heat required to produce high pressure gas could likely come from waste heat from the reactor. The Mars Lander would put the ISPP unit into operation and it would fellow this diurnal cycle for about 600 days, producing roughly 0.6 kg of oxygen every day. After this period, the positions of Mars and Earth would be right for ascent and return to Earth. By contrast, in the Baseline mission, the stay on Mars might be a relatively short period. Thus, the mission operations cost of an ISPP mission is bound to be considerably higher than the Baseline mission. However, it is possible that much exploration, science observation and sample gathering could be achieved in this 600 day period, resulting in a much bigger science payoff than would be possible with a short mission. In the simplest form of the Zirconia process, fuel (probably in the form of propane) is brought from Earth. The process produces only oxygen. Compressed Martian CO2 is introduced into a chamber heated to ~900oC where it is partly dissociated. A zirconia membrane coated with porous platinum on a wall of this chamber has a voltage applied to it, allowing oxygen to be conducted as ions across the membrane into an antechamber containing pure oxygen. The oxygen is cryo-cooled and stored. The design of the Mars Ascent Vehicle has significant impact on the value of any particular ISPP system, and vice versa. The staging of the Mars Ascent Vehicle, the sizing and positioning of the tankage, and the utilization of tankage for storage of chemicals and propulsion are all closely coupled to the ISPP system. An ISPP system cannot and should not be developed in isolation, but rather as a part of an overall program to develop a propulsion system for the MAV.

Schenker Sample acquisition is a significant part of any surface exploration project, whether it be in situ or sample return (ref. 25, 26). Ref. 1 discusses sampling requirements for a MSR. These requirements are summarized in Table 2. Even for a low cost sample return, careful sample selection will be necessary, and rocks are highly desirable, although constraints may be such that only loose soil and pebbles may be collected. In Ref. 1, size and power limitations were thought to preclude sawing or coring, and it was hoped that the need for unweathered rock would be answered by collecting pebbles and utilizing material from their interiors. However, the ability to chip or core during the sample collection process itself might still prove feasible, and could be of great scientific value. Furthermore, a mission concerned with water detection would probably concentrate on acquisition of sub-soil samples by drilling. It is possible that in order to reduce costs, future MSR planners may accept smaller samples, but the values given in Table 1 seem to represent a consensus of opinion of the minimum desired sample size. Note that Ref. 13 assumes a 5 kg sample on the grounds that the MESUR-based sample return study (conducted by Lockheed-Martin and JPL in 1993) determined that for any given sample, 100 grams of material is sufficient to correctly characterize the sample type. However, they recommend 5 kg as a reasonable starting point for the total sample set in order to carry out needed analyses on a range of samples. In Ref. 1, it was conjectured that a scoop mounted on a one degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm at the front of a mini-rover should be sufficient to obtain samples of both pebbles and regolith. Samples would be stored in a carousel assembly in the Lander, consisting of three carousels stacked vertically. Prior to taking a sample, a can is placed on the rover by a mechanism on the lander. Sampling takes place on the rover, the forward motion of which scoops material into the can. Cans are retrieved and sealed by the Lander. It is difficult to know how appropriate this scenario from Ref. 1 will be for use in a future MSR mission. Questions remain as to how much intervention and selection will be made by operators from Earth, and whether we will be able to afford a rover. All samples might be taken directly by a Lander, using various Lander-based robotic mechanisms and controls to selectively sample both the near surface area and sub-surface strata of the landing site. Thus, the Lander-based phase of the scenario, e.g. sample acquisition and transfer to the Lander, sample preparation, in situ analysis and packaging (for a potential sample return) all need further elucidation, and are a central focus of this program. Because these capabilities are important whether or not a rover operates in conjunction with the Lander, we give them priority in our program planning, both as to earlier development and relative technology emphasis. Sampling requirements for the 1998 and 2001 Lander missions are also somewhat unclear. Thirty-six of the 64 potential Mars surface instruments would require horizontal deployment on the surface, with roughly 2/3 of these requiring deployment distances of � 1 m, and about 1/3 requiring deployment distances of 1 to 10 m. Two instruments need deployment distances greater than 10 m (Ref. 15). Some instruments require vertical deployment with a mast or balloon. Thirty-nine instruments require bringing a sample back to the instrument. Of these, 17 required soil, 11 rock, 7 unweathered rock, 2 duricrust and 2 required ice. Surface manipulators to acquire these samples were suggested as scoops, soil cores, trenchers, chippers, augers and drills. It seems highly desirable to develop a limited sampling capability which might be applicable to the 1998 mission (as a prelude to more capable sampling systems on future missions), which emphasizes mass and power reduction, and allows for maximal flexibility for sample selection. Based on this mission perspective, the starting assumptions for Sample Acquisition/Evaluation Testbed (SA/ET) technology work of the program are: Initial sampling capability development within this program will be Lander based; rover based sampling is being developed in a complementary Rover Technology Program also supportive of the Mars Exploration Program. The Lander will have a capability to examine its surroundings, either by remote near-field observation, or by applying a probe on a sampling arm to nearby soil and rocks.). Operators on Earth may make limited selections of areas for taking samples, by visually designating areas/objects of science interest about the Lander. Mechanisms deployed by the Lander will take samples, by limited degree-of-freedom manipulation of a robot arm in the near field, or possibly by coring below the lander site. Use of a robotic arm will initially emphasize grasping and scooping, and evolve to probing and actively controlled sample extraction (e.g., core-drill, chip, scrape). The sampling system for an in situ project will be similar to that for a sample return project, the difference being that in the former case, samples are analyzed with instruments on the Lander, while in the latter case, samples are processed and loaded into cans in a carousel and transferred to a sample return capsule. It is desirable to have an evolutionary program which can contribute increasingly more capable sampling technology to a succession of landers, leading eventually to a sample return mission. Specifically, this program will develop capabilities in the following sampling technology areas: visual user interfaces and work site calibration for the operators sample selection efficient control of robotic motions during sampling (free-space, guarded, and contact) including power and energy conservation/management sensor processing/perception for robot guidance, sample acquisition and analysis robot control behavior for robust autonomy in response to real-time sensor data control architecture integrating sensor and knowledge-driven sampling activities These advances will be coordinated with a parallel RTOP task entitled Lander Manipulators under the Telerobotics Program, which will design, fabricate, and test the mechanical structures (joints, actuators, links, end-effectors, etc.) needed to be controlled by the systems developed in this RTOP. The combined effort will lead to demonstration of Lander-based sample acquisition/evaluation approaches which include: autonomous acquisition of samples from random locations about the Lander operator-designated acquisition of samples from areas and objects of interest coring of samples from selective strata beneath the Lander site transfer of robotically acquired samples to Lander for sample analysis or return automated sample preparation and in situ analysis within the module coordination of the previous activities with rover sample acquisition The goal of this task is strategically coordinated advances in robotic mechanization, controls, and perception to enable Mars surface/sub-surface sampling in the near field of a miniature lander. This work will be carried out in mutually beneficial cooperation with manipulator technology developments of the NASA Code X Telerobotics Program. Specifically, the Mars Exploration Technology Program will emphasize perception and control functions for robust lander-based sampling operations and intelligent in situ sample analysis, while the Telerobotics Program will innovate sample acquisition devices consistent with the mass, power, volume, and cost constraints of Mars Surveyor-class science packages. The focus of the task is on mid-term Mars Surveyor science goals--the Mars 2001 Lander is representative, with evolution to Mars Sample Return a longer range task technology objective. R&D partnerships with the science community, NASA and outside, will be important to foster coherent sampling concepts, flight robotics technology insertion, and coupling to NASA strategic goals of cost-effective small-scale technologies. This task will therefore include strategic outside partnerships for in situ robotic science, for example coordinated robotic sample acquisition and spectroscopic sample analysis, with increasing miniaturization, autonomy, and data efficiency. There is an immediate opportunity to influence and perhaps contribute to Mars 1998 Lander science capabilities. Specifically, this task is making an accelerated effort in FY95 to define a relevant robotic sample acquisition subsystem for 1998 flight science integration. Progress in this work will be demonstrated through mid-FY95 laboratory technology concept demonstrations, broad communication of these capabilities to the Mars Science Working Group, and potential teaming relationships with interested science investigators for proposals into the $20M Mars 1998 Science AO package (this last effort to be conducted under separate funding). Consistent with primary funding goals of this task, the subject work will evolve to FY95-end new technology results in such areas as power-optimal sampling control strategies and volume-and-mass efficient deployable manipulator designs. The planned task developments in terms of yearly Level 1 Milestones are: FY95 Milestones Develop and demonstrate proof-of-concept for lander-based robotic sampling. Specifically, demonstrate capability for a robotic arm to reach out from a simulated lander platform to known near-field locations, scan and acquire samples of interest, and deposit a sample to a pre-specified lander location. The subject manipulator and controls development will provide a laboratory concept 3-d.o.f. serial arm of 2 meter (deployed) length--extensible to a replica flight implementation at 3.5 kg mass, 1.5 kg full extent payload, and 15x15x40 cubic-cm stowed volume. As a derived product of this work, JPL proposed a robotic arm payload for the Mars 1998 Science AO (D. Paige, PI, UCLA/Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor) and was selected. In the context of lander-based sampling, demonstrate flight-relevant innovations in control of the manipulator trajectories and sensor-referenced automated behaviors, with respective operations goals of minimizing power utilization for a given sampling objective and autonomously verifying task status & sampling system health during same. FY 96 Milestones In FY'95, the 3-d.o.f. Mars robotic arm prototype was operated under open loop control -- moving in free space, into abrupt contact, and through simulated soil/rocks based on programmed position controls only. During FY'96, we will develop capabilities for sensor-based dexterous manipulation in closed-loop position and force. This will enable such important science functions as commanding of the arm to an exact, operator designated location in the near field, a precision proximity camera scan of a sample surface, force-controlled emplacement of instruments and probes, and closed-loop position/force behaviors for trenching, sample grasp, and manipulation (e.g., flipping a rock over). We will comparatively benchmark these new control-and-perception paradigms against FY'95 capabilities, using planned Mars Surveyor '98 lander task activities as reference studies. Demonstrate capability of the lander-based sampling manipulator to autonomously place a simulated science sensor adjacent to an operator-selected location/object in the near field, thereby enabling a scan of immediate surroundings for information of geologic interest. Develop, with science partners, lander-based Mars geological sample processing, utilizing an onboard instrument in-situ preparation-and-analysis of a simulated surface sample, e.g. material characterization by imaging spectroscopy. Develop perceptual and algorithmic concepts for the lander-based intelligent automation of sample analysis, motivated by goals of down-link data compression and on-board science sample prioritization (extracting primary syntactic and semantic features of the sample data and ranking/classifying these relative to a particular training set or science-user defined attributes). Demonstrate this basic approach for discrimination and identification of basic Mars surface substrate materials by their characteristic visible and near-IR imaging spectra features. FY 97 Milestones Develop an appropriate mechanization and sensor-referenced controls to enable sub-surface lander-based sampling up to depths of 1 meter in simulated Mars environments. Demonstrate retrieval of this sub-surface strata to a lander-based analysis, autonomously carrying out the sample acquisition, preparation, preliminary on-board analysis, and packaging (for hypothesized Mars sample return). Develop and demonstrate an opportunistic science capability wherein a sensor of practical interest, used in coordination with thematic data obtained by a lander-mounted camera(s)/instrumentation, and carried by a lander-based robotic mechanism, scans the lander near-field proximity for objects of geologic interest, cataloguing its results (A science user will designate lander areas/objects of broad interest, and scanning will proceed semi-autonomously). Develop and demonstrate sci-boom: a laboratory proof of concept for lander-based robotic science under extreme mass/volume/power/ cost constraints. This device concept is a telescopically-deployed (and prismatically-driven) mechanism that will carry integral end-of-arm microscopic viewing and point image spectroscopy sensors, and allow return of small quantity soil samples from at least a hemisphere of the lander near field (flight targets: 3 meter reach, 1 kg mass, 3 watts power utilization, 10 cubic-cm sample volume, and 1M$). Demonstrate and benchmark experiments for lander-based robotic science with on-board intelligent data analysis and compression. In this work, the goal is to evaluate science value and engineering efficiency of down-linking full, versus featurally-compressed sample data for a science instrument of major interest. Several different algorithmic approaches will be illustrated (drawn from statistical/fuzzy/heuristic decision criteria). The comparative accuracy and confidence of science sample analysis will be assessed, contrasting science users ability to achieve their goals using full versus compressed data sets. These experiments will be carried out as actual laboratory-simulated operations of a Mars science scenario, utilizing a lander-based robotic arm to retrieve user-designated blind samples from the near field. One candidate instrument is an on-board imaging spectrometer, and others will be utilized as science interest provides and motivates. FY 98 Milestones Demonstrate generalized sampling operations wherein lander-based robotic mechanization (utilizing various and possibly exchangeable end-effector tooling/sensors), science instrumentation, and hierarchically structured on-board controls enable autonomous near-field scanning, multi-mode sample acquisition (viz., scrape, chip, drill), and in situ characterization/discrimination as to relative science value. Based on this generalized sampling subsystem, show an automation capability to intelligently coordinate, prioritize and sequence a further set of opportunistic behaviors for high-yield, diversified in situ science. For example, if the initial scan of a nearby object is perceived interesting, then appropriately codified actions will be taken by the lander subsystem as might a field geologist performing analogous knowledge-based rudimentary analysis. Supporting these advanced control capabilities, develop advanced machine perception functions to provide required robustness. Specifically: 1) computationally efficient means of visually localizing and servo in manipulator end-point trajectories to objects of interest; 2) visual and proximity sensing sufficient to verify in real-time sequence the action/success relative to a sampling objective (confirmed: the-designated-rock-is-grasped); 3) machine learning whereby a science user can interactively teach a set of basic sample acquisition primitives/behaviors for later semi-autonomous on-board execution FY 99 Milestones Demonstrate a lander-based robotic sample acquisition subsystem operating in flexible autonomy with a nearby micro-rover. The basic scenario will be an initial visual mapping of the lander surround for science values of general interest (including any areas of explicitly designated by a science user), followed independent robot and rover collection/analysis of representative samples in the near and far field. Based on this initial determination of area science values, lander-based sampling (and on-board analysis) and micro-rover will coordinate their further control and perception for strategic area sample acquisition, processing, characterization, and packaging. Such scenarios may include deployment and collection of data from science instruments, sample hand-off from rover to robot, robot end-of-arm scans of rover-delivered specimens, etc. The general goal is to have this scenario proceed under high-level automation with temporal efficiency, achieving field geologist-like flexibility of sample collection and assessment.

The search for water (when, where, form and amount) acts as the common thread for three thrusts. In situ instruments have been identified as an important need by the Mars Exploration Office. A search was made of potential instruments (Ref. 15). With this great emphasis on water, it was decided to develop an instrument uniquely capable of detecting and characterizing water in different states, a miniature Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (Ref. 21). Resonance instruments work on the principle that a magnetic field is applied to the sample, thus splitting the energy levels of either the nuclear or electronic spin states, and then energy is pumped into the states. Measurement is made of either the energy absorbed, or the re-emitted energy as a function of wavelength. Characteristic spectra reveal the composition of the sample. The advantages of magnetic resonance techniques are that samples are tested under ambient conditions minimal preparation or disruption of samples (gram to milligram) analysis is not confounded by sample matrix the spectrum is molecule-specific. The special features of Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) are that it can detect: presence of water in soil, minerals, rocks free water in pores adsorbed water on surfaces chemically bound water The special features of EPR are that it can detect: nature of oxidant in Martian soil oxidation state of paramagnetic ions in soil (mineralogy) characterization of volatiles (carbonates, sulfates) radicals in icy samples (characterization at impurity level) organics in subsoil Laboratory instruments use cw (change of impedance) or pulsed mode (observe re-emitted radiation). These instruments use large electromagnets to apply the magnetic field. For a space instrument, a miniature permanent magnet system would be used (Ref. 24). The scanning method would depend on the application. Scanning at fixed magnetic field with variable frequency is relatively easy for NMR because circuitry to scan rf radiation is readily available. On the other hand, EPR requires scanning at microwave frequencies and this poses much more of a challenge. A goal of this task is to exploit prototype instrument probe systems for preliminary in-situ characterization of Martian surface chemistry, and to support the sample selection, and site selection objectives of this Task. The goal is to utilize innovative new technology in an external detection mode, which does not require separate sampling procedure for analysis. Since the search for water has been chosen as the theme for Mars exploration, initial emphasis in our program is on building and testing of a miniature Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (MRS) with combined capabilities of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). Conventional NMR and EPR systems in the laboratory employ very large, heavy electromagnets and sweep the magnetic field to observe spectra. We plan to achieve miniaturization by using small permanent magnets, and use a tunable RF cavity to achieve a frequency sweep. It is projected that mass reduction of several hundred to one will be possible. This would provide a non-invasive analytical technique with a unique combination of capabilities such as detection of water, characterization of volatiles, active oxygen species, oxidation states of paramagnetic ions, and detection of possible organics from soil, minerals and rocks. All probes will be made compatible with the mechanisms and control systems developed under the SA/ET Task. The investigator under this task will also provide the team with insight into science needs for Mars surface missions. P-46173 Cd FY95 Accomplishments The miniature Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer is being developed as a lander micro-instrument for the detection of water in the soil, minerals and rocks on Martian surface. NMR can characterize different forms of water in the sample, such as adsorbed water (e.g., soil or clay), or chemically bound water in minerals (e.g., gypsum). The analyses will be quantitative and require no modification of the sample. Typical sample size is 0.1 - 1 gram. The picture shows the essential components of NMR; sample coil (probe), electronic detection and processing circuit, and the permanent magnet (Halbach). Depending on mission requirements, such components can be deployed in several configurations as a penetrator, a lander or a rover sensor element. It will be a compact, light weight (about 400 gram), low power (<0.5 W) instrument. In FY'95, we have developed miniature NMR electronics for two configurations, one which requires a sample to be placed inside the coil (conventional NMR) as shown in the first picture titled, "Digital Surface Mount NMR," and the other which can detect water externally by merely placing the NMR sensor over the sample surface (Inside-Out NMR." The Inside-Out NMR circuit was tested with a laboratory electromagnet. We obtained NMR spectra of adsorbed water in a clay sample as shown in the third picture. Variation of the spectral intensity is shown, as expected, the NMR intensity decreases as the spacing between the sensor coil and the sample is increased. FY96 Milestones Demonstrate a permanent magnet assembly to generate the Inside-Out field configuration for the miniature NMR spectrometer probe. Demonstrate integration of the miniature NMR electronic circuit with the permanent magnet assembly, and optimize for best performance as a system (target sensitivity, about 2 wt% H2O). Design and fabricate a wideband mirowave sensor (scan range of 0.5 GHz - 5 GHz) for a miniature Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer. FY 97 Milestones Microwave Antenna Technology for Geologic and Volatile Sample Detection. Build and test a microwave antenna for an EPR spectrometer and an EPR signal processing circuit with a solid state microwave source and demonstrate functionality of microwave antenna and EPR signal processing circuit using a laboratory electromagnet. Demonstrate integration of miniature antenna, miniature magnet assembly and EPR electronics and optimize for best performance as a system using standard and geologic samples (ppm level). EPR will detect the presence of other volatiles in the form of: carbonates and sulfates; active oxygen species; oxidation states of paramagnetic ions for characterization of mineralogy. FY98 Milestones NMR/EPR Probe Integrated with Sample Acquisition System. Demonstrate an integrated NMR and EPR probe with supporting electronics for use in the sample acquisition system developed under SA/ET.

The approach to survivable electronics will be to develop models for the physical processes that cause failure under thermal cycling, and to verify these through test. This will allow us to assess the survivability of present designs under various thermal stresses, as well as to propose alternative designs for high density flight electronics that avoid these failure modes. This task will produce specific designs, including materials, for high density electronics that will survive on Mars or in other extreme temperature environments. Existing design/material combinations for high density electronics are being evaluated using a probabilistic physics of failure methodology to provide a point of departure from which to define new configurations that will survive in extreme temperature environments. An integral part of this effort is pioneering work in the characterization and modeling of failure mechanisms of high density electronics hardware. Miniaturized flight electronics are needed which can operate on the surface of Mars. Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs) are under development for warm electronics which will offer significant reductions in size and weight. There are two questions: (1) Will these electronic packages survive and function on the surface of Mars, and if not, (2) how can their design be modified to make them survivable. Conventional approaches to evaluating and controlling failure risk of electronic components are not effective for critical failure modes of Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs). It is not possible, by testing alone, to verify acceptable low failure risk for critical damage-accumulation failure modes that are indigenous to MCMs. However, failure risk due to damage-accumulation failure modes can be effectively evaluated and controlled using a Probabilistic Physics of Failure (P2oF) approach that incorporates both testing and analytical modeling based on fundamental analyses of the physics and mechanics of failure mechanisms. In P2oF, probabilistic models based on the physics of failure phenomena provide a framework for incorporating information from materials and component testing, inspection (NDE/NDI), and environmental characterization, even when such information is vague, approximate, sparse, or uncertain. MCM-D technology appears to be the most promising high density packaging technology for space applications, and it is being developed by a number of manufacturers, primarily for warm electronics applications. This technology takes several forms, such as metal/polymer based packages, and n-Chip (Al/SiO2 layered substrate). This will provide the starting point for our work. MCM-D multi-chip module packaging technology will be evaluated to determine probabilities of failure when subjected to thermal cycling characteristic of the Mars surface, and specific failure modes and associated design aspects will be identified. The probabilities of failure will be determined as a function of the thermal variations to which the electronics are subjected. In the unlikely event that it will be found that the electronics (designed for warm environments) will function adequately in the Mars environment, nothing further need be done. In the more likely event that the probability of failure is too high to be acceptable, we will do two things: (i) Specify the maximum allowable range of thermal variation (as achieved by advanced thermal control) to meet adequate standards of reliability. (ii) Specify specific design changes in the multi-chip module packaging technology which will eliminate or significantly reduce the probability of major failure modes, thus significantly improving reliability in a Mars-like environment. FY 95 Achievements The major achievements of the task, "Low Temperature Survivability of High Density Electronics," during FY'95 were 1) the development of a general method for evaluating life of high density electronics packaging (HDEP) subjected to severe thermal cycling and 2) the application of that methodology to characterize stress and evaluate fatigue life of aluminum/silicon dioxide HDEP structures. This thin film fatigue life evaluation method includes stress characterization by means of finite element modeling which incorporates x-ray rocking curve stress measurements. In this method, a fatigue life simulation is carried out using a probabilistic fracture mechanics model which can consider average temperature, thermal cycle amplitude, geometry, material fracture mechanics properties, initial flaw size, and uncertainties about values of governing parameters and accuracy of stress and flaw growth models. The probabilistic approach enables sensitivity analyses to be performed to identify the most important service life and failure risk drivers, so that development work can be focused more effectively to achieve life goals. The initial results of stress characterization and fatigue life simulation for the aluminum/silicon dioxide HDEP structure indicate that high residual stresses in the aluminum interconnect lines coupled with stress cycling due to thermal cycles drive the propagation of small initial flaws that result from void formation during stress relaxation and from manufacturing defects. Design or manufacturing process changes that may improve thermal cycling fatigue life will be investigated in the ongoing work. FY96 Milestones In FY'96, other materials and designs will be evaluated for use in extreme thermal environments. This work will be focused on the investigation of the thermal cycling fatigue life of HDEP structures using copper/polymer substrate technology. The evaluation of copper/polymer substrate technology will be conducted in a collaborative effort among Caltech/JPL, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, and Auburn University. FY97 Milestones Develop probabilistic life prediction model for metal/polymer substrates based on the physics of low temperature failure mechanisms and processes characterized in FY96. Validate the metal/polymer physics-of-failure models in collaboration with industry. Formulate analysis procedure for evaluating life and failure risk of electronic systems containing multiple high density electronic modules, based on P2oF model output. FY98 Milestones Specify the thermal cycling limits that are required for present metal/polymer based MCM-D designs to survive on Mars. Define design sensitivities of metal/polymer based MCM-D substrates using the P2oF model that includes substrate characterizations. Based on sensitivity analysis results, develop a recommended metal/polymer substrate design(s) for survival on Mars. FY99 Milestones Evaluate alternative MCM-D technologies to identify those best suited for low-temperature survival. Assess life and failure risk of electronic systems consisting of multiple MCM-D units, based on aggregation of P2oF model results. Transfer to industry the technology and tools for design evaluation and life prediction of high density electronic packaging technology, including probabilistic physics-of-failure models.

Most electronics developed for Earth application require operating temperatures in the range 233 Kelvin to 313 Kelvin, and limits for survival in extreme temperatures. While it is hoped that some day, special electronics will be developed which can survive low temperatures and possibly even operate at low temperatures, the continuing pressure to drive costs down on space missions usually implies that low-cost standard electronics developed for room temperature operation will be employed on future Mars Landers. We are working on the development of technology for low-temperature survivable electronics in a companion task in this RTOP. In addition, other components, particularly batteries lose performance as the temperature is lowered, and eventually become non-operable at very low temperatures. Therefore, protecting electronics, batteries and other components from the low temperature Martian night environment is a critical need of Mars Lander missions. Future Mars Landers are expected to draw their power from photovoltaic (PV) arrays. As a result, significant power will only be available during sunlit hours. While batteries can be used to provide minimal power over night, the power they can supply is limited, and furthermore, they must be protected from very low temperatures at night. It is exactly when temperatures are lowest that the least power is available for heaters to maintain the warmth of key components In order to cope with this problem, the Mars Pathfinder and 98 Lander missions will house electronics and batteries within enclosures which are very effectively insulated, and which contain Radioisotope Heating Units (RHUs) which produce a considerable amount of heat for their mass (~ 1 W per 50 g). Because mass is always very scarce, lightweight enclosures have been developed using ultra-efficient insulation (Ref. 27). However RHUs are no longer being produced and the 98 Mars Lander will have to depend on left-over spare RHUs from the Cassini mission. It is expected that RHUs will probably not be available for Mars missions after the 1998 launch. Without RHUs to provide heat overnight, such warm electronics enclosures will go through very wide temperature swings during the diurnal cycle, despite the excellent warm electronics box (WEB) design developed by the Mars Pathfinder Program at JPL. Therefore, post-1998 Mars Landers face a potential crisis in thermal control. Based on recent modeling conducted under this RTOP, it is believed that the best way to provide thermal control in the absence of RHUs is to employ a scheme whereby heat is collected and stored during the day when the sun shines, and the heat is released at night to significantly reduce the diurnal temperature variation in an electronics/battery enclosure. There is a ready source of heat during the day because the photovoltaic arrays associated with the lander generally operate above ambient temperature, and the structural members (frames or supports) for these PV arrays may be regarded as a substantial heat source for needs during the day. Heat can be stored efficiently in phase-change material (PCM), a material that undergoes repeated cycles of melting and resolidification when thermally cycled above and below its melting point. Dodecane, with its melting point of about 263K, is an obvious choice for our application. Heat can be transported from the PV arrays to the PCM within the enclosure by means of miniature heat pipes filled with a working fluid such as butane or propylene. However, even though use of PCM is a very appealing approach on paper, the application of PCM for heat storage has been problematic for several reasons. One is that it is necessary to supply and remove heat from all parts of the PCM, and this in turn requires good conduction heat transfer within the bulk of the PCM. Secondly, there is always a significant change in volume when a material melts or solidifies, and if the voids left by a previous solidification are not uniformly distributed, large stresses can build up locally upon subsequent melting if no voids are available to a region of PCM to accommodate the resulting volume change. Thirdly, many materials tend to supercool below their melting points without solidification, unless nodes are present as nucleation sites to serve as solidification starting points. Figure 1 The PCM composite materials are being developed by ESLI (A small business in San Diego) with SBIR funding, sponsored by the United States Air Force (Air Force Material Command, Phillips Laboratory, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico 87117-5777; Point of Contact: Marko Stoyanof, tel. 505-846-0775; Phase 1 Contract Number F29601-95-C-0098). ESLI has developed a unique material which appears to overcome these three problems to using PCM as thermal capacitors. It involves a network of high thermal conductivity carbon fibers (flocks) which occupy perhaps only 5% of a volume, as shown in Figure 1. PCM is poured in to this matrix, which holds the PCM with capillary forces. Heat transfer throughout the PCM region is rapid due to the network of carbon fibers. Voids tend to collect at fiber tips and thus get distributed fairly uniformly throughout the bulk of the PCM. Furthermore, the fibers also act as nucleation points for solidification, thus reducing supercooling. This material is used to fabricate the MET warm electronics enclosure, as shown in Figure 2, for a highly efficient PCM heat storage. Figure 3 The initial effort in thermal control is to demonstrate the viability of a warm electronics/battery enclosure (WEE) using a PCM thermal capacitor, and including a diode heat pipe. We will also attempt to use similar technology for energy saving in ISRU systems. FY 95 Accomplishments For missions to Mars without the use of Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs), analysis of the MFEX Rover Warm Electronics Box (WEB) design showed that the aerogel only insulation design would not be adequate. Analysis showed that the integration of Phase Change Material (PCM) panels with the aerogel insulation would meet the thermal requirements for diverse future Mars missions, including microrovers and power limited landers. Carbon fiber flock PCM panels were developed and thermally cycled to show PCM panel concepts robustness. Miniature diode heat pipes were incorporated into the PCM panels and shown to have a high thermal efficiency. Designed and fabricated PCM panels into a Warm Electronic Enclosure (WEE) with foam insulation. The WEE was tested at both 1 atmosphere pressure and 10 torr ambient pressure for 3 diurnal temperature cycles (- 80 degrees to 0 degrees C) representative of the Mars Pathfinder landing site. During the 10 torr testing, the WEE maintained the interior temperatures within -10 to +20 degrees C for a 72 W-hr heater power duty and within -25 to -3 degrees C for a 57.6 W-hr heater power duty load. FY96 Milestones Further demonstrate Martian diurnal thermal cycle performance of a simple generic WEE structure incorporating improved aerogel/composite insulation, PCM energy storage capability at ~ 270 K and miniature diode heat pipes. Optimize the design of composite PCM panels for thermal enclosures. Demonstrate improved mechanical performance while improving thermal performance by increasing PCM mass fraction and reducing structural mass. Demonstrate a design for more realistic brassboard WEE's which provide thermal control during simulated earth operations, during simulated cruise, and after simulated landing on Mars. Design and build a brassboard WEE with application either for a Microrover or for use on a lander such as the Mars 98 or Mars 01 landers and evaluate its performance. FY97 Milestones Perform long-term thermal cycling tests on realistic brassboard WEE's which provide thermal control during simulated earth operations, simulated cruise, and after simulated landing on Mars; one for use on a microrover, and the other for use on a lander. Test in a vacuum and in a simulated Mars environment to ascertain creep, possible degradation in thermal performance, and structural load carrying capability. Characterize observations and document findings. Demonstrate significantly improved performance of the realistic brassboard WEE's compared to the present state-of-the-art WEB which do not include RHUs. Accomplishments During the FY'95, ESLI completed fabrication of a 6-inch side PCM (Dodecane) composite panels, and one special panel containing the Butane DHP. Approximately 100 deep thermal cycling tests (-50 degrees C to +30 degrees C) were conducted on PCM panels, and 15 cycles on the DHP panel to assure that these performed as expected and were mechanically reliable . A warm electronic enclosure (WEE) was then made by joining these panels and was fully instrumented with heaters and thermocouples and insulated with a 1-inch thick Rohacell insulation all around to undergo three deep thermal cycles at 1 atmosphere pressure, and approximating the Mars thermal environment. The heater power (0 to 5 W ) was adjusted to mimic a typical payload duty cycle. The warm electronic enclosure performed as expected by demonstrating that test results were repeatable as per design specifications. They fully instrumented WEE assembly was then delivered to JPL for subsequent thermal vacuum tests. Figure 4 Figure 5 The WEE was tested at JPL in simulated 10-Torr Mars environment. The WEE consisted of a 6-inch cubical box that included 5 Dodecane PCM panels and one Dodecane PCM panel with integrated butane diode heat pipe from Energy Sciences Laboratory (ESLI). These panels were enclosed within a 1-inch thick Rohacell foam insulated box, as shown in Figure 5. The test consisted of evaluating the performance of the WEE and a reference thermal foam enclosure through three diurnal thermal cycles with heating applied to a simulated electronics mass to mimic a typical payload duty cycle. Two duty cycles were evaluated, 8 watts maximum and 6.4 Watts maximum, for total heating of 72 W-hrs and 57.6 W-hrs. The test showed reproducible phase transitions and maintained interior test temperatures within +20 degrees C and -25 degrees C. These tests have demonstrated that the proposed WEE thermal control design is feasible. Figure 6 Finite element models (FEM) have been developed to perform transient thermal analyses of the WEE. The models are well suited for investigating moving phase fronts, and for studying optimization of PCM mass, as shown in Figure 6.Return to menu WT01-B04-56IA080-000557-B035-156http://lmooradian.jpl.nasa.gov:80/Hiplotb.html 137.79.14.197 19970103071610 text/html 9156HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: MacHTTP/2.2Message-ID: Date: Friday, 03-Jan-97 07:21:12 GMTLast-Modified: Saturday, 03-Aug-96 00:10:34 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 8910 Hi Perf, Lo Temp Bat High Performance, Low Temperature Batteries Points of Contact: S. Surampudi, Chen-Kuo Huang, and M. Smart The major goal of this program is to develop advanced batteries for future Mars Exploration Missions. Mars Exploratory Missions can be broadly classified into four types: orbiters, landers, rovers and penetraters. These missions have some common performance requirements, such as high specific energy and energy density due to mass and volume limitations. However, each of these missions have some unique promary performance drivers, such as, long cycle capability (orbiters) and ability to operate at low temperatures (landers, rovers and penetraters). The orbiters require a cycle life greater than 10000 cycles at 20-30% depth of discharge with a specific energy > 100 Wh/kg. The landers and rovers require batteries that can provide > 120 Wh/kg and operate at ttemperatures -20 to 30oC, whereas, the cycle life requirement is < 500 cycles (50-70% DOD). Penetraters require batteries that can operate at temperatures lower than -60oC and withstand high shock levels. The SOA Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries are quite heavy and bulky and cannot meet mass and volume requirements of future Mars missions. Furthermore, they have very poor low temperature performance capability as they use aqueous electrolytes. Rechargeable lithium batteries offer significant weight, volume and cost advantages compared to SOA Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries and are especially attractive for future Mars Missions. The performance advantages include: higher specific energy (2 to 3 times greater than Ni-Cd and Ni-H2), energy density (3-4 times greater than Ni-Cd and Ni-H2), higher cell voltage, coulombic and energy efficiency, low self-discharge rate, and lower battery costs compared to the SOA Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries. These advantages translate into several benefits for Mars Missions including: reduced weight and volume of the energy storage subsystem, improved reliability, extended mission life, and lower power system life cycle costs. the overall technical goal of this task is to develop advanced rechargeable lithium ion cells with improved cycle life and wide temperature performance capabilities for future Mars Exploratory Missions such as orbiters, landers, rovers, and penetraters. The specific objectives of this task are: 1) Improve the cycle life performance of Lithium-ion cells and demonstrate the ability to meet life requirements of the Mars orbiters, 2) Improve the low temperature performance of lithium-ion cells and demonstrate their applicability to lander, rover and penetrater missions, 3) Design and fabricate higher capacity cells (> 10 Ah) with uniform capacity and predictable performance in association with US battery manufacturers, and 4) Establish effective charge methodology and reconditioning methods for on-board battery management. The proposed technical approach consists of three well defined subtasks: 1) chemistry and materials, 2) cell development, 3) testing and evaluation. The prime objective of the chemistry and materials subtask is to develop advanced electrode materials and electrolytes that are capable of providing long cycle life and improved low temperature performance. The objectives of the cell development subtask are: a) develop methods for the fabrication of electrodes with uniform loading (to achieve cell matching and predictable performance), b) optimize cell design for improved cycle life and low temperature performance and c) fabricate higher capacity cells (5-20 Ah) for technology demonstration. The objectives of the cell testing subtasks are: a) establish charge methods for effective battery management and b) determine the performance of cells at various mission operating and accelerated test conditions and demonstrate technological viability for various missions. Assistance of an industrial patner will be sought for the fabrication of cell hardware.

This involves two major technology developments, one being a digital X-band receiver using advanced GaAs Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, and the other involves development of miniature high-frequency high-density electronic packaging technology. The combination of these two technology advances will enable a new miniature transponder with unsurpassed performance: Narrow bandwidth Phase Lock Loop (<20Hz) with a carrier tracking threshold of -158 dBm. Wide dynamic range (>70 dB) Command Detector functionality (for multi-user compatibility) Total mass <2.5 kg. In the past, deep space telecommunication systems for spacecraft have been developed individually to fit the requirements of each spacecraft project. Since past spacecraft tended to be heavy, expensive, and power hungry, telecommunication systems based on past spacecraft designs are inappropriate for use on new miniaturized spacecraft. For Mars Landers launched from Med-Lite launch vehicles, mass, power and volume are precious commodities, and it is crucial that a truly miniaturized, high efficiency telecommunication system be developed for this kind of application. The Mars Exploration Office has defined such a development as their #1 technology need. Over the past couple of years, the Pluto Fast Flyby Advanced Technology Insertion (ATI) effort initiated the development of an advanced miniature X-Band digital receiver which is a major portion of a miniature telecommunication transponder. TRW won a competitive contract to develop this critical technology. However, they could not complete the work within the allocated funding and the effort was left unfinished. Nevertheless, the Pluto ATI effort successfully demonstrated the RF front-end functionality using advanced GaAs Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology. Also it was shown that the mass goal of less than one kilogram was indeed a feasible target. But the digital architecture was not completed nor was the integration of the miniature front-end with advanced high-frequency multichip module (MCM) packaging. In our work, we will support advances in digital receiver and high frequency high density packaging technology to a prototype readiness level which will allow the Mars Exploration Office to decide whether or not to proceed with procurement of flight hardware. One part of the proposed program is completion of the digital architecture and integration of the miniature front-end with advanced high-frequency multichip module (MCM) packaging. The goal of this effort is to develop a state-of-the-art digital X-Band receiver technology which employs advanced GaAs MMIC and high-frequency packaging to achieve unsurpassed performance. The second part of the program involves the use of high density packaging technology to achieve miniaturization of the transponder. Although considerable effort and funds have been invested in high density packaging, very little of these resources are being invested in high frequency (> 200 MHz) applications and these packaging techniques are usually not suitable for use at high frequencies. Consequently, NASA must lead and stimulate the development of miniature high-frequency high-density packaging technology. Microelectronic packaging provides four basic functions: (1) Power Distribution, (2) Heat Dissipation, (3) Signal Distribution, and (4) Environmental Protection. High density electronic packaging implies incorporation of multiple integrated circuits, as bare die and passive components on a common interconnecting substrate. This format is commonly referred to as a multichip module (MCM). Significant improvements in circuit density are attainable (10-30X), as compared with printed circuit board technology. For high density, high frequency (defined to be the microwave and millimeter wave range, covering 1 GHz to 100 GHz) packages) the performance requirements are much more stringent than for low frequency packaging for digital technology. Signal distribution becomes a major challenge as the frequency and packaging densities increase. Stray (RF) radiation in the form of cross-talk and package moding become limiting factors which must be addressed in order to preserve performance. The interconnecting networks into and out of the package must have low loss characteristics and be matched to the impedances of the adjacent networks. 3D high density formats which use multi-layer materials systems and embedded components further complicate signal propagation characteristics and thermal management issues. Thermal management of Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) used for high frequency applications is a significant development issue in high density package design and can severely affect package reliability and performance. This task will include the development and demonstration of new cooling techniques which are critical for this application and while addressed mainly to high frequency applications, will be of benefit to all high density electronic packaging. The passive cooling approach will involve utilizing a very high thermal conductivity substrate to reduce the temperature of high power devices and the circuit in general by rapidly spreading and conducting the heat away. Methods for bonding the substrate to the devices will have to be developed. The performance and temperatures of various parts of the circuit will be compared to those obtained with a conventional substrate (such as alumina or Kovar). A single milestone occurs on 10/1/95 when it is expected that the RF MCM will be demonstrated. This may or may not include the final form of the MCM including thermal control but the analysis for the final form will be done. The digital receiver will be demonstrated to the extent it can be depending on which contractor is selected. However, the technologies will be demonstrated at a readiness level which will allow the Mars Exploration Office to decide whether or not to include this innovative transponder in its plans for the 98 Lander mission.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINE, PLEASE DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. General Guidelines Since 1994, Ethiolist Services has been an open communication medium for Ethiopians, friends of Ethiopia and interested subscribers. Since its inception, Ethiolist has been a vanguard proponent of OPEN communication. This tradition, which brings us all together WILL continue to be a celebrated privilege we all cherish. Our aim is to provide forums(s) that would be used for constructive, informational and educational purposes. Our main focus has been and continues to be to bring all Ethiopians and friends of Ethiopia together. For the most part, we have been successful! Our achievements would not have occurred without your participation. We are very thankful for your support. As you all know, the Ethiolist file and list server runs on a commercial service provider's platform. Ethiolist is not simply one list but it is rather a huge system capable of handling transactions of multiple lists and file services. Ethiolist operates based on its contractual obligations and its guidelines. Furthermore, the very nature of the INTERNET dictates the type of service we provide. As such, Ethiolist: cannot and does not guarantee the delivery of each posting to its subscribers. We put in every effort to ensure that mails are distributed to all subscribers. Because of the routing mechanisms of e-mail distributions and the involved nodes in the path of the transmission of E-mails, we are unable to guarantee all distributions. promotes an open communication medium and free exchange of ideas. Therefore, Ethiolist cannot monitor where each e-mail has been forwarded. Our guidelines state that it is up to the individual to express a "Copy Right" disclaimer on the write-ups before the first distribution has been made. As we mentioned earlier, Ethiolist is an open forum, however, we reserver the right to cancel, refuse or suspend subscription at any time with or without cause. The following has been added to the Ethiolist guidelines/rules. Cross postings. Cross-posting of threads that began at a different list are not allowed on any of the Ethiolist forums. Mail forwarding Ethiolist does not permit the forwarding of mails from non-subscribers without the permission of the postmaster. Individuals (non-subscribers) who would like to have their messages forwarded to Ethiolist have to join the forums themselves. UPON REQUEST from Ethiolist postmaster, subscribers are required to identify themselves to the postmaster. Failure to comply with this guideline will result in automatic cancellation of subscription until such disclosure is made by the individual who recieved the request. Upon Request from the Ethiolist Postmaster, diucussions of "heated" nature, personal attacks ..etc will be diverted to off-line communication. Ethiolist does not allow any dragetory, racial or ethnical postings that are intended to insult any group of people. Ethiolist reserves the right to deny subscription or change the rules and guidelines of its forums at any time. Ethiolist Services has the following forums available to subscribers. EthioForum - News and Information forum regarding Ethiopia and Ethiopians .This is the global forum to which subscribers may send and receive news and information regarding Ethiopia and Ethiopians. News and information can be of different natures (example, Political, Cultural, Sports ..etc.). News of political nature may be sent to Ethioforum (the default forum), discussions are also encouraged. However, if subscribers request that the discussion be held in the political forum (EthioPolitics), then, involved parties are required to redirect their mails to the political forum. When mails are sent to one of the forums, they are distributed ONLY to subscribers of that particular forum. EthioBusiness Discussions of Business nature . ONLY legal and socially acceptable business discussions and advertisements are allowed. Advertisements and/or discussions involving the sale and purchase of narcotics or drugs, child adoptions for the purpose of profit making, prostitution and any other morally and socially unacceptable practices to our communities and the law of the land are NOT allowed. Ethiolist is not responsible for ANY transactions that come as result of discussions on the EthioBusiness forum. EthioPolitics: Discussions of political nature. Political discussions directed toward the well-being of Ethiopians are encouraged. EthioSports: Discussions of Sports. EthioCulture: Discussions of various Ethiopian cultures (tradition, customs,food etc.) EthioMusic: Discussions of Ethiopian Music (traditional or modern) EthioScience: EthioScience Discussions of scientific nature (researches, inventions, studies) This forum is intended to serve as a reach-out to the academic and professional Ethiopians. Discussions are encouraged to be subject oriented - Engineering, Chemistry, Biology, Economics .etc. EthioHistory: Discussion on Ethiopian History - ancient or modern history of Ethiopia. Other forums may be created in the future when and if the need arises. These available forums are experimental and may not cover all of the interests of subscribers. It may also be difficult to categorize a given write-up - meaning what some consider to be historical may also be political in nature. In cases like that subscribers are requested to make a reasonable judgement. Regardless of the difficulties though, we feel that we must start from a point and prepare ourselves to modify the guidelines as the needs come. HOW DO I SEND MY MAIL TO A PARTICULAR FORUM? Simply address your mail to the particular forum. For example, to send mail to the EthioCulture forum, send your mail to: EthioCulture@ethiolist.com The same procedure applies to the other forums. Subscribers who do not want their article(s) to be redistributed elsewhere should state so in their articles. WHO TO CONTACT Contact the postmaster (Tadesse Tsegaye) with your questions and/or suggestion. The postmaster can be reached via txt4@ethiolist.com or txt4@netcom.com . DISTRIBUTION OF COPY-RIGHTED MATERIAL(S) IS NOT PERMITTED WITHOUT A WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE AUTHOR AND THE POSTMASTER OF THIS ALIAS - ETHIOLIST. IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH RULE IS VIOLATED AND HAS COME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE POSTMASTER OR THE MANAGING TEAM OF ETHIOLIST SERVICES, THE POSTMASTER WILL TERMINATE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE PARTY INVOLVED WITH OR WITHOUT FURTHER NOTIFICATION!

How many forums are there on Ethiolist Server? Ethiolist Services has the following forums : EthioForum EthioPolitics EthioCulture EthioHistory EthioMusic EthioScience EthioBooks EthioBusiness EthioSports Ethio-Humor Ethio-Art EthioNews 2. How would I post to these forums? First you need to subscribe to the Ethiolist Services by sending a request e-mail to Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com. Once the subscription is processed, then posting to any one of the above forums is simple and direct. For example, to post to EthioMusic subscribers are requested to send their mails to EthioMusic@Ethiolist.com. And, to post EthioCulture the address to use is EthioCulture@Ethiolist.com. The domain name for all the forums is the same - @Ethiolist.com. The only thing that changes is the forum name. So, the format [forum name]@Ethiolist.com works for all postings. 3. Why all these forums, is it not going to be confusing for subscribers? The forums were designed to reflect different interest areas. For example, those interested in discussions of sports may send their messages to sports forum, and those interested in the Ethiopian culture will direct their postings to the EthioCulture forum. Having such kind of setup really benefits subscribers. As more Ethiopians get e-mail access, more postings will show, and it will be time consuming for a subscriber to sort through all the incoming mails. The current set-up can be used as a preliminary sorting method. If a subscriber does not want to get mails from a given forum he/she would unsubscribe from that particular forum while still being able to get information in other areas of interest (other forums). 4. What do I need to do to archive files? Postings sent to Ethiolist server are automatically archived and can be accessed by sending a request to the request alias. The request alias for the Ethiolist services is : Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com Since the archiving is done for each forum separately different commands should be used for each forum. However, all requests can be made in a single request mail. The following example shows how to use the request alias to get archive mails. The first thing you need to do is address your request to the proper alias. In the case, the request would be addressed to Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com , so, the mail header would look like this: 		To: Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com		From: Your address (this is entered automatically)		Date: (This is automatic)		Subject: (what ever you want it to be)		SEND EthioForum		SEND EthioMusic		SEND EthioCulture		SEND Ethio-Art		SEND Ethio-Humor As you see, the command for retrieving archives is the SEND command. Other commands also follow the same format. We are currently working on adding more features onto the system . 5. If I send the an e-mail to all the forums at the same time, would subscribers get that many duplicate mails - provided that they have subscribed to all the forums? If a mail is sent to ALL the forums at the SAME time, subscribers should not be getting multiple copies and , the incoming mail shows the tags indicating which forum the mail was sent to. If mails are sent at time intervals, then, subscribers might get multiple copies. So, if you want to reach ALL Ethiolist subscribers without sending duplicate mails, then, what you really need to do is, address your e-mail to one forum and carbon copy all the remaining forums. Since it is one mail composition, the server should not send SAME mail to the same person more than one time. 6. Are there other commands that subscribers may use? We are currently working on a set of commands that would grant list maintainers access to the Ethiolist server. As the needs comes we will be adding more commands that could also be utilzed by subscribers to get more information on their subscrption and also allow them to access the archives in a better efficient way. By design, the Ethiolist server would allow us to add more commands as the needs come in the future. 7. What is the objective of Ethiolist? Our objective is to open and strengthen an open electronic forum for Ethiopians and those who promote the interests of Ethiopians. We sincerely believe that open communication and exchange of diverse ideas is a prerequisite for a consensus on issues at hand. Hence, we encourage discussions on different issues to be open and sincere. The Ethiolist managing team has no political partisanship, however, we sincerely believe that our strength rests on our unity. 8. Who pays for all these service? Is there any plan to share the cost? This question was raised by a number of subscribers. Ethiolist is maintained by the postmaster and managed by a team of Ethiopians. There is a monthly fee that is paid to the service provider for access to their machine. That fee is ONLY for a limited use of the service provider's resources. For instance every time we exceed the limitation (disk space) we are required to pay extra money. This can happen very frequently considering the increasing number of subscribers. Every activity on the Ethiolist server is logged in addition to the actual e-mails that are also saved on the server. And that eats-up disk space. Ethiolist requests subscribers to share the burden. We will be asking for small contribution to continue the service. The subscription and start-up fee is a little over $2 per month per subscriber for a total of $25/year. 9. Where would I send my contribution to? Contributions to Ethiolist Services can be sent (in check or money order) to the following address: Ethiolist Services 3245 S. White Rd. Suite 155 San Jose, CA 95148 Check or money order payable to: Ethiolist. 10. How "OLD" is Ethiolist? Ethiolist came into being on March 14, 1994. 11. How would I get a copy of the most recent FAQ? FAQs can be obtained from the server via the request alias : Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com. Address your mail to this alias and in the body of your request mail mail type SEND FAQ. 12. File Transfer VIA FTP Some files on the Ethiolist Server can be accessed via the FTP mechanism. To download files via FTP, use ftp ftp.netcom.com directory /ftp/pub/tx/txt4. From the 'txt4' directory you would more subdirectories for the forums we maintain. Go to the forum of your choise and check tha available file out (if any) WITHOUT FTP Ethiolist also has an E-mail based File Transfer service for binary files. These files can be saved on the server via e-mail remotely and can also be retrieved via e-mail remotely. Files and programs can be saved to AAU on the Ethiolist system and people in Ethiopia can access these files via e-mails. To use this feature interested parties need to contact the postmaster (txt4@Ethiolist.com). Due to limited disk space, this feature may not be available to all at this time. However, interested parties are encouraged to contact the postmaster. This feature is what was talked about on the AAU connectivity project. Well, it is here now. 13. What is new? -Three more forums have been added! Ethio-Art Ethio-Humor EthioNews The managing team has just added three more forums - Ethio-Art and Ethio-Humor. Ethio-Art is intended to enhance discussions related to Ethiopians arts, and Ethio-Humor serves as a forum for discussions regarding Ethiopian humors. Jokes that are not based on ethnicity and that are not divisive are very welcome. Homor and/or jokes that undermine the integrity of ANY of the Ethiopian ethnic groups are NOT allowed! EthioNews is a news forum that is directly from Ethiopia. Ethiolist has made arrangement with news providers in Ethiopia and the postings to this forum are obtained directly from these news sources. In the future the sources will be expanded and not limited to sources in Ethiopia only. EthioNews is a moderated forum. ****** Ethiolist has aquired its new domain name - Ethiolist.com - in January 1996.

The organization was founded by Ethiopian couple and was registered with the Ethiopian government in 1994 to undertake child focused rehabilitation and development programs. However, ASCO lacks direct access to International donors to mobilize funds and other resources to support its programs and we believe you will be the right person. As we have now a couple of projects going on any donations in cash or in kind, from interested individuals, groups or agency will be highly appreciated.

Clampdown in Addis Ethiopia's Journalists at Risk by Kakuna Kerina After centuries of feudal rule, 17 years of communist dictatorship, almost three decades of civil war, and no tradition of an independent press before 1992, Ethiopia is at a crossroads. As one of the African continent's youngest exercises in democracy, Ethiopia can serve as an example of a true democracy--one that does not sacrifice freedom of expression and human rights as its leaders establish order. Or, it can join the ranks of neighbors whose leaders assumed office promising respect for press freedom and other civil rights, but who have since broken these and other pledges. As things stand today, Ethiopia's independent journalists and the government of Meles Zenawi, the country's first freely elected prime minister, eye each other with mutual suspicion and distrust. Journalists labor under a restrictive press law and penal code, and, as a result, more journalists have been jailed in Ethiopia in the past three years than in any other African country. The Committee to Protect Journalists embarked on a fact-finding mission to Ethiopia in May 1996 to better understand how and why the press law and other legal measures are used against journalists. Following the fall of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam's communist regime in 1991 and encouraged by assurances of press freedom by the newly installed Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE), a vociferous independent media exploded into existence, signaling what many hoped would be the end of tight government control over information. One of the first acts of the TGE, led by then-President Meles*, was passage of the Press Proclamation No. 34/1992 in October 1992. The law quickly put an end to the euphoria that fueled the country's new era of free speech as journalists realized how vulnerable they were under the proclamation, which is both restrictive and contradictory. The legislation prohibits, among other things, the dissemination of information the government deems dangerous, and requires the licensing of all journalists. Moreover, it classifies libel as both a criminal and civil offense, demanding penalties of payment in the amount of twice the value of a publisher's assets. Criminal libel laws or indeed any statutes intended or used to insulate government officials from press criticism through the application of civil or criminal penalties have no place in democratic societies. The right to speak freely without fear of government reprisal is a core principle of democracy, and critical reporting must be tolerated and protected, not criminalized. In late 1993, reeling from criticism from a growing number of newspapers and magazines about state policies and the political transition under way, the government cracked down on the press, starting with the detention of Tefera Asmare, editor of the independent newspaper Etiopis. In connection with an article titled "There's War in Gondar," Tefera was charged with "inciting people against the government" and "disseminating false rumors," under Article 10, Section 2 of the Press Proclamation. Tefera was later charged with 11 counts of libel under the press law; five counts were for the same story carried in different editions of Etiopis. In March 1994, he was convicted of all charges and sentenced to a two-year prison term. He was released on Sept. 27, 1995. The irony of Tefera's arrest was that he was legally carrying out his responsibilities as a journalist according to the Press Proclamation's Art. 4, Sec. 2, which states that "the press gathers and disseminates news; expresses opinions on various issues; forwards criticisms on various issues; participates in forming public opinion by employing various other methods; [and] undertakes other activities necessary for the accomplishment of its purposes." Tefera's case is emblematic of the double bind imposed on independent Ethiopian journalists--he is one of more than 50 who have been imprisoned for their work since 1993. By simultaneously using ambiguous articles of the Press Proclamation and provisions of the civil, penal, and criminal codes, many of which were created in the 1950s, the Meles government has put the media on notice that it will not hesitate to manipulate the laws to suit its own ends. Ethiopia, which is a signatory to several regional and international charters guaranteeing press freedom, such as the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has rapidly become a country where reality belies the government's public proclamations about the need for a free press. Contradictory statements by government officials illuminate this gap between rhetoric and policy. "A free press is an essential ingredient of any democratic exercise [because it provides] information to the public so they can make informed decisions," Prime Minister Meles told CPJ's mission. During the same meeting, however, he also said that the government has to impose restrictions on the media to stave off ethnic strife and threats to national security. The stance that Prime Minister Meles' administration chooses to adopt toward the independent press in the coming years will have significant repercussions. The existence of a free press in Ethiopia is dependent upon a clear commitment from the government to support the development of private media and to lift restrictions on reporting and private-sector competition. Ethiopia cannot claim to be a genuine democracy, nor should it be treated as one by Western donors such as the United States, unless the Meles government ceases its practice of subjecting independent journalists to repeated arrests, detention without trial, and excessive fines. *On second reference, Ethiopians are referred to by the first of their names.

U.S. State Department Institutes Policy Change Toward Ethiopian Press During Christopher’s Visit to Addis Ababa Policy Change Enacted After Review of CPJ Report Revealing More Journalists Imprisoned in Ethiopia in Past Three Years Than in Any Other African Country New York‹ U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher today declined the Ethiopian government’s invitation to hold a joint press conference upon his arrival in Addis Ababa. This, in response to a report by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) detailing the legal harassment and imprisonment of Ethiopian journalists, and the government’s systematic exclusion of the private press from official press conferences. State Department Spokesperson Nicholas Burns told the Committee’s chair, Kati Marton, that CPJ’s report Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopia’s Journalists at Risk led to the policy change. In a public statement, Secretary of State Christopher told reporters, “Ethiopia has made progress in human rights during the past five years, but the United States wants to see more. One of the areas of our concern is the freedom of the press and the treatment of journalists.” CPJ’s report is based on a fact-finding mission conducted last May by Africa Program Coordinator Kakuna Kerina, who wrote the report, and CPJ board member and Newsday U.N. bureau chief Josh Friedman, who wrote the report’s introductory essay. Based on more than 50 interviews with government officials, journalists and other sources, the report demonstrates how independent journalists are regularly harassed, censored and jailed under the provisions of a restrictive press law enacted in 1992. The repressive climate exists despite promises of press freedom made by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) in 1991 and by the recently elected Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who served as TGE president. Clampdown in Addis, which was released on October 7 -- the day Ethiopia’s Parliament reconvened to address key media issues -- made several recommendations to the Meles administration, and called on the United States and other Western countries to take a more aggressive role in encouraging the Ethiopian government to uphold guarantees of press freedom. “Secretary of State Christopher’s position is a welcome step toward what CPJ hopes will be a continued U.S. government commitment to press freedom and support for Ethiopia’s independent journalists,” said Kerina. “We look forward to the time when the Ethiopian government views the private press as an ally, not an enemy, in the democratic process.” To order copies of Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopia’s Journalists at Risk, please call (212) 465-1004. CPJ documents and responds to press freedom abuses around the world. From its headquarters in New York, CPJ works to get detained journalists out of jail, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive governments, and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous areas. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, and does not accept any government funding.

Children who were the most vulnerable group become easy victim of various diseases, malnutrition, death and untold misery and suffering. Alem Children Support Organization was established as an indigenous and humanitarian NGO, to contribute its share towards alleviating the plight of the children in the country. ASCO was founded by Ethiopian married couple and was registered with the Ethiopian government in 1994 to undertake child focused rehabilitation and development programs. The organization is superintended by a board of directors whose membership is drawn from government and non-government organizations. I is managed by Mrs. Alemnesh MOgessie with the help of small but diligent staff. There are now a couple of professional people who have joined the organization as paid staff. HIGHLIGHTSOF ACTIVITIES Within the past three years, efforts have been made to provide basic and material support by the founders and by few humanitarian individuals. BENEFICIARIES - STREET AND DESTITUTE CHILDREN Street and destitute children numbering 200 from low income families of the neighborhood are being supported at a drop-in center in Addis Ababa with the following: Provision of supervised informal education through the day care center. Supplementary feeding program, i.e. offering one mean a day at the drop-in center through out the year. Recreational facilities. Health referral and clothing support. School supplies such as exercise books and pencils are issued for pre-school children and a few primary school children. Providing monthly financial support to very poor families through the child sponsorship program. DESTITUTE MOTHERS Provide cash loan to 80 disadvantaged mothers of the neighborhood to start small income generating ventures. Assist another 60 poor women to earn income by involving them in traditional cotton spinning activity. The spun cotton will be used as raw material to produce traditional Ethiopian clothes. The weaving cottage handicraft was set up within the compound of the drop-in center as part of our effort to reduce our dependence on external assistance and promote self reliance. Provision of basic health education, including family planning practice, child care and nutrition. MAJOR CONSTRAINTS Lack of direct access to internatonal donors to mobilize funds and other organizational support. Lack of transport is a major constraint for carrying out planned activities on time. Shortage of qualified staff, office supplies and equipment. Frequent changes of government structure and policies. FUTURE PLANS Improving the facilities, management operation and the quality of manpower so as to promote effective performance. Increasing the number of beneficiary children by promoting child sponsorship programs. Providing revolving fund to street children and their mothers to initiate income generating schemes. Partnering with other NGOs to have a maximum positive impact from the programs. Initiating income generating activity or other alternative options that would reduce dependency on donation and promote self-reliance. It is to be noted, however, that the above plans are only major outlines reflecting our vision and intents. If you wish detailed plan and project proposals to participate in funding, we are ready to submit. We will be glad to receive innovative ideas and practical experiences as well as assistance in the form of cash, material and man-power support.

(in vitro fertilization) I.C.S.I. (intracitoplasmic sperm injection) oocyte donation in early and physiologic menopausal women IN VITRO FERTILIZATION PROGRAM In order for pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm. Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube which joins the uterus to the ovary. However, in IVF the union occurs in laboratory after eggs and sperm have been collected. Embryos are then transferred to the uterus to continue growth. There are five major steps in the IVF and embryo transfer sequence: Monitor the development of ripening egg(s) in the ovaries. Collect eggs. Obtain sperm. Put eggs and sperm together in the laboratory, and provide correct conditions for fertilization and early embryo growth. Transfer embryos in the uterus. INTRACITOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION PROGRAM I.C.S.I. is indicated for severe male infertilities. Couples with infertilities related to lowered sperm counts or sperm motility or obstructive azoospermia (sperm failure to be ejaculated) usually have I.C.S.I. The tecnique involves all the steps of the I.V.F. precedure exept for the fertilization step. In fact one sperm is directly injected in the egg cytoplasm with the aid of a microcapillary glass tube. This overcome the sperm failure to attach the egg zona and to penetrate the cytoplasm. Embryos so obtained are then transferred into the uterus two days after. OOCYTE DONATION PROGRAM Nowdays even women with premature ovarian failure of diverse origin (e.g. surgical menopause) can become pregnant with the aid of this tecnique. Morever, the procedure descripted below has been extended to physiological menopausal women up to 50 years of age. The procedure consists on the collection of eggs from selected and healthy young donor women followed by in vitro fertilization using the acceptor's husband semen. Embryos so obtained are then transferred in the uterus of the acceptor woman. Please note that this tecnique leads to higher rate of achieved pregnancies compared with those obtained with conventional IVF.

Normalmente questo processo, detto fecondazione, avviene nelle tube di Falloppio che uniscono le ovaie all'utero. Nella tecnica della IVF tale incontro avviene, invece, in laboratorio, dopo che sia gli ovociti che gli spermatozoi sono stati raccolti. Gli embrioni così ottenuti sono poi trasferiti nell'utero della donna per continuare lo sviluppo. La sequenza delle operazioni da compiere utilizzando questa tecnica è la seguente: Monitoraggio ecografico dello sviluppo degli ovociti nelle ovaie. Prelievo degli ovociti. Raccolta del seme. Manipolazione delle uova e degli spermatozoi in laboratorio per ottenere le migliori condizioni di fecondazione e di sviluppo degli embrioni. Trasferimento degli embrioni in utero. INIEZIONE INTRACITOPLASMATICA DEGLI SPERMATOZOI (I.C.S.I.) La tecnica detta "I.C.S.I." è indicata per le infertilit à maschili gravi. Infatti essa viene usualmente applicata nel caso di coppie con infertilità correlata ad una scarsa quantità di spermatozoi o ad una loro scarsa capacità di movimento oppure alla impossibilità degli spermatozoi ad essere eiaculati. Le operazioni che si compiono utilizzando tale tecnica sono le stesse della "Fecondazione in vitro" tranne che per le modalità di fecondazione. Infatti, si inserisce direttamente uno spermatozoo nel citoplasma dell'uovo con l'aiuto di micropipette di vetro manovrate da un micromanipolatore. Ciò facendo si superano le incapacità degli spermatozoi di raggiungere l'uovo e di penetrarvi. Gli embrioni così ottenuti vengono trasferiti in utero dopo circa 48 ore. DONAZIONE DI UOVA Attraverso questo tipo di intervento, anche donne con carenze ovariche premature di origine diversa (come, ad esempio, la menopausa chirurgica) possono ottenere una gravidanza. Tuttavia ciò può essere applicabile anche a donne in menopausa fisiologica (sotto i 50 anni di età). La procedura consiste nel prelievo delle uova da donne volontariamente donatrici, dopo un accurata scelta rispetto ad alcune caratteristiche tra cui lo stato di salute e l'età. Si procede quindi ad inseminare in vitro le uova raccolte con il seme del partner della donna che riceverà gli embrioni. Si fa notare che attraverso questa procedura la possibilità di successo risulta maggiore di quella delle altre tecniche descritte (IVF ed ICSI).

(in vitro fertilization) I.C.S.I. (intracitoplasmic sperm injection) oocyte donation in early and physiologic menopausal women IN VITRO FERTILIZATION PROGRAM In order for pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm. Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube which joins the uterus to the ovary. However, in IVF the union occurs in laboratory after eggs and sperm have been collected. Embryos are then transferred to the uterus to continue growth. There are five major steps in the IVF and embryo transfer sequence: Monitor the development of ripening egg(s) in the ovaries. Collect eggs. Obtain sperm. Put eggs and sperm together in the laboratory, and provide correct conditions for fertilization and early embryo growth. Transfer embryos in the uterus. INTRACITOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION PROGRAM I.C.S.I. is indicated for severe male infertilities. Couples with infertilities related to lowered sperm counts or sperm motility or obstructive azoospermia (sperm failure to be ejaculated) usually have I.C.S.I. The tecnique involves all the steps of the I.V.F. precedure exept for the fertilization step. In fact one sperm is directly injected in the egg cytoplasm with the aid of a microcapillary glass tube. This overcome the sperm failure to attach the egg zona and to penetrate the cytoplasm. Embryos so obtained are then transferred into the uterus two days after. OOCYTE DONATION PROGRAM Nowdays even women with premature ovarian failure of diverse origin (e.g. surgical menopause) can become pregnant with the aid of this tecnique. Morever, the procedure descripted below has been extended to physiological menopausal women up to 50 years of age. The procedure consists on the collection of eggs from selected and healthy young donor women followed by in vitro fertilization using the acceptor's husband semen. Embryos so obtained are then transferred in the uterus of the acceptor woman. Please note that this tecnique leads to higher rate of achieved pregnancies compared with those obtained with conventional IVF.

From January to March of each year, approximately three to fivethousand Atlantic humpbacks migrate to the Silverbank from as far away as NovaScotia, to birth and train their young. This area, which is north of theDominican Republic, is only one of a few areas where this activity happens each year,and to swim with these mothers and calves while being escorted by many bulls is anexperience like no other a swimmer has ever witnessed. The humpback is the most active of whales on the surface, and at this timeof year the action gets even more incredible. As you watch males compete for females,you will see them finslapping and lobtailing. When you watch 50 ton maleleviathans as they breach completely out of the water and ram into eachother with incredible force, totally ignoring their surroundings, it is a sight thathumbles even the hard-core naturalists, and sets everybody's heart pounding. . A whale expert will be present on every trip and during the night we will sharewith you personal experiences with lectures, slide shows and hopefully videostaken during the day. During the day we observe the whales from the comfort ofour large, stable skiffs. At the Silverbank, we don't only see the whales,we also hear them. The humpback whale is famous for its haunting song, and duringmating season it is ever present. With our hydrophones you will be able tolisten in on every word, as we interpret it for you. The skiffs are provided with acover to protect you from the sun, and have a special area for protecting the cameraequipment. The skiffs also have bran-new, silent and fumeless engines inorder not to disturb the whales, since we are there solely to enjoy the splendor ofthe whales, not to intrude on them. This is the experience of a lifetime you don't wantto miss. Contact us for further information. © 1996 Undersea Hunter, Netilus.

Undersea Hunter Aft-deck Undersea Hunter The research vessel Undersea Hunter was built in Florida in 1968 for Perry Oceanographic and was used for twenty years as a submarine support vessel. Working primarily in the Bahamas and the Carribean, she completed hundreds of research and photographic missions including the Deep Rover Project with Dr. Sylvia Earle. Her closest brush with fame - so far - was her participation as support vessel for the James Bond movie "License to Kill." We bought the Undersea Hunter in June, 1990, and spent five months refurbishing her from stem to stern. Already a capable and well-proven research vessel, the Undersea Hunter was modified to include six new cabins, complete will all the modern conveniences, to accommodate 14 passengers. She is now a rare hybrid combining the large working platform and powerful machinery of a functional work boat with the comfortable interior of a modern yacht. With fuel capacity of 40 tons and water tankage of 26 tons, her blue water capability is almost unlimited. Under the guiding hands of Captains Avi Klafper and Yosy Naaman, the Undersea Hunter is dedicated to bringing civilized comfort to the delightfully uncivilized gems like Cocos Island. The undersea Hunter features these advantages not usually found on a vessel her size. - Extendable deck-mounted crane with 15 ton capacity - Large aft work deck measuring 38ft by 24ft - Two main generators, 40kw and 25 kw - Portable diesel 5kw generator mountable in either tender - Two heavy duty fiberglass tenders, 24ft and 22ft - Full workshop including electric welder, oxy-acetelene unit, drill press, and all other necessary tools | Undersea Hunter | Email | Home | Contact | Vessel Specifications | © 1996 Undersea Hunter, Netilus.

Specialties of her itineraries include excellence in service, food, and incredible underwater excitement. She has eight cabins for a total capacity of 18 passengers (three double-bed staterooms with private bath, two triples with private bath, and three doubles with private bath). Diver facilities are extremely well designed: a private dryer for clients' towels and bathing suits, private camera/strobe storage shelves with individual 110 volts AC power, individual gear storage, etc. The chase boats are superb; two 24' fiberglass cruisers. Sea Hunter puts 9 or less divers in each chase boat.

Well I'm afraid you will just have to wait for my next edition of "The Blurb" to find out what it is all about. It should be coming to a mailbox near you soon. What a great year this has been at Cocos! In fact, what a great two years this has been! It is difficult to believe that I am in my third year already and do you know what? It gets better! Yes, after we came back from the Silverbank trips (Whale watching, Humpbacks, loads of them all over the place, between the Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos but that's another story) Cocos was alive and well and living in the prehistoric era. At least that's what it feels like when you are there, such a beautiful place. Anyway this year was unbelievable (you can ask anyone who has been there, they will tell you. Go ask somebody). Human Toothpicks For three months there was this amazing scene going on at Manuelita. Hammerheads by the score wandering in close to the rocks (I mean really close) to get their teeth cleaned by the King Angels and the Barber Fish. What a job! Imagine being a human toothpick, not to mention the other places they have to clean. Jimmy Hoffa's Boots Anyway there we were, face to face with these sometimes huge beasts. Some looked as if they had been shaving with an old razor blade, nicks and scratches and cuts all over their chins. It's an amazing feeling looking down the throat of a big old Hammerhead and seeing what they had for breakfast. This just went on and on. I'm sure I saw Jimmy Hoffa's boots one day. Bored Yet? Are you bored yet? Yes? Well listen to this then. We saw Whale Sharks four times on one trip and Petra, from Sinai Divers got her reward by seeing the largest fish in the sea on her last dive of the trip (her third, all the way from Egypt). (I was keeping it in reserve because everything was so unbelievable) Do you know what? I can't count the number of times that I have dived with Dolphins since I've been here. It's great to be in one of the pangas after someone has just swam or dived with a Dolphin for the first time. Sometimes they have enormous yellow fin tuna with them and very often silky sharks. There are a lot of firsts out here I can tell you. I know, I've witnessed them. Orcas in the Soup What if I told you that I was doing a rebreather course and as soon as we left the surface Hugo, our panga driver, saw three orcas cruising "right over our heads" he said, but I think he was exaggerating (slightly). Anyway I was obviously paying too much attention to my student because I didn't see it at all. That fish on the reef was really freaking out, several divers got to see two. One luck guy had an eyeball encounter. Imagine that when you least expect it! You see never know what you might see! That was also on the last dive of that trip. The orcas were seen again on the next trip also. What an amazing place! Hot Chocolate Fights You know, anyone can night dive. Every night if they wish and we encourage it, but I'm not really into it much anymore, I get all the excitement I need with the three major dives of the day but when the silkys show up at night around the back of the boat, as they do regularly these days, it's impressive. It is even more impressive seeing the divers jump into the water while there are about ten around (I just take another sip of my hot chocolate and try to remember where I put the Band-Aids). Yes, the excitement level is pretty intense here! The Manta Thief Did you here about one of our repeat guests who had his camera nicked by a manta? True story. No really. Well he was at dirty rock getting some superb shots of the manta's throat when the strobe cable got caught around the cephalic fin and the manta took off with $7000 worth of camera gear. Winnie Persinger from Germany was the unfortunate victim of this theft. The camera was never seen again. There were several witnesses, I might add. Poor manta. Anyway, the great manta debate continues. Are mobilas mantas? I would say ask everyone who has seen them here what they think. To me they must be. I mean what else do they look like? You know we've regularly seen schools of twenty or more. What a fantastic place this is. Quadruplets Do you know what else a diver saw? No? Well you know I'm going to tell you anyway, right? It was a white tip giving birth in the sand at Manuelita. I'm not surprised really, sometimes there are hundreds of the buggers swimming around courting. Anyway I'll bet you didn't know that they come out tail first. You did? Well, there you go then. Secret I'm afraid I can't tell you anymore because we are trying to keep Cocos one of the best kept secrets in the world. Well it's not really going to be a secret anymore once Howard Hall's new special on Cocos is released. He has some unbelievable stuff. So I hear has Marty Snyderman who was here a few months ago. It was great to see all the new faces this year and to see lots of our old friends back again. When you come back next time you had better bring me some new jokes! One guy came for the seventh time this year (take that anyway you like). Ladies and Wizardry What else can I bore you with? I know, Silverbanks. It is between the Turks and Caicos and the Dominican Republic. A huge mating and calving area for humpbacks. We go there for three months, beginning in January and actually get to swim with these fantastic mammals and boy can I tell you (and girl too, it's just a figure of speech, we are definitely not sexist on our boats) where was I? Oh yes, looking one of these gigantic ladies in the eye, that, I bet you know everything, is unbelievable. So you had better get hold of Alan on the phone or fax or other electronic wizardry and book now. Go on, do it, it's going to be great! Don't forget that while we are away the Undersea Hunter is still enjoying the thrill of Cocos and the weather is very nice at this time of year with more excursions to the south of the island. It's time to start seeing big schools of Eagle Rays. Although you can see groups of five or size year round. It really is a great place. Comments about "The Blurb?"

It is not recommended for inexperienced divers because it is an open ocean destination that requires advanced open water diving skills. Every dive at Cocos is distinct. Currents and visibility can be entirely different in just a few hours. The diving among the rocky islets off the coast of the main island is very exciting. The primary attraction are large pelagics, i.e., sharks, whales, rays, mantas, turtles and schooling fish. Sightings of sailfish, marlin, bottlenose dolphins and whale sharks are often reported. The bottom is volcanic rock, with prolific long-spine sea urchins. Most of the action is at 60-80 feet but a dive computer is recommended as you will want the capability to go to 100 feet. A safe limit of 110 feet is requested. Visibility averages 80-100 feet. Diving will commence shortly after your arrival at Cocos Island. There are three dives daily from one of the fiberglass skiffs. You may choose your diving buddy or join the group which is guided by our dive master. Water Termperature: You will be diving in water about 78-83 F. Visibility: Visiblity averages 80-100' with ocassional extremes of 40 and 120'. Certification Cards: All divers must bring proof of certification by a national certifying agency. The dive master will request to see your certification before you are allowed to dive. Dive Gear Suggestions: You will need the following gear:1/8" to 3/16" wet suit, mask, fins, snorkel, regulator with visible pressure gauge, dive computer, buoyancy compensator, depth gauge, dive gloves, weight belt (without weights), dive knife and dive watch. It is recommended that you mark each piece of gear with waterproof paint or tape. We suggest you put all or most of the above items in a carry-on bag. There is ample storage space for your diving equipment, including your own personal locker. We provide you with 80 cubic ft. tanks and weights. Underwater Photography: The diving around Cocos Island offers some of the most photogenic waters in the world. Photographers will find reefs, fish life and visibility excellent for both stills and videos. | Undersea Hunter | Email | Diving at Cocos | Home | Sea Hunter | © 1996 Undersea Hunter, Netilus.

A well-equipped first aid kit including oxygen is on board. You may want to bring anti-seasickness medicine if you feel you will need it. Please inform us and especially the dive guides if you are taking medication or suffer from allergies. There is no smoking allowed inside the boat. Smoking is permitted on the sundeck only. Travel Documents: All passengers must have a valid passort for entry to Costa Rica. Non U.S. residents must check with the Costa Rican consulate if visas are necessary prior to travel. Clothing: We recommend casual and cool cotton attire while on board. Nights can be chilly and/or drizzly. A sweater, light jacket or windbreaker should be sufficient on a cool evening. In San Jose dress is slightly more formal - long pants for men in the evening and a dress or pant suit for women is appropriate. Puntarenas is generally very warm and shorts are acceptable. We suggest packing in a soft duffle bag for easy luggage storage. Currency: Hotels and banks will accept and exchange US Dollars for Costa Rican Colones. US dollars as well as travellers checks are accepted on the Undersea Hunter and Sea Hunter. We do not accept personal checks. Baggage Limitations: Pack lightly since you will be dressing for warm tropical weather. Airlines' baggage limitations can affect divers and photographers. Domestic airlines limit passengers to two pieces of check-in luggage. International flights also have a two piece limit and a limit of 70 lbs per bag. You will be charged for an extra bag or overweight luggage. D.A.N. Insurance: We strongly urge all clients to obtain the inexpensive D.A.N. insurance designed to evacuate divers in the event of an accident. Cocos Island is a very remote area and the cost involved in evacuating a diver is very high. The D.A.N. policy, priced at $52.00 per year is a vital protection to have. Insurance: We recommend the purchase of a short term cancellation insurance policy in case of unexpected changes in your plans. Accident, medical and baggage insurance are also recommended. The nearest recompression chamber is in Panama and the cost of evacuation is extremely high, we therefore recommend emergency evacuation insurance. National Park Fee: There is a National Park fee of $105.00 per person for seven days of diving. This must be included with your final payment. | Undersea Hunter | Email | Travel Information | Home | Sea Hunter | © 1996 Undersea Hunter, Netilus.

Lapey, MD MARIJUANA UPDATE 1996 by Janet D. Lapey, M.D. Marijuana causes many mental disorders, including acute toxic psychosis,panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions, depersonalization, hallucinations,paranoia, depression, and "uncontrollable feelings of aggression."(1) Increased aggressive behavior after smoking marijuana has been reportedin inner city males. (2) Marijuana has long been known to trigger attacks of mental illness, suchas bipolar (manic-depressive) psychosis and schizophrenia. It has been shownthat marijuana users are six times more likely to develop schizophreniathan are non-users. (3) Marijuana use is associated with the development of Amotivational Syndrome.(4) "Often the relationship of impairments and symptoms to marijuana usebecomes evident only when the user is persuaded to stop, shows clear-cutimprovement in mood and behavior, and describes a feeling of coming outof a fog." (5) Marijuana impairs perception, judgment, thinking, memory, and learning.Memory defects may persist six weeks after last use. (6) Mental disorders caused by marijuana (cannabis) listed in the Diagnosticand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV, published by the AmericanPsychiatric Association May 1994 include: Cannabis Dependence; CannabisAbuse; Cannabis Intoxication (impaired motor coordination, anxiety, impairedjudgment, sensation of slowed time, social withdrawal), often includes perceptualdisturbances; Cannabis Intoxication Delerium (memory deficit, disorientation);Cannabis Induced Psychotic Disorder, Delusions; Cannabis Induced PsychoticDisorder, Hallucinations; Cannabis Induced Anxiety Disorder; other Cannabis-RelatedDisorders. Marijuana causes both dependence and addiction. "Marijuana is an addictivedrug...Addictive use is defined by compulsive, repeated use in spite ofadverse consequences. Marijuanas effects include tolerance, leading to dependence,and then inability to cease use." (7) In many parts of the country, there are more people admitted to drug treatmentcenters because of marijuana addiction than heroin addiction. (8) A withdrawal syndrome occurs, consisting of "anxiety, depression, sleepand appetite disturbances, irritability, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea, muscleconvulsions, and restlessness." (9) Since marijuana impairs coordination, perception, and judgment, it is thecause of many accidents. A study of 1023 trauma victims revealed that marijuanahad been used by 34.7%; alcohol had been used by 33.5%.(10) This is similar to a 36.8% incidence of marijuana use reported in fatallyinjured drivers in California.(11) A study of 182 fatal truck accidents revealed that 12.8% of the drivershad used marijuana, 12.5% alcohol, 8.5% cocaine, 7.9% stimulants. (12) A roadside study of reckless drivers not believed to be impaired by alcoholfound that 45% tested positive for marijuana. (13) The effects of marijuana, which is fat-soluble, persist much longer thanthe effects of alcohol, which is water soluble. An experiment on pilots,using a computerized flight simulator, showed that their ability to landa plane was still impaired 24 hours after smoking a single marijuana cigarette.(14) The use of marijuana during pregnancy is associated with babies of low birthweight. (15) Also, there is evidence that such infants will show intellectual impairmenta decade or more later. (16) Children exposed to marijuana prenatally have increased behavioral problems;they have decreased visual perception, language comprehension, attentionspan and memory. (17) Babies born to mothers who use marijuana during pregnancy have an eleven-foldincrease in nonlymphoblastic leukemia. (18) In males, marijuana diminishes testosterone production and lowers spermcounts. In females, marijuana disrupts hormone cycles. (19) Studies have shown that marijuana is mutagenic and impairs DNA synthesis.(20) Marijuana smoke produces airway injury, acute and chronic bronchitis, lunginflammation, and decreased pulmonary defenses against infection. Smokingone marijuana cigarette leads to airway deposition of four times as muchcancer-causing tar as does tobacco smoke. (21) Recently, there have been cases of cancer reported in young marijuana smokers,including cancer of the mouth, tongue, larynx, jaw, head, neck, and lungs.(22) Marijuana causes impairment of the white blood cells which fight infections.(23) Marijuana use decreases resistance to diseases such as herpes. (24) Marijuana smokers have increased outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses,accidents, and other illnesses. (25) The use of marijuana tends to lead to the use of other drugs. 20% of personswho use marijuana 3-10 times go on to use cocaine; 75% of persons who usemarijuana 100 or more times go on to use cocaine. (26) Non-marijuana users virtually never become cocaine users. In Alaska, whenmarijuana use was decriminalized, use by Alaskan youth of both marijuanaand cocaine became the highest in the nation. The National Survey of HighSchool Seniors showed that whereas nationally 17% of seniors had used marijuanain the past month, the Alaskan rate was 45%. The Alaskans then sensiblyrecriminalized marijuana use in 1990. 1. Schwartz RH. Pediatric Clinics of North America 34:305-317, 1987. 2. Cherek DR et al. Psychopharmacology 111:163-168, 1993. 3.

Harm Prevention THE EFFECTS OF HARM REDUCTION VS HARM PREVENTION: AN INTERNATIONALASSESSMENT Susan Kaplin May, 1994 Although the term "Harm Reduction" is applied more generally,it has its roots in and is applicable to treatment. Harm reduction has someuse in treatment; hopefully while working toward the goal of stopping druguse. To attempt anything less is a disservice to individuals, families,communities, and society. Although it is said that harm reduction coversa continuum of approaches ranging from prohibition/abstinence to legalization,most harm reduction approaches focus on the "safer" uses of drugswhere drug-taking behaviors fall on a continuum with differing levels ofdanger. Therefore, harm reduction is not appropriate for use in primary prevention,since primary prevention focuses on avoiding drug use since any use of drugsaffects the body, which can lead to harm. This includes both legal and illegaldrugs. It is especially important to remember that harm reduction is notappropriate with young (underage) children since it is illegal for themto get/use legal drugs (e.g. cigarettes and alcohol), in addition to illicitdrugs. There are four studies which have examined the effects of the "harmreduction" policy of the Netherlands on drug taking: 1. "The Dutch Drug Policy: A Physician's Commentary" (Karel FrederickGunning, M.D., 1993). Conclusions: The availability and sale of cannabisin Dutch coffee shops has been associated with an increase in its socialacceptability and use among adolescents as a "soft" drug. The"harm reduction" Dutch policy of containing heroin addiction throughdistribution of free needles and syringes and through methadone distributionhas not prevented the spread of heroin addiction, curtailed drug-relatedcrime, nor has it proven to decrease the level of HIV infection. 2. "DrugReform: TheDutchExperience" (RichardR. Schwartz, 1993).Conclusions: The Dutch policy has been associated with a progressive increasein cannabis use among 15-19 year olds (from 4% in 1984 to over 8% in 1989).Between 1984 and 1988, the use of cannabis increased by almost 100% amongupper high school students in the Netherlands. The policy of "harmreduction" has not prevented a steady and significant rise in drugaddiction (cannabis, cocaine and opiates) among 15-19 year olds and youngadults. [These two reports are presented in "Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology,Detection" (CRC Press, London, 1993).] 3. The Dutch Institute on Alcohol and Drugs questioned 8,000 young peopleand also found that the percentage of students smoking cannabis has morethan doubled in four years (from 3% in 1984 to 7% in 1988). (Guardian, 9November 1993). 4. The Council of Europe, Pompidou Group Survey of 1990 showed that therewas a doubling of cannabis use among 15 and 16 year olds after the lawswere relaxed. The number of retail outlets or cafes, where cannabis productsare sold, has risen from 30 to 1,500. (Lambton Families in Action Newsletter,Fall 1993) After visiting Amsterdam to learn more about the Dutch drug policy, theScottish Affairs Committee documented important problems with this policy.Drug policy guidelines have been violated in many coffee shops selling cannabis:stocking amounts over the 30 gms limit, selling alcohol and other ("harder")drugs and advertising (Scottish Affairs Committee, House of Commons "DrugAbuse in Scotland, Volume I, " 1994). It was reported that "theguidelines are clearly being flouted despite the more rigorous enforcementwhich was supposed to have taken place over the last year. Since May 1993,we were told by the Justice Ministry officials that 60 coffee shops hadbeen closed down, 14 of them on the grounds that they permitted hard (sic)drugs to be sold on the premises". The Scottish Committee also described Amsterdam as "an important centrefor the import and export drugs of all categories and along with the CrownOffice, we believe that the Dutch toleration of soft (sic) drugs has hada role to play in this unwelcome development". Recently, it has beennoted that a new type of cannabis ("skunk") has been developedin the Netherlands that has a much larger THC component and this has nowbeen found in the U.K. (Home Office, 1994). Amsterdam is seeing an increasein crime and it has been written that it has one of the highest crime ratesamong European cities. Police are experiencing difficulty in handling thiscrime and the general increase in, and visibility of, other drug use suchas heroin. Citizens are also objecting to the increased visibility of heroinuse, especially those people who have children who are exposed to this sight. Other countries have had an increase in drug use and related social problemswhen drug laws and policies were made more lenient. In England, drug-relatedcrime has risen in regions adopting harm reduction strategies (includingcautions for some drug offenders, registration of addicts, methadone andneedle exchange programmer). For example, the cost of drug-related crimein the Metropolitan Police area is �1.85 billion each year (1992). In Wigan,England, it has been estimated that drug-related crime costs victims �7million per year. More than half the crimes committed in the borough arethought to be carried out by drug abusers in order to fund their addictions(1993). U.K. government sources have stated that legalizing drugs will notlower crime because those who desire drugs will still require the moneyfor these drugs. "So those who currently resort to stealing will continueto do so. Furthermore, since the drug would be more easily available, demandwould increase and so, arguably, would theft". (Kenneth Baker, "WhyWe Cannot Go Soft on Drugs," June 1991). In Liverpool, England, ten years ago, a small number of people were injectingdrugs. With the uncontrolled issuing of syringes, the number of people injectingdrugs increased dramatically. (South Liverpool Family Support Group). Spain's change to a lenient drug policy resulted in a tremendous increasein drug use and crime, including trafficking (cocaine, heroin and otherdrugs). Places that have tried decriminalization or legalization have either rescindedliberalized laws or are currently rethinking them based on the increaseof crime and other social problems that appear to have occurred as a resultof more lenient laws regarding cannabis use. Police in Alaska supporteddecriminalization in 1975 primarily because they believed that crime woulddecrease. However, by monitoring the situation over time, in 1990 it wasshown that there was a major increase in cannabis use and problem use: upto twice the national average in both categories. Use of all other drugsincreased. Health and social costs also increased drastically. Most importantly,the main argument for decriminalization that is also occurring in the UK(that crime would decrease) was disproved as crime increased. Whether ornot there was a direct cause and effect relationship between cannabis decriminalizationand the increase in crime, decriminalization was seen to have failed. Inseeing this failure, the police who had initially supported decriminalizationfully supported rescinding the law. (Drug Prevention: Just Sav Now, Stoker). In early 1992, Zurich, Switzerland ended its four year experiment with designatinga park a "police-free harm reduction area". In this park, drugusers were allowed to deal and use and dealers "commuted" fromTurkey and Lebanon. Drug users in the park increased dramatically and camein from other parts of the world. Food and needles were distributed, asmany as 12,000 needles a day. However, three to four users died each nightand crime rose enormously. In one year, drug-related deaths doubled andthis city has one of the highest drug abuse and AIDS rates in Europe. Swissofficials admitted that harm-reduction had failed and thus, this experimentwas ended. Although ended, there were still costs to the drug users andsociety that remain after this four year period ended. (Stoker). In comparison, Sweden has by tradition had a restrictive drug policy. However,there was once a short period (1965-1967) when a more permissive drug policywas in operation. During this period, a number of doctors were allowed toprescribe drugs (stimulants, opiates) to addicts. Though drugs were legallyobtained, this permissive policy was seen to increase the amount of drugson the black market and criminal activity among the addicts. Because ofthis, the government returned to a restrictive drug policy by the end ofthe 1960s. This policy has been maintained and reinforced since then. Swedishstudies have shown that there has been a steady decline in the proportionof young people reporting that they have ever tried narcotics (from a maximumof 15% in 1971 to 4% in 1991) (Allebeck). In 1988, Professor Nils Bejerot,The Carnegie Institute, Stockholm reported that a restrictive drug policynot only halts the spread of addiction but also makes considerable reductionsin the rate of current drug use. In contract, a permissive drug policy leadsto "a rapid spread of drug use" [Allebeck and Bejerot's reportsare presented in "Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection"(CRC Press, London, 1993)]. Harm reduction, through its acceptance and "normalization" ofdrug use actually sets in motion the increased use of drugs in society.There are no studies showing that harm reduction has decreased drug use. In the recent report from the Scottish Affairs Committee, House of Commons("Drug Abuse in Scotland, Volume 1," 1994), it is clearly statedthat harm reduction should not be applied to schools and children indiscriminatelybecause it is not appropriate for them. It is believed that using a harmreduction approach on all young people would be "totally counter-productive". The Committee also takes a firm stand on the proven harm of cannabis andstate that "the lesson of history is that the dangers of a drug aremore often under-estimated than over-estimated" (eg the harm of smokingtobacco and that "heroin itself was originally developed as a non-addictivesubstitute for morphine"). They also cite cannabis as a gateway drug(as well as cigarettes and alcohol) and state that "the greater theprevalence of cannabis use, the greater the risk will be that more youngpeople will enter into a drug taking subculture and develop a serious drugproblem". Based on the Scottish Committees' experience in assessing the Dutch drugpolicy (described earlier in this paper), they state "we are totallyopposed to any experimentation with the Dutch approach to cannabis in Scotland".They note that "at a time when Scotland faces a massive drug problemwe believe that any move to decriminalize cannabis would send the wrongsignal to young people. As the Association of Directors of Social work putit to us: There comes a point where you have to draw the line somewhereand if you keep moving the line practice suggested that people's behaviorwill move to wherever you draw the line". In fact, the Scottish Committee does not believe that the fight againstdrug trafficking is being hampered by the diversion of police resourcesto a vast number of minor cannabis offenses and that fiscal fines, whenapplied to minor cannabis offenses, should act as credible deterrents. The socio-economic costs of drug use are high. For example, in the U.K.in 1992, it was estimated that alcohol and other drug use costs industry3 billion pounds each year (1992). However, the costs of providing prevention are low and the results of researchshow that prevention, not harm reduction, works in halting potential drugusers. In the U.S.A. young people who have been the focus of preventionprograms were found to use less alcohol and other drugseachyearbetweenl979andl991.(NIDA,199ISurvey). Twenty-fivemillionAmericans who will not use drugs inthe next month might have if it were not for prevention ("Alcohol,Tobacco and Other Drug Prevention and Prevalence: A White Paper," 1993,Social and Health Services Inc.). The amount of money spent each year onhealth care in the U.S.A. could be reduced by $90.4 billion if alcohol andother drug problems were prevented (U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices, 1985). More than twenty research studies evaluating prevention programs based onpersonal and social skills training have demonstrated significant reductionsin substance use (typically cigarettes). Reductions in the onset of smoking ranged from 42% - 75%. Alcohol and marijuanause have also been significantly reduced. Results across studies were consistentand effects generally lasted for at least two years aRer post-testing. Research into Life Skills Training has shown that it significantly reducesthe use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana (by 50% - 83%) when used with12 and 13 year olds. The positive effects from this programming apply tovarious population types and may last for at least two years after the conclusionof the program. A study of drug prevention (Project Alert, aimed at cigarettes, alcoholand marijuana) by the Rand Corporation (1990) tracked 6,500 12 year oldchildren from 30 schools over a period of three years. Students in the programwere one-third less likely to try marijuana than the control group students.The number of children wo experimented with marijuana was reduced by 50%.For students who tried cigarettes, the program reduced smoking from 30%- 50%. In 1990, the long-term impact (over a period of eight years) of the "I'mSpecial" (ISP) drug abuse prevention program for primary school students(8-10 year olds) was assessed in America. The study showed that a lowerpercentage of the ISP students used alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and otherdrugs. They also had a lower incidence of other problem behavior than didnon-ISP students. A long-term study looking at the PRIDE prevention program (for youth andparents) over five years found that there has been a continuous decreasein use of all substances by almost all age groups (the younger childrenhave smaller percentages of use and as such, the changes may not be statisticallysignificant). One example is that cannabis use by 16-17 year olds has decreasedfrom 45% to 30%. In the U.K., an evaluation of the Brigantia Smoking Prevention Prograrnhas shown a reduction in experimental smoking in 9-1 1 year olds. A studyof another UK program, the "My Body Project" also showed a reductionin experimental smoking. A community program which included social resistance training and normativeinfluences modification with 10-13 year old was effective in reducing cigaretteand marijuana use prevalence. These effects are still very strong aRer threeyears and during the ages when youth are more apt to use drugs. The school setting has also been shown to be an effective site for preventionprograms. Drug use risk factors have been reduced, while skills for copingwith social pressures/influences to smoke, drink or use other drugs haveincreased. Programs in schools that include cognitive and behavioral skillbuilding have been successful in preventing the start of drug use. (Preventionresearch information from "Evaluation Studies Supporting the Successesof Drug Prevention," October 1993. All reference materials are citedin this report). Also, in Ontario, Canada prevention has had a major impact on adolescentdrug use which has declined steadily from 32% in 1979 to 14% in 1991. (LambtonFamilies in Action, Newsletter, Fall 1993). With the widening chasm between treatment and prevention theories, a vacuumhas been created. This vacuum is increasingly being filled by applying treatmenttheory's harm reduction strategy to the prevention field. Harm reductionistshave claimed that prevention and the "war on drugs" have not worked,despite the multitude of studies which clearly show that prevention programsfor young people do work. Instead, harm reductionists believe drug use is"inevitable" and young people need to be educated on ways to maketheir own drug use "safer". While it has been shown that preventiondoes work, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of harm reduction.

Noffs Founder, Executive Director, Life Education Centers,USA Founder, Past President, Drug Watch International A new and well organized group of drug pushers have taken to the streetsof some of the world's major cities in an apparent attempt to sustain adrug market that has felt the impact of over a decade of prevention effortsworldwide. They have engaged communities in debating the legal aspects ofdrug use and skillfully avoided any discussion around the consequences,whether physical, emotional, or spiritual, of the user or their family andfriends. In so doing, they have managed to recruit some well respected citizensin their drug promotion efforts. These pushers of the '90s call themselves "Harm Reductionists,"an appropriately Orwellian title, considering their main pastime is thepromotion of "responsible" drug use among the world's young people.They believe that primary prevention programs have failed in their effortsto prevent drug use among young people and that legislators have wrongfullydeclared drug users criminals. To the Harm Reductionists, drug use is anormal part of adolescence, has always been practiced by humans, and willalways be a human form of expression. They say, therefore, that we shouldteach young people how to use drugs responsibly, rather than be endlesslyfrustrated in our attempts to stop drug use. Harm Reductionists point to a range of symptoms from this intolerance todrug use in our culture. Prohibition is their choice weapon to impress uponus the futility and negative consequences of drug criminalization. Theybelieve organized crime, corruption, the spread of disease (in particularAIDS), and the massive drug cartels are the fruits of our labor when wemake drugs illegal in our society. Their claims are convincing to many andthey back them up further with impressive sounding surveys and researchcoming out of prestigious educational institutions, failing to explain thatthey conducted the surveys themselves and that their research has been challengedby the medical community, health organizations and research foundations. Furthermore, Harm Reductionists believe drug use is actually beneficialto individuals and is an essential part of an adolescent's initiation intoadulthood. To them, drug use is a positive expression of a young person'sindividuality and freedom to explore the limits of their mental, physical,and spiritual being. To Harm Reductionists, society should grant this rightto explore without fear of moral judgment or imprisonment, while teachingyoung people how far they can go on this flight to freedom. Harm Reductionists ignore the human face of drug addiction. They do notfrequent AA or NA meetings, nor do they visit outpatient wards or drug crisiscenters. Their world is the conference podium, curriculum committee, oran office somewhere far from those other "uneducated" drug pushers.Tragically, Harm Reductionists target the innocence of children. Beware the Harm Reductionists or Minimizers or any other variations of theseclever drug pushers. When they come to your hometown, as they surely will,challenge them. Above all, remember that, despite their arguments, preventionis working . . . the Harm Reduction movement is proof! From The Best of IDEA, Illinois.

"HarmReduction" is a theory promoted by pro-drug advocates who hold thatsociety must learn to accept levels of use of psychoactive or addictivedrugs by adults and youth and teach them the "responsible use"of these drugs to reduce the harm. Drug Watch International opposes thistheory of "harm reduction" and believes that no level of use ofmarijuana, cocaine, and other harmful and illicit substances is acceptable. Background: The term "Harm Reduction" was "coined" in Great Britainby a group of individuals attempting to make the use of illicit drugs acceptableto society. The basic premise is that the personal use of illicit drugsshould be legal, and can be made manageable and less harmful to the user.The goal of "Harm Reduction" according to proponents, is to decreasethe negative consequences of drug use, rather than to decrease the prevalenceof drug use. Abstinence, they say, may neither be a realistic nor desiredgoal. Some have utilized this theory as a method attempting to "reduce"the spread of hepatitis among IV drug users. The onset of HIV infectionhas given major impetus to this flawed concept. The "Harm Reduction"concept has been incorporated into some treatment programs which allow forcontinued drug use rather than working towards no drug use. It has alsomade inroads into health programs and school curricula in Great Britain,Australia, and Canada. Rationale: "Harm Reduction" interpretations range from the legalization ofsome drugs, to decriminalization, to the legalization of all drugs. Thefallacy of "Harm Reduction" is that dangerous and addictive drugscan safely be used if "properly" managed by the user or regulatedby government. "Harm Reduction" has no place in drug prevention. "Harm Reduction"includes educational strategies used to teach "responsible use"of drugs and convey that drug use is tacitly, if not openly, acceptableregardless of the harmful effects of drugs. The "responsible use" or "harm reduction" approach todrug use was attempted in the U.S. in the 1970's. The result was recordlevels of drug use by young people, many of whom became the middle-agedaddicts of today. "Harm Reduction" proponents falsely claim that education and preventionhave failed. Prevention (no first drug use) programs, policies, and strategieshave caused a positive change in public attitudes about illicit drugs anda significant decline in drug use, especially by youth. A social contextin which drug use is not accepted is essential in decreasing drug use. "Harm Reduction" ignores the proven physiological effects of druguse. "Harm Reduction" is counterproductive to individuals withaddictive behavior. The most successful treatment programs are abstinence-based. "Harm Reduction" policies in Europe resulted in a dramatic increasein the number of drug users in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland,Sweden and other countries. As a result, a number of European countriesreturned to a restrictive drug policy when it became clear that lenientdrug laws had a negative effect on society. "Harm Reduction" proponents consider that legalizing drugs wouldbe the ultimate "harm reduction" for the drug user. For them,the right to the personal use of psychoactive and addictive drugs supersedeswhat is beneficial and healthy for the rest of society.

The theory of "Harm Reduction" isthat drug use can be made more safe, as an alternative to drug abstinence. Needle Exchange Programs (NEPs)seek to prevent HIV infection by providing clean needles to intravenous users ofillegal drugs. NEP advocates claim that NEPs save lives by lowering HIV infection rates. Evaluation studies have been equivocal. NEP opponents state that any apparentpositive results are flawed, and a Montreal study indicates NEP participants had higherrates of HIV infection than non-NEP addicts. Three common flaws are: (1) Failure to separate effects of NEPs from effects of concurrent interventions such as drug treatment and HIV/AIDS education. (2) Failure to monitor sickness, injuries, and deaths resulting from continuation of drug use among NEP participants. (3) Failure to compare NEP effects to alternatives known to be effective, particularly aggressive outreach and drug treatment. The true effects of NEPs may take many years to sort out. Based on the current state of knowledge, even the best designed and best administeredNEPs will probably be found to increase drug deaths more than they decrease HIV infection, particularlyin comparison to outreach and drug treatment. Given this dismal scenario, why are proponents and opponents of NEPs so concerned and vociferous? The reason is ideology. "Harm reduction"in general, and NEPs in particular, is a major battleground between those of us who believe illicitdrug use to be an anti-social act (due to drug-induced health problems, violence, negligentinjury, negligent parenting, and destruction of pro-social values) versus those who believethat drug use is merely a lifestyle issue. A stunning example of how fully the drug culture permeates "harm reduction" and NEPs appeared in a recent day-long workshop given by Mr. Dan Bigg, whooperates a major NEP in Chicago. Printed material composed and distributed by Mr. Bigg clearlypresents drug use as acceptable, unlike drug abuse, which he defines as drug use thatproduces "unwanted harm." In other words, until the user perceives harm to self or others,use is acceptable. Similarly, he defines recovery as "Any positive change as a persondescribes it for her/himself." Mr. Bigg's handout sheet titled "Essential Ingredients of a Harm Reduction Program" starts with, "Orientation toward the person seeking helpas the expert in the direction and intensity of their own positive change(s)." Again, harm is onlythat which is perceived by the drug user. Accordingly, another "essential ingredient" is "Definitionsof program completion and success that include the continued use of alcohol and otherdrugs." The point is clear. Drug use is not aproblem unless the user decides it's a problem. Another handout from Mr. Bigg is titled "Some Comparisons Between Typical Drug Treatment and Substance Use Management." What are these comparisons? For "process," typical drug treatment uses "coercion" while substance use managementuses "clarification." For employers," typical drug treatmentemploys "drug-free workers," while substance use management employs "drug-abuse free workers." For"outcome," typical drug treatment aims for a "drug-free state," while substance abusemanagement aims for a "happy, productive, stable existence regardless of drug use." Another handout created and distributed by Mr. Bigg is titled "TypicalGoals of Substance Use Management (as selected by the person seeking help)." Of the three goals listed, two are covered briefly: * "Abstinence: As people freely define it for themselves (may includeone or more drugs and be permanent or of a limited period.)" * "Improved: Health, Relationships, Job Performance . . ." The third goal, "Developing and Enacting a Safer Use Plan," ismore extensively discussed. Sub-headings include "Practicing Safer DrugUse," "Preparing Yourself for Use," and "Creating aSafer Drug Use Environment." Other material distributed by Mr. Bigg continues along the same lines, asdid comments he made in the course of the presentation. A slide show includeddemonstrations of how to find good veins to inject, how to cook heroin, etc. This is all very disturbing, but perhaps most disturbing is the acceptanceof "harm reduction" and NEPs by legitimate authorities. Mr. Biggpresented this material in Peoria, Illinois on May 22, 1996, at a presentation sponsored by the local HealthDepartment, and widely promoted by that department. The presentation was accredited by the IllinoisChapter of the National Association of Social Workers, and by the Illinois Alcohol andOther Drug Abuse Professional Certification Association! When I wrote to these three organizations,I received no response except from the credentialing association. The Executive Directorpointed out that the organization, "doesn't endorse, support or approve the content of anytraining." The Director has received "numerous calls from Association members complaining abouthis (Mr. Bigg's) presentations and disagreeing with the content." Still, they feelthe absurdity of the ideas speak for themselves, without need for censorship by the Association. "Harm reduction" and NEPs are publicly promoted as having pragmaticvalue, but Mr. Bigg's presentation demonstrated that the defining characteristichere is not a concern for effective results, but a firm belief that drug use is fine. I would encourage all responsible persons and groups to disavow any support for this. I particularly believe that support for this so-called "harmreduction" movement is absolutely incompatible with legitimate drug abuse preventionand treatment entities. Because of the support "harm reduction" has already received,active opposition is needed from those of us who believe that illegal drug use IS an anti-social act. * * * * * * * * * * Alan Markwood has been an InTouch Prevention Area Coordinator since 1987, serving nine Illinois counties as part of the statewide prevention coordinatingsystem.

Drug Watch International supports the efforts of Californiansto defeat the California Marijuana Initiative 1996. Position Paper Use of Marijuana as a "Medicine" There currently exists some controversy concerning smoking marijuana asa medicine. Many well-intentioned leaders and members of the public havebeen misled by the well-financed and organized pro-drug legalization lobbyinto believing there is merit to their argument that smoking marijuana isa safe and effective medicine. A review of the scientific research, expertmedical testimony, and government agency findings shows this to be erroneous.There is no justification for using marijuana as a medicine The California Narcotic Officers' Association consists of over 7,000 criminal justice professionals who are dedicated to protecting the public from thedevastating effects of substance abuse, whether cocaine, methamphetamine,or marijuana. We have seen first hand the debilitating and often tragicresults, both psychologically and physically, of those who choose intoxicationas part of their lifestyle. We have studied the medicinal use of marijuanaissue, compiling information from medical experts to present to those weare sworn to protect. It is our firm belief that any movement that liberalizesor legalizes substance abuse laws would set us back to the days of the '70swhen we experienced this country's worst drug problem and the subsequentconsequences. In the '80s, through the combined and concerted efforts oflaw enforcement, prevention and treatment professionals, illicit drug usewas reduced by 50 percent. Teenagers graduating from the class of 1992had a 50 percent less likely chance of using drugs than those who graduatedin the class of 1979. Substance abuse rises whenever public attitude is more tolerant toward drugs.i.e.. they are safe and harmless. Other factors that contribute to a risein use include increased availability, reduced risk associated with usingor selling, and lower prices. In 1993, for the first time after 12 yearsof steady decline, illicit drug use rose and continues to climb. A majorcontributing factor is a message that drugs "aren't so bad." To counter this "just say yes" campaign, we feel compelled toprovide the facts on the use of smoking marijuana as a medicine. These well-documentedfacts will prove beyond a doubt that MARIJUANA IS NOT MEDICINE. FACT: The movement to legitimize smoking marijuana as a medicine is NOTencouraged by the pharmaceutical companies, Federal Food and Drug Administration,health and medical associations, or medical experts; but instead by groupssuch as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). These organizations have little medicalexpertise and favor various forms of legalizing illicit drugs. FACT: Pro legalization organizations have admitted that their strategy tolegalize marijuana begins with legitimizing smoking marijuana as a medicine.As reported in High Times magazine, the Director of NORML expressly statedthat the medicinal use of marijuana is an integral part of the strategyto legalize marijuana. Tony Serra, a criminal defense attorney associatedwith the prolegalization groups, stated that medicinal marijuana is the"chink in the administration's armor" that will lead to societyseeing pot's mystical effects of peace, sisterhood and brotherhood. He isalso the one who said, "If you kill a cop, I'll pay to take the case;"and "My sustenance is drugs and murder." A former director ofNORML, Keith Stroup, told an Emory University audience that NORML wouldbe using the issue of medicinal marijuana as a red herring to give marijuanaa good name. The director of NORML, Dick Cowan, is quoted, "The keyis medical access. Because once you have hundreds of thousands of peopleusing marijuana under medical supervision, the whole scam is going to bebrought up...then we will get medical, then we will get full legalization."Is there any doubt about their true motive while they play this cruel hoaxon people with legitimate illnesses? FACT: A leader of the medicinal use of manj uana movement, Dr. Lester Grinspoonis an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard as well as chairman ofthe board of NORML. He has made absurd claims such as marijuana, like aspirin,is "unusually safe;" using cocaine two or three times a week "createsno serious problems;" and "Chronic cocaine abuse usually doesnot appear as a medical problem." He wrote a book called 'Marihuana:The Forbidden Medicine', which is the bible for pro-marijuana advocates. FACT: The studies cited by the marijuana advocates have been found to beeither unscientific, poorly researched, or involved pharmaceutical THC,not marijuana. One of their "experts" who testified at the 1987federal hearings to reschedule marijuana was a wellness counselor at a healthspa who admitted under oath to using every illegal mind altering drug heever studied. Another "expert'' admitted he had not kept up with newmedical or scientific information on marijuana for over 18 years. Anotherdoctor claimed there was voluminous medical research on the effectivenessof marijuana but under oath, when asked to cite the number of the studies,he replied, "I would doubt very few." The fact is that there isnot one reliable scientific study that shows smoking marijuana to be a safeand effective drug. FACT: The majority of the marijuana advocates' "evidence" comesfrom unscientific, nonscrutinized or analyzed anecdotal statements frompeople with a variety of illnesses. It is unknown whether these individualsused marijuana prior to their illness or are using marijuana in combinationwith other medicines. It is also unknown whether they have had recent medicalexaminations, are justifying their use of marijuana, experiencing a placeboeffect, or experiencing the intoxicating effect of smoking marijuana. FACT: The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana (THC) is already legallyavailable in pharmaceutical capsule form by prescription from medical doctors.This drug, Marinol, is less often prescribed because of the potential adverse effects, and there are moreeffective new medicines currently available. Marinol differs from the crudeplant marijuana because it consists of one pure, well-studied, FDA-approvedpharmaceutical in stable known dosages. Marijuana is an unstable mixtureof over 400 chemicals including many toxic psychoactive chemicals whichare largely unstudied and appear in uncontrolled strengths. FACT: The manufacturers of Marinol, Roxane Laboratories Incorporated, donot agree with the pro-marijuana advocates that THC is safe and harmless.In the Physician's Desk Reference, a good portion of the description ofMarinol includes warnings about the adverse effects.. FACT: Comnon sense dictates that it is not good medical practice to allowa substance to be used as a medicine if that product is: 1) not ADA approved 2) ingested by smoking 3) made up of hundreds of different chemicals 4) not subject to product liability regulations 5) exempt from quality control standards 6) not governed by daily dose criteria 7) offered in unknown strengths (THC) from 1 to 10 +percent 8) self-prescribed and self-administered by the patient. FACT: The federal govemment, over the last 20 years involving a number ofadministrations from both political parties has determined that smokingmarijuana has no redeeming medicinal value, and is, in fact, harmful tohealth. These governmental agencies include the Drug Enforcement Administrations,the Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Public Health Service. Theirlatest finding, as recently as 1994, was affirmed in a decision by the U.S.Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. FACT: Since the pro-marijuana lobby has been unsuccessful in dealing withthe federal govemment, they have targeted state and local govemments tolegitimize smoking marijuana as a medicine. A careful examination of theirlegislative and/or ballot proposals reveals they are written to effectivelyneutralize tile enforcement of most marijuana laws. Crude, intoxicatingmarijuana under their proposals would be easier to obtain and use than eventhe most harmless, low level prescription drug. FACT: Major medical and health organizations, as well as the vast majorityof nationally recognized expert medical doctors, scientists and researchers,have not accepted smoking marijuana as a safe and effective medicine. Theseorganizations include: the American Medical Association, the American CancerSociety, National Sclerosis Association, the American Glaucoma Association,American Academy of Ophthalmology, National Eye Institute. National CancerInstitute, National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NationalInstitute of Dental Research, and the National Institute on Allergy andInfectious Diseases. FACT: There are thousands of studies available documenting the harmful physicaland psychological effects of smoking marijuana. The harmful consequencesinclude but are not limited to premature cancer, addiction, coordinationand perception impairment, a number of mental disorders including depression.hostility and increased aggressiveness, general apathy, memory loss, reproductivedisabilities, impairment to the immune system, numerous airway injuries,and other general problems associated with intoxication. FACT: The medicinal marijuana movement and its media campaign have helpedcontribute to the changing attitude among our youth that marijuana is harmless,therefore contributing to the increase of marijuana use among our youngpeople afler 12 years of steady decline. The overriding objective behind this movement is to allow a minority (lessthan five percent) of our society to get "stoned" with impunity.This small minority is willing to put our citizens at risk from all thenegative and disastrous effects caused to and by those who are intoxicated.What we don't need in this society is more intoxicated people on our highways,in workplaces, schools, colleges, or in our homes. We ask you, as concerned citizens, to join us in spreading the truth andcountering the lies propagated by those who want to legalize drugs.

Kaneshiro, Prosecuting Attorney Honolulu, Hawaii Without question, drug abuse in our society has been a major cause of crimeand social disruption. The drug problem has been so enormous that some in our community, misguided by frustration, are listening to the beguiling arguments to legalize or decriminalize drugs. The solution to the drug problem is not to repeal drug laws. The solutionrequires commitment to a balanced strategy of drug education, prevention, treatment and law enforcement. Softening our drug laws would be a terrible mistake. Research information and data clearly show the problem is not drug prohibition, but drug use. When drugs are cheap, plentiful and legal, more people will use them. It is a frightening scenario that envisions more of our citizens, juveniles and adults, using mind-altering substances that not only adversely affect their own behavior and health, but also endanger innocent people. Experience has already shown a link between illegal drug use and crime; thateven the mythical "victimless" use of marijuana can cause a disproportionate amount of serious accidents; and that countries (such as South Korea and Taiwan) learned that tolerating drug abuse only allowed it to grow to intolerable levels among their citizens. Those who do not learn from experience are damned to repeat it. We cannotafford to do this with the drug problem. At stake are the lives of too many of our people in this generation and the next. As Honolulu's Prosecuting Attorney, I ask for your strong commitment to fight--and not surrender--in the war against drugs.

Drug-addicted parents breed drug-addicted babies who grow up severely handicapped, physically and emotionally. They later become drug-addicted juveniles who commit serious violent crime as the influence of drugs reduces inhibitions, undermines judgement, cloudsperceptions, and eliminates conscience. Since most drug users are in the child-bearing years, the cycle continuesand drug-compromised adults face the crucial job of child-rearing, while at the same time dealing with the consequences and the side effects of hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia, physical aggression, impulsive behavior, memory loss and depression. These factors include good parenting. Drugusing parents who come before me are routinely diagnosed as havingamphetamine or cocaine induced delusional disorders, as being gravely disabled, or unable to provide self and family with food and clothing. They are a danger to themselves and others, and they often have 4 to 6 children. The description of cocaine or methamphetamine addicted babies most oftenreads something like this: incessant crying, respiratory breathing problems,rigidity of limbs, blindness, lack of muscle control, inability to sit up or crawl, developmentally disabled, and sometimes retardation. I have watched these children go back and forth between the homes of addict parentand new foster homes where they try to care for the severely handicappedchild and often give up. This child then grows up how? -- abused? molested? neglected? Is it any wonder that these youngsters turn to drugs and crime? Without values, without consistency of love and care, they have learned to use and to abuse. Approximately 90% of abused, neglected, abandoned and molested children inLos Angeles alone are the result of substance abuse. These are dysfunctionalfamilies in the real meaning of the word. This is a phenomenon that we as a state cannot afford. People who use drugs undermine not just their own lives, but make victims of us all as they destroy future generations, overrun our hospital and health care facilities, cause carnage on our highways, anddestroy our cities and neighborhoods as they join gangs, commit crimes andvictimize law-abiding citizens. We have laws to ensure some minimum level of behavior that is universallyrecognized as being essential for a civilized society. It is a futile exercise to suggest that crime can somehow be eliminated or the behavior of a drug user changed by redefining it as legal -- as if a criminal act had no inherent danger other than the fact that it has been placed in the law books of our nation. To legalize this behavior is to condone it and undisputably increase the behavior. This we cannot tolerate! More importantly, laws are the reflection of the values of society. The seriousness with which we hold those values is measured by the penalty imposed when those values are violated. Therefore, I ask you, how do we value our children when illegal drug use is not viewed as the destroyer it is when the penalties for drug use are insignificant? How can we expect a minimum level of behavior in our children, when we send the message that drug use is not harmful or wrong? Drug treatment has not been a panacea, with less than a 25% success rate.We must do everything in our power to prevent and deter the use of drugs, because the high is extremely powerful, and the desire for it almost impossible to stop. In 1988, I chaired the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America. Thatconference held hearings throughout the United States with five thousand principals and over one thousand recovering addicts participating. Every drug user gave the same heartfelt message, "Make it difficult, very difficult to use, because if you don't, the lure and seductiveness of the "high" will prevail." There must be a down to drug use. We must always consider and encouragetreatment and recovery, but sanctions should be commensurate with and reflect the harm drug use does to society. We live in a democracy with freedom to make a choice and freedom to choose consequences. Those who use drugs make their own choices. For some, the choices are more difficult than for others, but there are many free-will choices made before one becomes an addict. There must be sanctions for drug use. When people are considering that choice, considering giving their lives over to drugs, the penalties for the use must have a significant impact on that decision. Drug use is clearly the beginning of crime for the users and the abused whobecome the next generation of users and abusers. Stop the use of illegal drugs, and we will stop much of the crime in California.

The impact of tougherdrug sanctions has been overshadowed by a prevalent myth that U.S. drugenforcement has become Ôtoo punitive' or is a failed approach thatshould be replaced with a Ôpublic health' strategy by diverting enforcementresources into treatment programs. This myth has been packaged and promoted by the multi-million dollar pro-druglegalization lobby, civil libertarians, and misguided academic researchersto the media and public with limited critical review and challenge. Historicalexperience warns that weakening drug enforcement leads to increased societalcosts and problems. Attacks on drug enforcement efforts often hold law enforcement to impossibleand changing performance standards. Law enforcement, treatment, and preventioncomplement one another. None of the credit for a dramatic twelve year declinein drug use among our children is attributed to law enforcement, yet recentincreases in drug use are cited as evidence of enforcement's failure. The Slough of Drug Permissiveness The prevailing myth is that the U.S. has taken a progressively tougher drugenforcement stance for the past 30 years and that this punitive approachhas not been successful or beneficial. The basic premise that the U.S. has taken a progressively more punitivepolicy on drugs is inaccurate and based on faulty measures. When toughnessis re-defined from arrest and incarceration numbers to reflect the proportionof drug arrestees actually incarcerated, one finds that the nation entereda period of drug permissiveness beginning in 1960 and ending in 1980. It is during this period of drug permissiveness and weak punitive sanctionsthat a dramatic rise in crime and violence swept across America. The declinein drug offender incarceration rates was steep and sudden. In 1960, theincarceration rate for drug offenders was over 90 per 1000 arrests, by 1980that figure reached a low point of only 19 of every 1000 offenders beingincarcerated. As drug incarceration rates fell 374% from 1960-1980: Serious crimes increased 215%, on average up 11% per year. Property crime increased 210 %, on average up 11% per year Violent crime increased 252%, on up average 13 % per year Drug use among teens (% who use) climbed 27% from just 1974-1980 Murders increased 100%, an average 5 % per year. Burglary increased 230 %, an average 12 % per year. Drug addiction rates also rose, with heroin use climbing 900% As drug incarceration rates rose 447% from 1980-1994: Serious crimes declined 8% Number of teens who used drugs declined 193% Property crime declined 12 % Murders declined 7% Burglary declined 35% Violent crime rate growth slowed from 13 to 2% per year Heavy cocaine use fell 11% and heavy heroin use 17% from 1988 The entire 215% rise in crime rates experienced during the past three decadesin the U.S. transpired when drug incarceration rates fell below the 1960level during a period of declining incarceration rates for drug offenders.This permissive period also is correlated with rising drug use. Historical experience indicates that arresting drug offenders is not aneffective policy, offenders have to be incarcerated and risk facing consequencesto have an impact. It is only when the U.S. abandoned a permissive treatmentdominated drug policy that the growth in drug use and crime was abated. The Impact of Increasing Drug Incarceration Rates The peak year for murder and property crime in the U.S. was 1978-1980. Drugincarceration rates reached their lowest ebb during these years. After 1980,crime rates began to stabilize and have declined overall as drug incarcerationrates increased. It was not until 1990, that drug incarceration rates reachedthe level the nation was at in 1960. The crime rate began falling againin 1992, as drug incarceration rates reached record levels. Estimates for1994 are that violent crime dropped another 4% and murder, rape, and burglarydropped 5%. U.S. police chiefs believe that the number one way to reduce crime is toreduce drug use. The imposition of mandatory minimum drug penalties in 1988was followed by the nation's largest decrease in drug use. The proportionof murders related to narcotics also has fallen with tougher drug sentencingpractices and the imposition of mandatory minimum laws. Young black males are seven times as likely to be murdered as their whitecounterparts. This racial discrepancy rose during the drug permissive 1970'sand peaked in 1972, when black males were more than 11 times as likely tobe murdered than white males. Are We Tough Enough On Drugs? Myth: Too many non-violent first time minor drug offendersare in prison. Fact: The most comprehensive study ever of U.S. prisonersby the U.S. Department of Justice found the following: 1. 93.5% of state prisoners were either violent or repeat offenders,two thirds are currently in prison for a violent crime (violent crime makesup only 9% of all crime). 2. Only 1.3% of state drug prisoners are not repeat or violent offendersof the 6.5% in this category. 3. Only .6% of state prisoners were in prison for marijuana possession(with unknown quantity) and only 2% were in for marijuana trafficking. 4. In federal prison the average amount of marijuana a traffickerwas involved with was 3.5 tons and cocaine traffickers averaged 183 poundsof cocaine. 5. Only 1.3% of federal prisoners are in prison for drug possessioncharges (average pot possession is 105 pounds). 6. A large number of federal prisoners are aliens and their priorcriminal record may not reflect their entire criminal history. Myth: Drug arrests are increasing and threaten to overwhelmthe criminal justice system if alternatives to the criminal justice approachare not undertaken. Fact: Drug arrests are declining and the criminal justicesystem is not about to be overwhelmed by drug cases. 1. Drug arrests have been decreasing since 1989 and only make up 8%of all arrests nationwide. 2. Federal prosecutors have declined to prosecute an increasing proportionof drug cases. 3. Alternative sentences are being used and growing. 4. Court caseloads for drug offenses have declined the past few yearsand court and prison staff have generally kept pace with increased drugcaseloads. 5. Decriminalization would result in more drug related arrests, alcoholrelated arrests far outnumber drug arrests, with more teens arrested forunderage drinking than drug offenses. Myth: Drug sentences are too harsh and mandatory minimumsshould be repealed. Facts: Drug incarceration rates plummeted through 1980and stronger incarceration and mandatory minimum terms are the result ofpublic demanded. There is evidence that drug sentencing is still inadequate. 1. Despite lengthy terms on paper, the average federal drug possessorimprisoned served only 8 months. 2. Those convicted of a federal drug possession offense were lesslikely to be incarcerated than those convicted of liquor law or motor carrierregulatory violations. 3. The proportion of drug offenders who are traffickers has increasedas drug possession convictions and incarceration declined since the late1980's.

Volume 1, No. 1, February1994| Marijuana absent in 1993 scientific review of glaucoma treatment G!aucoma treatment was thoroughly reviewed in the New England Journal ofMedicine, Vol. 328, p. 1103, 1993, by Quigley. Marijuana was not mentionedin the review of effective medications for treatment of this disorder. Forprecise control of the intraocular pressure usually associated with thisdisease, frequent monitoring of patients receiving a drug that deliversuniform doses is necessary. Commentary: Except in rare instances glaucoma is a symptomlessdisease until loss of eyesight begins. Most, but not all patients afflictedwith glaucoma, experience increased intraocular pressure which, if leftuntreated, will lead to blindness. Since there are many effective medications,and since doses of marijuana by smoking cannot be controlled, using smokedmarijuana to treat glaucoma is potentially dangerous. Because the baseline (normal) pressure varies from individual to individual,this disease and its treatment must be carefully monitored and tailoredto each patient. Though marijuana, like alcohol, can reduce intraocularpressure, the dose cannot be controlled and risk of damage due to eitherexcessive or inadequate lowering of pressure could lead to blindness. Further,the side effects associated with marijuana use, such as impairment of motorskills, are not present with currently available approved therapies. Toassure the best outcome for this disease, frequent monitoring of patientsreceiving a drug that delivers uniform doses is necessary. Suppository form of Delta 9 THC better than oral form for treatingappetite loss Struwe et al, in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy, vol. 27, pp. 827-831, 1993,reported a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial withtwo 5-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week washout period. Patientsreceived dronabinol (Marina) 5 mg twice daily before meals, or a placebo.Twelve HlV-infected patients who had lost at least five pounds participatedin the study. Only five patients were able to complete the protocol becauseof various side effects of delta 9 THC. In the subjects who completed thestudy, there was no statistically significant weight gain, increased serumproteins, or improved appetite. Commentary: Smoking marijuana has been alleged to be goodfor the loss of appetite seen in AIDS patients. Because inhallation of irritants(which potentially could be contaminated with fungi) poses a needless andserious endangerment to the already compromised immune systems of AIDS patients,this practice would appear risky. Oral delta 9 THC, the synthetic form of the most active cannabinoid in marijuana,would seem to be a better choice, but recent research on its efficacy wasdisappointing. Thus, in a selected group of HIV infected patients, a controlledstudy failed to support any effect of delta 9 THC to increase appetite. Perhaps the recent report by Mattes and associates, in the journal, Pharmacology,Biochemistry, and Behavior, vol. 44, pp. 745-747, 1993, of a rectal formof THC which was well-tolerated, would be of benefit. This drug producedhigher and more sustained plasma levels which should enhance its efficacyas an anti-vomiting drug in chemotherapy and, perhaps, as an appetite stimulant.This would completely avoid the necessity to have a smoked form of the drugin which a variable amount of active drug is delivered with each cigaretteand further compromises damaged immune systems. Marijuana carries serious risk for those under treatment formental illness Tardive dyskinesia is a condition in which abnormal involuntary movementsdevelop, producing serious necrologic disability. Some patients treatedfor schizophrenia with drugs such as chlorpromazine, develop this seriouscondition as a side effect of therapy. New research published by Zaretskyin the journal, Schizophrenia Research, Vol. 11, pp. 3-8, 1993, shows thata major risk factor for development of this complication of neuroleptictherapy is current or past use of cannabis. A study of 51 chronic neuroleptictreatedoutpatients with diagnoses of schizophrenia showed that current use of cannibisfar outdistanced any other risk factor such as cigarette smoking, caffeine,or alcohol use. The authors concluded that even "recreational"use of marijuana or hashish in patients treated with these drugs was dangerous. Commentary: This study adds to the current literature confirmingthat up to 60% of schizophrenic patients use non-prescription psychoactivedrugs. O Marijuana components damage the ability of human immune cellsto function. Recent work by Watzl et al, Drugs of Abuse Immunity and Immunodeficiency,1991, and Djeu et al, published in the same journal, showed that the majorpsychoactive component of marijuana, delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)is able to interfere with the function of white blood cells taken from humans.Both neutrophils, which fight bacterial infection, and mononuclear cellsof the immune system, which fight viruses, were suppressed by various concentrationsof THC. Schwartz, in the Journal of Hospital and Community Psychiatry, Vol. 38,p. 531, May 1987, pointed out that marijuana use is a factor in preparingthe ground for HIV infection and that in the list of risk-reducing behaviorsfor patients with HIV, a significant preventative step might be to discouragethe use of marijuana among those at risk. It is of interest, as pointed out by Pillia, in the Archives of Toxicology,Vol. 65, pp. 609-617, 1991, that drugs of abuse, as well as alcohol, haveimmunotoxic properties which include marked changes in the cellular, humoral,and other components of the immune defense mechanism. Commentary: Applying this work to human beings would suggestthat marijuana smoke would depress those immune cells which protect thebody from viral or bacterial infections. This would be particularly dangerousin patients with already compromised immune systems, such as those withAIDS. Thus, since a large majority of people with AIDS have a well-establishedhistory of drug and alcohol abuse, Such a compromise of the immune systemcan render the body more susceptible to the development of AIDS after HIVinfection.

Volume 1, No. 2, July 1994 Fungal sinus infection associated with marijuana use Marijuana smoke is often contaminated by the fungus, aspergillus, (Kagenet al, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 71, pp. 389-393,1983). A report by these authors showed that 11 of 12 samples they testeddemonstrated various species of the fungus, aspergillus. It then was ofgreat interest when Brummund, in the Journal of the American Medical Association,vol. 256, pp. 3249-3253, 1986, reported cases of allergic sinus infectionwith the same fungus from the recreational use of contaminated marijuana. Commentary: Fungal sinus infections can be very difficultto treat and can lead to destruction of the sinuses with involvement ofthe brain and central nervous system. Marijuana implicated in fatal fungal infection A 34-year-old man who had undergone a bone marrow transplant for chronicleukemia was reported to have developed a fatal disseminated fungal infectionassociated with a contaminated batch of marijuana cigarettes used heavilyfor several weeks prior to his admission to the hospital (Chestvol. 94/2,pp. 432-433, 1988). Commentary: Noting that "Invasive aspergillosis hasbecome a significant cause of death in immunosuppressed patients" Theauthors, Hamadeh and associates, reported the case so that physicians wouldbe aware of this potentially lethal complication of marijuana use in compromisedhosts such as patients with AIDS or malignancies. Aspergillus spores are found throughout the environment in soil, air, andvegetable matter, including tobacco and marijuana. However, smoking contaminatedplant material, puts a concentration of the fungi directly into the lungsand blood stream placing smokers/ patients without intact immune systemsat extreme risk. Marijuana use impairs function in all areas Psychological tests measuring intelligence, memory, and other mental functions,were given to 26 heavy cannabis users and compared with a control groupby Varma reported in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 21, pp.147-152, 1988. A heavy cannabis user was defined as a person consuming cannabisfor five years, 20 or more times per month, with a daily intake equivalentto 150 mg of delta-9 THC, 3 to 5 joints depending on the concencentration. Commentary: These authors found that the cannabis users,with an average of 6.8 years of use, were found to react very slowly inperforming motor tasks, but more importantly, suffered disability in personal,social, and vocational areas. They also indicated a higher score for neuroticand psychotic behavior. This is consistent with several other recent studieslinking marijuana smoking to behavioral problems. Marijuana smoking linked to increased lung damage Marijuana smoke is known to be as irritating as tobacco smoke. Researchby Barbers and associates American Review of Respiratory Marijuana ResearchReview, Volume 1, No.2, July 1994 Diseases, vol. 135, pp. 1271 -1275, 1987, showed that smoking of both marijuanaand tobacco caused the small oxygen exchanging parts of the lung to shedinflammatory cells. The smoking of marijuana and tobacco together increasedthis reaction significantly above smoking either drug alone, and marijuanacaused an adverse effect on the lungs that was independent of and additiveto that of tobacco. 19 healthy non-smokers and 43 healthy smokers of tobaccoand/or marijuana took part in the study. Commentary: None of these individuals had any previoushistory of chronic lung disease. These lung inflammatory changes are earlyfindings in individuals who go on to develop malignancy, chronic infection,and emphysema in their lungs. Pre-employment screening for marijuana use makes good economicsense Zwerling and associates, in the Journal of the American Medicine Association,vol. 264, pp. 2639-2643, 1990, present a prospective controlled study ofthe association between pre-employment drug screening tests and adverseemployment outcomes in 2,537 postal employees. "This was a blind study:the employees, hiring officials, medical personnel and management officialsdid not know the results of the urine drug screens at any time during thestudy. The study was designed to detect and measure any association betweenthe presence of marijuana and/or or cocaine on a preemployment drug screenand employment outcomes such as employee turnover, absenteeism, accidents,injuries, and discipline." Commentary: The purpose of the study was to substantiateor disprove claims that drug-abusing employees have substantially more accidentsat work, many more compensable injuries, and use significantly more sickleave than those who do not use illicit drugs. The study showed that marijuana users had "55% more industrial accidents,85% more injuries and a 78% increase in absenteeism." It also showedthat cocaine users had a 145% increase in absenteeism and an 85% increasein injuries. The mean absence rate from the job was 7.1% for marijuana userscompared to 4% for non-users. The study showed that pre-employment drug screens positive for marijuanaand cocaine were associated with significant adverse employment outcomesupporting the use of such screening for economic and health reasons. Marijuana continues to be available for scientific research Since the 1970's more than 10,500 scientific studies have been conductedon marijuana. The marijuana (cannabis) used in the studies is obtained fromthe Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Mississippi,who produce a standardized marijuana specifically for research. Materialto be used in clinical trials is shipped to Research Triangle Institutein North Carolina where it is processed into marijuana cigarettes. It isthen made available for Researchers following proper protocol and paperworkfiled with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in that form. Questionsregarding the availability of marijuana should be directed to Dr. Rao Rapakaor Dr. Paul Hillery at NIDA (301-443-4250). Per Mahmoud A.

Volume 1, No. 3, October1994 Dangerous side effects of cocaine are amplified when used inconjunction with marijuana Drug-using volunteers were used in a study to determine the effect thatmarijuana smoking had on their subsequent use of cocaine. Lukas and colleagues(Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, Vol 48:715721, 1994). The studyfound that the increase in heart rate due to cocaine was markedly enhancedif preceded by smoking marijuana, and that the time to the cocaine highwas reduced from two minutes to one minute. Most importantly there was doublethe amount of drug absorption evident when marijuana use preceded cocaineuse. Commentary: Many drug users use two or more drugs at thesame time. In analyses of polydrug use, marijuana is the most heavily usedillicit drug. Because it enhances the cocaine experience, it is commonlyused in combination with this drug. People snorting cocaine after smoking marijuana are at greater risk of overdoseand more severe cardiovascular effects from the cocaine. Variability inthe nasal effects of both drugs makes dosing unpredictable and dangerous. Study on use of THC to treat HlV-wasting syndrome shows no weightgain. A review of the current treatment for the HIV-wasting syndrome reportedon studies with dronabinol, which has an approved use for anorexia in AIDSpatients. Schroeder, Hart, and Lynch (Annals of Pharmacotherapy, Vol 28:595-597,1993). Dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana,was approved by the FDA based on a double-blind placebo-controlled clinicaltrial involving 139 AIDS patients in 18 centers. Patients with a five-pound weight loss, no active infection, and no marijuanause for 30 days were included in the study. Dronabinol was given in a doseof 2.5 mg orally twice a day to the treatment group with a placebo controlgroup. Patients reported an increase in appetite after six weeks of therapy.However, there was less than a half-pound weight gain in treated patientswhich was not statistically different from the one-pound weight loss inthe placebo group at the end of the six week period. The authors conclude that the efficacy of dronabinol in reversing the wastingprocess associated with AIDS is yet to be determined, and that the subjectiveincrease in appetite did not necessarily correspond to increased body weight. Commentary: AIDS wasting is a devastating complicationof infection with the AIDS virus. The drug megestrol has been recently approvedby the FDA and is far more effective than dronabinol in the studies to date. Likewise, no scientific studies have confirmed a benefit of the use of crudemarijuana on HlV-wasting syndrome. Additionally, for the AIDS patient, smokinga substance with fungal and bacterial contamination, as well as the inherentdamage by the smoke to lungs already predisposed to infection, would becounterproductive. Review of anti-nausea drugs show restricted use for syntheticcannabinoids Grunder and Hesketh (New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 329:1790-1795,1993) recently reviewed current therapies for chemotherapy-induced vomitingcontrol. The authors discuss the vomiting response and the neural pathwaysinvolved in mediating that response. Regarding the use of cannabinoids,the authors state that dronabinol and nabilone, the two cannabinoids thathave been evaluated most thoroughly, are active only in patients receivingmild, not severely, emetogenic chemotherapy. The authors state that these drugs have serious side effects, however, includingdysphoria, vertigo, hallucinations, sedation, and disorientation, and areseldom selected as first-line anti-emetic therapy. They point out that whilethese drugs have limited usage, some synthetic cannabinoids with no psychotropicactivity have anti-emetic properties, suggesting that there are separatesites of action for the anti-vomiting and the psychotropic activity. Commentary: With the availability of newer anti-emeticdrugs which are more potent, more effective and have less side effects inreversing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, the use of drugswith major side effects should be avoided. One common assumption about taking anti-emetics orally is that the patientsare already vomiting and cannot keep the medication down. However, all anti-emetictherapy is given prior to administration of chemotherapy drugs, before theonset of nausea and vomiting. Further, if the need for additional anti-emeticmedication were indicated it could be administered in suppository form. Study looks at immunologic impact of tobacco and marijuana smokeon the lungs Wallace and associates, in Chest, Vol. 105:847-852, studied the effect ofheavy, habitual marijuana use and compared it with tobacco smoking on thecomposition of cells in the peripheral blood and small airways of the lung. Cell samples from 14 non-smokers were compared to samples from 14 tobaccosmokers, 19 heavy habitual marijuana smokers, and 9 patients who smokedboth substances. The tobacco smokers had lower percentages of cells in theirsmall airways that had the marker for the CD4 or helper T-cells. Marijuanause had the opposite effect of lowering the CD8 positive cells, so-calledsuppressor cells, at the expense of CD4 cells. The authors concluded thattobacco and marijuana have effects on immune cells and blood lymphocytepopulations that differ from each other, both in type and magnitude. Commentary: These data are further examples of informationfrom the group of Tashkin et al which show the effects of tobacco and marijuanasmoke on the intrinsic cells in the lung and the immunologic defenses ofthe lungs. A combination of tobacco and marijuana would be devastating interms of exposure of patients to carcinogens, and also in damaging the immuneresponse to foreign particles, bacteria, and viruses. Immunologic alterationsthat were observed in the study were of potential importance because theycorrelated with the adverse health effects of smoking either substance,alone or in combination.

Volume 2, No. 1, January1995 Study shows MS patients further impaired by smoking low-THCmarijuana. Greenburg et al, in their paper in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,Vol. 55:324-328, 1994, performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlledstudy of inhaled marijuana smoke on balance and coordination responses inten adult patients with spastic multiple sclerosis, and normal volunteerswho were matched for age, sex, and weight. A sophisticated computer controlledvideo system was used to identify responses. The study showed that marijuanasmoking enhanced the abnormalities already present in MS patients and thatsmoking just one marijuana cigarette containing 1.5% delta-9 THC increasedthe objective errors in these responses. The authors concluded that marijuanasmoking impairs coordination and balance in patients with spastic MS. Commentary: This is an objective and well done controlledstudy which strongly refutes anecdotes suggesting that marijuana is beneficialfor patients with multiple sclerosis. In the absence of data showing anybenefit, this documentation of an adverse effect is disturbing and shouldbe heeded by those who would consider using smoked marijuana for treatmentof this disorder. Low doses of THC found to cause learning deficits Kamine et al, in their article in Behavior of Pharmacology, Vol 5:71-78,1994, studied the effects of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the learningand performance ability of eight healthy subjects (19-32 years of age) allof whom had occasionally used marijuana, as well as other psychoactive drugs,but were not perceived to be drug dependent. Subjects were given placebocapsules, and 10 mg. and 20 mg. capsules of THC, ("...roughly equivalentto smoking a marijuana cigarette containing 2.3-3.6% THC") Oral THC caused measurable learning deficits which, the authors concluded,might be disasterous in some environments, such as operating "the cabof a speeding locomotive." They pointed out that the "learningdeficit from a single dose might become quite relevant if it accumulatesover time." Commentary: In regular marijuana users, the presence ofa learning deficit with a single dose of drugs and five hours of post-therapymonitoring is sobering. In view of the greatly increased potentcy of marijuanaover the past decade and the recent rise in its use by teenagers and pre-adolescentchildren, this should be particularly alarming to parents and educators.This report contributes to the body of evidence showing that "recreationaluse of marijuana is not a benign habit in terms of intellectual performance." Marijuana's implication in a number of chronic diseases reflectsits harmful impact on the immune system. Immune defenses against fungal organisms are triggered by natural killercells. If this system is upset, the susceptibility to fungal infectionsis enhanced. Cusher et al, in their report in Cellular Immunology (Vol 154:99-108,1994) incubated human large granular lymphocytes (human immune cells) withvarying concentrations of THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol). The concentrationsused mirrored what would be obtained in the blood of people smoking marijuanaor taking the drug dronabinol. They found that low levels of THC inhibitedtumor necrosis factor thereby weakening the killing activity of lymphocytesagainst tumor cells. Commentary: It is well-known that substance abuse may compromiseimmune response to a variety of infectious agents. Marijuana, a widely abuseddrug around the world, and its components, have adverse effects on the immunesystem. This study is another of a series showing that, in the test tube,concentrations of the major psychoactive metabolites of marijuana are capableof impairing the ability of human immune cells to kill tumors and destroyfungal cells. The importance of this report is that the relatively low concentrationswhich mimic drug use in humans, cause these profound depressions of immuneactivity. Marijuana not listed in latest review of beneficial treatmentfor Multiple Sclerosis Because of frequent claims that smoking marijuana provides therapeutic benefitto victims of multiple sclerosis, the extensive and well documented reviewof all the effective therapies for treatment of this disease, by G. C. Eber,The Lancet, Vol 343, January 29, 1994, is included in this publication. Eber notes in his review that multiple sclerosis (MS) "...is unpredictable,being characterized by a tendency to relapse and remission and/or to stabilisationwithout treatment." He notes that the natural history of the diseaseis well-defined and states that trial and error can no longer be reasonablyapplied to the search for effective therapies. Eber concludes that althoughclinical symptoms and anecdotes are valuable, highly sensitive objectivemethods are now available in the form of serial MRI scans to document improvementof the disease with such exciting therapies as beta-interferon. Commentary: This extremely complete review of multiplesclerosis therapy puts to rest any contention that smoked marijuana is goodfor this disorder and can be given without side effects. There simply areno data to support the safe or effective use of either smoked marijuanaor dronabinol for treatment of MS. Eber's warning of the need for objectivedata when judging a therapy for this complex disease is well worth heeding. Marijuana use linked to homicide In terms of life-time use, marijuana was reported to be the most commonillicit drug used by a sample of 268 murderers incarcerated in New YorkState correctional facilites, for homicides that occurred in 1984. Spuntet al ("The Role of Marijuana in Homicide," International Journalof the Addictions, Vol. 29:195-213,1994) About one-third of prisoners who had used marijuana, had used it in the24-hour period before the homicide, and three-quarters of those said theyexperienced some kind of effect from the drug when the homicide occurred.The authors speculate that drugs and violence may be linked in a varietyof complex ways. Commentary: It is clear that abnormal behavior inducedby the use of psychoactive drugs plays a significant role in violent crimeswhich are completely unrelated to either drug profits or trafficking. Manyof the murderers interviewed for this study stated they felt that marijuanause was a factor in their crimes. Recent well-publicized violent murders,such as the tragic rape and murder of 12 year-old Polly Klaus, were alsocommitted by people who admitted to being under the influence of marijuanaat the time of their homicides.

Volume 2, No. 2. March l995 Cannabis use found to increase frequency of relapse in patientswith schizophrenia The literature examining the relationship between marijuana use and schizophrenicsymptoms among patients with schizophrenic disorders has been conflicting.The purpose of this study by Linzen et al (Archives General Psychiatry,Vol. 51, pg. 273-279, 1994), was to compare cannabis-using schizophrenicpatients with schizophrenic non-users. There were 11 mild and 13 heavy cannabisusers compared to 69 non-users in a prospective study which lasted one year.The authors found that significantly more and earlier psychotic relapsesoccurred in the cannabis-using group, particularly as use increased. Noother factors could be found to explain this including other street drugs. Fourteen of the cannabis-using patients, who were experiencing clinicalremission from their schizophrenia, reported an immediate increase in psychiatricsymptoms after using cannabis again. In all but one of the patients cannabis use also preceded the onset of theirfirst psychotic symptom. Over the one-year period only 20 percent of thenon-using subjects had a psychotic relapse, as compared to 46 percent forthose who used cannabis . Commentary: This study helps to clarify the relationshipbetween cannabis use and schizophrenia. While studies such as this cannotprove cause-and-effect relationships, it is clear that use of cannabis cancause patients with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, to havemore frequent relapse of symptoms compared to non-users of cannabis. Animportant feature of this study was that the groups were matched for variables,such as the use of other street drugs or alcohol, making these factors notrelevant in interpretation of the results. Findings of this study are consistentwith the observations of prior studies showing that cannabis use prior toillness was an independent risk factor for schizophrenic symptoms. Smoking Tobacco or Marijuana Reduces Antioxidant Levels in HlV-lnfectedPatients Miguez-Verbano and colleagues from the University of Miami School of Medicinereported at the American College of Clinical Pharmacology meeting in 1994that anti-oxidant status was negatively impacted in 60 non-symptomatic HlV-infectedmarijuana smokers. Vitamin E levels were significantly lower in marijuana users, as well ascigarette smokers, compared to non-smoking HIV infected subjects. Subjectswho used both tobacco and marijuana exhibited frank vitamin E deficiency,although vitamin E intake did not differ significantly among the groups. These findings show that marijuana and tobacco smoking have a detrimentaleffect on vitamin E status of HlV-infected individuals. This is of concernin light of the important role of vitamin E in immune processes, includinginhibition of viral activation. Commentary: This well done study shows further evidencethat smoking marijuana contributes to defects in the immune system. Theissue of smoking marijuana for an HlV-infected patient makes absolutelyno sense in terms of preserving immune function to fight the virus thatcauses the disease. Antioxidant levels also have an important effect onpreventing cardiovascular disease and cancer, both of which would be importantin HlV-infected individuals. Study examines the use of psychoactive and addictive drugs byphysicians Lutsky et al studied the current use of psychoactive drugs of abuse by physiciansspecializing in medicine, surgery, and anesthesia, all of whom had trainedat the same academic institution. (Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia 1994/41:7/pp561-7)1624 questionnaires were sent with a response rate of 58 percent. Difference in impairment rate among the physicians was not significant:in surgery 14 percent, medicine 20 percent, and anesthesia 17 percent. Substanceabuse was clearly associated with a family history of substance abuse. Increasedstress at various career stages did not appear to increase substance abuse.Substances most frequently abused were marijuana 55 percent, amphetamines33 percent, and benzodiazepines 25 percent. A number of respondants reported that the use of alcohol and drugs by facultyrole models during their medical training was an important part of theirown personal use. Drug counseling programs and diversion programs were judgedinadequate by most respondents. Commentary: No subset of society is immune from substanceabuse in a modern social context. Obviously, better detection and treatmentprograms are necessary for the prevention and control of this problem, whichimpairs medical judgment and places patients interests at great risk. In the United States, only 3 percent of practicing physicians are anesthesiologists,yet 13 percent of physicians being treated for drug dependency are anesthesiologists,presumably because of the ease of access to these substances in this medicalspecialty. The data from this survey pointed out that most drug use started prior toentry into medical school. The authors suggested that programs aimed atdeterrents failed at least partially because there are no universally acceptabledrug screening methods, and because penalties for drug use are insufficientlysevere. Substance abuse by faculty represented another setback to any prospectfor deterring physicians in training. Study shows two marijuana cigarettes as harmful as 28 of tobacco. This study by Starr et al followed 25 non-tobacco smoking surfers, in excellentphysical condition, who smoked an average of two marijuana joints per day.The control was 25 male urban smokers from the San Francisco area and 25non-smoking male Mormons from the Silicon Valley area. Damage and irritationto the lung cells of the marijuana smokers was comparable to those who smokeda mean of 28 tobacco cigarettes per day. (Medical Tribune, page 17,1994) Commentary: Tobacco smoke is the most widespread factorassociated with premature death due to cancer and cardiovascular diseasein the USA. This study shows that cellular damage to the lungs producedby daily use of two marijuana cigarettes is similar to that seen in thosewho smoke nearly a pack and a half of tobacco cigarettes a day.

Volume 2, No. 3, June 1995 Increase in unprotected sex in urban minority youth blamed onuse of alcohol or marijuana It is now established that regular condom use can decrease the spread ofAIDS. A recent study by Ford and Norris (Journal of the Acquired ImmuneDeficiency Syndrome, Vol 7:389-396, 1994), studied the effects of the useof alcohol and marijuana in the context of sexual relationships and theimpact of these substances on the consistency of condom use by urban minorityyouth. The sample design and field work were conducted by the Survey Research Centerof the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. A totalof 1435 interviews were obtained from Hispanic and African-American youngadults, ages 15-24, residing in low-income areas in Detroit. Results indicated that when alcohol and marijuana were used with a sexualpartner, the consistency of condom use decreased even when other variablesrelated to sexual history were controlled. Alcohol use had a greater negativeeffect on condom use for Hispanic men, and marijuana for African-Americanwomen, than it did for Hispanic women and African-American men. The authors concluded that safe sex intervention programs for urban lowincome minority youth need to emphasize the risk of AIDS virus exposurethat results from substance use, casual sex, and sex with multiple partners. Commentary: Aside from the many obvious adverse side effects,use of alcohol and marijuana among teenagers may contribute to the spreadof AIDS. Clearly, it is counter-productive to give a safe sex message without alsopointing out that the behavior produced by the use of alcohol and marijuanalessens the likelihood that safe sex will be performed. This factor is oftenoverlooked in drug prevention programs and sexual eduation courses when,in fact, these things should be considered together. Delta 9 THC affects metabolism in human blood cells Delta 9 THC is known to inhibit a variety of immune functions. Diaz andcolleagues, in their paper in the Journal of Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics, 268:1289-1296, 1994, show that THC, when incubated with cellsfrom the blood of normal humans, caused increased release of a variety ofmetabolites that stimulate acute inflammation. These metabolites are potentagents that can cause asthma, and which enhance the activity of other cellswhich suppress immune defense against virus and other infectious agents. Commentary: This paper is one of the first to show thatnormal human cells, when incubated with concentrations of THC equivalentto that found in the blood of regular smokers of marijuana, cause immunecells to release compounds which promote inflammation within the lungs,and at the same time, suppress the natural defenses against external bacterialand viral agents that cause disease. While these studies are conducted in the test tube, the implications forsmoking marijuana in humans, particularly those who smoke or with a tendencytowards asthma or respiratory disease are obvious. Attempt made to use marijuana to treat Tourette's Syndrome A nurse consultant and a visiting psychiatrist reported on a single caseof Tourette's Syndrome treated successfully with smoked marijuana (Hemmingand Yellowlees, Journal of Psychopharmacology 7-4 1993 pp. 389-391 ). Tourette's Syndrome is a disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocaltics. The tics occur many times daily and may include obscenities and otherstrange behaviors. Untreated, the disorder tends to be a lifelong diseasecharacterized by remissions and relapses. Haloperidol (Haldol) is the drugof choice in the treatment of this disorder. The patient they reported started to smoke marijuana at age 35 to get reliefwhile he continued his Haldol. The anecdotal improvement prompted the casereport. There was no stopping of the drug to see if symptoms returned, andno rechallenge with marijuana. Commentary: This report is the type of anecdote used tosupport claims for the use of smoked marijuana to treat disease. It is interestingthat the standard treatment of Haldol was continued throughout the periodof marijuana use with this patient, and there was no placebo control orrechallenge involved. There are ways of using drugs in single patients,known as the "n of 1" method. Efficacy as well as side effectscan be monitored using this method in a single patient. This was not donehere. It is also of interest that there is no objective documentation ofimprovement in Tourette's Syndrome in the patient. Neither of the authorshas any expertise in neurologic diseases. Nicotine is also known to potentiatethe effects of Haldol in improving motor tics in this disorder. It is possiblethat any one of the 4000 components found in marijuana smoke provided beneficialeffects, if, in fact, they did occur. Study finds self-reporting of Illicit drug use differs greatlyfrom actual test results. Self-reporting by users, of the frequency of their drug use, is the measureused In a variety of studies regarding prevention strategies, needle exchangeprograms, and effects of treatment interventions, to indicate the successrate of these programs. The report by Hindin in the International Journal of the Addictions, 29:771-789,1994, highlights the fact that when an objective measurement is done, suchas an assay of hair for actual determination of cocaine, heroine, and marijuanause, the indication is far greater than that reported by the user. Among a group of patients followed up post-treatment, only 51 percent ofcocaine positive people and 67 percent of heroin positive people gave anaccurate history by their own self report. The correlation with marijuanawas even weaker. Commentary: The study emphasizes the folly of dependingon self reporting as an outcome variable in any study regarding the efficacyof treatment and prevention programs. Objective measures of exposure need to be done because of the notoriousinaccuracy of self reporting. This self reporting, with its obvious pitfalls,is, however, currently being used to prove "efficacy" of needleexchange programs which claim to limit the spread of HIV by providing "clean"needles to addicts. The purported success of these programs is based, inpart, on self reporting by the addict of whether or not they shared needles.O Material used in this publication has been reviewed and commented on byWilliam M.

Thiseffect was independent of the age of the men. In the same issue of the NewEngland Journal of Medicine, Howards, page 312, pointed out that male infertilityis often related to lifestyle factors such as the use of marijuana, anabolicsteroids, and cocaine. Commentary: While associations such as these do not provecause and effect, it is of interest that illicit drug use could be a majorfactor in the decline of fertility among men over the past two decades.The authors of the original paper admit to not having another explanationand acknowledge that environmental or lifestyle factors could be playinga major role. Lower IQ in Toddlers Linked to Prenatal Exposure to Marijuana. Researchers (Day et al. Neurotoxicology and Teratology 16, 169-175, 1994),found ''significant negative effects of prenatal marijuana exposure on theperformance" of both African-American and Caucasian children in standardintelligence tests. This negative effect on the child was related to marijuanaexposure during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. On average,children exposed prenatally to marijuana will have a lower IQ compared tochildren who are not exposed, even when the effects of various environmentalfactors are adjusted for. Commentary: The children involved in this study were trackedfrom birth to three years. The study, which included an equal number ofCaucasian and African-American women, most of whom were single and of lowersocioeconomic status, suggesting that marijuana, not race or other prenatalfactors, accounts for these changes. Sleeping Problems Found in Toddlers Exposed to Marijuana Prenatal exposure to marijuana showed impairment in sleep pattern and moreawake time after sleep onset in exposed children, at age three, comparedto control children (Dahl and colleagues in the journal, Archives of Pediatricand Adolescent Medicine, 149:145-150, 1995). Sleep deprivation is frequentlyassociated with emotional and behavioral difficulties and reduced attentionspan, symptoms which could be associated with other psychiatric problemsas well. Marijuana directly impacts the part of the brain that regulatessleep and arousal, causing concern that prenatal use of marijuana couldaffect the development of that part of the brain, resulting in permanentchanges in sleeping patterns. Commentary: While studies of prenatal marijuana exposureand long-term follow-up of children so exposed are rare, the weight of theevidence suggests that this exposure is not without adverse consequencesfor the child. Substance use during Vietnam conflict associated with nine timeshigher mortality rate than that for civilians Price et al., from Washington University School of Medicine, presented longterm follow-up studies on a group of Vietnam veterans, now in their mid-40's,compared to civilian controls who did not serve in Vietnam. Veterans whotested positive for drugs upon their return from Southeast Asia, had a ninetimes higher death rate than that of the civilian controls. The death ratefor veterans who tested negative for drugs was still four times higher.The authors concluded that substance use in the Vietnam experience playeda key role in the increased mortality. This is a culmination of a landmark study started in 1972 and consists of900 soldiers who had come home from Vietnam the year before. All had beentested for drug use. Three year follow-up interviews were conducted in 1974when civilian controls were also added to the sample. The current studytracks the original participants. Available data in the present study show that a sizeable percentage of deceasedveterans who tested positive for drugs died of drug and/or alcohol relatedcauses according lo death certificates. Of the deceased drug positive veterans37 percent had alcohol or drug related causes of death, and 14 percent werefound to be homicide victims. While these men tested positive in one single drug test, the authors notedthat it was interesting that this one test seemed to have predicted boththe high mortality and a high risk of certain causes of death. The authorsnoted that drug use was not the only statistically significant predictorof premature death, since veterans who tested negative for drugs still hada four times higher death rate than men of similar age and background whodid not go to Vietnam. Commentary: This important study should carry major alarmmessages for those who advocate casual drug use and minimalize the impacton the medical and psychiatric health of the population. Toxic Psychosis Produced by Marijuana Smoking While on Antabuse A 36-year-old man who was on Antabuse alcohol treatment smoked marijuanaas a substitute for alcohol. He immediately developed an acute toxic psychosiswith disorientation, lack of reality, and a manic psychosis. This lastedfor 48 hours. The manufacturers of Antabuse have had one previous reportof this type of drug interaction (Lacoursiere et al., American Journal ofPsychiatry, 140:242-244, 1983.) Commentary: People attesting to a relative safety of marijuanaforget that there are interactions between many drugs that may lead to adversereactions. This example of an acute toxic psychosis in someone under treatmentfor alcohol abuse emphasizes the potential for marijuana interactions withprescription and non-prescription substances.

The offspring have been assessed repeatedly duringthe neonatal period and at least annually up unto the i age of 6. Whileearlier reports of children to age 3 did not reveal an association betweendefects associated with in utero exposure to marijuana (memory, languagedevelopment, visual perceptual functioning), later follow-up could distinguishbetween marijuana exposed children and control children. Prenatal marijuana exposure showed that at age 4 and older children showedincreased behavioral problems and decreased performance on visual perceptualtasks, language comprehension sustained attention and memory. The authorconcluded that the nature and the timing of the appearance of these deficitswas consistent with the notion that prenatal marijuana exposure adverselyaffected behavior that is goal-directed which includes planning, organizedsearch, and impulse control. These findings suggested to the author thatchronic marijuana use impacted on functioning of the prefrontal lobe inthe brain. Commentary: This study documents that the adverse effects of prenatalexposure may not become apparent until the child grows old enough to performhigh level tests such as those termed executive functioning. The dangerof drawing short-term conclusions from effects that, while introduced inutero may take a generation to discover, have been amply documented forother poisons ingested by expectant mothers such as lead, cocaine, and alcohol.Some authors have suggested that differences in the functioning of childrenexposed in utero to marijuana to nonexposed children often disappear byage 2-3. However, effects of marijuana cannot be determined until enoughtime has passed so that the children are expected to perform. Then, andonly then, can their performance be accurately assessed. This prospectivestudy provides valuable insights into the many insidious problems associatedwith the use of marijuana. Prenatal use of tobacco and marijuana by adolescent mothers causes increaseddamage to infants Cornelius et al. studied the effects of tobacco and marijuana use duringpregnancy on length of gestation, growth, and formation of 310 childrenof adolescent mothers (Pediatrics 95:738-743). The subjects were interviewedat mid-pregnancy and after delivery to obtain information on their use oftobacco, marijuana, and other substances before and during pregnancy. Theinfants were examined by physicians 24-36 hours after birth. The averagematernal age was 16. Prenatal tobacco use was associated with reduced birthweight, length, andcircumferences of head and chest, but not the gestational age or the numberof physical abnormalities of the baby. Prenatal marijuana smoking was associatedwith increased premature birth. Additionally, some physical abnormalitieswere associated with the use of marijuana during the first trimester amongthe white participants in the study These effects of prenatal tobacco andmarijuana smoke were prominent despite the lower levels of exposure in theseoffspring as compared with the offspring of mothers of adult age. The authorsconcluded that the risk of adverse effects from use of tobacco or marijuanaduring pregnancy may be increased for offspring of adolescent mothers. Commentary: Under the best of circumstances, infants of adolescentmothers are 2-6 times more likely to be of low birthweight compared to infantsof adult women, and these infants are at increased risk for prematurity,complications, and infant mortality. During the first year of life, themortality of children born to teenagers is 2-3 times that of infants bornto older mothers, and there is a 6-told increase of Sudden Infant DeathSyndrome, Hectman L. Teenage mothers and their children: risks and problems:A review, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 34:569-575, 1989. The currentstudy points out that the use of tobacco or marijuana can be associatedwith adverse effects on newborns. The authors found that adolescent motherswho smoked tobacco during pregnancy were more likely to binge on alcoholand use other illicit drugs in the first trimester. Mothers who smoked heavilyhad significantly lower pre-pregnancy weight. Similarly, teenagers who usedmarijuana tended to use more tobacco and drink more alcohol, particularlyin the crucial first trimester when the fetal organs are being formed. Itis clear that preventive efforts aimed at eliminating the use of marijuanaand tobacco would correlate with reduction of alcohol intake, further reducingthe risk of adverse effects to the children of these adolescent mothers. Attention impaired by marijuana use If attention processes were impaired through chronic use of marijuana, thiswould be important to understanding decreases in work performance, memorylearning, and every day tasks, such as driving. Previous research has shownthat cannabis use impairs attention while the user is intoxicated, but thelong-term effects of chronic use had not previously been studied. Subjectsin this study by Solowji et al (Biol Psychiatry, 37:731-739, 1995) wererecruited from the general community through advertising. The minimum requirementfor participation as a cannabis user was regular use at least once a monthfor 3 years. By criteria established by the American Psychiatric Association,all subjects could be labeled as cannabisdependent or cannabis abusers.The control group of non-users were selected to cover the range of the age,years of education, and sex distribution in the user group. The subjectswere excluded if they had a history of any psychiatric or neurologic disorders,head injury, or the use of any other drugs more than once a month, or alcoholabuse. The ability to focus attention and filter out irrelevant informationwas measured and was found to be impaired progressively by the number ofyears of marijuana use, but was unrelated to the frequency of use. Withincreasing frequency of use the speed of information processing was delayedsignificantly but was unaffected by the duration of use. The results suggestedthat a chronic build-up of cannabinoid produces both short- and long-termimpairments of brain function compared to control subjects. Commentary: The data from this well-done study provide an outstandingdemonstration that marijuana use effects brain function, and documents inan objective way what has been observed for decades, namely that marijuanaproduces an attention deficit. This study was controlled for alcohol use,educational level, and l.Q. scores. No subject involved in other illicitdrug activity was included in the sample so that these data are from individualswho consume marijuana by smoking alone. The data developed in this studyprovide evidence that iincreasing duration of cannabis use leads to progressivelyimpaired information processing which could lead to distractibility andimpairment in any situation where concentration and focus attention areessential. Passive exposure to cocaine and marijuana impacts children In a study by Bhushan et al (American Journal of Public Health, 84:675-686,1994) over 7,700 infants and young children visiting the pediatric emergencyroom of a New York City hospital for six months in 1992 were screened forevidence of byproducts of marijuana and cocaine in their urine. Of the approximately15% who were given a routine urinalysis 245 were randomly selected for furthertesting. The criteria recommended by NIDA for testing exposure to drugswas applied in 100 of the cases and no metabolites were detected. However,when more sensitive measures for cocaine and marijuana byproducts were usedto test the remaining 145 specimens, 11 % tested positive for cocaine ormarijuana metabolites. Since these children were all age 8 and under, themost likely avenue of ingestion is by passive exposure to smoked forms ofthe drugs. There is some indication that passive low level exposure maybe cumulative in children. Commentary: Low level exposures to toxins in the environment canonly be detected by changing the detection threshold to a highly sensitive,but still specific level. This study shows that use of NIDA limits for exposurewould not have picked up the passive exposure of children whose mothersuse smoked marijuana and cocaine in their presence. Symptoms consistentwith cocaine toxicity have been described previously in infants and toddlersexposed to smoke of cannabinoids and free base cocaine, by Moreland, etal., Journal of Forensic Sciences 30:997-1002, 1985. Though these childrenhave no substance use problems themselves their exposure may predisposedthem to such problems in the future as well as other negative physiologicalconsequences.

He had smokedmarijuana for 10 years, and just prior to admission had smoked several marijuanacigarettes and consumed several bottles of beer. No other psychotropic drugswere used. An area of damage in the right kidney resulting from a blockin the major branch of the right kidney artery was detected. Toxicologyscreening on the urine revealed cannabinoids. All other causes of acutekidney infarction were excluded. The world's literature on cannabis effectson the kidney was reviewed by the authors. Commentary: This report is the first one showing clotting off ofan artery to the kidney resulting from acute marijuana smoking. The cardiovasculareffects of marijuana are well-known and include dilation of peripheral bloodvessels resulting in blood pressure changes and reflex, speeding up of theheart rate. If the heart rate is inadequate, there may be drops in bloodflow to organs such as the kidney with resulting thrombosis of small arteries.Marijuana is known to be associated with myocardial infarction and stroke(Zachariah SB, Stroke 22:406-409, 1991; Charles et al. Clinical Toxicology14:433-438, 1979). It is also possible that the marijuana damaged the bloodvessels directly, as has been suggested for other drugs of abuse, such asamphetamines (Baden et al. New England Journal of Medicine, 284:111-113,1971). It is clear from this case report, however, that a previously healthymale with acute ingestion of marijuana can clog the blood vessels of a majororgan. British study illuminates negative aspects of regular marijuana use A self-reporting study of the behavior of marijuana users attending a communitydrug and alcohol climic was reported on by McBride in Drug and Alcohol Dependence39:29-32, 1995. One hundred consecutive users were interviewed. All wereCaucasian and 85% were male. The mean age was 28 and their cannabis usehad been ongoing for approximately 12.5 years. No one in the sample wasemployed. All were receiving state benefits. Eighty percent smoked tobaccocigarettes as well. The author found that the average consumption of cannabisin the week preceding the interview was 10.5 grams with 60% of intervieweessmoking daily. The average cannabis cigarette comprised 3 cigarette papers,the tobacco from three-quarters of a king-sized cigarette, and 0.35 gramsof cannabis resin. Only 26% of the sample smoked tobacco in the absenceof cannabis. Only 5% of the population took cannabis by oral ingestion.The amount of money spent on the cannabis averaged £35.00 or approximately$50.00 per week at current exchange rates. The author concluded that thehigh doses of cannabis used, the frequency of use, and the expenditure onthe drug relative to income raised questions about the assumed benign effectsof cannabis among those attending such clinics. Commentary: Heavy use of cannabis was documented in patients attendingdrug and alcohol clinics for which cannabis was not the primary reason forreferral to the clinic. Amphetamines, alcohol, opioids, and benzodiazepinescomprised 94% of the cases referred. This data shows the frequency of cannabisuse in combination with tobacco. This makes it very difficult to interpretself-reporting data about the health effects of tobacco alone. It is clearthat drug-seeking behavior, even in patients undergoing treatment for drugand alcohol abuse, is not completely gone since other drugs are being usedat the same time. Perhaps the difficulty in obtaining a higher level oftreatment success relates to this fact. It is also startling to note theamount of money being spent on cannabis by a population supported by thegovernment and in whom tremendous healthcare resources are being expended. Marijuana cigarette triggers severe hyperthermia The symptoms of heatstroke include a body temper-ature of 104° F orgreater, and delirium, coma, or seizures. Many drugs and chemicals havebeen associated with heatstroke, including amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, andPCP. Walter and associates, in Clinical Toxicology, 34:217-221, report acase of life-threatening hyperthermia associated with the use of marijuanaalone. A 24 year-old man with a history of smoking one marijuana cigarettetwice a month for many years left his office immediately after smoking onemarijuana cigarette. He was acclimatized to the environment but had beenjogging for only one week. The temperature was 84° F with a low relativehumidity. He had no preexisting medical conditions. After jogging for 15minutes, he became acutely ill and collapsed. Paramedics were called whonoted a hot, red, dry skin and an agitated combative condition. They tookhim to an emergency department where his rectal temperature was recordedat 107° F. He required aggressive cooling and a tracheal tube for assistedbreathing. It took him 16 hours to return to his usual mental state. Alltests were negative except for urine and blood toxicology screens, whichshowed cannabinoids. No other drugs associated with hyperthermia were detected. Commentary: This case report fits with animal studies and some humandata showing that marijuana interferes with normal temperature control.In animal studies, marijuana has been shown to produce a condition knownas poikilothermia, which is a loss of the ability to regulate temperaturecontrol. Marijuana is known to increase heat production in humans (Hannaet al. Aviation Space Environmental Medicine, 47:634-639, 1976, Rosenberget al. Cntical Care Medicine, 14:964-969, 1986). Thus, people who smokemarijuana in environments of high temperature and exert themselves are excessivelypredisposed to hyperthermia, which can be lifethreatening. The smoker feelsless hot than they really are because of constriction of skin blood vesselsand diminished sweating. The impaired ability to feel overheated producesa greater chance of developing heatstroke. THC causes abnormalities in immune molecules Zhu and colleagues continue a series of investigations into the mechanismof the immunological effects of the active ingredient in marijuana smoke,tetrahydrocannabinol (The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,274:10011007, 1995). These authors had previously reported that interleukin2, a potent substance released by activated immune cells (which are necessaryfor a proper immune response) is suppressed by ingredients in marijuanasmoke. The current studies use a line of cloned natural killer cells ofthe immune system which are mixed with varying concentrations of THC. Thesecells were blocked in their ability to display this important molecule.The authors suggest that this effect may account in part, at least, forthe THC suppression of the immune response. Commentary: Further studies by the active immunology group of Klein,et al, at the University of South Florida, has further explained the wayin which the active ingredient of marijuana can suppress the immune response.Somewhat surprisingly, the liberation of an important molecule by lymphocyteswas not reduced, but instead, the place where it attaches on activated cellswas suppressed. The result of this abnormality is that a cloned cell lineof natural killer cells could not function in their ability to attack invadingforeign molecules. Although these results are done in a test tube, it isfrightening to think what the implications of this work is for patientsalready immunosuppressed by the viral disease, AIDS, where part of the viralinfection is impairment of the immune system. Smoking marijuana in thissetting would further depress the body's ability to fight those invadingorganisms which, ultimately, are the cause the death of most AIDS patients. Rectal THC effective as an appetite stimulant One potential use of delta-9 THC (dronabinol) is as an appetite stimulantin patients with cancer or AIDS. Mattes et al., Pharmacologic PharmacologyBiochemistry, and Behavior, 49:187-195, 1994, reviewed the subject of cannabinoidsand appetite stimulation. They noted that most but not all prior studiesshowed marijuana to have some appetite stimulating property. In this studyeleven subjects, all of whom were casual marijuana cigarette users, wereobserved. The authors compared oral THC with administration by a rectalsuppository. Mean daily food intake was significantly increased when thepatient was routinely using the rectal suppository, but this did not occurwith either an oral capsule or dissolving an oral dose under the tongue. Commentary: This study confirms the efficacy of rectal suppositoriesin appetite stimulation. The drug absorption from the rectal suppositorywas adequate to accomplish the therapeutic goal compared to oral or inhalationroutes. There was no correlation between drug efficacy and the age, gender,the dnug "high," or plasma drug levels. This study further supportsthe possibility of developing a rectal suppository form of delta-9 THC foruse in appetite stimulation in chronically ill patients.

No. 3. October, 1996 MARIJUANA RESEARCH REVIEW A publication of Drug Watch Oregon Volume 3, No. 3, October 1996 Study cites marijuana as factor in increased crime and emergency roomepisodes "A substantial proportion of the US population has used illicit drugs,resulting in increased risk of injury, disease, and death," (BA Rouse,Clinical Chemistry 42:8(B) 1330-1336, 1996). From this perspective, Rouseexamined the National Institute of Justice Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) systemand two studies from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,i.e., the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the Drug Abuse WarningNetwork (DAWN), to chart the role of illegal or nonmedical drug use in emergencyroom episodes and interactions with the criminal justice system. The DAWN report showed marijuana use had increased significantly in allage groups and that in emergency room treatment "most marijuana relatedepisodes also included mentions of other drugs, particularly alcohol andcocaine." Nonetheless, marijuana use alone was a significant factorin emergency room visits. Commentary: In the DUF study on the relationship between drugs andcrime it was noted that since an arrest may occur long after an offencehas taken place, determination as to whether or not drugs were a factoris often minimised. Additionally, only the most serious offence for whicha person was booked was reflected. That being the case, it is highly likelythat drug offences are under reported. Marijuana users incur Increased health care costs Marijuana smoke contains carcinogens and more tars than tobacco smoke. However,little epidimeologic evidence has identifled marijuana smoking as a riskfactor for health. Polen et al (Westem Journal of Medicine, Vol. 158, pp596601, 1993) studied the health effects of smoking marijuana by comparing daily marijuana smokers who never smoked tobacco(452 patients) with a demographically similar group of non-smokers of eithersubstance (450 patients). Daily marijuana smokers had a 19% increased riskof out patient visits for respiratory illnesses, a 32% increased risk ofinury, and a 9% increased risk of other illnesses compared to non-smokers.They also had a 50% increased risk of being admitted to the hospital. Theseresults were adjusted for sex, age, race, education, marital status, andalcohol consumption. Commentary: Daily marijuana smoking, even in the absences of tobacco,appears to be associated with an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes,including an excessive use of health care resources. Many marijuana smokersalso smoke tobacco and the adverse health consequences of using these twosubstances together are likely to be multiplied. Lung cancer causing carcinogen more prevalent in marijuana than tobacco A breakthrough report published in the journal Science, October 18, 1996,provides the first true molecular evidence conclusively linking componentsin tobacco smoking to lung cancer. A chemical found in tobacco smoking,benzopyrene, causes genetic damage in lung cells that is identical to thedamage observed in the DNA of most malignant tumors of the lungs. Although scientists have been convinced in the past that smoking causeslung cancer, the strong statistical associations did not provide absoluteproof. This paper absolutely pinpoints that mutations in lung cancer cellsare caused by benzopyrene. An average marijuana cigarette contains 30 nanogramsof this carcinogen compared to 21 nanograms in an average tobacco cigarette(Marijuana and Health, National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicinereport, 1982). This potent carcinogen suppresses a gene that controls growthof cells. When this gene is damaged the body becomes more susceptible tocancer. This gene, P53, is related to half of all human cancers and as manyas 70% of lung cancers. Commentary: Clearly marijuana smoke contains more of the potent carcinogenbenzopyrene than tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the technique of smoking marijuanaby inhaling deeply and holding the smoke within the lungs presents a chanceof much greater exposure than a conventional tobacco cigarette. Marijuana interferes with brain's ability to metabolize glucose Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States, butits short and long term effects on brain metabolism are not clearly understood.Volkow et al (Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, Vol 67, pp 29-38, 1996)studied brain glucose metabolism in daily marijuana users at baseline andduring marijuana intoxication. They used the sophisticated technique ofpositron emission tomography (PET scan) which gives a visual picture ofthe actively metabolizing brain. The results of eight chronic marijuana users were compared with age andsex matched normal subjects. They found that THC, the main psychoactivecomponent of marijuana, produced lower glucose metabolism in the cerebellarpart of the brain. A single THC dose in a chronic user increases metabolismin other specific parts of the brain. This does not occur in the non-usingcontrols. The activation of chemical metabolism pathways in the brains ofusers, as compared to the controls, could lead to the drive and compulsionto self-administer the drug observed in addicted individuals. Commentary: This sophisticated use of PET scanning which illustratesindividual regions of the brain and their abilities to metabolise glucose,the main energy source of the brain, documents an abnormality in chronicusers of marijuana. The location of the abnormality in the cerebellum couldaccount for the motor defects and lack of coordination previously reportedin these subjects. This has obvious implications for public safety and operationof motor vehicles by marijuana users. Researcher calls for more studies of impact of marijuana on brain In an editorial (JAMA 996;275:521-527) Robert I. Block, Ph.D, discussesa study by Pope & Yurgelun-Todd in the same issue relative to marijuanause and brain function. Dr. Block laments that there is "so littlescientific information to communicate about adverse effects of chronic marijuanause on human cognition or brain function" He cites the Pope & Yurgelun-Toddstudy, which "shows impairment in mental flexibility and abstraction,as well as some aspects of leaming" in frequent marijuana users, andadds that "With continued use of marijuana...the impairments mightincrease over the years." Block notes that there is evidence of cognitive deficits "persistingfor prolonged periods following cessation of marijuana use, consistent withmarijuana-induced brain alterations," and says that the recent increasein marijuana use by US youth is a "compelling motivation" to conductmore rigorous testing using the most modern detection techniques. Commentary: The editorialist feels that far too few studies havebeen done on this aspect of marijuana use and praised the Pope and Yurgelun-Toddstudy for "incorporating a rigorously supervised, 19-hour abstinenceperiod before testing." His suggestion that matched studies must bedone to measure intellectual ability prior to the onset of drug use is seeminglyimpractical in that it would require being able to predetermine who woulduse illicit drugs. However, more well designed and controlled studies inthis area would certainly be useful. Material used in this publication has been reviewed and commented on by William M.

In March 1992, at the completion of their long thorough review,the NIH scientists issued a report stating that there were better, saferdrugs available than marijuana cigarettes. The report contained specificfactsheets concerning cancer chemotherapy, the AIDS wasting syndrome, multiplesclerosis, pain, and glaucoma. These factsheets stated that "Marijuana cigarette smoke contains acomplex mixture of over 400 compounds including polyareomatic hydrocarbonswhich are carcinogenic. This would be a concern for anyone, but especiallyfor patients with chronic disorders and/or impaired immune systems." The National Eye Institute factsheet on the Therapeutic Use of Marijuanafor Glaucoma states that the NEI did research on marijuana from 1978 to1988, and "none of the studies demonstrated that marijuana or any ofits components could safely and effectively lower intraocular pressure enoughto prevent optic nerve damage from glaucoma." Undesirable side effectswere produced by smoking marijuana, such as elevated blood pressure anddry eye. It was noted that these patients would also be at risk for respiratorydamage. Furthermore, marijuana smoking is not an optimal drug delivery system,lacking a standardized product and method of assuring the bioavailabilityof its active ingredients. There are 24 FDA approved drugs for the treatmentof glaucoma. In conclusion, "there is no scientifically verifiableevidence that marijuana or its derivatives are safe and effective in thetreatment of glaucoma." The National Cancer Institute factsheet noted that the FDA has approvedsynthetic THC (Marinol) and a related synthetic drug, Cesamet, for use inchemotherapy patients who have failed to respond to other anti-nausea agents.However the NCI scientists believe that marijuana-related compounds probablyare not as effective as certain other antiemetics or combinations of emeticsin controlling nausea and vomiting. Moreover, inhaling marijuana smoke isa health hazard. Other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron, metoclopramine,droperidol, etc. have been shown to be more useful than marijuana-relatedcompounds as first line therapy. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke factsheet statedthat there is no evidence that marijuana is effective in modifying the courseof multiple sclerosis and that only anecdotal reports of benefit have beenreported. The report mentioned that a suppository formulation of THC isbeing tested on human beings and that this promises better bioavailabilitythan the oral form. The National Institute of Dental Research factsheet reported that no controlledstudies of the effects of marijuana on acute or chronic pain exist, thusthere is insufficient evidence to recommend marijuana as treatment for pain. The National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases factsheet reportsthat studies of the effect of oral THC on the HIV-wasting syndrome are underway.Also the suppository THC is being tested in normal volunteers. Again itis mentioned that marijuana cigarette smoke would be a concern for patientswith compromised immune systems. From the Best of Idea.

Is marijuana good medicine for illnesses we all fear? The answer might seem obvious based simply on common sense. Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases. Americans take their medications in many different forms, but never by smoking. No medicine prescribed for us today is smoked. * Marijuana's chemistry is neither fully known, nor reproducible. * Adequate safety studies have not been done. * There are no adequate, well-controlled scientific studies provingmarijuana is effective for anything. * Marijuana is not accepted for medical use in treatment by even arespectable minority. * The published scientific evidence is not adequate to permit experts tofairly and responsibly conclude that marijuana is safe and effective for use in humans. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the claims that marijuana is medicine are falseand dangerous. It is a cruel hoax to offer false hope to desperately illpeople. Sick people can be fooled by false claims and waste precious timeexperimenting with marijuana while neglecting approved medications for their specific illness. Not one American health association accepts marijuana as a medicine. * Not the American Medical Association * Not the National Multiple Sclerosis Society * Not the American Glaucoma Society * Not the American Academy of Ophthalmology * Not the American Cancer Society There are over 10,000 documented scientific research papers on file at theUniversity of Mississippi, and not one gives marijuana a clean bill ofhealth. By any modern standard, marijuana is no medicine. Using lay testimonials, impressions of physicians, isolated case studies,random clinical experience, reports so lacking in details they cannot bescientifically evaluated, anecdotal proof, and statistically flawed studies,pro drug legalization advocates have sought to establish credibility throughthe medical marijuana issue. Unfortunately, many who have limited or no medical background and politicians with little time to learn the issue have been influenced by the drug culture statements presented by the media. In many cases, the media has ignored contrary data in thousands of research papers and opinions of highly respected medical researchers. The result, if not the intent, of this type of irresponsible reporting is that society is being misled with an untrue and very dangerous message. From the Best of Idea, Illinois.

In The December 1993 issue of High Times Magazine, a reader who signed himself "Doper Professor," complained that after ingesting marijuana-laced "space cakes" he and his wife became "frighteningly high...accompanied by a lot of vomiting...combined with passing in and out of consciousness...which seemed potential life-threatening," adding that a doctor had to be called to give them Valium "to counteract the reaction..." High Times responded by informing Doper Professor that "determining the desired dose is much harder if one is eating cannabis. It is not unusual to have a panic reaction." This would certainly appear to invalidate the claims made by San Francisco's Brownie Mary that her sole reason for possessing 200 pounds of marijuana was that she gives marijuana-laced brownies to AIDS patients to help ease their nausea and vomiting. One of the world's leading specialists on medical quackery, Victor Herbert, M.D., J.D., of Mount Sinai and Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, wrote of this phenomenon in JAMA in October 1993. "In some cases," he wrote, "the patient never had the disease. In others the disease was cured or a remission was induced by genuine therapy, but the quack remedy also given was credited. In other cases the patient died but was represented as cured. Sometimes the patient had a spontaneous remission that was publicized as a success, but the proponents failed to keep score and publicize all the failures before and after each 'success.' The difference between promoters of quack remedies and promoters of legitimate remedies is that only the latter keep score." An abstract of a recent study on the Impact of tobacco and marijuana use on antioxidants in HIV-1 infected patients by Miguez-Burbano, G Shor-Posner and MK Baum at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Univ. Miami School of Medicine, in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 1994;34:1031, showed that vitamin E levels were significantly lower in marijuana users and cigarette smokers relative to non-users, stating that "The results of this study indicate that both marijuana and cigarettes have a detrimental effect on vitamin E status of HIV-1 infected individuals. These findings are of particular concern in light of the important role of vitamin E in immune processes, inhibition of viral activation, and the death of immune cells."

GLAUCOMA Is Marijuana a Safe and Effective Treatment? What is Glaucoma: Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, in the UnitedStates, afflicts nearly 2 million Americans, about 60,000 of whom are legallyblind. Open angle closure glaucoma: In the vast majority of cases this type ofglaucoma is without symptoms. It is associated with mild elevation of intraocularpressure that produces chronic damage to the optic nerve. Open angle closureglaucoma is treated medically with drugs that reduce aqueous humor formation. Acute angle closure glaucoma: This rare form of the disease, which may includepain, blurring of vision, halos around lights, etc., is treated with laseror surgery. Although elevated intraocular pressure is a common symptom of glaucoma,nearly 20 percent of those who have the disease do not experience elevatedpressure. For these the traditional screening tests may miss the diagnosisand, since glaucoma patients "almost never have symptoms," damagewill continue to progress in their eyes. Medical treatment for Open Angle Closure Glaucoma: Because the level ofpressure that causes damage varies from person to person a target "normal"pressure must be determined for each patient and the treatment carefullyadjusted. "Daily variations in pressure complicate the assessment oftreatment, since eyes affected by glaucoma tend to have larger fluctuationsthan normal eyes." (New England Journal of Medicine, 328:1103,1993) Prostaglandins:These drugs are being developed to improve aqueous humoroutflow and are believed to "hold much greater promise for the hypotensivetherapy of glaucoma." Beta blockers: At least four are marketed in the United States and beingused sucessfully in the treatment of intraocular pressure associated withglaucoma. According to researchers there is "little motivation to developnew inhibitors of aqueous humor formation since the market is relativelysaturated with such drugs." In the latest scientific evaluation of glaucoma treatment, as reported inthe New England Journal of Medicine, 328:1103,1993, marijuana was not mentionedas having any role whatsoever. What about marijuana?: The country's leading ophthalmologists are "chagrined"and "disturbed" to hear that claims are being made touting marijuanaas a treatment for glaucoma. Because of wide fluctuations in intraocularpressure, and a numerous other factors which affect the course of this disease,doctors agree that using marijuana as a treatment is likely to mask problemsand increase the risk of blindness. William T. Shults, M.D., recognized in the publication "The Best Doctorsin America," for his work in ophthalmology at the Devers Eye Institutein Portland, Oregon, noted that alcohol can also lower intraocular pressureif one has ingested enough to be intoxicated. He added that no one wouldpropose using alcohol for that purpose, however, because of its many adverseside effects. Shults stated " I can see no compelling reason whatsoeverfor the use of marijuana by patients with glaucoma, and believe that topropose such a use works a cruel hoax on the public and especially thosewith a chronic ocular disease for which many other better treatments arecurrently available." Even Judge Francis Young, the DEA administrative judge often quoted by advocatesof medical use of marijuana, stated that he found insufficient evidenceto show that marijuana is an accepted treatment for glaucoma.

SOMEBODY HAD BETTER TELL YOUR DOCTOR! by Dan Brookoff, M.D., Ph.D. I give people dangerous drugs. I am responsible for a lot of people using narcotics. I am an oncologist. I do not recommend marijuana. IS MARIJUANA A MEDICATION? My definition of a medication is a drug treatment that is aimed at one ofthe following three goals: 1. the prolongation or preservation of life, 2. the support of functioning or 3. the relief of discomfort. The use of drugs for other purposes is not medicine. My guiding principle in caring for a patient is that any medication thatI use must be the best available treatment for that particular situation.Because of this, marijuana cannot be considered a medication. IS MARIJUANA NOT A MEDICATION BECAUSE IT IS TOXIC? Some of the drugs we use in the medical treatment of cancer have toxic sideeffects. The toxic effects of a drug don't necessarily disqualify it asa medication. Sometimes it is worth using a very toxic medication if thepotential benefits are great. For example, many cases of leukemia can becured but at the cost of severe side effects. In some cases, the severeside effects are not a risk -- they are a certainty. IS MARIJUANA NOT A MEDICATION BECAUSE IT IS UNCONVENTIONAL? Just because a treatment is not "conventional" doesn't disqualifyit as a medication, either. Sometimes, there are no conventional treatmentsavailable for a particular problem. After weighing the risks and benefitsof an unusual treatment, my patient may feel that he or she wants to undergoan alternative therapy. If I am sure that my patient is fully informed,is not forgoing a treatment that has a better potential for success, andis not exposing himself or herself to needless risk, I (and many physicians)will help the patient gain access to that treatment. I have certainly recommendedalternative medical treatments for several of my patients with AIDS and,frankly, I am glad that I did; however, marijuana is neither an acceptablemedical treatment nor an alternative medical treatment for any illness. BUT MARIJUANA CAN RELIEVE CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA; ISN'TTHAT AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM? When one of my patients has a cancer problem that can be helped by treatmentwith chemotherapy medications, I will recommend that we proceed with treatment.Many of these drugs have serious side effects that we must take into considerationand be prepared to manage. Often, I will also recommend the use of medicationsto alleviate symptoms caused by the cancer (such as the judicious use ofnarcotic medications for the relief of pain). I will also use medicationsto relieve the symptoms caused by chemotherapy treatments, such as nausea. Whenever I recommend that a patient undergo chemotherapy treatment, I alwaysmake sure that we have a lot of time to discuss the effects of a particulartreatment and how they will be managed. I find that the word "chemotherapy"usually evokes a lot of anxiety. People facing the prospect of chemotherapyinvariably know of someone who underwent cancer treatment and suffered agreat deal of discomfort. The most frightening symptom that people associatewith chemotherapy is not pain, but rather uncontrollable nausea and vomiting.While this is not a problem with many types of chemotherapy treatments,it has been common enough over the years to give rise to a lot of legitimatefear. The good news is that within the last 10 years, safe and effectivetreatments for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting have made this feara thing of the past. IS THERE EVER A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH MARIJUANA IS THE BESTAVAILABLE TREATMENT FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING? I never recommend that my patients use marijuana. I want to explain whyin the most balanced and compassionate way I can. To understand why I feelthe way I do, it is important to understand some of the medical detailsabout chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapy drugs cause nausea by stimulating an area of the brain calledthe chemoreceptor trigger zone. Typically, nausea and vomiting begin 90minutes to three hours after the administration of the chemotherapy andcan last for up to six hours. For certain chemotherapy medications, suchas platinum and intravenous cyclophosphamide, the onset of nausea may bedelayed for up to 18 hours and may have a somewhat more prolonged courseof up to four days. Patients whose nausea and vomiting have been poorly controlled can becomeconditioned into developing anticipatory nausea, which can begin even beforethe treatment begins. Since there are several different chemical receptorsin the brain which control the sensation of nausea, several different typesof drugs have proven effective in its treatment. All of these medicationsneed only be used for very limited periods of time. The most successful group of anti-nausea drugs has been the recently introducedmedications which block serotonin receptors in the chemoreceptor triggerzone, such as ondansetron. These medications have proven to be safe andeffective for both adults and children and generally have only mild sideeffects. Another group of drugs which has proven safe and effective for the treatmentof chemotherapy-induced vomiting are medications which block dopamine receptors,such as metoclopramide and haloperidol. Other dopamine-blocking medicationsas the phenothiazine medications (which include Thorazine and Compazine)are somewhat effective but are inferior and remain "third choice"medications. Other medications, such as certain steroids and minor tranquilizers, haveproven safe and effective for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nauseaand vomiting, usually when used in conjunction with another anti-nauseadrug. WHAT ABOUT DRUGS DERIVED FROM MARIJUANA? A class of drugs derived from marijuana called the cannabinoids has alsobeen shown to have some anti-nausea effects, but this activity is no greaterthan that of third-choice drugs. Cannabinoids also cause more side effects than the other anti-nausea drugs(sedation, dizziness, low blood pressure, and an unpleasant sensation calleddysphoria). A purified form of the cannabinoid Delta-9 THC has been availableon the American market for eight years under the brand name Marinol. Despiteits availability it has found limited use, because it generally doesn'twork. If you look at the advertisements for Marinol placed in the medicaljournals by its manufacturer (Roxane Laboratories), it is touted as "moreeffective than Compazine," which is a third-choice medication for thetreatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. IS MARIJUANA MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE CURRENTLYON THE MARKET? Every few years, the lay press brings up the issue of using inhaled marijuanafor the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea. For physicians, this issuewas settled 10 years ago when Dr. M. Levitt and colleagues conducted a randomizeddouble-blind comparison of Delta-9 THC and marijuana for the treatment ofchemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. (This is published in the 1984Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, volume 3, page91.) What they found was that neither agent was particularly useful (75percent of patients in both groups suffered significant nausea and vomiting),and among patients expressing a preference, Delta-9 THC was chosen the bestagent. Inhaled marijuana has nothing to add to the limited benefits of purifiedDelta-9 THC. It does carry added risks due to its method of delivery andits impurity. This includes toxic effects on the lungs, additional sideeffects, and the danger of infection from fungus which is often found inmarijuana cigarettes. Marijuana is never the best available treatment fora patient, and that is why it is not a medication. IF MARIJUANA ISN'T A MEDICATION, WHY AREN'T PHYSICIANS UP INARMS ABOUT THE CURRENT MOVEMENT TO LEGALIZE ITS USE FOR CANCER PATIENTS? Most physicians are unaware that this is really an issue; for them the issuewas settled years ago. Years ago, when there were no effective medicationson the market for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,the American Medical Association considered the therapeutic potentials andhazards of marijuana. As they examined its emerging therapeutic possibilities,they found more and more evidence that marijuana was hazardous to health.(Journal of the AMA, Oct. 16, 1981, volume 246, pages 1823-1827.) Nonetheless, many physicians (including me) had patients who participatedin treatment trials using inhaled marijuana in the late 70s and early 80sbecause, at the time, there was no better alternative. With the therapeuticpotential of marijuana eclipsed by safer and more effective drugs, we havecome to the conclusion that there is no therapeutic use for marijuana. Allwe are left with are the hazards. These include lung disease, cardiac dysfunction,brain damage, genetic damage, immune disorders and psychomotor impairment. HOW CAN PHYSICIANS' NON-RESPONSE TO THE ISSUE OF THE MEDICINALUSE OF MARIJUANA BE EXPLAINED? I have to admit that when I was first confronted with the issue of "medicalmarijuana" by my friends in the prevention field, I couldn't get veryexcited about it. I felt that the facts obviously showed that there wasno medicinal use for inhaled marijuana and, as such, it was not a subjectworthy of serious concern. As I mentioned to a friend, I classed the medicaluse of marijuana right up there with the issue of therapeutic bathing inDrano! I was against that too, but I couldn't see that anybody could seriouslybe in favor of it. HASN'T THERE BEEN RECENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MARIJUANACAN BE USEFUL AS A MEDICATION? If you look up "marijuana" in the last few years of the journalused by most clinical oncologists (Journal of Clinical Oncology) you'llfind only one mention of marijuana (a sign that it's not a hot topic forus). That mention is made in an article by Richard Doblin and Mark Kleiman,of Harvard University, that reports a survey that they conducted of physiciansand that purports to "suggest that support for rescheduling marijuanais indeed present in at least a significant minority of our population (oncologists)." The report, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Oncology volume 9,pages 1314-1319, does not mention how the authors selected doctors to respondto their survey, and it also doesn't mention the authors' affiliation withany of the pro-marijuana organizations to which they belong (no bias there?).While this article did not have much of an impact on oncologists, mentionof it was made in letters to many medical journals -- letters written byDoblin and Kleiman. These letters were generally ignored by physicians. This would almost befunny if all these references weren't being used by pro-marijuana forcesto convince ill-informed government officials that there is medical evidenceto support the use of marijuana. WHAT ABOUT THE BOOK ON MARIJUANA WRITTEN BY A PROFESSOR AT HARVARDMEDICAL SCHOOL? Another source cited as evidence of the therapeutic effects of marijuanais a book that was recently written by Dr. Lester Grinspoon of the HarvardMedical School ("Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine"). The bookis poorly written, unscientific, and makes some absolutely bizarre claimsfor the use of marijuana. (For example, Dr. G. says it promotes safe driving!) Many people in the prevention field were justifiably angered when they readthis book. I read the book, and I found it very disturbing. I must say thatmy predominant emotional reaction was to feel sorry for Dr. Grinspoon. Dr. Grinspoon was obviously moved to write this book because of his experiencewith his young son Danny. Danny had leukemia, and his treatments causedsevere nausea and vomiting that did not respond to the medications thatwere available at that time. Danny could barely tolerate his chemotherapytreatments, and I'm, sure that his parents could barely stand to watch himsuffer. Nonetheless, they must have thought that the chemotherapy treatmentsheld some potential benefit for Danny, so they urged him to continue. In 1971, Danny found that smoking marijuana helped him tolerate his treatments.His doctors, feeling that this was the best available treatment, supportedDanny's smoking and conducted research which eventually led to the developmentof Marinol. Dr. Grinspoon writes that, during the remaining year of hislife, Danny used marijuana before his chemotherapy treatments and becauseof his marijuana use, Danny and his parents were all much more comfortable.Because of this, Dr. Grinspoon must have some strong positive associationswith marijuana, and he has become an advocate for its use as a medication. Marijuana is not a medication. Marijuana was a medication when Danny usedit. At the time it was the best available treatment, and he used it in amedical, life-affirming way. He did not use it to escape his life. He usedit to help him undergo treatment so that he could continue his life. I am sure that Dr. Grinspoon would not recommend that people undergo thesame leukemia treatment that Danny underwent over 20 years ago. There arenow new treatments that are more effective and safer. (These days most childrenwith the type of leukemia that Danny had are cured.) I think that the sameholds true for Danny's anti-nausea treatment. These days, no oncologistwould recommend marijuana, because there are safer and more effective treatments. IS MEDICAL MARIJUANA A SERIOUS ISSUE? The thing that really frightens me is that some people will use Dr. Grinspoon'stragedy to construct an even larger tragedy. I worry that the well-financedadvocates of the recreational use of marijuana -- e.g. the people that wantto sell it to my kids -- are using this wedge of false medical evidenceto open the door for the legalization and wider recreational use of marijuana.The glibness with which our new (and obviously uninformed) Surgeon Generalhas come out in favor of using inhaled marijuana is scary and shows thateven some doctors (though I'm sure it's very few) don't always think beforethey speak. This is a serious issue, and I am worried that most doctorswon't get involved until it is too late. SOMEBODY HAD BETTER TELL YOUR DOCTOR!

This initiative creates a giant loophole to grow and deal marijuana, endangeringthe health and safety of all, and it puts California in conflict with Federal law. Thisinitiative falsely implies that marijuana cigarettes alleviate disease; however, there is no scientificproof that marijuana is safe or effective for ANY illness. Its use masks symptoms, discouragingill people from seeking medical care, often causing them direct harm. In 1994, a US Court of Appeals ruled marijuana remain a Schedule I drug:highly addictive, no medical usefulness. The court noted that the pro-marijuana physicianshad relied on non- scientific evidence. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approvedTHC, marijuana's major ingredient, for limited medical use. Pure syntheticTHC, marketed as Marinol, is available by prescription in pill form fortreatment of nausea in some cancer chemotherapy patients and as an appetitestimulant for AIDS Wasting Syndrome. The FDA has NOT approved crude marijuana, which has more than 425 chemicalsconverting to thousands when smoked; many are toxic and cancer-causing.Smoking is harmful; no medicine is administered by smoking. AIDS: Scientific studies indicate marijuana cigarettesdamage the immune system, causing further peril to already weakened immunesystems. HIV-positive smokers progress to full-blown AIDS twice as fastas non-smokers and have an increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia. CANCER: Marijuana contains many cancer-causing substances;some are present in higher concentrations in marijuana smoke than in tobaccosmoke. Studies have linked marijuana to a number of cancers in young marijuanasmokers, including cancer of the mouth, tongue, larynx, jaw, head, neck,and lungs. GLAUCOMA: Marijuana does NOT prevent blindness due toglaucoma. Marijuana is harmful to lungs, heart, immunity, and reproduction. Recentstudies have shown numerous abnormalities, including low birthweight, behavioral disorders,lower IQ, and an eleven-fold increase in childhood leukemia in offspring of mothers who smokedmarijuana during pregnancy. Since marijuana impairs mental functioning,it is a known cause of many motor vehicle and industrial accidents. Marijuana is currently up to 25 times more potent than it was in the 1960s.It remains in the bodys fat cells for months. Marijuana is a major causeof addiction, often requiring rehabilitation/treatment. Research links marijuanato the use of cocaine and other drugs. The number of young users of marijuanais rising because of the marijuana as medicine propaganda. The initiative bypasses laws designed to protect the public from unscrupuloussnake oil salesmen. With no restrictions or regulations, this initiativeencourages cultivation and use of marijuana, allowing any physician, includingthose in the marijuana lobby, to verbally approve marijuana for any condition. What has not been made clear to the public is that this initiative willbypass FDA regulations designed to protect the public. A leading activist for marijuana legalization said pro legalization advocateswould use "The medical model as spearheading a strategy for the legalization of marijuanaby 1997." The California Marijuana Initiative 1996 is blatant legalization of marijuana;it is medical quackery and makes a mockery of the law.

New York Dear Dan: Thank you for your letter to Drug Watch International about the drug legalization issue. My name is Bob Peterson and I have been asked to respond on behalf of our organization. I have enclosed a pamphlet about Drug Watch. We are a group of volunteers, both professional and lay persons ( I am an attorney), who are dedicatedto preventing drug use and ensuring that the facts about drugs are known. None of us are paid for our Drug Watch work, but all of us share a deep concern for young people and are committed to drug prevention. We also have no affiliation with any government agency. Drug Watch leaders include parents, drug treatment professionals, medical doctors, attorneys, educators, and community prevention experts. You asked what Drug Watch does and what kind of people Drug Watch helps? Our information, training, and advice has been tapped by a broad range of individuals, from high school students (such as yourself) to national and international government leaders. We have helped parents find treatmentfor their children; helped communities discover resources and ideas to closedrug houses; and, we have provided medical, scientific, and legal advice and updates to professionals and community based groups. Mainly, we have helped counter the huge barrage of pro-drug propaganda that dominates the Internet, the media, and the entertainment industry. Millions of dollars has been poured into the pro-drug legalization movement over the past few years and almost no money has been spent to balance it. While we cannot counter the funding we do provide a balance to their barrage of misinformation. Why do we feel that controlling drugs is the right thing to do? For many reasons, but the top reason is probably to protect children. All of uslived through the 1970's when drug legalization was a popular idea and even the President talked of decriminalizing pot. Our nation's attitude was very permissive toward drugs and although drug arrests were made, the incarceration rate for drugs went down dramatically. The result was record drug use among high school students and among adults as well. In 1979, nearly one in ten high school seniors was stoned on pot every day of theweek and drug incarceration rates were at an all time low point - support fordrug legalization was at an all time high. Drug prevention combined with tougher drug control in the 1980's brought about a less permissive attitude and less acceptance of drugs. This resulted in cutting the use of drugs in half from 1980-1992, especially among young adults and children. Support for drug legalization fell also and drug incarceration rates rose for the first time since the year 1960. However,in the past few years things have begun to change again. The pro-drug legalization movement grew by millions of dollars and support for drug legalization went up again. The use of drugs, especially pot, has doubled among teens in just four years! Legalizing drugs would not solve any of our social problems. You mentioned prison overcrowding. There is a lot of propaganda about this issue. Didyou know that 93% of prisoners are repeat or violent offenders and that first time non-violent marijuana offenders make up only 1/10th of 1% of the prison population (and these might have been dealers who pled down). Alcohol is legal and yet there are three times as many alcohol related arrests than there are drug arrests. If drugs were legal there would likely be a 300% increase in drug arrests, not a decrease! From 1960-1980 the drug incarceration rate (the % of drug convicts actually locked up) dropped by 374% and violent crime and property crime skyrocketed. The murder rate peaked the year that drug incarceration rates were at anall time low point. Nearly all of the drug prisoners are hardcore criminalswho make their living out of crime, when you lock up the drug dealer you also have locked up the mugger and the burglar! From 1980-1994 the drug incarceration rate rose swiftly and crime of all types went down - especially property crimes that victimize the most people. I have enclosed a few pages of my book on this topic for you. You mentioned the cost of drug regulation. Of course if drugs are legalthey would be even more regulated. There would be government regulations ondrug imports, drug purity, drug types, drug farms, and security and taxes and sales and age limits. The cost of tobacco and alcohol warn us that tax revenues can never make up enough to pay their way. The increased health care costs would hurt us all. Most police time is spent on petty crimeand disturbances and if drugs are cheaper and easier to get, there will be far more demands on police time. Drug testing of drivers and workers also would have to be expanded and our civil rights would diminish. Lastly, you state that you believe that drugs are a personal choice andmany legalization advocates hold that viewpoint as well. We greatly respect individual liberty and personal freedom. We respect it for the person who does not use drugs as well. It is our view that drugs do not only affectthe person that is using them and, like other hazardous substances, they area danger to innocent non-users. The most hideous violence in society is perpetrated against children by adults through child abuse and neglect. If drugs were legal, cheaper, and easier to get, would there be more crack addicted babies born, or fewer? With more fathers and mothers stoned, more often, would there be less child abuse, or more? In some cities over 80% of child abuse killings are related to the use of cocaine, yet only 2-3% of adults use cocaine regularly. When a person uses drugs they use them to get intoxicated and once the brain is impaired people do not make good decisions about driving, child care,or workplace safety. It is our ability to reason and to think clearly that enables us to make choices freely. All of society is at risk from druguse, not just the user. Among big rig truckers killed in accidents, as manyhad pot in their system as had alcohol, even though there are five times asmany regular drinkers. If pot were legal, even more accidents would occur. Have you ever been to a high school or public event and seen an intoxicated person annoy others or start fights. That is an intrusion on your rights causedby intoxicating drugs. Legalization will not improve the situation. Most of us in Drug Watch have seen the damage drugs cause firsthand. Some have wept with mothers who have lost their son or daughter to addictionor to drug related accidents. Some have gone through it with their own children. Some have treated the abused children of addicts. Some have tried to patch up the broken bones and bodies in emergency rooms. Some have watched healthy happy teens withdraw into bitter rebellion and loneliness. Some have seen drugs steal the best and brightest minds. Some have helped others work through the family, financial, and legal wreckage. Some regularly visitthe gravestones of people they loved dearly. None of us can imagine what problems legalizing drugs can ever solve andhow it would benefit children. None of us have ever seen someone become a better person by taking mind numbing intoxicants. None of us plan to let that happen while we are alive. I am very happy that you wrote and that you want to hear what "our"side has to say about this issue. I am most pleased that you do not use drugs andI hope that you never do. They have nothing to offer. You have been hitwith a lot of propaganda from the pro-drug legalization side. MTV, Rolling Stone, music bands, and mass media have worked hard to promote this legalization idea. In fact, recently one billionaire gave over $15 million to the legalization cause. I hope that you can sift through the myths and thefacts on this issue. It seems that many of the legalizers are a bit older thanI am and white and from fairly wealthy homes. They only relate drugs to their 60's experience or their ivy league college times and from that perspective they may sound convincing. Drug Watch believes that we have to protect the poor, as well as the rich, and people of all races and gender. Our focus should be on the needs of children - not the desires of a few selfish adults. People are more important than ideas and theories. Our experience in life teaches us that drug legalization is not good for people. Kindest regards, Robert E.

Gilligan, Ph.D. "No!" Now, that's a word difficult to say these days. Parentsof teenagers fear it, educators seldom use it, and elected officials avoidit. Take for example: "Just Say No To Drugs." It evokes laughteramong teenagers and comments by adults that this is just too simple to work.It's the root causes of drug abuse that first must be addressed, goes theargument. For drug abuse, some say, is only a symptom of a deeper socialpathology; just telling kids to say "no" will never work. Of course, if everyone did say : No!" to illegal drugs, there wouldn'tbe a problem. In the last analysis, anyone's cure from drug use and alcoholabuse will require a firm and resolute "No!" for we are all responsiblefor our own actions and the consequences that follow. So, what's the problem with the campaign "Just Say No To Drugs"first initiated by Mrs. Reagan? Why hasn't it been more successful? Thereare several reasons. First, it takes courage -- guts -- to say "No!"This is particularly true when it goes against the tide of social pressure.It requires a strength of character not yet fully developed in adolescents.That's why strong parental and adult guidance is required during this criticaland final period of character formation. (The assumption is that adultsdo have the convictions and moral strength of character to also say "No!") Next, too many educators are ambivalent about the illegal status of drugsin our society and tolerant of underage drinking. Now, if adult leadershiphas difficulty providing a clear and unequivocal "No!" to theillegal use of drugs and alcohol, what may we reasonably expect from theyouth of America? A few quotations from a widely used text in universitiesand high schools will illustrate this second point. In the book From Chocolateto Morphine: Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering Drugs, theauthors state that ". . .we are not going to argue for or against drugsand will not side with either those who endorse them or those who opposethem." What a clear and unequivocal position on nothing! Yet, the authors do havea position: "to teach people how to form good relationships with drugsso that if they choose to use drugs, they will continue to be users andnever become abusers." This must be very comforting for parents toknow that their sons and daughters are learning how to form "good relationshipswith drugs." The authors then go on to give "advice" on the use of the following:Stimulants: "limit your frequency of use;" Marijuana: "Donot use marijuana on the job or at school;" Solvents and Inhalants:"Only inhale nitrates when you are in a comfortable sitting or lyingposition;" Hallucinogenic Drugs: "if you are trying one of thehallucinogenic drugs for the first time, take it with an experienced companion." Isn't it good to know that our youth are learning to make wise choices aboutwhen and how to use illegal drugs? So thank the authors and the educators who order these books for contributingto a culture that is tolerant of illegal drug use. Apparently, they believewhat the authors stated in their opening chapter: "Drugs Are Here ToStay." And, the only course of action is to make the best of it andteach our children how to make wise choices. But, what about just plain"No!" Rape, theft, and murder are also with us. Are we to now start educatingstudents on how to make "wise decisions" about date-rape, theft,and murder? Is there anything to decide? Can't anyone just say "it'swrong?" Can't anyone just say "No!" All of which brings us to the final point of why the "Just Say no ToDrugs" message has trouble playing in America. It's called relativism.Assertions about what is good or bad and what is right or wrong and whatis true or false are quickly becoming only matters of subjective opinion.If there are no objective criteria, the moral code is reduced to such relativisticand inane aphorisms as "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"and the recommendation of inner guidance "to do your own thing."At last, something is now certain: "You should do your own thing." Some things are good, some things are true, some things are right, and somethings are just. Likewise, there are some things that are bad, some thingsthat are false, some things that are wrong, and some things that are unjust.To assert otherwise is to cast aside 2500 years of Western Civilization'saccumulated wisdom, knowledge, and experience. To accept that no judgmentscan be made and that all is relative is not only the end of human discoursebut the demise of society itself. In a world of relativism, all values and truths cancel each other out. Accordingto this view, the evils embodied in the Holocaust could never be calledevil. Evil would only be a matter of opinion. In such a world, there canbe no justice, no mercy, no loyalty, no honor, and no freedom. And societywill be reduced to the world of the "Road Warrior" or "Terminator." In so far as illegal drugs are concerned, a culture that not only toleratesbut legalizes them will be different from one that does not. It would bethe final surrender to all restraints on the human impulse to feel goodnow. In addition to opening a societal black hole of self-centeredness,it would sabotage society's ability to develop any sense of obligation andduty among its citizens to promote the well-being of the human community. The question is: Should we, as American citizens, tolerate illegal druguse in practice, policy, or law? We are at a fork in the cultural road.Do we want a drug free culture or one that is tolerant of drugs? The answerwill yield one culture that is much different from the other. And some culturesare clearly better than others. So, let's say "No!" to drugs. Why? Because they are wrong. Theypollute both body and spirit. They destroy family and community. They destroystrength of will and character, both for the individual and the nation.Their sole effect is to intoxicate beyond redemption. This is why we havemade them illegal in the first place. "If men were angels, no laws would be necessary," said James Madison,father of our Constitution. So, let's keep our laws against illegal drugsand strenuously enforce the laws on the illegal use of alcohol. Our salvation-- at least in this kingdom -- may depend upon it. Dr. John F.

Lapey, M.D. Currently there is an epidemic of violence in the U.S., and it is related inlarge part to the epidemic of drugs, since drug alcohol usage to violence iswell-documented in Pediatric Clinics of North America: 37:881-903, 1990, where Jan Bays, M.D. writes that "Intoxicated adults can become violent, paranoid, and less constrained about injuring, molesting, or neglecting their children . . . Cocaine, methamphetamine, and PCP use causes anxiety andfearfulness, distrust of others, hallucinations, and physical aggressiveness. . . Violence is increased in families that abuse alcohol or drugs . . . Abuse or murder of a spouse is more likely when both partners are intoxicated . . . One half of all child abuse and neglect cases in New York City in 1987 were linked to parental substance abuse. If alcohol abuse was included, the incidence rose to 64% . . . An Oregon study documents a 93% increase in incidents of child abuse and neglect between 1981 and 1987 attributed the increaselargely to parental substance abuse." Too often we hear people claim that legalizing drugs would end violence whenthe truth is that legalizing drugs would actually increase violence, since itwould increase the use of drugs. Consider the well-publicized case of New York defense attorney Joe Steinberg, who was convicted of beating his little daughter Lisa to death while he was snorting cocaine. He certainly did not kill her to get money for drugs, or because she was a rival drug dealer;cocaine use had tragically changed his behavior. Other drugs are also increasingly connected to violent behavior. Anabolicsteroids cause "roid rage," i.e., steroid-induced violent aggressive behavior. In general, mind-altering drugs cause users to lose control of their behavior. The Physicians' Desk Reference (p. 2076, 1993) states that "Marinol," which is THC, the main active ingredient in marijuana, causes "decreased ability to control drives and impulses." A recent study by Dr. Don R. Cherek in Psychopharmacology 111:163-168, 1993, showed that smoking marijuanacaused increased aggressive behavior in inner-city males. Furthermore, it isknow that marijuana use tends to lead to the use of other drugs, such as cocaine, which are strongly associated with violent behavior. Herbert Kleber, M.D. in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 49:2 (Suppl), p. 3-6, 1988, reported that 20% of those who used marijuana 3-10 times went on to use cocaine. 75% of those who used marijuana 100 times went on to use cocaine. InAlaska, when marijuana was decriminalized, use among the youth of bothmarijuana and cocaine skyrocketed, becoming by far the highest in the nation. Alaskans then repealed their lenient laws in the fall of 1990. Thus, any discussion of the violence prevalent in society today must takeinto account the fact that drug and alcohol use cause violent behavior. People who promote drug legalization are promoting drug use and thusincreasing violence in our society.WT01-B04-157IA077-000514-B024-18http://drugwatch.org:80/Documents/DWMGEAC.html 207.112.150.94 19970124121255 text/html 1721HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:12:05 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 1550Last-modified: Tue, 29 Oct 1996 17:29:43 GMT What if?

Cimaglio Director, Illinois Department of Alcoholism and SubstanceAbuse (DASA) Let's be realistic. Legalizing marijuana is a terrible idea which wouldhave serious negative side-effects. Proponents of legalization are making false arguments that may sound good,but are often simplistic and short-sighted. Legalization may lessen theviolence surrounding drug dealing. But the real problem is violence resultingfrom drug use, and this must be addressed with strong law enforcement, substanceabuse treatment, prevention and a commitment to cultural change. Do we need marijuana as medicine, as some legalizers claim? Not accordingto many medical experts who say marijuana is neither safe to use nor effectivefor medical use. And marijuana users are fooling themselves if they think smoking pot isn'tharmful. The active ingredient, THC, is addictive, and users can get hookedjust as they can on alcohol or cocaine. More than 5,000 Illinoisans listingmarijuana as their drug of abuse were treated at state-funded programs lastyear. Many pot smokers also suffer serious health problems and are a threatto others when they're high. Any tax revenue resulting from legalization would be minimal compared tothe social costs of addiction. Legalization would create even more clientsfor an already overburdened treatment system -- at a much higher cost. Buttreatment is only part of the price we pay. We also pay for marijuana usersincreased health problems, reduced productivity, injuries from accidents,auto crashes, and crime. All the media hype over legalization of marijuanais particularly scary when you think of the impact on our young people.Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug among Illinois teens. Thirteenpercent of students have tried it. The good news is marijuana use is downslightly according to a recent state survey. We must send strong and consistentmessages to our youth about what society considers appropriate behavior.A message that it is "OK to get high" is not a message that stresseshealthy relaxation and coping with problems in a mature manner. The majorityof Americans believe legalization is not the answer.WT01-B04-160IA077-000514-B025-106http://drugwatch.org:80/Documents/DWSH.html 207.112.150.94 19970124121516 text/html 3571HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:14:54 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3400Last-modified: Tue, 29 Oct 1996 17:30:11 GMT  For The Sake of Our Children. by Stephanie Haynes "FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN" by Stephanie Haynes,President, Drug Watch International America must not be deceived by the voices of despair and doom crying outfor the legalization of drugs. Some say the drug problem is overwhelming,inevitable, hopeless and that the "war on drugs" is lost and theonly solution is to legalize drugs. Some of these people are national leaders who are making headlines. Theymay be well-intentioned but are very misguided, because there is no soundmedical, legal, or social evidence that drug legalization would be a solutionto the drug problem. To the contrary, scientific research, history, andcommon sense tells us that if drugs are made easily available, drug usewill increase, drug addiction will increase, and society's problems willincrease. There are also others who are self-servingly promoting drug use, who aremembers of the Washington based Drug Policy Foundation, NORML, and the ACLU,"children of the 60's:, the so called "intellectuals" oftoday. These people, who now wear suits and ties instead of sandals andbeards, are working hard to shape public opinion in the media on recenttelevision and talk shows, and in popular magazines, and to influence lawmakersand public policy. Their agenda is the same as it was in the 60's and 70's.They believe they should have the right to alter their own consciousnessthrough drug use, ignoring the harm it would do to society in general ifdrugs were legal, available and socially acceptable. I was a teenager in the late 60's, and now as the mother of two teenagers,for their sake, I do not want to go back to that time when the drug culturewith its pot-heads, psychedelic mind-trips, and depraved lifestyles demoralizedthe nation. Society is paying a heavy price for the permissive drug useof that era, which has left in its wake problems of the homeless, childabuse, crack babies, the HIV epidemic, loss of productivity on the job,and crime-ridden communities. Drug legalization now would only deepen theproblem by increasing the number of drugged, addicted individuals on ourstreets, on the job, and in our hospitals. Now is not the time to surrender. Attitudes are changing. Drug use is nolonger considered "chic;" people in public housing are takinga stand against drug dealing; others are "reclaiming" their neighborhoodsand tearing down crack houses; and statistics show that drug use is downamong young people. We have a long way to go. We did not get here over night, but we are onthe right track. We must be convinced that a society and an environmentfree of the overwhelming problems associated with drug use are once againattainable. As a nation, we must be committed to providing safe, drug-freeand healthy environments where parents can parent, children can grow, teacherscan teach, and all of us can travel on our streets and live in neighborhoodswith the feeling of security For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must keep our standardshigh. We must never give in and risk the increase in drug use which legalizationwould surely bring.

At whatever age the condition begins, the emotional developmentof the user arrests. Hence, we find 40 year old people (some with excellentjobs, others unemployed) demonstrating irresponsible adolescent behaviors.Unfortunately, the enormous increase in drug use in the sixties and seventieshas led to a large adult cohort of drug users. Some adults have devoted their lives to advocating their drugs of choice,demanding that we legitimize their choices and behavior. They deny the effectsof drug use on their health, families, and society. They run pro-drug advocacygroups, magazines, web sites, etc. They deny the science that reflects theharm that their drugs of choice cause, claiming that the government andscientists are lying to them. Pro- drug advocacy groups send out by mailand via the internet materials disputing scientific claims of the harm thatmarijuana does and making outlandish claims of its benefits. Sadly, denialand lying are as much a part of drug use as getting high. Psychoactive drugs reduce inhibitions and self control, impair judgmentand decision-making skills. Those under the influence make high risk decisions,e.g., driving while impaired, having unsafe sex with inappropriate partners,overreacting to stressful situations, and generally engaging in behaviorsthat are highly likely to have negative consequences. Society is now reapingthe bitter fruits of increasing adolescent violence and anti-social behavioras the pre and post-natally damaged children of the drug users of the seventiesand eighties come of age.

Roques, Drug Prevention Specialist There is no verified information that needle distribution reduces the incidenceof HIV seroprevalence (positives) among intravenous drug users. There isonly self-reporting, anecdotal information. There are a number of international experiences that have been less thansatisfactory. The rate of HIV infections among addicts involved in heroinmaintenance programs in Switzerland ranges from 40% to 50% positive, despitedistribution of free, clean needles for at least 8 years. Italy and Spainhave a 70% rate of HIV prevalence among its heroin addicts, and needle saleshave never been restricted in those countries. The number of heroin addictsand needle sales have never been restricted in those countries. The numberof heroin addicts per capita in Switzerland, Italy, and Spain is severaltimes that of the U.S. Sweden has run a needle exchange study since 1987,and there is no statistical difference in the rate of HIV seroprevalencein the cities where the needles are distributed and the non-participatingcities. A needle distribution program in Montreal reflects a four timeshigher HIV seroconversion rate among participants, than non- participantaddicts. Distribution of clean needles cannot prevent overdose deaths or protectthe injector's immune system from being compromised by the drugs, causinggreater vulnerability to HIV, hepatitis, and other opportunistic diseases.It does enable the addict to continue this harmful behavior. Clearly, druguse (particularly intravenous use) is illogical and self-destructive. Advocatingthe concept of needle exchange as a perceived method of reducing the risksassociated with needle- sharing is predicated on the theory that intravenousdrug users will make a rational decision to delay fulfilling their needfor their drug, while they seek out a clean needle to insure their safety! It is an act of extraordinary faith to believe that people engaged in suchultimately self-destructive behavior can or will make rational, healthydecisions while fighting the ravages of withdrawal. The well- meaning activistsfor needle exchange project their own thoughtful evaluation of the riskof needle-sharing onto the dysfunctional thought processes of intravenousdrug users, a classic error. Needle use is not the only method of HIV transmission that affects drugusers. Prostitution and promiscuity are also high risk factors. Witnessthe explosion of HIV positives among non-needle using crack addicts. Needleexchange programs do not show any change in such dangerous sexual practices. Federal funding of needle exchange programs is inappropriate and premature.The science regarding the efficacy of needle exchange programs falls farshort of normal standards. Further scientific examination is called forand should be used to determine the wisest course for us to follow. We must not be stampeded by fear and politically correct advocates whosecompassion clouds their judgement.

Rosenthal NO, DRUGS CAN LEAVE YOU DEAD By A. M. Rosenthal New York -- He strolled out of his apartment in Manhattan. He knew whereto get what he wanted, no problem. He was back soon with his packages, theway some husbands come home with ice cream or flowers. He took some of the contents, and so did his wife. She died. The two childrenwere asleep. They found out in the morning. Happens all the time -- heroin overdose, dead on arrival. But he was a youngmagazine publisher and she a stockbroker -- both up and coming and everythingto live for. How could they do this to themselves and the kids? Soon somebody wrote a letter to The New York Times explaining how it happened.US. antidrug polices are to blame. The "demoniztion" of drugsprevented people from learning how much heroin at what potency was O.K.for holding good jobs without dropping dead. That failure to acknowledgethe enduring appeal of drugs is the "larger tragedy." This was from a professor. He also is a senior fellow at one of those pro-legalizationgroups supported by tax-free foundation money. This column is not directedto people like that. They make their reputations and living by being professionallegalization pushers; they are gone, goodbye. It is addressed to other people, in academia, or journalism, some lawyers,who simply believe that making drugs legally available would reduce drugcrime and save the billions spent on fighting drugs. They are worth arguingwith because they are people of influence. Their activities, writing, theirmoney to pro-drug foundations, help create a casualness, an acceptance,toward drugs that increases their use. I ask them to rethink the consequences of what they do. Start by callingthe Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse -- (212) 841-5227 -- to getits new report, "Legalization: Panacea or Pandora's Box?" I haveread myself groggy with studies on drugs. This one by the center -- at ColumbiaUniversity and headed by Joseph a. Califano Jr. -- is one of the most valuable. These are some of its points: The drug war has made substantial progress that would have been impossiblewithout laws and public support. The number of "current" users-- those who used drugs within the last month -- has dropped from 24.8 millionin 1979 to 13 million last year, nearly 50 percent -- but not evenly inall cities and neighborhoods. The number of hard addicts has stayed steadyat 6 million. Wrestling with them is the job ahead. Marijuana is the growing enemy of US youth. Teenagers who use it are85 times more likely also to use cocaine than those who do not. Youngstersalso say that the major deterrent to the use of marijuana and other drugsis legal penalty. More access to drugs through legalization or permissiveness will hugelyincrease consumption and addiction. That will cost far more than the $13billion spent to fight drugs -- in increased hospital costs, spread of disease,and drop in economic productivity and student learning abilities. Drug-gang crimes would decrease only if drugs could be bought almosteverywhere by grown-ups and kids, wiping out all black markets. Even so,crime would increase -- by drug-related crimes not related to the drug trade,like murder, rape and assault. Experiments in legalization or permissiveness have failed. In theNetherlands, adolescent marijuana use has increased 250 percent. Registeredharder-drug addicts have increased by 22 percent. Reading this report should be the ticket to talking about legalization.Go argue with it. If you still want more access to drugs, stroll down tobuy a few packets for yourself and your wife, while the children sleep.No problem.

Why shouldn't illegal drug dealers pay for the harm they cause? . . . InAmerica, sellers of legitimate products that are defective can be forcedto pay for the injuries they cause. Courts force such payments regularlyin civil suits brought by those injured, or their parents, against thosewho profited from the distribution of the harmful product. High punitivedamages are often imposed by courts and juries in civil judgments againstproduct distributors who sell their product even though they know of thepotential harm. Third parties, such as insurance companies and hospitals,can recover their costs of treatment either directly or indirectly fromthose responsible for harmful products. Doesn't it strike you as "out of whack" that millions of dollarsare paid by legitimate business that negligently produce or distribute harmfulproducts, yet personal injury suits against dealers of the ultimate harmfulproduct, illegal drugs, are virtually unheard of? . . . If so, the DrugDealer Liability Act should get your active support in your state. It hasalready passed in Michigan, Illinois, Hawaii, Oklahoma, and Arkansas andis pending in California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida. The Act fillsa vacuum in the laws against illegal drug trade. It imposes civil liabilityon anyone who is intentionally involved in trafficking illegal drugs. Who can recover damages under the Drug Dealer Liability Act? . . . Parents,hospitals, employers, insurance companies, county health departments andothers who suffer a financial burden as a result of illegal drug sales intheir community. All can recover damages, including punitive damages, fromany drug dealer in that community. For example, let's say "Bob"is a cocaine dealer who also has a successful dry cleaning business thatis independent of his drug trafficking. Even if Bob gets arrested and convictedof drug dealing, his dry cleaning business cannot be forfeited, since itis neither proceeds of, nor used to facilitate Bob's drug deals. However,a parent of a teen in drug treatment in Bob's community could bring suitagainst Bob to pay for the treatment. Bob could even be forced by the courtto sell his business to pay for drug treatment for kids in his community.Moreover, county hospitals that care for drug babies at public expense couldbring suits against drug dealers who may have assets, including wages thatcan be garnished. "Wait!" you say. Aren't most drug dealers "street dealers"who are often inner city people without bank accounts, legitimate businessesor garnisheable wages?. . . Many are . . .but most are not. Let's look atthe statistics. A national survey of household drug use by the National Institute on DrugAbuse showed that 67% of all drug users are employed. Workplace dealersmay be the majority of retail dealers. Moreover, this group may be deterredby threat of civil suit in which they could lose their savings, retirementfunds, home and other assets and have their wages garnished. In fact, experts on drugs in the workplace acknowledge that the major problemis the "accommodation dealer," the employee who happens to havea "source" and accommodates his or her friends by making drugpurchases as a middle man. But is it reasonable to expect that an accommodation dealer would be deterredby a potential civil suit, when they aren't being deterred by the possibilityof criminal charges? . . . The criminal prosecution of workplace dealers,particularly accommodation dealers, is virtually non-existent. Workplacesare difficult, if not impossible, for undercover operations to penetrate.Management is loath to call the police and publicize their company's drugproblem. Workplace dealers feel relatively safe dealing drugs to fellowemployees whom they have known for years. Furthermore, prosecutors are toobusy with wholesale dealers to focus much attention on retail dealers whodon't strike the community's attention. Does the Drug Dealer Liability Act have a potential for significant impact?. . . You bet it does. Markets respond to economic pressure. When some retaildrug dealers, even accommodation dealers, have to give up their assets topay for drug treatment facilities, many will be less likely to enter themarket. With fewer retailers promoting drugs to prospective customers, therewill be fewer customers and fewer retail sales. When retail sales decrease,markets decline. We have been concentrating on the major dealers; now it is time to confrontthe retail dealers. What's more, the Drug Dealer Liability Act doesn't requiremore prosecutors and police officers to have its impact. Peter Bensinger, a former head of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,has said that the Drug Dealer Liability Act has the potential to have asmuch impact as the major drug forfeiture laws passed by Congress in the1970s. It has been adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council,an organization of over 2,000 legislators nationwide, as its model legislation.

The notion thatsomehow legalization will take the underworld element out of the drug tradeand result in lower drug prices is ludicrous. To think that this will somehowreduce the drug problem is flawed logic. In fact, drug use would become far more widespread and rampant. Our modelson this are alcohol and tobacco. They represent extremely serious healthhazards. Why should we add cocaine, marijuana, etc., to this spectrum ofpotential physical and psychological disaster? Marijuana is clearly addictive, is responsible for behavioral, intellectualand cognitive deficits, and is responsible for severe side-effects to thepulmonary, reproductive and immune systems as well."

"Those who would legalize drugs fall into two categories -- Pollyannaswho are incredibly naive or uninformed, or children playing with matches.Legalization is a Pandora's box, which if opened would unleash a tide thatwill sweep away prevention and treatment."

Gilligan, Ph.D. International Drug Strategy Institute Director,International Delegates It's time for a change in America. Eight out of 10 Americans polled believethat the country is headed in the wrong direction. The questions are -- how did this happen, and what's to be done about it? Answers: We have tolerated too much, and it's time to stop! The innumerable problems facing our nation were not born overnight. We originallytolerated them in their harmless infancy. Now that they have grown dangerous,society decries them. We want someone to blame. Yet, we are that society.We are responsible for what is. Let's look at how it all happens. It is human nature to adjust, accommodate and readily tolerate slow andincremental changes in life. This capacity to adapt has great survival value,but it is also humanity's Achilles' heel. For we can learn to tolerate almostanything, even to the point of our own undoing. The founders of America recognized this tendency when they wrote in theDeclaration of Independence that ". . . all experience has shown thatmankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than toright themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed." What an insightful but also alarming sentence. There is this human tendencyto tolerate the evils around us and a hesitancy to take action against them.Yes, we have a wonderful ability to adapt to and tolerate most anything.It is in our nature. But, this capacity must be governed by forethought,self-discipline and the courage to challenge, or it will slowly and incrementallyresult in self- destruction. Take crime, for example. Look at how well society has passively adjustedto living with it: deadbolt locks, Mace, attack dogs, whistles, handguns-- 60 million legal ones -- and lots of protective barriers. Security guardhave become one of the leading employment opportunities in the United States.We have become accustomed to hourly crime as the reality of American life. Through this slow and incremental process, society can become tolerant ofand habituated to the very behaviors that can destroy it. Here is a sampleof behaviors to which we have grown accustomed: In addition to crime inthe street, we tolerate poor manners, disrespectful youth, poor performancein the classroom and workplace, litter on the side of our roads and underagedrinking. How does tolerating such apparently minor misbehaviors affect the nationalcharacter? Easily. Once a critical mass of citizens engage in them, societalmeltdown is soon to follow.

It was noted in thisproposed motion that there is a "growing body of evidence which testifiesto the medicinal and therapeutic properties of cannabis and its relativesafety compared with other legalized drugs". However, an amendment was made and passed stating that increased penaltiesfor possession of cannabis set by the government were welcomed "inthe light of overwhelming medical evidence that cannabis leads to poor short-termmemory and learning problems, lung damage and cancer risks that are 50-70per cent greater than those associated with tobacco use, reduced immunityproducing cells, and impairment of heart function: (it is noted that) cannabiscauses greater organic brain damage than any other drug with the possibleexception of PCP and the end stages of alcoholism; and that the effect ofone cannabis cigarette lasts five or six times as long as one unit of alcohol".It was then stated that "(this House) deplores any moves towards thelegalization of cannabis, based on the experience in Alaska where such amove was abandoned in 1990, having led to the increased use of both soft(sic) and hard (sic) drugs, increased drug related crime and increased healthcare costs". A letter from a pro-legalization organization questioning the facts of thispassed amendment was sent to the Member of Parliament responsible for itsdraft. This paper sets out to address these questions by citing recent relevantresearch findings. The effects of cannabis in the amendment are not "falsified" norare they a "form of outdated propaganda (laid) onto people.... ".In addition, the information on the harmful effects of cannabis are notbased on "biased newspaper reports". In fact, in reviewing thenewspapers over the past three years, there has not been a true factualrepresentation of the harmful effects of cannabis nor the potential dangersin legalizing or decriminalizing it. Instead, pro-cannabis individuals andgroups have been able to use the newspapers as a forum for their "cause"to the exclusion of factual information on cannabis and its effects. The facts on cannabis are not a "form of outdated propaganda".It should be pointed out that most of the studies cited in the pro-legalizationletter are outdated - documenting the evidence that "no detrimentaleffects (of cannabis) can be proved," when examining reference 1-13,eight of these are from the 1970s, one is from 1982, two are from the l990s(both of these sources, High Times and HEMP, "Help Eliminate MarijuanaProhibition," are pro-cannabis) and two are listed as "1893-4"and "1944". The majority of the research cited in the letter,therefore, is outdated. This is a major problem because medical researchin general has advanced technically since the 1970s. The "long-term"studies cited in the letter are from 1977 (Greek study) and 1975 (Jamaicanstudy). It should be noted that recent studies are able to assess the longerterm effects of cannabis, using more advanced research techniques (see belowfor examples). In addition, the study cited in the letter which examinedthe effect of cannabis on the immune system was from 1976. This is beforeAIDS was discovered. More recent studies on the immune system (how it worksand what affects it) have occurred since 1976 and these studies show theimpairing effect cannabis has on the immune system (see below for more detail). The following are some examples of more recent research to counter the researchclaims mentioned in the letter: Effects on memory: a carefully controlled study byRichard Schwartz; Georgetown University; Washington D.C. directly studiedthe effect of cannabis on memory (and examined other studies) and concludedthat the use of cannabis "impairs short term memory well beyond theperiod of intoxication". (Cannabis: Phvsiopathologv. Epidemiology Detection1993), not solely during the period of intoxication, as written in the letter(based on information from 1973). Cardiovascular/respiratory and carcinogenic effects:numerous studies on humans which examined the effects of marijuana on lungcell tissue have indicated that the adverse effects of marijuana smoke invarious contents equal or surpass the similar effects of tobacco smoke ("Government'sSupplemental Memorandum Re: Health Effects of Marijuana," in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Hawaii by the U. S. Attorney inHawaii, 1992). This report also documents that marijuana contains a totalof 421 chemicals, which include a variety of toxins and cancer-inducingchemicals. This finding was replicated after the United States Public Health'Service ordered a study by the nations' top scientists at the NationalInstitute of Health. A one year review of data concluded "marijuanacigarette smoke contains a complex mixture of over 400 compounds includingpolyareomatic hydrocarbons which are carcinogenic" (1992) (The letterstates that there are other ways to ingest cannabis than smoking it, however,the majority of cannabis users smoke it). The U. S. Attorney in Hawaii's report also included citation of studiesshowing that marijuana has substantial adverse health effects not previouslysuspected - including impairing effects on brain tissue and psychologicalfunctioning and damage to reproductive and immunological systems which arealso cited in this document. Immunity: In 1993, Virginia Medical College (USA)found that THC damages the immune system and reduces the ability to fightdisease (including AIDS). Also last year, Cabral and Vasquez from the Departmentof Microbiology and Immunology (Medical College of Virginia, USA) reportedthat cellular immunity and pulmonary immunity are impaired and it is nowdocumented that there is an impaired ability to fight infections in humans. The metabolism of cannabis: the metabolism of cannabisis not "similar to alcohol" as written in the letter. It has beenfound that cannabinoid urinary metabolites may be detected 3-5 days afteroccasional smoking and up to 77 days after chronic use (5 cigarettes a day)(Paul Latargue, Institut de Recherche Criminelle de la Gendarmerie, France,1993). Marijuana differs substantially from alcohol and other drugs whichare water soluble - marijuana is fat soluble and as such accumulates inthe brain, adrenal glands, liver, kidneys, heart, and sexual organs. Beingfat soluble, THC and other cannabinoids tend to remain in the body longafter the mind-altering effects of the drug have ceased, unlike water-solublealcohol ("Government's Supplemental Memorandum Re: Health Effects ofMarijuana," in the United States District Court for the District ofHawaii by the U.S. Attorney in Hawaii, 1992). The long-term effects of cannabis: in contrast tothe statements in the letter that harmful long term effects of cannabisuse have not been found, the Center for Brain Research in California (Gilkeson)and Oxford University (Paton) have found that the long term presence ofthe fat soluble molecules of cannabis do cause damage to the brain. Celldamage has also been found (University of Toulouse, University of Utah andUniversity of Toronto). It is therefore not accurate to state, as notedin the letter, that "all effects are reversible". Also, as statedbefore, lung damage occurs from smoking. In regard to Alaska, cannabis was decriminalized, not legalized,through the Alaska Supreme Court and through the initial support of policeprimarily because they first thought crime would decrease. However, cannabisuse and problem use went up (with heavy increases in health and social costs).An important factor in rescinding decriminalization was the response ofthe police, who saw first hand the problems caused by decriminalization.Whether or not there was a direct cause and effect relationship betweencannabis decriminalization and the increase in crime, decriminalizationwas seen to have failed. In seeing this failure, the police who had initiallysupported decriminalization fully supported rescinding the law. "Legalization could provide significant benefits to society,"as claimed in the letter, is not true when examining cities that tried decriminalization.In addition to Alaska's experience with decriminalization, when examiningthe effects of their lenient cannabis laws, the Dutch policy has been associatedwith a progressive increase in cannabis use among 15- 19 year old (from4% in 1984 to over 8% in 1989). Between 1984 and 1988, the use of cannabisincreased by almost 100% among upper high school students in the Netherlands.The policy of "harm reduction@' has not prevented a steady and significantrise in drug addiction (cannabis, cocaine and opiates) among 15-19 yearolds and young adults. ("Drug Reform: The Dutch Experience," RichardH. Schwartz, 1993). The Dutch Institute on Alcohol and Drugs recently questioned8,000 young people and also found that the percentage of students smokingcannabis has more than doubled in four years (from 3% in 1984 to 7% in 1988).(Guardian 9 November 1993). It should also be noted that references in the letter to support the claimthat "legalization could provide significant benefits to society"included three sources of information from the 1970s. In addition, the two1993 resources are by pro-cannabis, and thus, biased, authors. Finally, in contrast to the 1993 report, cited in the letter, on the decreasedhealth costs and lower absenteeism of drug-using employees in Utah Powerand Light and Georgia Power (originally appearing in High Times, a pro-cannabisand therefore, biased publication), it should be noted that over 85% ofthe largest employers in the USA use urinalysis drug testing as a meansof preventing illegal drug use on and off the job. Several studies havebeen conducted that examine work performance of employees using illegaldrugs compared with those who have tested negatively for such drugs. For example, at the U.S. Postal Service, the biggest employer in the USA,300 people who tested positively for illegal drugs were compared with non-drugusers who started work at the same time. After eight months, accident rates,injury, absenteeism, and disciplinary problems were found to be far higherfor the illegal drug users than for non-drug users. (Supervisors did notknow which employees tested positive for drugs). Those who tested positivehad higher termination and turnover rates than the no-drug user. After 16months, absenteeism, termination, and turnover rates increased even morefor the drug-users. The U. S. Postal Service has decided to do pre-employmentdrug testing to save 62 million dollars a year and decrease absenteeism,turnover, and accidents ("Testing for Illicit Drugs in the Workplace,"Peter Bensinger, Former Director, Drug Enforcement Administration, WashingtonD.C.) (Cannabis: Physiopathology. Epidemiology, Detection, 1993). In addition,it was recently found (March 1994) that drug use and resulting disciplinaryproblems by some Chicago postal employees has resulted in the nondeliveryof nearly 10,000 pieces of mail, some of which was dumped and burned. Thisproblem has had a major effect on the people and business in the areas affected. In conclusion, it is clear that the defeat of the proposed "Royal Commissionon Cannabis" is based on factual and recent research and is a positivemove to support prevention.

For about eight years now, we have witnessed a gradual shift from arestrictive to a more and more liberal drug policy in Switzerland. Thiseventually led to the big open drug scene at the Platzspitz and later at theLettensteg in Zurich. Because of the reduced law enforcement, drugs becamemore and more available. At that time, the distribution of heroin as ameasure of help for drug addicts was put on the political agenda. In my presentation, I'll shortly explain the attitude of the Swiss Governmenton drug policy. Then, after a presentation of the heroin projects, I willfocus on the scientific insufficiencies of these experiments. The Swiss Federal Government In February 1991 the Swiss Federal Government demanded measures to stabilize the number of drug addicts by 1993 and to reduce it by 20% until 1996. It demanded further efforts in the field of prevention and therapy as well as assistance and support for addicts. At that time, a scientificallyaccompanied pilot project on the distribution of narcotics to addicts wastaken into consideration; the distribution of heroin, however, should beexcluded in any case. This was in 1991: definitely no heroin distribution. Nevertheless, the Federal Government - under strong political pressure -agreed upon a scientifically accompanied project on the medical prescriptionof narcotics including heroin in May 1992. In October 1993, the responsibleauthority, the Federal Office of Public Health, approved on 7 submittedprojects in bigger cities of Switzerland. Aims of the experiments In the experimental design the general objective of the experiments isdescribed as follows: "Projects on the medical prescription of narcotics to drug addicts aredefined as scientific experiments aimed at examining the success of this kindof therapy as one step towards drug abstinence." Thus, the success of the projects should be determined by the number ofparticipants who become drug abstinent. Further aims are: Improvement of the physical and/or mental health of the addicts Improvement of their social integration (e.g. reduction of delinquency) Improvement of their responsible behaviour concerning the risk ofHIV-infection Research questions of the experimental plan The experimental plan includes a number of questions, for instance aboutgeneral well-being, ability to work, contacts with the drug scene, delinquentbehaviour, risk behaviour, subjective effects of drugs, preference of drugsand ways of application, to mention only some of them. The data come fromquestionnaires and interviews with the participants. Types of projects The participants get either iv heroin, iv morphine or iv methadone. They alsoget other substances like oral methadone, benzodiazepines oranti-depressants. The experiment is conducted in five different types ofprojects. They deal with different target groups or contextual conditions. Inthree of the project types the decision which drug is given to which addictis made by the doctor who asks the addict for his preferences. Two projectsstarted with a randomized allocation one of them is also double blind. Thisdouble blind project, however, was soon abandoned. The addicts may now choose the substance themselves. Number of participants and changes of the project design Originally, the experimental groups (heroin, methadone, morphine) weresupposed to be of the same size, 250 subjects each. For heroin being the drugof choice of most of the addicts, the heroin groups were filled much fasterthan the other two groups. So in December 1994, there was a first extensionof the heroin group up to 500 subjects. In May 1995 a second extension wasdecided upon. The number of heroin places was then increased up to 800.Additionally, the project design was changed in that the heroin distributionprojects were to be integrated into existing methadone maintenance programsand the prescription of narcotics should be extended to patients withpsychiatric disorders and to prisoners. The next steps which are discussedare the possibilities to take drugs home, to make cocaine available and tofurther extent the inclusion criteria (NZZ 16.8.95). This means they want tomake it easier for the addicts to participate in the projects. Actual size of the groups By April 1st, 1995, there were 286 participants in the heroin group, 28 inthe morphine group and 41 in the methadone group. Of the possible number of988 places, only 355 are filled. Criticism From a scientific point of view, those narcotics distribution projects inSwitzerland and their scientific evaluation have to be criticized for a lotof reasons. First of all, I think that the distribution of heroin to drug addicts has tobe rejected for ethical reasons. Human beings should not be misused asexperimental rabbits! Negative effects on the whole society, an increase ofthe drug problem, an increase of delinquency and of the HIV epidemic have tobe expected. The devastating effects of such projects were alreadydemonstrated in different countries at different times. Let us continue with the research questions. They are partly formulated in avery general and unspecific way. The answers to this questions will be basedon questionnaires and interviews done with addicts who know that their future depends on their answers, and taken by professionals whose professional future depends on the outcome of these projects. A lot of energy is wasted and questions such as drug tolerance, side effects and withdrawal symptoms could have been answered easily by referring to the existing scientific literature. Unfortunately, the most controversial questions are not examined: The effectof the projects on the drug scene, the effect on drug related delinquency andthe effect on the AIDS epidemic. A fact which will result in a very difficult scientific problem is that theproject design was changed several times in different ways. The number ofsubjects was changed, the number of experimental groups was changed, the type of drug allocation was changed. A major criticism has to focus on the different group size of the heroin andthe other groups. You get into serious statistical trouble if you try to getsignificant results from a comparison of two groups if the number of subjects in one group is ten times higher than the number in the other group. Being aware of this forthcoming problem, the director of the experiment decided just not to compare the three groups. For my understanding, this is one further step away from a scientific approach. Another basic deficiency of the project design is that there is no drug freecontrol group. And above all, the polydrug use is a major pitfall of the evaluation of theheroin projects. According to Prof. Uchtenhagen, the director of theexperiment, only 10% of the participants are pure heroin consumers, whereasabout 80% additionally consume cocaine and/or other drugs. The participantsare not required to take only the drugs they get in the projects and there isno systematic testing on drugs. Obviously, the politicians who favoured this type of project and evaluationdo not really believe in what is said in the general objective of theexperiment itself, namely that this kind of therapy should be one steptowards drug abstinence. I think it is generally questionable if such a controversial issue likegiving heroin to heroin addicts is to be evaluated by means of a projectwhich is not designed according to scientific standards. The term scientificjust refers to the "accompanying scientific evaluation". Ladies andGentlemen, such a kind of scientific evaluation cannot compensate for theweaknesses of the project design and for the soft and biased data.

Creighton THE MARKETING OF MARIJUANA THE SHADOW PUSHERS TARGET AMERICA'S YOUTH by Rosanna Creighton The "shadow pushers" are the aging marijuana users and advocateswho try to legitimize their drug of choice and perpetuate their crusadeto legalize marijuana. They have embraced slick marketing and promotionaltechniques that target a new generation of potential marijuana advocates.Media blitzes, billboard and print advertising, celebrity endorsements andpromotion, logo merchandising, mainstream outlet distribution, religiousand environmental sensitivities, and compassion for the ill and suffering;all of these techniques have been used. Their most potent weapon is subterfuge.Keep the masses ignorant of the facts, and manipulate and distort the truth. They try desperately to separate marijuana from the other dangerous mind-alteringdrugs. They call it hemp! They call it medicine! They portray themselvesas caring and compassionate. They do whatever they can to get attentionand sound rational; they conceal their true agenda - complete LEGALIZATIONOF MARIJUANA. They target America's youth by going to college campuses inan attempt to recreate themselves and their own college experiences of spacingout, promoting peace and free love while rebelling against the establishment.They desperately need new recruits to emulate their ideals and their lifestyle. But unlike the 60's and 70's, smoking pot and legalizing marijuana is notwell received by the general public today, so the shadow pushers have disguisedtheir intent and turned to promoting hemp to save the environment and promotingmedical marijuana to end pain and suffering. Richard Cowan, former directorof NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and DrugPolicy Foundation Board of Advisors clarifies their point of view, "Medicalmarijuana is....our strongest suit. It is our point of leverage which willmove us toward the legalization of marijuana for personal use."1 STRATEGY NUMBER ONE - MARIJUANA, THE MEDICAL MAGIC BULLET Let's look at what the shadow pushers mean by medical marijuana. Theyinsist pot smoking will help America's sick and terminally ill. No crediblemedical or scientific data supports such an outrageous claim, but they sayit, and the media prints or broadcasts it. In 1979, Emory University studentswere told that NORML would help reclassify marijuana as medicine for chemotherapypatients, "as a red herring to give marijuana a good name...."2 A synthetic form of THC (the only chemical in marijuana identified astherapeutic) is available by prescription, but that is not good enough forthe shadow pushers. If they acknowledge that a pharmaceutical preparationis already legal and available, they can't push for growing and using potwithout legal restriction. They would lose their political agenda and theirprofit potential. So they push the need to smoke pot by exploiting the fears and desperationof sick people and their families. The shadow pushers do not tell the public,and the media rarely includes scientific fact with the marijuana propaganda,that smoking marijuana can weaken and damage the immune system. Crude leafmarijuana can irritate the lungs and introduce bacteria and fungal organismsthat can lead to infection and upper respiratory arrest. To successfully market an idea or a product, the promoter would never wantthe target audience to know that the product is not proven safe or effective.The truth is, AIDS and chemotherapy patients have an extremely weakenedimmune system, and smoking pot can be extremely dangerous to them and otherailing Americans. But the shadow pushers cleverly conceal the potentialdangers of smoking marijuana. Why do they conceal the dangers? Because theywould risk losing their legalization goal! Why don't the media reveal therisks to sick people smoking pot as "medicine"? Because they rarelyknow or believe the truth, and the shadow pushers use the media to theiradvantage. Marijuana advocates have been carefully trained. In a media workshopat the 1985 NORML conference advocates were instructed to, "strokethe egos of reporters. They like to be courted, they like to have attentionpaid to them."3 These advocates are not concerned about substantiatingclaims because, most of their press releases get publicized anyway. Case in point: in 1985 NORML head Kevin Zeese sent out a press release claimingthat marijuana had become the largest cash crop in the country. This informationwas never verified. There was no real way to substantiate such a claim,but this "fact" was publicized all over the country in major newspapers.4 Wow, what a break for the shadow pushers! They can tell lies, distort thetruth, exaggerate, or fantasize. It doesn't matter if what they say is notproven by reputable scientific fact -- they just say what they want, andit usually gets printed. In the last few months, their ideas and fantasieshave received increasing attention on major television networks. Nonscientificclaims with no solid base of medical evidence have been printed and broadcastrepeatedly until Americans, young and old, believe what they hear and read.The marketing is effective, appallingly effective. The medical marijuana scam has reached our youth! Young people believe thepropaganda, repeat the misconceptions, and tell themselves and each otherthat marijuana is natural, that God created it, that it is less harmfulthan tobacco and alcohol, and that it couldn't be bad because it is usedfor medicine. So smoking crude leaf marijuana for medicine becomes a successful marketingtool for the shadow pushers. The truth doesn't reach the public and thelegalizers become the winners; the kids, their parents, the community, thecountry, and especially the sick and the vulnerable, become the losers. This marketing strategy has unfortunately gotten a boost from the tragicHIV/AIDS epidemic. As stated in High Times Greatest Hits, "Due in largepart to the growing AIDS crisis, the fight for medical marijuana has becomethe most important issue in the battle for legalization."5 STRATEGY NUMBER TWO - HEMP FOR VICTORY The marketing of hemp fabric and novelty products started out as a cottageindustry targeting the counterculture; but by calling marijuana or pot "hemp",a new twist for respectability and mainstreaming became available to theshadow pushers. Direct from High Times Greatest Hits comes insight into this marketing strategy."Hemp Clothing Is Here! Suddenly, out of nowhere came Stoned Wear,a new line of hemp clothing and products.... High Times editors were skeptical,as the clothing samples sent were only 55% hemp and 45% cotton. Is thisthe real thing or not, we asked? Then we met Matthew Cheng and Alex Shum, the two men who are importing thehemp fabric. Matthew and Alex feel that the way to legalize marijuana isto sell marijuana legally. When you can buy marijuana in your neighborhoodshopping mall, IT'S LEGAL! So, they are going to produce every conceivablething out of hemp: hemp shirts, hemp pants, hemp jackets, hemp hats, hempoven mittens, hemp towels, hemp pot holders, hemp books, hemp comics, hempscratch pads, and hemp stationery. Anything and everything you can thinkof will be made of hemp."6 And it is all coming true. Hemp is being promoted as a fabric, a fiber,an environmental savior; a true marketing find for the shadow pushers. EvenAdidas has joined the counterculture's marketing of hemp to America's youthby introducing a sport shoe called "The Hemp" with hemp tops andhemp shoelaces. Everyone is cashing in! But the cash is often coming fromour children's pockets, and the hemp hype is promoting a strong psychoactivedrug - marijuana. Hemp, as a word, is confusing, which adds to the benefitsof the marijuana legalization efforts. Marijuana (pot, weed, reefer, bud,chronic, blunt, dope, ganja, etc.) is generally called Cannabis Indica orIndian Hemp or Cannabis sativa. "True hemp" is Cannabis sativaL. There are other fibers that are referred to by the generic name "hemp",which can be Manila hemp or abaca, sisal hemp or henequen, New Zealand hemp,jute and others.7 Only the "true hemp" comes from the cannabisplant, the same plant as the psychoactive drug, marijuana. Whether "true hemp" or a generic hemp fiber, the shadow pushersjust call it "hemp". They interchange hemp and the word marijuanawhenever they want and whenever it suits their purpose. They market "hemp"as an environmentally sound fiber, and just like the smoking marijuana for"medicine" strategy, their claims about "hemp" beingthe environmental magic bullet gets printed and repeated with no scientificproof. Remember, they have learned they do not have to substantiate theirclaims; it gets printed anyway. The kids buy into the marijuana propaganda hook, line, and sinker; so domany adults. America's environmental idealism gets exploited just like thesick and terminally ill get exploited. The marketing strategies are working. In the September 1993 issue of Madamoiselle, Rob Buchanan writes, "Tothe antidrug lobby, the medical marijuana argument is a cynical attemptby recreational users to capitalize on sympathy for the ill, just as theindustrial-use argument tries to cash in on the sympathy for the environment...."That premise is supported by the very actions of the marijuana promotersand the words of their leaders. "It's the 'leaky bucket' strategy,"says Eric Sterling, marijuana promoter and president of the Criminal JusticeFoundation. "Legalize it (marijuana) in one area, and sooner or laterit will trickle down into the others."8 Yes, the shadow pushers know what they are marketing. They are marketingthe legalization of marijuana and they are targeting America's youth. Besidesmarijuana leaf logo clothes and novelty items, besides "hemp"clothes and products, they have utilized the most powerful youth spell binderavailable -- rock music and rap groups! STRATEGY NUMBER THREE - LOSE YOURSELF IN THE MUSIC ANDTHE BEAT Hempilation (1995 Capricorn Records), a CD featuring a variety of rockbands, vividly demonstrates this marketing approach. This album was producedto benefit NORML, and it shamelessly promotes pot smoking. This album includes: I Wanna Get High by Cypress Hill I Want To Take You Higher by Blues Traveler Don't Step On The Grass, Sam by Gov't Mule Champagne & Reefer by Ian Moore Sweet Leaf by Sacred Reich Who's got The Herb by 311 I Like Marijuana by David Peel And The 360's High Time We Went by The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies Smokin' Cheeba Cheeba by High Fidelity Pot Head Pixies by Raging Slab Legalize It by Sublime Homegrown by Gus And It Stoned Me by Widespread Panic High Times magazine promotes this album in a full-page ad offering hempilationT-shirts and hemp baseball hats. When asked about their special supportof NORML, High Times replied: "High Times' founder Tom Forcade workedclosely with NORML, and the magazine will continue to support the groupuntil legalization is realized."9 In High Times Greatest Hits the editors say, "In 1993, rock and rapstars moved to the forefront of the legalization movement." CyprusHill's Sen Dog states, "in all our demos, we rhymed about gettin' high.It's just something that comes natural to us."10 The shadow pusherstell America's youth, be hip -- do drugs--be like us. Marijuana is OK, it'shealthy, and it's good for the environment. Marketing marijuana, marketing illicit drug use, marketing lies for profitand political gain; the shadow pushers know no shame. At the Hempfest in Seattle, Sarah Ferguson writes, "...with the late-summersun came crowds, thousands upon thousands of ganja fans, hemp fanatics,medical marijuana crusaders, and stoned-out rockers, ready to fete the herbin all its glory."11 Our young people flock to these hemp/marijuana/pot festivals, they learnto glorify the herb, glorify hemp, and glorify the mind-altering drug -marijuana. The shadow pushers say: MARIJUANA can reduce stress, increase creativity, enhance sensual activities, improve health, create laughter, and stimulate good feelings *********** Hard drugs like heroin, cocaine and PCP CAN KILL you.

These children are the innocent victims of their parents marijuana use. Basedon research by Dr. L. Robison in the publication Cancer and Dr. J. Buckleyin Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection. * * * Marijuana smoke produces airway injury, acute and chronic bronchitis, lung inflammation, and decreased pulmonary defences against infection. Smoking one marijuana cigarette leads to airway deposition of four times as much cancer-causing tar as does tobacco smoke. Based on research by by Dr. D. Tashkin as reported in the Western Journalof Medicine. * * * Cases of cancer, including cancer of the mouth, tongue, larynx, jaw, head, neck, and lungs have been reported in young marijuana smokers that would not occur in tobacco smokers until much later in life. Based on research by reported in Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, the Journal of the American Medical Association and Southern Medical Journal. * * * A 1995 study of blood samples taken from one thousand four hundred and forty-one dead or impaired drivers across Canada found marijuana present in 38% of these samples. Based on research by ofDr. Wayne Hindmarsh, Dean, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba and Wayne Jeffery, R.C.M.P. Police Forensic Laboratory. * * * Marijuana has long been known to trigger attacks of mental illness, such as bipolar (manic-depressive) psychosis and schizophrenia. It has been shown that marijuana users are six times more likely to develop schizophrenia than are non-users. Based on research byof Dr. S. Andreasson published in Britain's The Lancet. * * * The use of marijuana leads to the use of other drugs. Of those who use marijuana 3 to 10 times, 20% go on to use cocaine. Of those who use marijuana one hundred or more times, 75% go on to use cocaine. Based on research by as reported in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. * * * Marijuana causes both dependence and addiction. Addictive use is defined by compulsive repeated use in spite of adverse consequences. Marijuana's effects include tolerance leading to dependence and inability to cease use. Based on research by of Dr. Mark Gold published in his book Marijuana. * * * It's not just alcohol that caused impaired accidents. A roadside study of reckless drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, showed that 45% of these drivers tested positive for marijuana. Based on research by of Dr. Dan Brookoff, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. * * * The effects of marijuana persist much longer than the effects of alcohol. Using a computerized flight simulator, an experiment on pilots showed that their ability to land a plane was still impaired 24 hours after smoking one marijuana cigarette. Based on research by of Dr.V. Leirer in Aviation, Space & Environmental Medicine. * * * Children exposed to marijuana prenatally have increased behavioural problems, and they have decreased visual perception, language comprehension, attention span and memory. These children are the innocent victims of their parents marijuana use. Based on research by of Dr. Peter Fried of the Ottawa Prenatal Prospective Study. * * * In males marijuana use diminishes testosterone production and lowers sperm count. In females, marijuana use disrupts hormone cycles. Marijuana is mutagenic, fetotoxic (poisonous to the fetus) and impairs RNA and DNA synthesis. Based on research by of Dr. Mark Goldin his book Marijuana and Drs. Latour and Nahas in the Medical Journal of Australia. * * * Marijuana impairs the white blood cells which fight infection. Marijuana also causes decreased resistance to diseasessuch as herpes. Marijuana smokers have increased outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, accidents and other illnesses. Based on researchby of Drs. Spector, Djeu, Watzl and Cabral in Advances in Experimental Medicine & Biology and the Western Journal of Medicine. * * * Children prenatally exposed to marijuana experienced more than two times the number of sleep arousals at night and more awake time after each sleep arousal than children not prenatally exposed to marijuana. Based on research by published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. * * * Cases of cancer from marijuana use are now well documented. In one California study 90% of young cancer patients are marijuana smokers compared with 40% of young people in California as a whole. Based on research by by Dr. P. Donald in Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery . * * * HIV positive marijuana smokers have increased incidence of bacterial pneumonias in comparison to non-smokers. HIV positive smokers develop full-blown AIDS twice as fast as non-smokers. Based on research by in the journal, AIDS Weekly 1993, and Dr. Neiman, in the journal, AIDS 1993. * * * In a survey of one hundred and fifty marijuana using students, 59% surveyed report they sometimes forget what a conversation is about before it has ended. 41% report that if they read while stoned they remembered less of what they had read hours later. Based on research by of Dr. Richard Schwartz, Vienna Pediatric Associates in Psychiatric Annals. * * * Long-term use of marijuana may cause irreversible memory problems. Marijuana users find it more difficult to separate irrelevant information from the relevant, their reaction times are longer and electrical activity of the brain is slowed. Based on research by from Macquarie University, Sydney in conjunction with Australia's National Drug& Alcohol Research Centre. * * * Marijuana impairs perception, judgment, thinking, memory and learning. Memory defects may persist for 6 weeks after last marijuana use. Based on research by of Dr. Richard Schwartz, Vienna Pediatrics Associates in the American Journal of Diseases of Children. * * * There are significant negative effects of prenatal marijuana exposure on the performance of children in standard intelligence tests. On average children exposed prenatally to marijuanawill have a lower IQ compared to children who are not exposed. Based on research by of Dr. Day et al, in Neurotoxicology and Teratology. * * * A cannabis (marijuana)-state-dependent effect in users includes weaknesses in analytic and synthetic skills. This includes having difficulty sorting out information, synthesizing and classifying information correctly and understanding subtle shades of meaning. Basedon research by of Dr. Lundqvist in Life Sciences. * * * Fetal Marijuana Symptoms are similar to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome are two diseases children are born with that are totally preventable. One of the leading specialists in cellular heredity, Dr. Akira Morishima of Columbia University, has said that in his 20 years of research on human cells he has never found any other drug, including heroin, which comes close to the DNA damage caused by marijuana. * * * Saying nobody ever died from smoking marijuana is like saying nobody ever died from smoking tobacco. Marijuana contains the same cancer causing chemicals as tobacco. Marijuana contains acetone, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, benzene, benzo pyrene, nitrosamines and many other cancer causing pollutants. Based on researchby of G. Huber in Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior. * * * Who is really killing our rain forests? The United Nations reports that in Jamaica growers of marijuana plant their crops on isolated mountain slopes disturbing fragile forest soils.

Houston's Drug-Free Business Director Fears Results of LenientDrug Policy Federally-funded heroin distribution clinics on the corner. Methadone maintenance programs gone awry. Needles and condoms openly distributedto minors. Frustrated police officials with little control. With resultssuch as these raging through the streets of Switzerland, the dangers of a lenient drug-control policy were made abundantly evident last week to Calvina Fay, Executive Director of Houston's Drug-Free Business Initiative. "As I stood and watched young addicts inject themselves with heroinas though this was normal behavior, I realized that no attempt is made to intervene on behalf of the addict and get him or her into treatment,"Fay observed. "The objective of the Swiss law seems to be to assist theaddicts, not get them off the drug." Switzerland's current drug-control policy, while outlawing consumption,is also a futile attempt to reduce the harms associated with use by taking certain drugs off the street and putting them in the control of governmentdistribution clinics. One frequently heard argument against the adoption of a similar law in the United States centers around the concern that such a policy would serveonly to magnify drug usage, rather than eliminate it. And according to Fay,her observations of the situation in Switzerland only support such an argument. "The alarming thing about the state of affairs in Switzerland is thatthis did not occur overnight," Fay said. "This situation emerged overa 10-year period and was slowly created through a process that I see evolving herein the United States." Switzerland's lenient environment, according to Fay, began with inadequate controls to enforce the law. Consumption and trafficking of drugs suchas marijuana, cocaine and heroin are illegal. However, all that enforcementcan do to prevent such crimes is give the offender a ticket; imprisonment comes only after a multitude have been issued. Hence, officials are powerlessto effectively control what Fay sees as a growing problem. The situation was furthered with the development of the government-subsidized programs designed to monitor current drug addicts and limit access to certaindrugs. Such efforts, in addition to free heroin distribution clinics and methadonedistribution centers, include needle exchange programs in the name of AIDS preventionand public shooting galleries, where street addicts are provided with a room, food,condoms, and clean needles. "What they are doing to these addicts is absolutely criminal. The government has given up on them and thrown them away," Fay said. "Ifear that we will see the same situation in our country in just a few years." As expert in workplace drug prevention, Fay returned from Switzerland last week, where she addressed employers about the impact of drug abuse in the workplace. Fay's presentation, requested by Swiss employers concerned about safetyand productivity implications of the lenient drug policy, detailed the findings of a recent research study she directed through HDFBI in collaboration with the University of Houston - Clear Lake. The study, which gathered employers' attitudes about drug control strategies, such as mandatory drug testingand employee assistance programs in the workplace, attempted to measure the impact of such methods on workplace productivity. HDFBI is a non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating alcohol anddrug abuse in the workplace by providing information and assistance to the business community. Founded in 1985 after the Strategic Planning Committee of the Houston Chamber of Commerce asked for business sector involvementin the community's anti-drug activities, the organization is supported by the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Houston Crackdown, Texans' War onDrugs and the U.S. Attorney's office.

Lung cancer causing carcinogen more prevalent in marijuana than in tobacco. A breakthrough report published in the journal Science, October 18, 1996, provides the first true molecular evidence conclusively linking componentsin tobacco smoking to lung cancer. A chemical found in tobacco smoking, benzopyrene, causes genetic damage in lung cells that is identical to the damage observed in the DNA of most malignant tumors of the lungs. Although scientists have been convinced in the past that smoking causeslung cancer, the strong statistical associations did not provide absolute proof. This paper absolutely pinpoints that mutations in lung cancer cells arecaused by benzopyrene. An average marijuana cigarette contains 30 nanograms of this carcinogen, compared to 21 nanograms in an average tobacco cigarette (Marijuanaand Health, National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine report, 1982). This potent carcinogen suppresses a gene that controls growth of cells.When this gene is damaged, the body becomes more susceptible to cancer. This gene, P53, is related to half of all human cancers and as many as 70% of lung cancers. Clearly marijuana smoke contains more of the potent carcinogen benzopyrene than tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the technique of smoking marijuana by inhaling deeply and holding the smoke within the lungs presents a chanceof much greater exposure than a conventional tobacco cigarette. * * * * * * * * * * This material has been reviewed and commented on by William M. Bennett,M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Clinical Pharmacology and Hypertension at Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon. Dr. Bennett, who is listed in "BEST DOCTORS IN AMERICA," states,"The idea of using smoked marijuana containing these carcinogens as medicine, particularly for patients who have suppressed immune systems like those with AIDS, should be unthinkable. Thus, prior to considering marijuana as medicine, one must abide by the old edict, "first do no harm."

Drug treatmentshould be made available, accessible, and accountable to those addictedto alcohol and other drugs. Background: Substance abuse is the number one health problem in America. More deaths,illness, and disabilities derive directly from substance use than from anyother preventable health condition. The financial costs of substance abuse,according to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,approach $400 billion annually. This does not include all the personal lifetragedies incurred by the individuals addicted and the sufferings borneby their families, children, and friends. Almost 30% of all prisoners wereunder the influence of drugs at the time of their offense. Furthermore,in a sample of 23 American cities, 70% of all female arrestees tested positivefor drugs, and 30% to 78% of male arrestees likewise tested positive fordrugs. Rationale: Drug treatment has multiple goals: maintaining a drug-free lifestyle; reducingthe demand for illegal drugs; reducing street crime; changing users' personalvalues; developing educational and vocational capabilities; improving theuser's overall health; reducing fetal exposure to drugs. Different modalities of treatment have been demonstrated to be effectiveto varying degrees in achieving, to some degree, the aforementioned treatmentgoals. Furthermore, significant savings, in terms of court costs and imprisonment,are achieved as a result of participating in drug treatment. Health carecosts are likewise reduced as a function of drug treatment. For every $1.00expended in drug treatment, there is a cost offset of up to $4.00 savedin related health care expenditures. By making treatment more available, making it a priority within the healthcare delivery system, and insisting on it whenever possible, the costs ofcriminal justice and health care systems that are mushrooming out of controlcan be reduced. More importantly, an addicted person can have the opportunityto engage in a life of recovery and make a positive contribution to hisor her community. An appropriate criticism of the current treatment frameworkinvolving criminal addicts is the "revolving door" phenomenon.Criminal addicts often receive treatment as an afterthought, but then cyclethrough the criminal justice system with repeated relapses. A possible alternative to currently available treatment of criminal addictscould include intensively supervised extended treatment, which also involvesan intensive overhaul of the addict's social and personal factors, whileintegrating treatment into the criminal justice system. Thus, criminal addictscould not use treatment as a means to reduce their sentences. Rather, sentenceswould be spent in a treatment environment, and addicts would risk goingto criminal prison or remaining incarcerated if they continue to use drugs. When it is said that treatment works, this doesn't mean that it works ineach and every instance. There are few medical interventions that work allthe time. For some, treatment is a framework for life that will never beacceptable or applicable. For others, treatment is embraced and is a successfulway of life. Relapse occurs in many of those who finish treatment, but mayoften be handled by short relapse focused refreshers. A great emphasis isnow placed on the eventuality of relapse and how to prevent it. Some treatment programs are more effective than others. Treatment is a continuumof processes which on one hand may include only self help measures, andat the other extreme may be extensive long term institutional processes.It is also important to recognize coexistent conditions which reduce thepotential long term effectiveness of treatment. Effective programs mustincorporate the entire family system, relapse prevention, and aftercaresubsequent to the primary treatment program. The effectiveness of treatmentshould be documented by drug testing and outcomes monitoring. The challenge to treatment professionals, then, is to identify those differencesin order to establish more effective and cost efficient treatment for society.Every treatment program should also be able to demonstrate its effectivenessand cost effectiveness to both the public and private payers. Conclusion: Drug use and addiction is a complex human and societal problem. It mustbe addressed from at least a threefold perspective: interdiction, preventionand treatment. None of these interventions is by itself sufficient, butin combination they are effective. They do reduce the amount of drugs thatare available, they do prevent initial use, and they do result in addictsbecoming drug free.

Drug testing is an important tool to reduce health and workplace costsand to monitor criminal offenders. Drug testing enhances safety for workplaces, schools, and transportation. Background: Drug-related health costs, crime, and erosion of worker productivity costsbillions of dollars annually. Drug testing is a useful tool in combatingthese problems. The aim of responsible drug testing is to deter drug useand to rehabilitate those who need help in overcoming drug problems. The1994 American Management Association Workplace Drug Testing Survey statedthere is no doubt that drug testing is an effective method of identifyingdrug users and deterring drug use in the workplace. Rationale: Health care costs have risen dramatically in the last decade. The escalatingepidemic of drug use has contributed to these costs. Drug-free workplaceprograms reduce health care costs. Drug testing is essential to the successof workplace programs and is a useful tool in drug treatment. Drug testinghelps break denial and disrupts addiction. Workers support drug-free workplace programs which include drug testingand provide firm and compassionate education and rehabilitation. Drug testingis effective in deterring drug use, and it has been overwhelmingly supportedby the courts. Studies indicate broad public support for workplace drugtesting. In an employment context, all positive screening tests should beconfirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Voluntary drug testing in schools has proven to be effective as part ofcomprehensive drug prevention programs, which include education, interventionand counseling. Drug testing aids law enforcement by adding new levels of flexibility andaccuracy to the detection and monitoring of drug-using offenders. Treatmentprograms and probation and parole officers use drug testing to therapeuticallyconfront offenders. Drug testing is used to detect and reduce incidents of crime and druggeddriving. The accuracy of on-site drug testing has been well established. It has beenapproved by the American Probation and Parole Association Drug Testing Guidelines. Both laboratory and on-site testing are valuable tools in implementing drugprevention, treatment, and enforcement programs, and in protecting the healthand safety of society.WT01-B04-176IA077-000522-B043-157http://drugwatch.org:80/Documents/DWPDUA.html 207.112.150.94 19970124123447 text/html 17177HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:34:35 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17005Last-modified: Tue, 29 Oct 1996 17:29:59 GMT Drug Watch Position on Drug User Accountability Drug Watch International: Position Statement on Drug User Accountability Drug users, like any other members of society, must be held accountable fortheir actions. Illicit drug use should bring swift and cost effectiveconsequences which will benefit the user and society at large. Every segmentof society must send the message that drug use and drug use behavior will notbe tolerated. Drug user accountability must be a cornerstone of national andinternational drug policy. Background: In Australia and New Zealand : Social Policy Advisors to the Australian andNew Zealand Governments have pushed the Harm Reduction model exclusively. More liberal laws exist in Australia than in New Zealand. However, contrary to news media reports, most Australian states have not decriminalized marijuana. The National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) is very active in both countries. The focus of their thrust seems to be the Universities. In July 1995 the students of Auckland University voted against decriminalisation, which was quite a setback for NORML. The editor of the student magazine, who described the student common room as a drug"supermarket," is now in hiding. His life has been threatened. Both New Zealand and Australia have seen dramatic increases in methadone and morphine maintenance programmes, free needles, condoms, with accent onbehaviour modification, ie: teaching children and adolescents how to usedrugs safely, "The Merseyside Model" and teaching alcoholics how to drinksafely. The good news is that the New Zealand Health Minister issued aproclamation "Cannabis Causes Harm," which contradicts the present liberalphilosophies. In Canada: Illicit drug use began its climb in Canada in the 1960's andreached its peak in the mid 1970's. Initially the response was almostentirely enforcement oriented. However, it was soon recognized thatprevention efforts would have to be increased. The most successful strategyconsisted of three initiatives: enforcement, prevention and treatment. Usingthis formula, a downward trend of drug use among the student population wasenjoyed until approximately 1992/1993, when the trend began to climb. Analysis of this shift revealed the topic of substance abuse had dropped offthe political agenda of all levels of government, and therefore few resourceswere dedicated to it. Presently, in Canada, there exists an organized campaign to re-directresources from strategies designed to eliminate inappropriate drug use to those strategies directed at the symptoms of drug use. These strategies come under the umbrella of "Harm Reduction" which is difficult to criticize given the converse position is to increase harm. A closer look at this concept allows us to realize there are two types of movements utilizing the term "Harm Reduction." The first is a genuine compassion for the addicted person which employs harm reduction strategies as part of a treatment program where the ultimate goal is to rid the person of drug dependency. The second type of "harm reduction" movement supports the liberalization of drug laws and or/legalization of the drugs themselves. This concept accepts a level of and actually promotes drug use. In England: The Government's position is clearly against legalisation and forprevention, education and treatment. Prime Minister John Major recentlywrote, "Drugs are a menace to our society. They can wreck the lives ofindividuals and their families. They are a frequent cause of crime. That is why we have toughened laws against drugs and why we have given the police and Customs the powersand the resources to enforce those laws effectively. Those efforts aredelivering results. Strong enforcement action has gone hand in hand withmeasures to reduce demand. Since 1990, the Home Office Drugs PreventionInitiative has supported over 1,000 projects to help local communities tacklethe drugs problem. Drug education is part of the National Curriculum. Health authorities spend over 25 million pounds a year on treatment andrehabilitation services for drug misusers." Since the mid 1980s, the Government has pursued action to tackle drug misuseon five main fronts: international cooperation enforcement deterrence prevention treatment However, the numbers of young people experimentingwith drugs, notified addicts and drug offenders have increased in recentyears. The Government proposes to introduce a new strategy for the period 1995-98,which, while fully maintaining the emphasis on law enforcement and reducingsupply, recognizes the need for stronger action on reducing the demand forillegal drugs.The new strategy will emphasize three areas: crime, young people, and publichealth. Vigorous law enforcement and a new emphasis on education and prevention willbe the focus. The principal objective of treatment policies will be to assistdrug misusers to achieve and maintain a drug free state. In The Netherlands: In 1973 the Dutch National Board of Drug Preventionformed inresponse to a trend in Dutch governmental circles to trivialize the harm ofCannabis. The policy of tolerance started officially with the amended OpiumLaw in 1976, mitigating the penal consequences of the possession of Cannabisproducts. A policy of increasing tolerance was started. There followed an enormousincrease in the use of cannabis, especially among young people. From 1983 to1992 cannabis use among pupils increased by 250%. Coffee shops, whereCannabis is sold openly, now number some 1500 to 2000. The situation in the Netherlands reveals that, by a tolerated possession ofcannabis for private usage and the absence of judicial prosecution of theirsale, the number of abusers will grow steadily. Though the number ofcoffee shops is still increasing and the population is becoming more and morecritical, the Dutch government keeps telling the world that everybody shouldfollow their beautiful example! The "responsible use" of drugs does notexist. Drugs destroy. And things that destroy must never be made legal. Ifwe allow drugs to be legalized, nothing will stem the progress of evil. In Sweden: Sweden has a restrictive drug policy, but this has not always beenthe case. In the mid-1950s, the number of drug abusers in Sweden wasestimated at 100. A few years into the 1960s, the figure ran into thousands. Police action alone could not stem the tide of drug abuse. And a liberalisation of drug policyfollowed. To limit the harmful effects of drugs to the user and to helpreduce crime, in 1965 drugs were legally prescribed to addicts and treatmentwas offered. However, the addicts supplied their friends with free drugs andcrime increased. The project was curtailed in 1967. In 1965, drug abuse developed into a major social problem, simultaneouslywith a rapid growth of juvenile cannabis abuse. There followed a series ofrestrictive drug policies and laws. During the 1970s drug policy wasintensely debated, and a permissive drug policy was again instituted. In themid-1970s, the advent of heroin among drug abusers resulted in a morerestrictive drug policy. From about 1980 onwards, drug use declinednoticeably among young persons, and continues its decline today. Today, drug prevention measures have high priority within the police, thecustoms service, the public prosecution service, the prison and probationservice, social services, schools and various leisure activities. Experimental use of cannabis and other drugs is very low in Sweden, and formany years drug use among young people has been very limited. Our aim is asociety in which drug abuse remains a socially unaccepted form of behaviour,a society in which drug abuse remains a marginal phenomenon. The essentialprerequisite of a successful drug policy is for people of all ages todissociate themselves from drugs and drug abuse. In Switzerland: Federal Law regulates the medical use of narcotic substancesandprohibits all production, trafficking, possession and consumption of drugsfor non-medical purposes. Opium, heroine, hallucinogens and cannabis areexplicitly banned for all purposes and may only be used for scientificresearch. However, the pro legalization lobby is attempting to circumventthe law through a well organized network and an intensive media strategy. In 1985 needle exchange programs were initiated. In 1989, Needle Park openedin Zurich, allowing addicts free rein in a specified location under officialsurveillance. About 300 syringes were distributed daily. By September 1991the number of syringes distributed in Needle Park had increased to 12,000 to15,000 per day. In 1992, squads of police were sent to close down the park.Dealers and addicts simply moved about a mile away to Letten, a desertedtrain station, where more than 1,000 addicts and dealers gathered daily andstupefied addicts lay slumped on a carpet of blood-spattered syringes, cottonswabs and refuse, while others bought and sold cocktails of drugs. After a string of murders and violence, Zurich closed Letten Station inFebruary 1995. The experiment in "harm reduction" had grown into a grotesquesordid spectacle and public menace that bore no resemblance to the clinical,carefully supervised venture promised by those who led the campaign in itsfavor in 1988. In 1987 a well-structured methadone program was liberalized. There were 300methadone addicts in the Canton of Zurich before 1987, and more than 2,000 in1991, according to police. In 1991, the Federal Government decided to intensify its commitment in thisfield. The Swiss Government pursues a four-pronged strategy to prevent theindividually and socially damaging effects of drug misuse: Criminal prosecution of illicit production, trafficking, possession andconsumption of all legally defined substances. Financially support to cantonal and private projects aimed at prevention. Support to cantonal and private projects for a variety of treatment andreintegration programmes for drug addicts. It has authorized and is supporting scientific studies of medically prescribed narcotics to destitute drug addicts. Support of "harm reduction" measures to enable the immediate survival ofthe drug addicts and also to prevent the spreading of HIV, such as needledistribution. A National People's Referendum for a "Youth Without Drugs," has beensponsored by Jugend ohne Drogen in support of abstinence oriented drug policyin the Federal Constitution. In June, 1995 on the occasion of the UnitedNations Day Against Drug Abuse and Trafficking (June 26th) a Resolution wasaddressed to the Swiss Federal Government by VPM Verein Zur Forderung DerPsychologiscen Menschenkenntnis calling for abstinence oriented andrestrictive drug policy. In the United States : Throughout the 1970's, marijuana was decriminalized in11 states; drug addicts were viewed as victims; and cocaine decriminalizationwas proposed. The largest increase of youth using drugs in the history ofthe U.S. followed this permissive attitude. Crime and drug-related socialproblems threatened the health and well being of all citizens. In the early 1980's the public and law enforcement applied pressure to holddrug users accountable for their illegal drug use and their role infacilitating the illegal drug trade. And drug use was reduced by over 50%. Drug legalization advocates initiated a sophisticated public relationscampaign aimed at weakening thepublic's aversion towards illegal drug use.Drug user lobbyists and organizations and other drug apologists assailed useraccountability measures as infringement of one's "personal right" to usedrugs, exaggerated the cost of user accountability policies, and ignored thebenefit of 12.6 million fewer drug users. In the early 1990s, the drug issue began to lose national focus, and thusmomentum. Once again, anti-drug messages and social attitudes started tosoften, the media and music began to reglamorize drug use, and drug use amongschool children began to climb (teen marijuana use doubling over a three yearspan), after a 12 year decline. Rationale: Drug use is not a victimless crime. Drug users place non-drug-users at riskand causeconsiderable societal harm. Drug users harass and disrupt the public peace,commit crimes under the influence of drugs, cause accidents, and createunhealthy conditions. They destroy families and take rights and freedom fromlaw abiding citizens. Recreational drug users, as well as hard core users, are the foundation ofthe international drug cartel trade and the source of funds for drug kingpinsand terrorists. The drug trade exists solely because drug users keep italive. Drug users who are not yet addicted are perhaps the most culpable fortheir drug use. Holding drug users accountable early in their drug use pattern can preventabuse and addiction problems. For those already addicted, swift and certainnegative consequences for drug use can modify drug use behavior and lead torecovery through treatment or individual initiative. Research clearly indicates that social norms and user accountability laws arekey factors in preventing drug use and decreasing problem behavior. In thejustice system, user accountability need not rely on lengthy prisonincarceration, but on a broad continuum of responses such as communityservice, asset forfeiture, tough mandatory fines, civil liabilities for alldamages, drug abstinence enforced through frequent drug testing of offenderswith immediate, progressive consequences, loss of federal and state benefits,loss of driving and other license privileges, automobile impoundment, andrestitution payments. In the workplace, programs must protect employers and non-drug usingemployees. Workplaces should communicate clear rules and consequences. In thecommunity, schools, and homes clear anti-drug norms and values must be statedand applied. Tough, but fair, user accountability sanctions should beenacted. Drug user accountability should be a cornerstone of drug strategy. Directingpolicies, funding, and energies towards effectively reducing the demand fordrugs is true compassion for the drug user and is in the best interest ofsociety. U.S. EXPERIENCE: Throughout the 1970's, United States drug policy exhibited tolerance for drugusers and focused enforcement on heroin traffickers. Marijuana wasdecriminalized in 11 states; drug addicts were viewed as victims; and cocainedecriminalization was proposed. The largest increase of youth using drugs inthe history of the U.S. and perhaps in the world followed this permissiveattitude by government and society. In 1979, approximately 24 million Americans had tried an illicit drug, andone in ten high school seniors was using marijuana every day of the week.Drug incarceration rates reached an all time low and crime and drug-relatedsocial problems threatened the health and well being of all citizens. In the early 1980's, non-drug users became acutely aware of the negativeimpact that drug use was having on their families and communities. The publicand law enforcement applied pressure to hold drug users accountable for theirillegal drug use and their role in facilitating the illegal drug trade aftera decade of lenient drug policy. Zero tolerance of drug use led to a dramatic shift in attitudes and to majordeclines in drug use. In 1992, a child was half as likely to use illegaldrugs as his or her counterpart from 15 years previous, and adults were evenless likely to use. Social intolerance to drug use resulted in 12.6 millionfewer Americans using drugs. Drug user accountability had been applied by lawenforcement, schools, families, workplaces, and the media. Drug legalization advocates initiated a sophisticated public relationscampaign aimed at weakening the public's aversion towards illegal drug use.Drug user lobbyists and organizations and other drug apologists assailed useraccountability measures as infringement of one's "personal right" to usedrugs, exaggerated the cost of user accountability policies, and ignored thebenefit of 12.6 million fewer drug users. In the early 1990s, the drug issue began to lose national focus, and thusmomentum. Once again, anti-drug messages and social attitudes started tosoften, the media and music began to reglamorize drug use, and drug use amongschool children began to climb (teen marijuana use doubling over a three yearspan), after a 12 year decline.WT01-B04-177IA077-000522-B043-374http://drugwatch.org:80/Documents/DWNEPP.html 207.112.150.94 19970124123616 text/html 6298HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:35:11 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6127Last-modified: Tue, 29 Oct 1996 17:29:52 GMT Drug Watch Position Paper on Needle Handouts to Addicts DRUG WATCH POSITION STATEMENT ON NEEDLE HANDOUTS TO ADDICTS Providing needles to addicts for injection of illegal drugs should cease. No funds should be spent on needle exchange programs unless it can bescientifically proven that such programs are safe and effective. Studiesbased on scientific protocols show no evidence that needle exchangeprograms (NEPs) decrease HIV infection rates, and these studies fail toprove that NEPs do not encourage drug use. The practice actuallyfacilitates and enables illegal drug use, which puts the drug user atcontinual risk of exposure and results in unpredictable behavior, crime,violence, rising medical costs, drug impaired newborns, and other societalproblems. Background: Needle exchange programs began in 1984 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,started by a drug-user advocacy group called the Junkie Union. Subsequentprograms were started in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington and San Francisco,California; and in 1990 in New Haven, Connecticut and New York City.Currently, many illegal programs are operating in the U.S. In Switzerland, liberal drug policies and the drug tolerant atmosphere they created, brought about the open drug scenes, where large numbers of needles were distributed to addicts, and caused a dramatic increase in drug addiction, crime, and violence. Rationale: Needles provided for the injection of illegal drugs encourage and perpetuatedrug use and unsafe sex that spreads AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The most effective approach to address the causal role of drugs with regard to AIDS is to prevent or intervene in the drug using behavior that leads to AIDS. Scientific studies show that drug use impacts the immune system and speeds the growth of the HIV virus which causes AIDS. Reducing drug use would also decrease the incidence of risky sexual behavior while under the influence of drugs, a major factor in the spread of HIV infection, hepatitis and other STDs. Aggressive outreach/education efforts have resulted in decreasedseroconversionrates of HIV/AIDS without providing needles to the population. Treatmentprograms have resulted in markedly reduced rates of HIV/AIDS. The HIVprevalence rate in addicts stabilized in NYC in 1983, well before needleprogramsbegan. The Greater Los Angeles area has a lower prevalence of AIDS-infecteddrug users than any major metropolitan area in the nation due to thenon-existenceof government sanctioned needle exchange programs, coupled with aggressiveprevention efforts and low cost treatment. Funds currently being used forNEPswould be better spent if directed toward expansion and improvement of drugabuse treatment.There is no valid scientific evidence that providing needles has resulted inanyadditional lowering of HIV/AIDS rates, according to the U.S. Center forDiseaseControl report. Furthermore, as shown in a recent Montreal study,seroconversion rates, i.e. the percentage of persons who contract the AIDSvirus,are many times higher in needle exchange participants than in addicts offeredoutreach alone. Current studies of needle exchange programs are flawed and inconclusive. Manyuse insufficient sample size, do not conduct objective tests, do not usevalidcomparisons, and use program staff, rather than independent evaluators, toconduct client interviews. A common failing of these studies is that theyfail tocontrol for the many variables involved. In Switzerland, first a limited number of needles were made available, thenthesupply was increased as the number of addicts increased. Later heroin wasprovided to addicts. The open drug scenes, which have since been closed, became a magnet for foreign addicts. Currently, needles are distributed atmultiple, smaller sites. In the past, narcotic laws were very effective ingettingaddicts to enter treatment, since addicts were given the choice of treatmentorprison. The threat of prison serves as an incentive to stay in treatment andoffdrugs. The problems associated with liberal drug policies, the distribution ofneedles toaddicts, and the resultant rise in addiction, crime, and violence, which haveoccurred in Switzerland, are now being replicated in the United StatesthroughNEPs. Police are instructed not to enforce the anti-drug paraphernalia lawswhenpersons possess a Pilot Needle Exchange Program Card. Persons whopreviously would have been ordered into treatment by the criminal justicesystemare given the means (needles, syringes, "cookers," and the NEP card) tocontinuetheir addiction. Only a small minority (16%) of addicts in NEPs entertreatment. Residents in the neighborhoods where needles are distributed complain thatgiving addicts needles to inject illegal drugs interferes with communitygoals ofclearing drug users and dealers from their neighborhoods. Addicts injectdrugs inbroad daylight, and residents report an increase of crime and violence. Providing needles to inject illegal drugs is in violation of U.S. Federallaw. Federalfunds may not be used for such programs, since they have not been shown todecrease the spread of AIDS without increasing drug use. Anti-drugparaphernalia laws, which are circumvented by NEPs, were passed to decreasedrug use and have proved to be effective. An active pro-drug lobby promotes needle exchange programs and theunscientific "studies" alleging the effectiveness of NEPs in reducingHIV/AIDSrates. The needle exchange issue is a priority for drug-legalization groups,wholobby for permissive drug policies and programs promoting so-called "safer"useof illicit drugs. The most compassionate and humanitarian approach for the addict, the druguser,and society is prevention, intervention and treatment. Needle handouts toaddictsfacilitate and increase drug use, enslaving the user and promotingpromiscuoussexual behavior which spreads AIDS. 1996 Drug Watch International WT01-B04-178IA077-000522-B044-62http://drugwatch.org:80/Documents/ATPOS.html 207.112.150.94 19970124123738 text/html 7626HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:36:56 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 7455Last-modified: Fri, 17 Jan 1997 07:33:41 GMT Alcohol and Tobacco Position Statement Drug Watch International POSITION STATEMENT ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO: TWO DANGEROUS GATEWAY DRUGS The use of alcohol and tobacco has taken a great toll on youth andsociety and is a predictor of future alcohol abuse and addiction, as wellas the use of other drugs. Therefore, Drug Watch International supportsall efforts to prevent use of these drugs by youth and supports effortsto restrict advertising of them to the general public. Background: Alcohol and nicotine are legal drugs for adults in many countries. Eventhough these dangerous and addictive drugs are "socially acceptable"for adults, they are, to one degree or another, controlled substances foryouth throughout the world. Many cultures try to limit their young fromusing alcohol or tobacco. Efforts to prevent the use of alcohol and tobaccoby youth should not be confused with efforts to prohibit adult use of eitherof these drugs. However, it is time adults looked at their own alcohol andtobacco use, if they want to influence young people. In North America and other countries, alcohol is the number one drug usedby teens. It's use is also the number one contributing factor in youthfuldeaths. In the U.S., the use of alcohol is associated with at least one-halfof all car crashes, suicides, drownings, crimes of violence, unplanned sex,poor school performance, and other trauma among youth. Alcohol and tobacco kill more people annually than all other drugs combined.Alcohol alone is associated with at least one-fourth of all hospital visitsin the United States. Nicotine is one of the most addictive and harmfulof all drugs. There is a false perception that if a drug is legal it must cause less problems.In many countries and cultures, the use of alcohol and/or tobacco is sodeeply woven into the cultural fabric of those countries that neither isacknowledged as a drug or even as a problem. Rationale: In July 1995, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded forthe first time that nicotine is a drug and that it should be regulated asa controlled substance. Regulations were proposed restricting access totobacco products and restricting attempts to make these products appealingto children and adolescents. Indeed, if alcohol and tobacco were new productsseeking FDA clearance today, each would likely be rejected as hazardousand addictive. A recent study by Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Subst,anceAbuse, states that the earlier children use the gateway drugs tobacco oralcohol or marijuana, the more likely they are to move on to other drugs.Youth who drank alcohol were 50 times more likely to use cocaine, and thosewho smoked tobacco cigarettes were 19 times as likely to use cocaine. Nearly90% of cocaine users had smoked tobacco or drank alcohol or used marijuanafirst. The study, based on 30,000 American households, established a clearprogression that began with use of the gateway drugs of alcohol, tobaccoor marijuana and led to use of other drugs. Dr. John Slade reported at the 1989 National Conference on Nicotine Dependencein San Diego, California, that tobacco smoking teaches drug acquisitionskills to the youth. He said, "For the most part, they're illegal forkids to buy. In addition, kids who smoke get firsthand experience in usinga substance to adjust emotional states." Slade reports that tobaccouse teaches drug-taking skills and that tobacco use promotes an attitudethat fosters other drug taking behaviors. Compounding the problem is the relative ease with which youth can accessalcohol and tobacco. Both drugs are widely available, inexpensive and heavilymarketed, making them especially attractive to youth, who are the most price-sensitiveconsumer age group. The right of adults to consume either of these drugs is a notion heavilypromoted by the alcohol and tobacco industries. This argument is meaninglessfor many young people who have reached the legal age for use with no realchoice left, because they are already addicted. They have been seduced intouse of both drugs by slick marketing targeted at youth long before theyhave had their first drink or used tobacco for the first time. Youth are bombarded daily with alluring advertising and marketing techniques.Because new alcohol or tobacco users are rarely adults, images which implysexual prowess, athletic ability, popularity, freedom and escape from problemsare especially appealing to young people. Children grow up thinking thatthey cannot have a good time without alcohol or tobacco. They don't realizethat many adults choose not to drink. Alcohol can kill or cause serious problems any time a young person usesit. Yet, some youth are convinced that drinking alcohol or using tobaccodoes not cause immediate problems in their lives, and most are certain thatthey could quit at any time. The average teen smoker had his/her first wholecigarette by 13 and became a daily smoker by age 14.5. Drug Watch International recognizes and supports the various efforts ofmany concerned drug preventionists who are attempting to prevent the useof alcohol and tobacco by youth. Many Drug Watch members are local and nationalleaders in this aspect of prevention. We must never retreat in our effortsto prevent drug use by youth. Drug Watch International supports the many promising practices and strategiesaimed at preventing youthful alcohol and tobacco use, including: changingsocial acceptance of use by youth, increasing law enforcement efforts forthose who provide or procure these drugs for youth, increasing excise taxes,Eating more meaningful and effective consequences for those who providealcohol or tobacco to adolescents, increasing prevention programs, restrictingadvertising and marketing, and supporting legislation and public policythat limits the lobbying practices of the alcohol and tobacco industries.

Ernst Aeschbach, M.D. For the past eight to ten years, the Citizens of the German speakingsector of Switzerland have been witnessing a highly questionable changeof drug policy: open drug scenes, toleration of rising crime rates, andpursuit of "survival aid measures," sometimes known as "harmreduction." These "measures" facilitate addictive behaviorinstead of behavior which favors the abandonment of drug use and positiveperspectives on life. Though the failure of Swiss drug policy seems obvious, nevertheless, modelsare still being proposed which more or less advocate the free availabilityof all drugs. One of these models calls for the distribution of heroin.The common denominator of all these models is the theory that drugs themselvesare not dangerous, but rather the way they are used. Two prerequisites are necessary for the political endorsement of these models.First, the media must disseminate the mistaken notion that drugs themselvesare not dangerous, but only the way they are used. And second, the "heroinexperiment" must be presented as a "scientific study." There is no scientific interest or reason for this heroin experiment. Thehazards of heroin use have long been proven. Indeed, for the heroin experiment,the term "scientific study" is being used as a subterfuge. Thisis the only way available for proponents to introduce the broad distributionof heroin in Switzerland. Federal Council of Switzerland 1992: Drug Abstinence as Primary Goal inMay of 1992, the Federal Council of Switzerland voted, under massive politicalpressure, to allow a temporary experiment to distribute heroin to addicts.It should be noted that the conduct of the experiment contradicted the prevailingnarcotics law. In its implementing decree of October 21, 1992, the Federal Council of Switzerlandstipulated that scientific research must accompany drug prevention measures,so that improvements in the health and living conditions of drug addicts,as well as their integration into society, may be analyzed. Drug abstinencewas still the primary goal of the prevention and welfare measures. Thisdecree forms the legal and substantive basis of the General ExperimentationPlan, published by the Federal Office of Public Health. The ExperimentationPlan delineates the binding guidelines for the establishment and implementationof the heroin experiment. It also explicitly states that drug abstinenceis the primary goal, thereby setting forth the primary criteria for evaluatingthe results. The first project applications for the experiment were submittedby several cities and organizations and approved by the Federal Office ofPublic Health in the Fall, 1993. The first experiment began in early December1993, in Zurich. One of the major components of the project was the trialprescription of heroin. This is an essential factor for determining scientificallythe possible basis for permanent distribution of heroin in the future. Sincethe distribution of heroin to addicts represents a fundamental deviationfrom hitherto proven principles of treatment, it is imperative that a criticalanalysis of this experiment be undertaken. Scientific Objectivity: Scientific research demands objective behavior in the formulation of experimentationconcepts, as well as in practical procedure. Pre judgment on the part ofthose responsible could lead to biased results and may later cause erroneouspolitical decisions. When massive political pressure exists, as is the casewith this heroin experiment, then at least those who evaluate the individualprojects should be neutral. However, in this particular case, the evaluators'neutrality is highly questionable. As early as 1991, the director of the current heroin project ZokL2, A. Seidenberg,stated the following: "A medicalization of the drug problem, as seenin this experiment, does not represent a definitive solution to the drugproblem. Instead, it represents a partial step towards normalization....Evenbefore a broad distribution has been implemented, it is possible to enterinto a discussion concerning additional market-deregulating measures."1 Continuous opposition to the Experimentation Plan has stated: * The Experimentation Plan is based on drug-policy, not scientific reasoning. * There is a call for broad distribution of opiates to drug addicts. * There are exceptionally premature "success reports" by projectmanagers and evaluators. Making unequivocal drug policy claims, and then trying to substantiate themscientifically, can lead to only seeing what advocates want to see. Internationallyaccepted scientific standards appear to have been violated. Flaws in the Federal Office of Public Health's General ExperimentationPlan: The design of the General Experimentation Plan contains methodological flawsand critical errors, some of which are presented below: 1. A major omission is the lack of a control group of drug addicts, to whomnarcotics are not prescribed, but who nonetheless receive the same welfaremeasures. Having a control group would have allowed an analysis of the results,to determine whether the results are due to heroin prescription or welfaremeasures. Without such a control group, positive results can be due to thequality of counseling and supervision given, and can occur without regardto the prescription of heroin. The use of control groups is a scientificstandard which all serious researchers include in order to insure recognitionof their work. 2. A major limitation is the unreliability of data collected. Details ofphysical and mental health, as well as social circumstances, were primarilytaken from interviews. This procedure is not in itself invalid, yet a scientistmust assure the reliability of collected data by hard facts and field surveys.Without such reliable data, conclusions can only be speculative. In thiscase, such supporting information has not been verified. In addition, thecollected data are not corroborated by reports from third parties, suchas relatives, employers, police, etc. Moreover, easily subjective data havenot been collected systematically. For example: although physical examinationswere given when participants entered the project, a preliminary report ofNovember 1995, shows that apparently not even systematic laboratory testswere given to determine such important parameters as HIV-status and hepatitisinfections. 3. A major contradiction is that quantitative conclusions cannot be drawnfrom the ambiguous formulation of many questions. For example: accordingto the General Experimentation Plan, risk behavior with regard to HIV mustbe examined. However, the criteria for measuring risk behavior remains completelyunclear. Since the participants were not required to take routine HIV-tests,no conclusion can be drawn with respect to the frequency of initial HIVinfections, not to mention those which may have occurred during the timeof participation in the experiment. 4. A major concern is that the majority continued actively in the drug sceneand consumed additional narcotic substances during the experiment. Sinceno records were kept of the drug types and amount consumed, no conclusionscan be deemed valid about the relationship between health and consumptionbehavior or changes in social circumstances during the experiment. Thisproblem could have been avoided by prohibiting participants from takingdrugs outside of the experiment and introducing controls such as obligatoryrandom drug tests. Here the Experimentation Plan once again failed to maximizethe reliability of the data required for objective evaluation. 5. Some critics, since the beginning of the heroin experiment, have raisedthe following questions: * Could the experiment have various negative effects on the drug scene? * Could a general increase in drug consumption lead to increased drug-induceddelinquency? * Could HIV infection spread further? According to the General Experimentation Plan, precisely these questionswill not be examined in the evaluation. In addition, cooperation by thepolice has been categorically rejected, and this insures that the impactof the experiment on public safety will not be appropriately verified. Dubious Changes in the Experimentation Plan: In its decree of October 21, 1992 the Federal Council of Switzerland designatedabstinence as the primary goal of the experiment. Moreover, it limited drugprescription to the end of 1996, except for the oral intake of methadone.It authorized only 5 projects with a maximum of 50 participants each, thussetting a ceiling of 250, so that the "scientific experiment with humanbeings not exceed certain bounds." These limitations have been attacked by various advocates of the experiment.These advocates essentially called for: (1) an increase in the number ofparticipants; (2) authorization of prescriptions for other drugs, for example,cocaine (U. Locher, Neue Zrcher Zeitung (NZZ), August 16, 1995); and, (3)less controlled distribution conditions, i.e., such as the ability to takedrugs home (M. Stocker, NZZ, August 16, 1995). These criticisms should beconstrued as an indication that the advocates themselves do not considerthe projects to be scientific research, but rather the means to implementdrug policy measures. Unfortunately, the Federal Council of Switzerlandsuccumbed to pressure from the experiment's advocates, and in October 1994,one year after it began, the Council voted to allow the first change inthe General Experimentation Plan. The number of participants eligible forheroin prescription was raised from 250 to 500, with those for morphinereduced from 250 to100 and methadone reduced from 200 to 100. The reasongiven was that heroin, in contrast to morphine and methadone, was more readilyaccepted by heroin addicts. Another rationale for changing the ratio of heroin, morphine and methadonesubjects was that initially fewer side effects and incidents were reportedwith heroin. By greatly increasing the number of heroin subjects and reducingthe number of other participants, the results of the study could be artificiallyaltered. This example shows very clearly that the experiment is not basedon scientific criteria. Instead, it was designed to accommodate the preferencesof heroin addicts. It is of considerable interest to note that no important successes havebeen recorded with regard to the experiments' official primary goal, drugabstinence -- the one factor which might have justified any eventual changesin the Experimentation Plan. It seems that the real reason for the changewas based on the preference of heroin addicts to take heroin. The second change in the General Experimentation Plan was made in May 1995.This time, the number of participants was increased to 800. With this change,the following three additional research areas were added to the study. Thecontribution of each one to the scientific validity of the experiment isquestionable: (1) Drug distribution to mentally ill addicts . . . This proposal was made even though clinical evidence demonstrates that providingdrugs to such patients is particularly dangerous to their health. (2) Drug distribution in prison . . . This proposal contradicts policy designed to motivate prisoners to acceptlong term therapy toward abstinence after physical withdrawal has been completed. (3) Heroin distribution to patients in already existing ambulatory methadoneprograms and other therapy centers . . . This proposal undermines theessence of the methadone programs and mixes heroin and methadone recipientsin the same facilities. This is inconsistent with the objective of helpingmethadone patients stay away from the drug scene and encouraging them toparticipate in abstinence oriented therapy. Once heroin programs are combinedwith methadone programs, those receiving methadone face a greater dangerof becoming de-motivated in overcoming their drug addiction. Preliminary Results Justify Abandoning the Experiment: Within the scientific community, it is customary to publish results in scientificjournals and thus make them available for verification and discussion. Non-compliancewith this discipline violates important scientific procedures. Announcingresults for the first time at a press conference is a most unusual procedureamong researchers. But this is precisely what the Federal Office of PublicHealth and the experiment's directors did in November 1995, when they presentedthe first results at the press conference and deemed them predominantlypositive. The feasibility of the experiment and the accessibility of participantswithin target groups were emphasized. Considering drug addicts' desire forheroin and the very low demands made on them in the experiment, this isnot surprising. The preliminary report indicates that the General Experimentation Plan'sdesignated goal of abstinence2 has been replaced by a new goal "...totest new approaches in the treatment of drug addicts." This means thatthe experiment violates the letter and intent of the original 1992 decreeof the Federal Council of Switzerland. Analysis of the individual results presented by the Federal Office ofPublic Health and the directors of the experiment indicates the followingspecific failures of the experiment: 1. Improvements in health did not occur within 6 months of the entranceof a participant in the experiment. Physical symptoms such as insomnia,loss of appetite, tiredness and loss of energy (a decrease from 47% to 46%!),nocturnal sweating, dry throat, etc., improved only by a small percentageduring the first 6 months -- not enough to meet minimum objectives anticipatedfor improvement of the participants' health. Indeed, the biggest improvementreported reflects only a better "injection technique", which astonishinglyhas been included in the list of physical symptoms. Based on the data provided, improvements in physical health are more probablythe result of care given than narcotics prescribed. In addition, no comparisonwas made of the results among the various groups receiving different narcotics.Hence, it is completely inconceivable that researchers could arrive at anoptimistic conclusion based on such incomplete data. 2. The amount of narcotics consumed stabilized after about a month. A significantreduction in dosage and frequency of consumption was therefore not achieved. 3. Improvements in living and working conditions of the participants, aswell as their social environment, are to be welcomed. However, it is morelikely that these results are due to psycho-social welfare measures ratherthan to the supply of heroin. The inclusion of control groups would mostprobably have substantiated this conclusion. 4. The research directors gave great importance to the high retention rateamong the participants -- 73% until June 1995, with 82% participating forat least 6 months. Such continuing participation in the program, with continuousaccess to heroin, must be deemed a failure in light of the goal of abstinenceset for the project. There is little or no information provided about how far the experimenthas been able to attain the goal of abstinence, or the extent to which acontrolled narcotics prescription program can help drug addicts quit thevicious circle of addiction (NZZ, November 24, 1995). 5. The high retention rate in the experiment in comparison to in-patienttherapy centers was especially emphasized by A. Uchtenhagen, but this comparisonis invalid and implies erroneous conclusions. A high retention rate in heroindistribution programs is, on the contrary, not an accomplishment if drugabstinence is the ultimate goal. 6. The reported decrease in illegal activities from 53% to 13% is basedon information provided exclusively by the addicts who participated in theheroin experiment. Therefore, it cannot be considered as objective proofof the impact of the heroin project on criminal behavior, as alleged byA. Seidenberg (NZZ, No. 228). This data has no value. Conclusions on delinquent behavior can only be based on verified policerecords. In the semi-annual report of the Federal Police Bureau of Switzerland,the central narcotics task force noted that "validated scientific findingsare lacking, and the only limited information available is based on certainanecdotal observations of the drug scene...." This has occurred primarilybecause the police have not been included in the heroin projects. Zurich'scantonal police force has also expressed its concern that the evaluationof the experiment will turn out to be biased. Consequences of Heroin Distribution: The real objective of the Swiss heroin experiment is to introduce a definitiveprogram to distribute heroin to addicts as soon as possible. The plannedrevision of the narcotics law and the introduction of a new pharmaceuticallaw will provide the necessary legal framework for achieving this objective.However, the political, social and therapeutic consequences associated witha departure from proven and accepted principles of drug therapy have beenignored to date. In this connection the following considerations warrant careful attention. * The implications of such a major change in Switzerland's drug policy hasnot been appreciated beyond its borders. * Nothing similar is being undertaken anywhere else in the world. * Even in the United Kingdom, heroin distribution has had universally negativeresults, reflected by an increase in the number of drug addicts, an increasein the death rate, and extensive health problems. Any program distributing narcotics is full of perils. A. Uchtenhagen, directorof the Swiss evaluation team acknowledged this when he stated, "Thedistribution of narcotics to addicts is being undertaken with great cautionand restraint throughout the world. In certain cases temporary and verystructured methadone programs have been provided as a bridge toward abstinence-orientedtreatment." (A. Uchtenhagen, Zrichsee-Zeitung, March 30, 1995). Caution in the distribution of narcotics is based on experience. On a societallevel and by the addicts themselves, such measures are perceived as actsof resignation. Trust in established abstinence-oriented treatments decreases.The danger involved in changing this mind set of an addict is frequentlynot recognized. Often addicts will more willingly fulfill the conditionsneeded to receive heroin in a distribution program than decide on a treatmentprocess which is considered to be arduous. Thus, motivation to enter therapyis easily destroyed, and with it the hope for a life without drugs. Thenegative consequences of drug use have represented the most important reasonfor an addict to give up drugs. Easy access to drugs and belittling theconsequences of drug use, instead of abstinence-oriented treatment, arecounterproductive measures that facilitate drug use and encourage distributionprojects. One of the reasons for launching the Swiss referendum "Youth WithoutDrugs" in December 1992, was the initiators' concern that the Swissheroin experiment could be misused to promote the liberalization/legalizationof drugs. If the referendum is enacted, heroin projects would be forbidden.At the same time, appropriate and necessary measures would be implementedto aid drug addicts. It is crucial that a broad and knowledgeable discussion be held on the scientificvalue of the heroin experiment. For this purpose, the World Health Organization's(WHO) current evaluation of the experiment is too limited. Scientists anddoctors beyond Switzerland should be invited to join in a critical professionalassessment of this experiment. 1 The translations which appear in this article have been prepared bythe author. 2 The original statement in the General Experimentation Plan, BAG, November1, 1993: "The experiments involving the medical prescription of narcoticsto drug addicts are defined as scientific experiments aimed at investigatingthe success of the therapy delineated here as a step towards drug abstinence."

The resultsof the recent bust of the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco clearlyrevealed how junkies and their allied so-called 'scientists' are tryingto promote the idea of "medicinal marijuana" to promote marijuana.Without any scientific proof whatsoever these harm productive groups claimthe beneficial results from using marijuana. Without referring to any ofthe results of thousands of scientific reports on the damaging effects ofmarijuana, even newspapers have bought the arguments. In a 'USA Today' recentdebate article, the headline of 'Our View' reads 'Anti-drug focus keepsmarijuana from the ill'. Among some of the 'arguments' in the article wefind "Marijuana is one of the least toxical compunds in the world.It poses far fewer pulmonary risks than tobacco and is less addictive thanalcohol. It is even less deadly than aspirin which causes at least 1,000deaths a year." The arguments are so bad and show such a lack of knowledge,one might think the author of the piece was advised by Philip Morris, thetobacco company which recently, in a European advertising campaign, claimedit was more dangerous to eat biscuits than being exposed to second-handsmoking. Is this science? - NO. It is sheer campaigning. The advocates of Medicinalmarijuana" are campaigning for it as if it was just a matter of launchinga new product - like Pepsi - the choice of a new generation" - Marijuana- the choice of a terminally ill generation". The tragedy is that theadvocates take advantage of ill people to support their claims for "medicinalmarijuana", which obviously makes the whole issue somewhat difficultfor some people as being against medication for ill people might seem abit odd. In that respect the strategy of the junkies and their allied so-called'scientists' is superficially clever. Very much in the same way as thosepromoting so-called harm reduction have managed to shut up some of theircritics by asking "Are you against harm reduction?" It is mostadvisable to reject so-called 'harm reduction' when it includes legalizationof marijuana, legal distribution of opiates, injection rooms, low thresholdmethadone programmes etc. In the same way it is most advisable to rejectmanjuana as the choice of a terminally ill generation. The following fact sheet information about the Cannabis Buyers' Club inSan Fransisco ought to make it very clear that what is going on there hasnothing to do with "medicinal use" based on science. CANNABIS BUYERS' CLUB FACT SHEET While claiming to be for the benefit of people who are terminally ill, theCannabis Buyers' Club was in fact a major drug distribution center for thecity of San Fransisco. The Club regularly sold marijuana to children, allowedchildren and even infants to breathe second-hand marijuana smoke in its'smoking areas', often sold marijuana without a doctors note or acceptedobviously forged doctor s notes for marijuana sales, and large multi-poundmarijuana deals with undercover agents without asking any medical reasonfor the usage. At the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco, officials seized * More than 150 pounds of marijuana valued from $750,000 to over $1 million * More than $60,000 in cash * More than 400 growing marijuana plants * Undercover surveillance films show dozens of infants and small children(many under the age of 10) inhaling large amounts of marijuana smoke inthe Club. Undercover videos also show the Club selling marijuana to teenagersand persons who have not provided any medical excuse. * The Cannabis Buyers' Club claims to serve more than 10,000 members. Themembers are purportedly only able to purchase marijuana for Personal use.'The Club's own rules state remembers cannot buy more than is required forpersonal use - "usually not more than 1/4 ounce". All of the membersare supposed to have a letter from their doctor claiming they suffer fromone or more specific illnesses such as: HIV Cancer Multiple sclerosis Glaucoma Intractable pain * Undercover agents made a number of buys inside the Cannabis Buyers' Cluband were able to purchase as much as two pounds at a time. In one videotapedcase, the sale was made to an agent who clearly was not sick and who wasnever asked by the Club's President for any kind of medical excuse. Undercoveragents alse seized several deliveries of marijuana headed for the Club. * Drug seizures from street delaers in other areas of San Fransisco haveincluded a number of baggies with marijuana apparently being re-sold fromthe Cannabis Buyers' Club. Some street dealers would even state to theircustomers the marijuana must be good since it has the Cannabis Buyers' Clubsticker on the bag. * Some of the "doctors' notes" used by undercover agents gavephony doctors' names and addresses which the Cannabis Buyers' Club neververified. Other notes were even written on scrap paper, without any typeof letterhead. Undercover agents from several law enforcement agencies wereable to purchase marijuana for such"medical uses" as: vaginal yeast infections sore backs insomnia "low back syndrome" colitis sciatica * The Cannabis Buyers' Club is estimated to have sold up to a hundred poundsof marijuana a week, based on former employee interviews and undercoversurveillance. * The estimated street value of one pound of marijuana is from $3,900 toover $10,000 depending upon the grade. * Health and Safety Code Section 11359 dearly states that "Every personwho possesses for sale any marijuana, except otherwise provided by law,shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison." It is important to infomm the general public about the pro-legalizers~ attemptto legalize the sale of marijuana to critically ill people, as that initiative,called Proposition 215 or the 'Medical Marijuana Initiative' is on California'snovember ballot. Hassela Nordic Network would like to know since when the practice of approvinga substance for Medicinal use" was transferred to a referendum whichcould be the consequence if the Medicinal use" of marijuana is approvedin California's November ballot. Before any other drug can be put on themarket, it must undergo rigorous development and testing to prove that itis effective and safe, a procedure under the responsibility of the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA). Usually laboratories of phammaceutical companiessynthesize new chemicals thought to be effective. The drugs are then screenedusing nonhumans to detemmine whether they are toxic and then whether theyhave effects similar to known therapeutically useful drugs. When, and if,the new drug appears to be safe, it goes to phase 1 of human testing, whichshould assess the toxicity and side effects of the drug on healthy humanvolunteers. Phase 2 involves testing on patients under very carefully supervisedconditions. If these two phases show that the drug has minimal toxic effectsAND a therapeutic effect, it goes to phase 3 with expanded clinical trials.If phase 3 turns out to be successful the drug is licensed and marketed. The process does not stop here though. In phase 4 data are accumulated onthe success, or lack of success, of the drug as used in the clinic and attemptsto identify adverse effects not apparent in the short-term testing in earlierphases. The above procedure has not been applied.to the distribution ofmarijuana at the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco. The CalifornianClub is just another version of the Dutch coffee shop topped with bogus-scientificauspices. We are pleased to note that action has been taken against thishamm productive establishment.

Truth: Oncologists overwhelmingly reject the idea of prescribingsmoked marijuana. Crude marijuana contains over 400 different chemicalsTHC, the main active ingredient in crude marijuana, is available as theprescription drug Marinol, for the treatment of nausea associated with medicationsare available and preferred by oncologists. Lie: Marijuana is a beneficial treatment for glaucoma. Truth: There is no scientific evidence that marijuana preventsthe progression of visual loss in glaucoma. While marijuana, as well asalcohol and a host of other substances, can lower intraocular eye pressure,the medication must be carefully tailored to the individual to prevent furthereye damage. Besides numerous adverse side effects of smoking marijuana,the dose cannot be controlled. Lie: Crude marijuana is effective in treating the wastingsyndrome associated with AIDS. Truth: Smoking marijuana compromises the immune systemand puts AIDS patients at significant risk for infections and respiratoryproblems. Current scientific studies show that Marinol (oral THC), whichis available to treat AIDS wasting syndrome, is effective in increasingappetite but is ineffective in increasing weight gain. Lie: The government is withholding important medicinefrom suffering patients by not allowing the prescribing of marijuana. Truth: Crude marijuana does not meet the scientific requirementsfor efficacy, quality, purity and safety necessary to be considered medicine.It is neither compassionate nor medically responsible to prescribe harmfulimpure substances to ill people. Lie: Smoking marijuana reduces the spasticity associatedwith multiple sclerosis. Truth: In a recent double-blind scientific study, the latesthi- tech electronic monitoring equipment was used to determine if smokedmarijuana had any benefit in treating spasticity in patients with MS. Thestudy found that all patients receiving marijuana rather than placebo perceivedtheir spasticity to be lessened, when in actuality, it was made worse. Lie: Many doctors want crude marijuana available sothey can prescribe it to their patients. Truth: Most doctors want the best medicine possible fortheir patients. Although synthetic marijuana (THC) in a pure and standardizedform is available by prescription, it is often the last choice of doctors,because many better medicines are available. The American Medical Association,the Federal Drug Administration, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society,the American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, andthe American Cancer Society have all rejected the use of smoked marijuanaas a medicine. Marijuana is not recognized as a medicine in generally acceptedpharmacopeia, medical references or textbooks. BY ANY MODERN MEDICAL STANDARD, MARIJUANA IS NO MEDICINE. Drug Watch International Position Statement on Medical MarijuanaUse. Leaf marijuana is not medicine. It is a harmful psychoactive drug, composedof over 400 different chemicals, which should not be used by anyone, especiallyby people who are ill. BACKGROUND: In the last several years, the public has seen the issue of the therapeuticapplications of leaf marijuana reach the level of discussions of publicpolicy. This movement has been fueled by the forces seeking to legalizemarijuana. By having marijuana listed as medicine, they hope to "legitimize"marijuana use. RATIONALE: Smoked marijuana is neither an acceptable medical treatment nor an alternativemedical treatment for any illness. Marijuana use has serious health consequences. Concentration, motor coordination,memory, lungs, reproductive and immune systems are all adversely impactedby marijuana use; marijuana is addictive. Physicians who treat people for cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and other diseasesdo not favor the use of marijuana. Not one American health organization accepts marijuana as medicine. Theseinclude the American Medical Association, National Multiple Sclerosis Society,American Glaucoma Society, American Academy of Ophthalmology and AmericanCancer Society. FDA/DEA have repeatedly rejected marijuana for medicinal use Marijuana failsto meet any of the Drug Enforcement Administration's requirements or FederalDrug Administration's eight criteria for approving drugs for medical use. Even Marinol, a synthetic form of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), availableby prescription for treating nausea, has far more negative health effectsthan other available agents. There are numerous safer and more effective anti-nausea agents These includeprochlorperazine (Compazine), metaclopramide (Reglan), lorazepam, corticosteroids,thiethylperazine (Torecan), ondansetron (Zofran), promethazine (Phenergan),perphenazine (Trilafon), and chlorpromazine (Thorazine). The pro-drug lobby exploits the suffering of patients with chronic illnesswith false promises about marijuana as a medicine. They have stated thatthey are pushing marijuana as medicine and using it as a "red herring"as part of a strategy to legalize marijuana for general use. © 1995 Drug Watch International WT01-B04-182IA039-000740-B041-161http://screamer.ccla.lib.fl.us:80/index.htm 198.78.22.165 19970210073527 text/html 936HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Process Software Corporation Purveyor (TM) Server / 1.0Allow: GET HEAD POSTMIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlDate: Friday, 3-Feb-95 15:42:40 GMTLast-modified: Tuesday, 5-Mar-96 22:7:21 GMTContent-length: 682 Resources for VE Teachers [Next section] [Table of Contents] [Resources for VE Teachers] Search for Words in the Varying Exceptionalities Manual You can use AND, OR, and NOT between words to find information in the VE Manual.

Over the past 20 years, theuse of the varying exceptionalities delivery model has increased. Various taskforces have been formed to examine the issues and concerns and to recommendpractices and policies to ensure appropriate uses of the model. In 1991, representatives from the Florida Teaching Profession/NationalEducation Association (FTP/NEA) urged the Department of Education to review thecurrent policies and practices. Surveys and interviews were used to gatherinput from VE teachers from 17 school districts over two years. This manual, Resources for VE Teachers, was developed at therecommendations of the advisory group formed in response to the FTP/NEAinquiry. It is intended to provide information about the use of the VE modelin Florida and to share classroom practices that teachers have found to besuccessful. In Fall, 1992, VE teachers were asked to submit ideas forinclusion in this manual. The members of the writing team that met in Spring,1993. provided valuable input and insight into the contents of this manual andtheir special contributions are gratefully acknowledged. Debbie Houston,Program Specialist in the Bureau for Education of Exceptional Students, and hersecretary, Myra Orange, also deserve recognition for their facilitation of thisentire effort.

State Board of Education Rule Certification Requirements for Teachers The use of the varying exceptionalities class as a delivery model forexceptional student education has a long history in the State of Florida.Currently, teachers of this class comprise the largest group of teachers inexceptional student education classes in this state. The model providesflexibility that enables districts to ignore categorical lines when servingexceptional students who have similar needs. Definition Varying Exceptionalities (VE) Classes: The setting that provides for the assignment of students of more than one exceptionality to one teacher per instructional class period, or more than one exceptionality to one teacher during the school week. Categories of Exceptionalities: For purposes of defining a varying exceptionalities class, the following categories of exceptionalities may becombined: Specific Learning Disabilities Mentally Handicapped (Educable Mentally Handicapped; Trainable Mentally Handicapped; and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped) Emotionally Handicapped (Emotionally Handicapped and Severely Emotionally Disturbed) Physically Impaired Speech and Language Impaired Visually Impaired Hearing Impaired Gifted Profound (including Autistic; Deaf-Blind; Profoundly Mentally Handicapped;and Severely Emotionally Disturbed) Please note that each school district determines which exceptionalities may beserved in a varying exceptionalities class. The list above indicates thatcertain categories of exceptional students may be grouped in classes that arenot considered to be varying exceptionalities classes. For example, ifemotionally handicapped and severely emotionally disturbed students are in thesame class, this class is not designated as varying exceptionalities. [General Information] [Table of Contents] History of the Varying Exceptionalities Model 1947 Rule established. "Where it is not practical nor feasible because of toofew pupils to assign special teachers for each type of exceptional child, combination units will be approved." (Concept deleted a short time later.) 1962 Rule revised. "Varying exceptionalities -- For the employment of a teacher to serve children with varying exceptionalities as defined in these regulations in rural and sparsely populated areas, one unit may be allowed." (Rule repealed in 1974 with the adoption of the Florida Education Finance Program.) 1970s Use of VE model increases somewhat as a result of school-basedmanagement, implementation of PL 94-142 and the concept of least restrictiveenvironment, and the high cost of transportation. 1980-81 Task Force on Varying Exceptionalities. Responding to arequest of the internal auditors, the task force met and made recommendationsregarding definition, class composition, and teacher competencies to beincorporated into State Board of Education Rules. 1980s VE use doubles with increased populations and changes in secondaryrequirements. 1985-86 Subcommittee on Varying Exceptionalities (State AdvisoryCommittee). Site visits were made to 12 districts, and VE teachers weresurveyed to identify issues related to the use of the VE model.Recommendations were made regarding the composition and organization of theclass, placement decisions, class size, support services, and teachercompetencies. 1986-87 Task Force on the Education of Exceptional Students (VaryingExceptionalities). As a result of issues raised by teacher organizationsand the Florida Association for Children with Learning Disabilities (FACLD), alegislative task force was convened. Recommendations were made regardingcertification requirements; VE class size, composition, and staffing patterns;parent involvement; and general policies. In addition, nine best practiceswere identified to assist districts. 1990s VE use increases. Prekindergarten programs increase and show preferencefor a VE model. 1991-93 Varying Exceptionalities Advisory Committee. At the urging ofthe Florida Teaching Profession/National Education Association (FTP/NEA), theBureau of Education for Exceptional Students funded a study to look at the useof the VE model in 17 districts and established an advisory committee. Theresults of the study were widely disseminated and a resource manual for VEteachers was developed. [General Information] [Table of Contents] Why Use the Varying Exceptionalities Model?Enables ESE students to be served in their home schools. Serving ESE students in the least restrictive environment requires thatconsideration be given to providing the services in the school that the childwould normally attend. Allows ESE students to be grouped by program or curricular needs. A VE model facilitates the grouping of students according to theirprogram or curriculum needs. For example, in some districts, a VE model isused to provide programs for students on Special Pupil Progression Plans. Inother districts, a VE model is used for the students in resource classes whoare served in ESE on a part-time basis. When a school has more than one ESE teacher, the use of a VE model allows thechildren to be grouped by age as well as curriculum needs. Thus, an elementaryschool may be able to staff both primary and intermediate units. A VE modelmay also be used where the majority of students are the same exceptionality andonly a few children have a different classification. Many school districtsdetermine the number of teaching units allocated to a school based on thenumber of ESE students and the FTE generated by them, and allow the teachers atthe school to determine how the students will be grouped in classes. Provides flexibility in providing services for small populations of ESE students. In addition to the options described above, a VE model provides for ESEstudents in low prevalence categories. Students with physical impairments ormild sensory impairments often can be appropriately served in a VE model. Focuses the educational program on the individual needs of the students,rather than on the label of the child. The flexibility associated with the use of a VE model can be seen as an assetwhen providing appropriate programs for exceptional students. When parentswant their child to be served in the neighborhood school, a VE model can beused to accommodate that preference. ESE teachers in secondary schools can usethe model to departmentalize and group students by functional levels. While a VE model sometimes carries a reputation as being a "dumping ground," infact, it can remove artificial barriers. What is important, however, isthat the program provided in a VE model have an identity, i.e., a clear senseof purpose. Whether a VE model is seen as the program for special diplomastudents at the high school, the prekindergarten program for high functioningstudents, or the program at the elementary school that enables all of theexceptional students to attend their neighborhood school, the teachers in VEclasses need to understand and support the purposes of their programs. [General Information] [Table of Contents] State Board of Education Rule In 1983, Rule 6A-6.0311, Florida Adminstrative Code, (FAC), Special Programsand Procedures for Exceptional Students, was amended to include requirementsfor varying exceptionalities classes. (3) Varying Exceptionalties. If a school district elects to use a varyingexceptionalities class, it shall be used only to a limited extent in order toprovide special programs for exceptional students. (a) A varying exceptionalities class is the setting which may provide forassignment of students of more than one (1) exceptionality to one (1) teacherper instructional class period, or more than one (1) exceptionality to one (1)teacher during the school week. (b) If a school district establishes varying exceptionalities classes,procedures for the program shall be set forth in district procedures asrequired by Rule 6A-6.0311, FAC. (c) Eligible exceptional students served in varying exceptionalities classesshall be reported for full-time equivalent membership in accordance with Rule6A-6.1.451(7)(8), FAC. (d) Parents shall be notified, as provided in Rule 6A-6.0311, FAC, when thestudent is assigned to a varying exceptionalities class with otherexceptionalities. [General Information] [Table of Contents] Certification Requirements for Teachers The required certification for teachers in VE classes is identified annually inthe Course Code Directory. Teachers in VE classes must have one of thefollowing certification areas: Varying Exceptionalities Specific Learning Disabilities Mentally Handicapped Emotionally Handicapped. The requirements for the Varying Exceptionalities certification have recentlybeen revised and became effective July 1, 1992. They are as follows: A bachelor's or higher degree with a major in exceptional student educationwhich includes courses in the instructional strategies for emotionallyhandicapped, mentally handicapped, and specific learning disabilities. or A bachelor's or higher degree with thirty six (36) semester hours inexceptional student education including the following areas: Foundations of exceptional student education Language development and disorders Assessment of exceptional students Educational management Teaching social and personal skills Methods and materials for teaching reading Teaching skills and concepts of mathematics Methods and content for teaching language arts Characteristics of mildly handicapped students (EH, EMH, SLD) Instructional strategies for teaching students who are mentally handicapped Instructional strategies for teaching students who are emotionally handicapped Instructional strategies for teaching students with specific learning disabilities In addition, teachers already certified in the areas of mentally handicapped,specific learning disabilities, emotionally handicapped, or physicallyimpaired, may qualify for VE certification by adding the appropriate additionalrequirements in terms of the characteristics and instructional strategiescourses specified in the last section.

In 1986-87, the Task Force on Educationof Exceptional Students (Varying Exceptionalities) developed a list of bestpractices to assist districts. Recent surveys of VE teachers have indicatedthat the majority of teachers feel that these best practices are beingimplemented in school districts. 1. A VE model should be used for specific educationalprograms. The Task Force recommended that a VE model may be best utilized at theprekindergarten or high school level. Districts have found a VE modeleffective for programs such as community-based instruction, vocationalprograms, and special diploma programs. 2. A VE model is best utilized for classes and programs where students havemore common curricular needs. The class size, composition, and educational demands must be taken intoaccount when using a VE model at any level. Consideration of the behavior andacademic functioning of students will be critical to the successful use of a VEmodel. 3. Prior to a student's placement in the VE delivery model, thepotential receiving teacher(s) should have the opportunity to observe the childin his or her current educational setting or to become familiar with thechild's educational needs. This may include access to the student's records, phone conferences, orother methods of communication when direct observation is not possible. Whenthe receiving teacher is well-informed about the needs of the new student,support services and other accommodations can be provided. 4. After a student is placed in a VE class, the appropriateness of theplacement is reviewed within a reasonable amount of time or wheneverrequested. Monitoring the effectiveness of a student's placement should be anongoing process. The review may evaluate the appropriateness of the placement,given the child's educational needs. Whenever requested, the staffing team mayreconsider a placement decision and recommend a more appropriate educationalprogram. 5. To the extent possible, full-time and part-time students should be servedin separate classes. Consideration must be made regarding the educational impact ofcombining self-contained students with part-time resource students, who enterand exit the classroom at differing times during the course of the schoolday. 6. Instructional aides are provided as needed. These may include volunteerassistants as well as paid paraprofessionals. Teachers need to understand the district policies and procedures forproviding teacher aides. In addition, participation in the school volunteerprogram can be a ready source of help. 7. Adequate supplies are provided within existing guidelines to maintain thequality of the program. In districts where money for supplies is managed at the school level,the ESE teachers should become a part of the decision making team. 8. Adequate support services are provided within district guidelines tomaintain the quality of the program. Support services should include administrative assistance and relatedservice personnel, including school psychologists and social workers. 9. Parents are well informed about the circumstances in the VE class. There should be a close working relationship between the parents of anESE student in a VE class and the VE teacher. The parents should be aware ofthe characteristics of the class (e.g., class size, functional levels of thestudents, etc.) and the availability of support and appropriate services fortheir child. 10. School or district administrative staff monitor the effectiveness of theprogram for students on an individual basis. The effectiveness of a VE delivery model should be evaluated by lookingat key indicators such as the accomplishments of the students, discipline,participation in the mainstream, etc. [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Sample District Guidelines for Varying Exceptionalities Local school districts determine how a VE model is to be used to deliverexceptional student education programs. In small districts, due to the smallnumber of students, a VE model may be used to provide a wide range of services.In middle and large-sized districts in Florida, a VE model may be used eitherbroadly or only for specific programs or populations. District policy andphilosophy determine the particular application. In VE classes that are seen as successful, students are grouped according tosimilar academic and behavior functioning and needs. Effective teachers in aVE model will need to have a strong curriculum background and will also need tobe well-organized, open-minded, flexible, and creative. They must be able topresent knowledge and skills from many different perspectives. The descriptions in this section are provided as illustrations of the ways thatdistricts have elected to use a VE model in the prekindergarten, elementary,middle, and secondary programs. Recommendations regarding thecharacteristics of children, provision of aides, or pupil/teacher ratio areincluded only as guidelines and are not intended to serve as requirements orofficial state policy. The districts that provided the guidelines are named atthe end of the descriptions. [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Prekindergarten Programs The primary purpose for using the VE model in the prekindergarten program is tokeep students as close to home as possible. This eliminates long bus rides andprovision of services on an itinerant basis. The model provides more costeffective services. Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Students can be grouped by ability or functioning level, rather thanexceptionality. Prekindergarten children can be exposed to better role modelsin skill areas which may not be their strengths. They more readily developsocial and language skills from interaction with their peers. Children who are 3-5 years of age and developmentally delayed are oftenconsidered for placement in a VE model. The disability of the child may bedirectly interfering with social interaction, and the child may need to be in aprogram with children of his or her own age. The family may benefit fromparent training provided along with the program for the child. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 8:1 with a full-time paraprofessional or aide isconsidered best practice for students in this age group. The class size shouldalso consider the needs of the students. Students who require a great deal ofcare and personal support will need to be placed in classes with an evensmaller pupil/teacher ratio or additional teacher aides. The classroom program should be staffed by a teacher who is certified inexceptional student education or early childhood education (as indicated in theCourse Code Directory). Speech/language pathologists, physical therapists, oroccupational therapists should provide programs and services for children asappropriate. The school psychologists and social worker may serve in anevaluative and consultative capacity and assist parents in accessing localagencies, if needed. Program Planned activities are designed to increase functional skills in all sixdevelopmental areas: fine motor, gross motor, language, cognitive, self-care,and social skills. Skill development is encouraged throughmulti-sensory-stimulation and activities such as dressing, pre-speech andfeeding, use of music to facilitate language and movement, and manipulation ofmaterials for improvement of fine motor skills. An interdisciplinary teamapproach is used in the classroom to support the goals and objectivesformulated in the Individual Educational Plan (IEP) of each child. (from Manatee County Guidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Elementary School Resource Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Children are grouped in a VE class with other children who have comparableneeds. They may exhibit delays in individual areas such as language arts,reading, math, motor skills, and social and personal behaviors. These studentsare mainstreamed for the majority of the school day, and the VE class serves toprovide intervention in the area of the child's greatest need and to providesupport to successful performance in the mainstream class. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff For a resource room, the number of students will be based on the number ofhours each student is seen. In most cases, 20-30 students can be served in aresource room. Sometimes additional students who are fully mainstreamed areassigned to the ESE teacher for consultation services only. Each district setsthe caseload requirements for a teaching unit, and actual numbers of studentsvary considerably from these recommendations. Support services are availablefrom the Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resources System (FDLRS), programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Program The schedule in a VE class is determined according to the particular needs ofthe students assigned to the class and must be arranged to accommodate the theschedule of the mainstream classes. In some schools, the VE teacher is using ateam teaching model to provide services in the context of the regularclassroom. Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of themainstreaming experience of all ESE students. Through this model, exceptionaleducation teachers and basic or vocational education teachers join together toplan needed support and accommodations for exceptional students in mainstreamclasses. Through regular conferences and monitoring, the likelihood of successof the student is greatly enhanced. This is particularly critical at the startof a new school year or when the ESE students are first being included inmainstream programs. (from Polk County Guidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Elementary School Self-Contained Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Children are grouped in a VE class with other children who have comparableneeds. They may exhibit delays in multiple areas such as language arts,reading, math, motor skills, and social and personal behaviors. Participationin mainstream classes is generally limited to art, music, and physicaleducation for most students. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff For a self-contained class, a 12:1 pupil/teacher ratio with a full-time aideor paraprofessional is considered best practice for students in this age group.Support services are available from FDLRS, program supervisors, schoolpsychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel and curriculumresource personnel in the school. Program The schedule is determined based on the functioning levels and subject areasneeds of the students as well as the scheduling of students for mainstreamclasses. In many programs, ESE students participate in the music, art, andphysical education programs with their chronological peers. In schools with more than one ESE unit, students can be grouped by age range orby program needs. Teachers generally feel that emotionally handicappedstudents who require full-time services should be placed together. (Polk CountyGuidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Middle School Resource Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model This program is usually designed for mildly handicapped students who do notrequire services in all academic areas or intensive related services or therapyfor behavior or emotional handicaps. Middle school programs are departmentalized or organized by grade level teams.Students typically receive instruction from a number of different teachers,including those in the exploratory subjects. The VE teacher may provideinstruction in basic academic classes such as English and mathematics, butgenerally the content areas and special areas are taken in the mainstream forstudents in resource programs. If the school has sufficient students and ESEteachers, faculty assignments may be made by subject area specialization or tograde level teams. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Aides and volunteers may be essentialif the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personalattention. Support services should be available from FDLRS, programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Program The schedule is organized by grade level, subject area, and in some subjects,by functional level. The number of VE teachers in the school will affect theflexibility of the scheduling. In middle schools with grade level teams, VE teachers are sometimes organizedas a separate department, and students are scheduled in their classes on apull-out basis. Other middle schools have found success with placing the VEteacher on one of the teams and enrolling the ESE students on that team. Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of themainstreaming experience of all ESE students. (See Elementary School:Resource Programs for a description of Cooperative Consultation.) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Middle School Self-Contained Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model This program is usually designed for exceptional students who require servicesin the major academic areas and may need some related services or intensivetherapy. Students in self-contained programs are taught the academic content areas inVE classes. If the school has sufficient students and ESE teachers, facultyassignments may be by subject area specialization within the ESE department.Students may be mainstreamed for art, music, physical education and vocationalexploration. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Aides and volunteers may be essentialif the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personalattention. Support services should be available from FDLRS, programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Program The schedule is generally organized by grade level, subject area, and in somesubjects, by functional level. If there is only one self-contained unit in amiddle school, the content area subjects may rotate on a three year cycle, toschedule the courses more efficiently. The number of VE teachers in the schoolwill affect the flexibility of the scheduling. [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] High School Resource Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model This program is designed for mildly handicapped students who are served on aresource basis and do not require intensive related services or therapy. High school programs are usually departmentalized. Students receiveinstruction from a number of different teachers. The VE teacher may provideinstruction in basic classes such as English and mathematics, or in supportareas such as learning strategies, social skills or unique skills. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Support services should be availablefrom FDLRS, program supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, schoolguidance personnel, and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Jobplacement specialists and vocational education services are an important aspectof the high school program. Because of the needs for transition services,other agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation may become involved at thislevel. Program The schedule is generally organized by grade level, subject area, and in somesubjects, by functional level. Team teaching has been used successfully inmany districts to support ESE students in mainstream classes. In this model,the ESE teacher and the mainstream teacher work as a team to deliver a class. Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of themainstreaming experience of all ESE students. (See Elementary School Programs:Resource Programs for a description of Cooperative Consultation.) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] High School Self-Contained Programs for Special Diplomas The exceptional students who require full-time placement at the high schoollevel in many districts are those who are working towards a special diploma.The full-time students would receive credit in VE classes to meet therequirements of a special diploma. Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Districts may establish guidelines to assist in the recommendation ofexceptional students for participation in a functional life skills curriculumand a special diploma. Low academic levels, particularly low reading ability,are commonly used indicators. In some districts, this determination is made as a part of the eighth gradeplanning process. The district program specialist may review recommendedstudents with teachers and other school personnel. The parent and students mayparticipate in an IEP review in the spring to make the actual decisions. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Aides and volunteers may be essentialif the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personalattention. Support services should be available from FDLRS, programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Most special-diploma-seekingstudents should be involved with a vocational program. Because of the needsfor transition services, other agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation maybecome involved at this level. Program The functional life skills curriculum emphasizes career awareness, socialskills, and pre-employment habits and attitudes necessary for successful workadjustment. Basic skills and problem-solving techniques are presented in areal-life context to prepare students to function independently as adults. (from Palm Beach County Guidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] High School Vocational Education Programs The purpose of vocational programs at the high school level is to enablestudents to develop the ability to communicate appropriately with peers andadults, to demonstrate the skills and attitudes essential for employment, andto help students set realistic career goals. Students are involved in jobpreparatory programs to develop specific occupational skills. Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Students should enroll in vocational programs based on their interest andaptitude. Work experience may be provided either on or off campus. ESEstudents may enroll in regular vocational programs or in specially designedprograms. The VE class generally serves to support the academic and jobtraining requirements of the program. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class is conisdered best practice forstudents in this age group. Occupational specialists, vocationalrehabilitation counselors, and ESE specialists and evaluators are needed tosupport this program. For more severely disabled students, job coaches may berequired. Program The program is organized to support the course needs to meet graduation andvocational program requirements. The student's work schedule may occur duringthe school day or may be arranged in off hours. Districts may provide thevocational program through the offerings at a comprehensive high school or inan area vocational-technical program.

Consideration must be given to the characteristics and needsof the students, the scheduling of students during the day, the way studentsare grouped for instruction, and the management of the learning environment.This section provides a variety of suggestions that may help the VE teacher. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Characteristics of Exceptional Students As identified in the first section of this document, all categories ofexceptional students may be served in a VE class. The following descriptionshave been developed by the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Students(Educating Exceptional Students, 1993) and are provided to define anddescribe educational characteristics related to each exceptionality. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Autistic Student Characteristics Autism is a behaviorally-defined syndrome characterized by severeproblems in learning, communication, and social interaction. Although autismis a lifelong disability for which there is no known cure, persons with thisdisorder can make substantial progress through intervention programs ineducation, speech and language therapy, and other disciplines. The term "autism" refers to a collection of behavioral symptoms which normallyare diagnosed during infancy or early childhood and may have more than onecause. Behavioral characteristics may vary significantly among individualswith autism. These characteristics include cognitive, behavioral, social, andcommunication deficits. Educational Characteristics Cognitive levels of functioning vary dramatically within thispopulation. Levels may range from the profoundly disabled who display a numberof physical problems, to high functioning individuals who are sociallyintegrated with the community. Many individuals show unevenness in their developmental profile. Splinterskills within and between academic areas often evidence this uneven skilldevelopment. Most individuals evidence speech which is noncommunicative and language skillswhich are dysfunctional. There may be markedly abnormal nonverbalcommunication, such as lack of eye contact or inability to refocus attention asthe situation changes. There may be marked impairment in the ability toinitiate or sustain a conversation. Many individuals may ignore the presence of others and remain aloof andindifferent to social contact. Interest in objects may be greater thaninterest in people. Some may show an inability to make friends with others inthe classroom. Some individuals may lack appropriate affect in relation to environmentalstimulation. They may become extremely upset without obvious provocation,resulting in tantrumming behavior of considerable duration or intensity. Hypo- or hyper-sensitivity are often characteristic reactions to stimuli.Individuals with autism may demonstrate insensitivity or lack of response topain, or they may overreact to a common environmental noise such as a schoolbell. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Dual Sensory Impaired Student Characteristics Students with "dual sensory impairments" have both a vision and a hearing lossand are sometimes referred to as "deaf-blind." The combination of sensorylosses creates severe communication and other developmental and learning needsthat require special education and related services. Communication andmobility are the most seriously affected areas for students with dual sensoryimpairments. Educational Characteristics Students communicate through facial expression, body movement, andvarious vocalizations that may seem unintelligible. Staff should acknowledgeand expand communication attempts so that students can develop effective meansof communication. Students with little functional use of their vision or hearing are oftenunable to understand what is going to happen to them. Staff should developtouch cues (specific signals of events or requests) and use them consistentlyin daily routines. Students with severe impairments react more positively to a stranger ifapproached using a gentle touch to the shoulder as a cue. Students must be taught appropriate touch, tolerating touch, and explorationstrategies. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Emotionally Handicapped and Severely Emotionally Disturbed Student Characteristics The student who has an emotional handicap exhibits one or more of thefollowing characteristics, to the extent that he or she is unable to takeadvantage of or participate in the regular education program: Inability to learn cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or healthfactors. Demonstrates inappropriate types of behaviors or feelings under normalcircumstances. General mood is one of unhappiness or depression. Tendency to develop physical symptoms, pain, or fears associated with personalor school problems. Unable to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships withpeers or teacher. Demonstrates a variety of excessive behaviors, ranging from hyperactive andaggressive responses to severe depression and withdrawal. All student characteristics must be examined as they are impacted by thecontext of educational settings (academic and social), home, and community. Educational Considerations Students should be provided with a structured learning environment to providefor skill acquisition in behavior control strategies, academic achievement, andsocialization. Classroom rules for group control and structure for targeting behaviors shouldbe key elements in the learning environment. Many have academic problems, particularly in reading comprehension, socialstudies, and math problem solving. These areas should be emphasized in thecurriculum. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Gifted Gifted students are rarely served in a VE model. However, students with otherexceptionalities occasionally exhibit characteristics associated withgiftedness, and these may be used as clues to appropriate learninginterventions. Student Characteristics There is no one type of giftedness; therefore, no single instructionalmodification is effective for all gifted students. Most effective teachingstrategies emphasize flexibility and sensitivity to the characteristics ofgifted students, and provision of opportunities to experience the breadth of aconcept to match the student's curiosity. General Characteristics Learn skills efficiently, with little practice. Interpret nonverbal cues and draw inferences independently. Work independently at an earlier age and for longer periods of time. Often have wildly eclectic interests and are intensely focused. Have seemingly boundless energy; may be misdiagnosed as hyperactive. Are able to relate well to adults and older children. Learning Characteristics Show keen powers of observation; have an eye for important details. Prefer structure, organization, and consistency in their environment. Are often skeptical, critical, and evaluative. Have a ready grasp of underlying principles; can make generalizations. Can attack complicated material and analyze it systematically. Have well developed common sense. Behavioral Characteristics Are often well organized, goal-directed, and efficient. Exhibit intrinsic motivation to learn, find out, and explore. Have a highly developed moral and ethical sense. Can integrate opposing impulses. Often seem to be daydreaming. May seek to conceal their abilities. Have a well developed sense of self and realistic ideas about theircapabilities. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Hearing Impaired Student Characteristics The term "hearing impaired" refers to people with all types of hearingdisabilities, ranging from a very slight loss to profound deafness. Whetherthe hearing loss occurred before or after the student acquired language oftendetermines the type of support services the individual student will need inorder to succeed. Educational Considerations The diversity of manifestations makes it necessary to consider eachstudent as an individual with unique characteristics and educational needs. Some students have difficulty accepting their hearing loss and areinconsistent in wearing their hearing aids. Hearing aids only partiallycompensate for an individual's hearing impairment. Individual students mayexhibit speech, language, and communication problems. Some students communicate orally; others use speech and sign language.Students may need the assistance of an interpreter or notetaker. Sign languageinterpreters may sign and speak at the same time. Oral interpreters voicewithout using signs. Optimum acoustical conditions must be provided for students with hearingimpairments. Any extraneous noise makes it more difficult for students tointerpret oral language. To reduce reverberation, the classroom should beequipped with sound-absorbing materials such as carpet, cloth curtains, andacoustical ceiling tile. Adequate lighting is needed to help with the comprehension of informationthrough speech reading and visual aids. In addition, amplification is neededto assist students in understanding what is being said. Students may havedifficulty processing both the visual information and the classroomconversation at the same time. Suggestions for Classroom Routines Speak normally when talking; hearing aids increase the loudness of sounds. Write assignments on the board. Encourage students to ask for statements to be repeated. Rephrase thestatements, if they do not understand. Students may fatigue more readily because of the continuous visual andauditory strain of keeping up with the classroom activity. Allow students to sit where they can have direct eye contact with the speakerand interpreter. Avoid standing in front of windows and other light sources when speaking tostudents. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Mentally Handicapped Student Characteristics People with a mental handicap develop at a below-average rate andexperience difficulty in learning and social adjustment. "Mentally retardedmeans significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existingconcurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during thedevelopmental period, that adversely affects a student's educationalperformance" (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA). In educational settings, students with mental handicaps may be determinedeligible for one of three groups based on their ability to learn and theirability to be independent and socially responsible: [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Educable Mentally Handicapped (EMH) Students are mildly impaired in intellectual and adaptive behavioral skills.IQ is approximately 55-70 and assessed adaptive behavior falls below age andcultural expectations. These students can learn about 50% to 75% of what atypical student can learn and understand. They usually have a short attentionspan and do not retain information readily. Educational Considerations Teachers may need to use many clear, unambiguous verbal cues; prompts;physical guidance; and modeling to help these students learn at a moreefficient rate. Students need frequent feedback and reinforcement. Students can learn a broad range of subjects including basic skills, socialstudies, science, and health and personal care. An important component ispreparation for a vocation and community living. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Trainable Mentally Handicapped (TMH) Students identified as TMH are moderately or severely impaired in intellectualand adaptive behavior and have a reduced rate of learning. IQ is approximately25-55 and assessed adaptive behavior falls significantly below age and culturalexpectations. Students can learn about 25% to 50% of what a typical studentcan learn and understand. In addition, they may have cardiac or neurologicalsensory disorders. Educational Considerations Students may require many services provided through an interdisciplinary teamapproach. Curriculum should include activities of daily living, preparation andparticipation in a supported employment program, and transition services forlife after school. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Profoundly Mentally Handicapped (PMH) Students identified as PMH are profoundly impaired in intellectual and adaptivebehavior and have a reduced rate of learning. IQ is approximately 25 or belowand assessed adaptive behavior falls very significantly below age and culturalexpectations. Students have little response to most social stimuli and limitedawareness of their environment. Communication is very limited, and they maydisplay temper tantrums, self-injurious behaviors, self-stimulation, andseizures. Many have other serious conditions as well, such as cerebral palsyor blindness. Educational Considerations Students benefit from social stimulation and communication training. Many students require assistive technology for ambulation, self-care, andhealth maintenance. Teachers need to work with the adult agencies to which these students maytransition after graduation and help the students develop the appropriatebehavioral skills for this transition. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Physically Impaired Student Characteristics A physical impairment is a physically disabling condition resulting froma health impairment, an orthopedic condition, or a traumatic brain injury whichrequires an adaptation to the student's school environment or curriculum.Physical impairments include physical problems present at birth as well asphysical problems resulting from other causes. Neurological problems, such ascerebral palsy, may be included in this category. Health impairments may result in reduced efficiency in school work because oftemporary or chronic lack of strength, vitality, or alertness. Asthma, cardiacconditions, leukemia, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) areexamples of health impairments that could interfere with a student'seducation. Educational Considerations The effect of a physical impairment can vary from little or none to acomplete restructuring of daily life. Severely involved students may requireintensive health care and educational assistance. Physical impairments may interfere with the student's motor functioning,communication, learning skills, or social development. Physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy are often central tothe education of students with physical impairments. The greatest progress isachieved when therapy suggestions are consistently applied in the student'shome as well as throughout the school environment. Programs may need to be made assessible by structural changes (adding rampsor elevators) or schedule or location changes. Physical impairments can affect the student's emotional and socialdevelopment. Avoid overprotection and encourage students to participate withinlimits of safety and health. Adaptive equipment can be used to enable students with physical impairments tofunction more normally. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Specific Learning Disabilities Student Characteristics A specific learning disability is a condition which affects one of thebasic psychological processes involved in understanding or using language. Apsychological process is considered to be the combined operations involved ingathering, storing, or retrieving information through sensory channels. Thedisability can appear in areas such as listening, thinking, reading, talking,writing, or arithmetic. Learning disabilities cannot be attributed to avision, hearing, or motor disability, a mental handicap, an emotionaldisturbance, or environmental deprivation. Specific learning disability delays are typically in spoken language orlistening skills, error patterns in written language (including reading),difficulty in grasping math concepts or performing basic arithmetic operations,and difficulty in applying organizational skills. These characteristics may beevident in several areas of performance. Identification of specific learningdisabilities is possible when a discrepancy exists between a student'sestimated ability and actual performance level. Educational Considerations The disability can have a mild to severe impact on students' academicperformance. Classroom organization providing a high level of structure, defined routines,and clearly stated rules and assignments are helpful to many students. Flexibility in allotment of time to complete assignments and in the use ofclassroom space and equipment provides students an increased opportunity to besuccessful. Modifications in instructional methods, such as activities to support lessons(study guides or advance organizers), assist students to master key conceptsand content. Instructional materials can be modified by compressing or paraphrasing texts,developing additional practice materials, or reducing the number of itemsrequired to show proficiency. Assessment procedures that allow alternative presentation of questions andresponses can enable students to demonstrate competencies. Clear instructionsand expectations must be provided. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Speech and Language Impaired Student Characteristics Speech and language impairments refer to problems in communication,i.e., the ability to understand or appropriately use speech and languagesystems. Such disorders may range from simple sound repetitions or occasionalmisarticulations to the absence of the ability to use speech and language forcommunication. A language impairment is the inability to use the symbols oflanguage through proper use of words and their meanings, appropriategrammatical patterns, and proper use of speech sounds. A speech impairment isdifficulty in producing speech sounds (articulation), maintaining speech rhythm(fluency), and controlling vocal production (voice). Educational Considerations Students with a communication disorder may have difficulty learningbasic academic subjects. As students progress through school, increased demands in the language oflearning can result in great difficulty for students with speech or languageimpairments. Some students may encounter isolation in educational, vocational, social, andemotional areas. Technology can assist students whose physical condition makes communicationdifficult. The use of augmentative or assistive communication devices allowslimited-speaking or nonspeaking students to engage in meaningfulcommunication. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Visually Impaired Student Characteristics "Partially sighted" refers to students who have corrected vision between 20/200and 20/70 and who may require the use of special materials for learning. "Low vision" refers to students who may be partially sighted or legally blindand who require adaptations that may include Braille. "Legally blind" refers to students who have corrected vision of less than20/200 or a very limited field of vision and who require the use of specialmaterials for learning. "Totally blind" refers to students who have no light perception and who requireBraille or other nonvisual media for learning. The effect of visual problems on a student's development depends on theseverity and type of loss, the age of onset, and the overall functioning levelof the child. Many children who have multiple handicaps may also have visualimpairments which result in further motor, cognitive, and/or socialdevelopmental delays. Many children who have a visual impairment are notmotivated to explore their environment because of lack of visual stimuli. Theymay appear uninterested, overprotected, and antisocial due to the impact oftheir visual impairment. Educational Considerations Special materials, including Braille, large print, and taped textbooks andsupplemental reading materials; special technology, including adaptivecomputers, low-vision optical aids, and print-enlarging equipment; andmodifications to curricula may be necessary for students with visualimpairments. Students may require special instruction in daily living skills, socialskills, orientation and mobility (independent movement in the environment),communication (Braille), or vocational/career options.

They feel that they have to work around thedemands of all other programs in the school. A proactive approach is needed tofacilitate appropriate scheduling. The following list provides a number ofsuggestions that may assist the VE teacher in developing the classroom scheduleat the beginning of the school year. Try not to remove ESE students from their homeroom time. Wait untilannouncements are finished. Allow time in the weekly or semester schedule for non-instructional duties,such as paperwork, testing, conferencing with parents and teachers, andplanning. Be firm and assertive about scheduling for the time specified on the student'sIEP. If you must teach more than one subject at a time, make sure you have thesupport you need. For some students and subjects, an integrated andinterdisciplinary approach to instruction works very well. Make individual plans for students that could be used for a period of time.Students could keep track of accomplishments and check off work as theycomplete it. Assignments may be posted on the bulletin board and students canbe responsible for tracking their completion. Stress day-by-day organization which is as critical as the weekly or yearlyplan. Students need to know exactly what to do each day and the rules shouldbe consistently applied. Be aware of practices like Friday testing in the regular classroom. Correlateyour activities as appropriate. Provide lesson plans for aides and volunteers so they will know what to do. [Scheduling] [Table of Contents] Elementary Programs The following suggestions are intended to help teachers in elementaryschools whose ESE students regularly participate in mainstream programs. Use the school's master schedule to identify times when all ESE students arein mainstream programs, such as music, art, and physical education; includelunch and other common times. Coordinate with the regular teacher's classroom schedule. Where possible andappropriate, the ESE student should remain in the regular classroom for classesand activities in which they can experience success. Try to schedule students in the VE class for the subject or area identified onthe IEP at the same time their regular class has this scheduled. Arrange theVE schedule so that students can be grouped by academic or social needs, notnecessarily by grade level or by exceptionality. Sometimes, you may find that the all of the regular classes offer the targetedsubjects, like reading, at the same time of day. The VE schedule becomesoverloaded at certain times during the day and very light at others. The ESEteacher may be able to negotiate with the regular teacher or the schooladministrator to adjust the schedule or to accommodate the ESE students in theregular class. If you have both part-time and full-time students in the class, try toschedule students so that they can be grouped by functional level. [Scheduling] [Table of Contents] Secondary Programs The following suggestions are intended for teachers in middle and highschools. ESE students should be hand-scheduled or scheduled first if a computer programis used to ensure that appropriate courses and instructors are selected. Thiswill help to avoid placing students in inappropriate classes. Providing a consistent structure can assist students in meeting requirementsof many different teachers. Daily reviews of expectations in each class willpromote improved behavior. Help students who are new to the school find their way around. Older studentscan be assigned to help new students for the first few weeks. [Scheduling] [Table of Contents] Grouping for Instruction After the schedule has been set for the VE class, the teacher must determinehow the students will be grouped for instruction. The effective use ofgrouping techniques can result in a classroom that functions as a real learningcommunity. The following section provides descriptions of major types ofgrouping techniques, with guidelines for determining the benefits of each typeof grouping, and recommendations and cautions for effective use of the groupingtechnique. Although each exceptional student has an Individual Education Plan andshould be provided individualized instruction and assessment, students canbenefit from participation in group instruction and group work. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Independent Learning What does this accomplish? Independent learning provides opportunities for students in VE classesto practice needed skills, promote responsibility and individual effort, andbuild time management skills and self-directed work habits. Who benefits? All students in VE classes can benefit from independent learning activities.Even prekindergarten students in play activities are learning independently.Older students requiring drill and practice for skill development andreinforcement may use this method. In self-guided learning activities,students can work at their own pace. How do you make this work? Select the activities. The types of activities used forindependent learning do not have to be limited to paper-and-pencil worksheets.Activity centers can be created in which students can work on interestingtasks. Creative centers promote self-expression. The computer is a naturaltool for an independent learning activity center. Provide a management routine. Students will need to be able to performthe expected behaviors and outcomes of independent learning activities.Students should be able to select, retrieve, and return all needed equipmentand materials. The more you can rely on students to do things for themselves,the more they will gain from the activities. Provide feedback on performance. Even though the activities areindependent, students will need direct feedback on their performance. Many ESEstudents benefit from clear evidence of their progress. Any cautions? Selection of activities. Teachers in VE classes must provide thestructure for independent learning activities. Activities should be carefullyselected so that they are appropriate for the students. They should neither betoo difficult nor too easy. Independent learning activities must besufficiently challenging and even more important, they must be interesting tothe students. Arranging the learning environment.The learning environment in the VEclass must be arranged so that students can easily locate the materialsthemselves. Students also should learn how to get help in ways that do notdisrupt the rest of the classroom activities. Silent signals and learningbuddies are two methods that have worked in many classrooms. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] One-on-One Instruction What does this accomplish? One-on-one instruction is used to provide the most intensive kind ofinstruction. Modeling, prompting, and feedback can be individualized toanticipate and respond directly to the learner's needs. Who benefits? Students requiring personal contact for information to be processed willrequire one-on-one instruction. All students in a VE class may requireone-on-one instruction from time to time. Students who are most likely to needthis type of instruction include the following: New Students--Students who do not know the classroom routine do notknow how to get help independently. Students in Crisis--Students who temporarily lack self-control needmuch direct support and structure. Students Learning a New Skill--Students learning new skills requirecareful attention to the modeling and feedback provided by the teacher.Sometimes this is most efficiently delivered on a personalized basis. Students with Sensory Impairments--Students whose ability to receiveinformation is impaired may require personal contact. Some dual sensoryimpaired students need to have the sign language transmitted in their hand. How do you make this work? The most successful use of one-on-one instruction necessitates carefulplanning. When the VE teacher anticipates the need for this approach, theappropriate conditions can be arranged. A classroom management program isneeded for the other students and could involve peer tutoring, independent taskcompletion routines, and use of assistants and volunteers. One-on-oneinstruction may require the classroom teacher for delivery, but it may also beprovided by teacher assistants or through computer-assisted instruction. Insome cases, the teacher can get the process started, then move aside as othersupport mechanisms take over. Any cautions? As in any ESE class, teachers need to keep the goal of independent learning atthe forefront. In VE classes, students often need a lot of one-on-oneinstruction at first. Plan to fade some of the direct assistance as the childbecomes acclimated to the classroom or more proficient in practicing the newskill. Where groups of students must be instructed together, shift back andforth from whole group participation to individual instruction and response.When students in VE classes are taught how to be independent learners, they canbecome partners in the process. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Large and Small Groups What does this accomplish? For students with similar learning needs, group instruction provides anefficient method for demonstrations, information presentations, and modeling.For students with more diverse learning needs, group instruction can be used toprovide shared experiences. Many VE classrooms use cooperative learning groupsto accommodate the diversity of student learning needs. Who benefits? Students of all ages can benefit from group learning experiences. Veryyoung students may require smaller groups and activities that are relativelyshort. Older students will need activities that are well paced and easy tofollow. Students with disabilities may need to learn how to participate ingroup activities. How do you make this work? Keep grouping flexible. Planning for instruction in a VE class requiresthe teacher to consider the needs of all students in the class. Students maybe grouped for specific skill learning or for concept development. Because ofthe diversity within a VE class, teachers often must group and regroup studentsthroughout the day. Most students can adjust to this type of flexibility aslong as it is predictable. Students can follow a task card, with symbolsrepresenting where they are to be. A timer in the classroom can help to signalchange in activities. Use media to enhance presentations. When information must be presentedto a group of students, visual and auditory aids are particularly useful.These aids can reinforce the key points. Concrete examples are generally themost effective presentation aids. Keep students actively involved. Learning requires active involvement.Listening is rarely sufficient for students in VE classes to gain theinformation and understanding provided through verbal instruction. Use a lotof cues to focus the student's attention. Students can also participate ingroup instruction in a variety of ways. Assign each student a different roleor expectation, then have them collaborate to complete a related task. Combine a variety of activities. Many teachers find group instructionsuccessful when they combine several activities within a class period. Beginthe lesson with an advanced organizer that "sets the stage" and provides anoverview of the lesson or a link to what was done in previous lessons. Thelesson can easily combine whole-group, small-group, and individual activities.Don't forget to end the lesson with a summary or post-organizer. Any cautions? Monitoring student response to group instruction is the key to itseffectiveness. Students will be processing information at different rates andvarying in their participation. The teacher must always check forunderstanding. Group feedback can be effective for some activities. However,individual feedback may also be required. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Students in the Mainstream What does this accomplish? To the extent appropriate, exceptional students should be provided education inthe least restrictive environment. For the majority of ESE students, thismeans participation in mainstream programs with their peers. Who benefits? ESE students can benefit from both the instructional and socializationopportunities available through placement in regular classes. For some,accommodations may need to be provided in terms of instructional methods,communication modes, and assessment procedures. How do you make this work? A structured process has been widely used in Florida to promote thesuccessful integration of exceptional students in mainstream classes.Cooperative Consultation (Riegel, 1988) provides a set of easy to usechecklists and forms through which exceptional education and mainstreamteachers can assess needs and plan realistic alternatives for studentsencountering difficulty in the school setting. The process facilitates opencommunication among the professionals and with the students. The result is ashared responsibility for implementing alternatives and monitoring the outcomesfor the student. The process requires the following steps: Assess the ESE student's educational needs. Assess the demands of the mainstream environment. Determine any modifications or accommodations needed for the ESEstudent. Monitor the implementation of the modifications and the progress of the ESEstudent. Any cautions? Mainstreaming works well when the mainstream teacher, the ESE teacher,and the ESE student have clearly communicated and agreed upon theirexpectations and responsibilities. When success is left to chance, results aregenerally uneven. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Managing the Classroom Environment The way you organize your classroom will contribute to the management ofinstruction. Furniture arrangement, access to equipment and materials, andorganization of materials all play key roles in managing the classroomenvironment. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Planning the Environment As you begin to think about organizing your classroom, here is a list ofthings you may want to consider. Take stock of what you will need. How many students will be in the classroom at a time? Will there be an aide or volunteers? What equipment and furniture is assigned to the room? What instructional materials are available? How can I get furniture, equipment, or materials I need? Organize your space. What kinds of working spaces will be needed? How can the space be divided to accommodate the different kinds ofinstructional activities that are used? How can the furniture be used to create different areas in the room? From VE Teacher Handbook, Polk County, draft, 1993 [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Arranging the Furniture Because of the wide variability in classroom size and location, nosingle arrangement for desks and centers will work in all VE classrooms. Thefollowing arrangements are provided to represent the typical types ofclassrooms and the advantages and disadvantages are listed to help teachersdecide which arrangement works best for them (adapted from The SolutionBook, SRA). CLASSROOM STYLE Benefits This arrangement has been the traditional arrangements in classrooms formany years. It places the teacher at the head of the classroom and faces allstudents to the center of instruction. It is an efficient use of space, andmay be used to keep individual desks away from learning centers, computers, orother special features in the classroom. When large group instruction andpresentation by the teacher is the most frequently used format, this style ispreferred. Problems When students are arranged in rows, the students at the back of theclassroom may have difficulty seeing the chalkboard or other visual aids in thefront of the room. Students also may be too close together for independentwork, and behavior problems may result. CLUSTER STYLE Benefits Grouping desks in clusters can be used in classes to support cooperativelearning activities, and team work. In many VE classes, there are small groupsof students who are working on the same level, and this classroom arrangementcould facilitate their instruction. Praise can be delivered to groups ofstudents as well as to individuals. Problems This arrangement may require more classroom space and leave little roomfor learning centers or other special classroom areas. Because students arefacing each other, behavior problems sometimes occur during independent worktime. Dividers may need to be used to partition the workspace. When wholegroup instruction is used, students may not all be facing the same direction. BOARDROOM STYLE Benefits Grouping desks is sometimes necessary when classroom space is limited.This works well when students are all working together on the same project orwhen students can work well independently. Problems Like cluster style, the arrangement sometimes results in behaviorproblems during independent work because students are facing each other.Students may also have difficulty receiving individual help from theteacher. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Organizing Instructional Materials and Supplies Think about how you will arrange and file your instructional materialsso that you, your assistants, and your students can easily access what isneeded. Where and how will you store textbooks, workbooks and other materials that arebeing used? What about the things you don't need right now? How will worksheets be filed? How will supplies be stored? [Managing the Classroom Environment] Information on Storing Textbooks, Workbooks, and Other Materials is also available.

By placing dividers about every 12 inches, bookscan be easily put into the "cubbyholes." Use plastic colored tape to code thebooks by level or by subject area, so that matching their storage locations iseasy. This same coding system could be used in other ways, perhaps to identifymaterials for individual students. Workbooks with soft covers will survive longer if placed in plastic reportcovers or if their covers are laminated. Some report folders have a clearfront and solid back with a three-ring holder. Have three holes drilled in theworkbooks so that they can be inserted in the folders easily. Books that are not currently needed are best stored out of the classroom. Itmay be possible to find a colleague who needs them. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Filing Worksheets Having access to a variety of worksheets can save the VE teacher a lotof time. But the key time-saver is having a system for filing so that theworksheets can easily be retrieved. Here's a system that works! Collect all loose worksheets and place all duplicate copies together inindividual files. Take the original or best copy of each and number itsequentially, so that each unique worksheet has a different number and there isa numbered corresponding file folder with the duplicates. The originals can then be sorted by topic or skill and placed in three ringnotebooks. You will have notebooks of worksheets for math skills, spellingpractice lessons, science concepts, etc. that you can scan easily to find justthe right one. With the numbering system, you can go to your files and, bymatching the number, locate enough copies of the worksheets for yourstudents. If you find that a worksheet fits in more than one category, just make enough"originals" to place it in all appropriate notebooks. If you are concernedabout putting holes in your originals to place them in the notebooks, put themin the plastic sleeves that can be put in notebooks. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Learning Centers Most teachers think of learning centers for elementary schools, but manysecondary teachers also find the concept very useful. Learning centers areused primarily to provide independent activities for students. They canprovide a structured exploration of a specific subject, topic, skill, orinterest area. The following are characteristics of a learning center: A learning center is self-instructional. When designed properly, no directsupervision of a teacher is required. A learning center can present activities on a variety of levels ofdifficulty. A learning center should have clear objectives. A learning center must include some method of record keeping for studentparticipation and accomplishment. Students need to be taught how to use a learning center. A learning center should be considered as a place where learning occurs, notas a place for recreation. (From VE Teachers Handbook, Polk County, draft, 1993) [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Managing Behavior The VE teacher must be able to manage the behavior of the diverse group ofstudents in the class. Behavior management is a system, method or techniquethat enables students to understand and respond appropriately to school andteacher expectations. A behavior management plan also helps studentsbecome aware of their own need to belong by choosing appropriate behaviors toachieve a special place in the classroom. The purpose of establishing a sound behavior management plan in the classroomis to enable students to be successful intellectually, socially andemotionally. Guiding and nurturing students in these areas enable children togrow up to become independent, creative, problem-solving citizens. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Behavior Management System How do you develop a behavior management system? To develop a successful behavior management system, several steps should befollowed. They include the establishment of a set of classroom rules,guidelines for implementation, and, if needed, a well-defined set of rewardsand consequences. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Establishing Classroom Rules How to Establish Classroom Rules Develop a maximum of five rules for your classroom. Be sure theycorrelate with school and district codes of conduct. State the classroom rules positively. Post the classroom rules in all four corners of the room on the first day ofschool. Include the classroom rules in a letter to parents and have parents sign andreturn it to indicate their understanding and full cooperation for theirchild's success. Teach the classroom rules directly and review them for seven days, statingthe rationale and life value of each. Some instructional activities that can be used include role playing ordramatization, drawing pictures to illustrate the classroom rules, orteacher-directed instruction to make sure that students can recognize anddemonstrate behaviors that follow the rules. You may also find it helpful tomake sure that students recognize behaviors that do not follow therules. Here are some examples of classroom rules: 	Give your best effort daily.	Listen when the teacher or someone is talking.	Raise your hand if you have something to say or to ask.	Cooperate and get along with others.	Complete all of your work. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Implementing Classroom Rules How to Implement Classroom Rules Be consistent. Set standards and expectations and follow them. Follow through with rewards and consequences that are realistic andappropriate. Provide both positive and corrective feedback to students and parents. Provide ongoing parent/teacher communication on a daily or regular basisdepending on the severity of problems and needs of individual students. As needed, go back to "square one." Reteach the classroom rules directlyand review them for several days stating the rationale and life value ofeach. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Maintain the Momentum How to Maintain the Momentum (or How do I survive in this classroom?) Whenever a student breaks a rule, use verbal correction. Example: "Carol, I see you talking. What's the rule about talking?" Waitfor response. "What will you do in the future if you want to talk? Repeatthat one more time." (Student verbalizes rule three times.) If student saysshe forgot, child should read rule from the chart and write that rule threetimes. Whenever a student breaks a rule and refuses to comply with your directions,use the broken record technique. The teacher repeats the rule conciselyuntil student cooperates. Whenever the "broken record" technique doesn't work, use the choicetechnique. Offer the student a choice of two things he may do, both ofwhich are acceptable to the teacher. It's recommended that one of the choicesbe obviously more appealing to the student. Whenever choice does not work, remove the student from the group until he orshe can act appropriately. This is a form of time out that keeps thestudent in the classroom. Advance the student through the steps only asnecessary. Step 1: Move chair away from the group, but facing the group so the studentcan observe appropriate behavior. Step 2: Leave the student where he or she is but turn the chair facing awayfrom the group. Step 3: Isolate the student from the group but within view of adult. Step 4: Have student draw or write responses to three questions: What did I do that put me in time out? What am I going to do in the future so this won't happen again? What did I miss as a result of being in time out? Assess the student's needs, interests, and behavior patterns andjointly construct a behavioral contract that specifically states what isexpected of the student. Contact the parents and get them to sign and support contract agreement. As a last resort, send student to the office where another alternative may beconsidered. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] R& R for Students To ensure a safe learning environment for all students, you may wish toinstitute R&R for students. An area of the classroom is designated asR&R -- Rest and Return -- and is available to any students who feel theneed to cool down and collect their thoughts when their behavior has gotten outof control. Generally a two-minute stay in R&R is sufficient for thispurpose. If the student won't voluntarily go to the R&R area, he or she is asked bythe teacher to put his head down on the desk for a specified time (e.g., three,five, or ten minutes). If the behavior persists or worsens, the student may be asked to leave theclassroom for a brief time and return when ready to participate. If this isrequired, it is recommended that someone, an aide or responsible student,accompany the student to the alternative area. Make sure that arrangementshave been made ahead of time for this type of crisis intervention. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Keeping Track of the Students On a paper attached to a magnetic board, the names of class members are listed.When a student leaves the classroom, he or she places a single magnet next tohis/her name to indicate the reason for being out of the classroom for a shortperiod. These reasons may include restroom, mainstream class, therapy, etc.When the child returns, the magnet is placed at the bottom of the listindicating re-entry to the classroom. This places the responsibility on thestudents to manage their own coming and going in the classroom. Additionalcontingencies could be set up: for example, limiting the number of studentsgoing out to the restroom at one time. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Silent Signals Sign language can be used for general requests in the classroom. There is asignal students may use to sharpen their pencils, get a drink of water, or goto the bathroom. This decreases the problem of being interrupted whileconducting a lesson. You can signal to the child to go ahead without stoppingyour lesson with the individual group. If you don't know sign language,contact your district coordinator for hearing-impaired programs or your localFDLRS Center. (from Lynn Barbieri, Citrus County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Rewards & Consequences A level system can be used for behavior management. The system must bedeveloped in conjunction with the classroom rules and behavioral expectationsfor the students. Positive reinforcement is provided for behavior that followsthe rules and meets the expectations. In most level systems, a point system is developed to provide concreteindicators to students. Points are awarded to students on a regularlyscheduled basis throughout the day or week. For example, the classroom day maybe divided into 30-minute intervals and a timer set to notify the teacher andstudents. In secondary schools, regular class periods serve as convenientintervals. Points may be awarded for each classroom rule a student follows, andpercentages may be calculated to determine how well the student is doing. Forsome students, the percentages may be calculated to show what percent of timethe student is following each rule. For other students, the percentages may becalculated to show what percent of the rules are being followed. The rewardsare based on the percentages: the higher the percentage, or the higher thenumber of days the percentage was reached, the higher the level of reward.Generally, the levels and rewards are determined once a week, although a dailyschedule may be needed for some students. Most teachers identify several behavioral levels for reinforcement. The levelsare defined in terms of privileges that the student earns. Privileges can beadjusted according to the student's interests. Level 1. Student's behavior is appropriate less than 80 percent of the time. No privileges. Student has no choice in activity or free time. Student maynot attend outside activities or field trips. Level 2. Student maintains appropriate behavior 80 percent of the time. Student may select art or music centers, manipulatives, computers, or otherfree-time activity. Student may attend outside activities and field trips. Level 3. Student maintains appropriate behavior 90 percent of the time. Privileges are the same as for Level 2, plus student may go to media center,run errands, or be a peer tutor. (from Phil Carlson, Palm Beach County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Another Level System Students "make their day" by earning a certain percentage of points. Once theymake ten days, students earn a reward (snack out of classroom school store).Students advance to the next level after earning ten days on the current level.They are also able to earn pro-social points for appropriate pro-socialbehaviors. Each pro-social point is worth $.05 which can be spent in theclassroom store. Individual point sheets are developed for each student with targeted short termobjectives from student's IEP. These sheets are updated every two months.This helps the teachers, aides, parents, and students stay focused on theinstructional objectives. Points are posted daily and discussed. Points aretallied daily and recorded on a point sheet that is sent home for parentsignature and returned the next day. (from Ann Campbell and Vicki Emo, Leon County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Token Economies Token economies are often used in connection with level systems for behaviormanagement. However, they can stand alone. Here are some examples ofeconomies that have worked in VE classes. Students earn play money for following classroom rules,participation, completing assignments, etc. Students may also be finedwhen rules are broken. If they don't have enough money to pay their fines,they receive chips from the teacher. The chips serve as an IOU. A red chipequals $1.00. A black chip equals $5.00. As students earn money later in theday or the week, a student must first pay off his/her fines. The classroombank is displayed on one bulletin board. "Baggies" are kept on this bulletinboard with students' names on them to hold deposits and IOU chips. Money canbe used to purchase items from classroom store which is displayed on anotherbulletin board. Money could also be used for classroom or department auctions,McDonald's Certificates, or earning privileges. (from M. Wolf, Marion County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] More Reward Systems More Reward Systems Students earn $20 of "good behavior money" for every 10 minutes theystay on task within the hour in the classroom. An activity period is allottedon Friday for good behavior money earned. Good behavior dollars are producedin neon colors in different currencies and bear the school logo. (from Nanette Standfast, Pinellas County) To promote a positive behavior management system, students are given anA,B,C certificate for good academics, behavior, or citizenship on whichthey write their names. At the end of class, students fold their awards inhalf and place them in a box. At least once a week a name is drawn from thebox. This lucky student can exchange the A,B,C certificate for a tangibleaward such as a small game, juice box, etc. The A,B,C certificates reinforcespecific behaviors immediately and give students an opportunity to be drawn asa chosen ticket. The more A,B,C certificates earned, the better the student'schances in the ticket drawing. (from Terri Partlow, Orange County) "Kind Acts and Good Deeds Jar" Students have 10 - 15 name cards in anenvelope at their desk. Whenever they do a kind act or good deed, they areallowed to place their name in the jar. This can also be used to rewardappropriate responses to bad situations. Whenever they do their best torespond to a negative situation in a positive manner, they whisper thesituation to the teacher and explain how they have tried to handle thesituation positively. Examples: ignoring rude comment, not hitting back afterbeing hit first, etc. The teacher then asks students to place their names inthe jar for positive behavior responses. Each Friday 3-5 names are selectedfrom the can for special recognition or reward. (from Trina Cassidy, Orange County) [Other Management Techniques] Information on Using Aides, Volunteers, and Peer Support is also available.

Many teachers are fortunateto have aides or paraprofessionals assigned to their classes. Some teachersuse the school volunteer program to lend a hand. Students can also be awelcome source of assistance to teachers. This section provides somerecommendations for ensuring success with assistants in the classroom. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Common Concerns Who's in charge? The most common problem faced when bringing aides andvolunteers into the classroom involves their authority. Often the students ina VE class do not respect the direction provided by someone other than theirteacher. VE teachers must show the students that aides and volunteers havetheir complete support. Recognition for Effort It is strongly suggested that aides, volunteersand peer support receive recognition on a regular basis. These individualsshould be reinforced for their efforts. They should know that their effortshave been valuable and have contributed to the development and progress of thechildren they have helped. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Teacher Aides Teacher aides are members of the instructional staff at the school. Somedistricts use different titles for this job, but generally the aide's job is toassist the teacher. Duties may include administrative and clerical tasks,arranging the classroom environment for learning, instruction-relatedresponsibilities, and supervisory activities with students. The teacher aide will need both knowledge and skill training to workeffectively in a VE classroom. The school district, often in collaborationwith the regional FDLRS center, can make training available to teacher aides.It is suggested that the aide be involved in an inservice training prior toworking with the students in VE classes. This training should involve a basicunderstanding of child growth and development and a general knowledge ofeducational approaches to learning. They will need to have an understanding ofthe basic causes and characteristics of handicapping conditions for studentswith whom they work. They must understand the purpose of IndividualEducational Plans and how they are developed and carried out. The specific duties of teacher aides varies from district to district. Certainrestrictions may be placed on the range of duties assigned based on the sourceof funding. If aides are paid from federal IDEA funds, they may not provideservices to students who are not eligible for exceptional student education,nor may they work with gifted students. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Volunteers Volunteers are recruited from the community to assist in classrooms. Mostdistricts and schools have an organized program to facilitate this effort.However, volunteer programs may not always be utilized in VE classes.Sometimes ESE teachers feel that volunteers may not be suited for theirprograms. This is certainly not true. What is needed, is volunteer selectionand preparation procedures that insures their awareness of the characteristicsof the students in VE classesand their readiness to respond appropriately. In many situations, volunteers may have duties that are similar to those of theteacher aides. However, they usually have not been specifically trained fortheir role and the time they have to spend in the classroom is generally morelimited. The volunteer may assist with preparing materials for the classroom,filing student work, and providing important personal contact with students. It is suggested that volunteers spend some time in the classroom beforecommitting to the job. Training is also recommended to prepare volunteers towork with the students appropriately. Where can volunteers be found? If you don't have a ready source of volunteers for your classroom, trythese sources: Church groups and service clubs in the community Business partnerships who provide release time for employees to serve asmentors and volunteers in school programs< Senior-citizen groups Community college and university training programs< [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Peer Support The use of students to provide assistance in the VE classroom benefits both theESE students and the student volunteers. In some districts, older studentsfrom nearby schools may earn credit by assisting in these classrooms. Peersupport can also involve students from within the VE classroom or from regulareducation classrooms in the school. The student assistant can provideinstructional assistance and be a positive social influence. Selection of Students for Peer Support Peer support students can be selected by an interest survey and teacherrecommendation. Some high school service clubs may be interested in sponsoringa student assistance program. It may be possible to recruit peer supportstudents from within the VE classroom. Older, more mature students can serveas respected role models. Students will need structure and training to serveeffectively as a peer support. The teacher should carefully select thesestudents. The factors that should be considered include reliability,compatibility, behavior, and willingness to make a commitment. The following are examples of peer support programs that teachers in Floridahave used. Reading Buddies Once a week ESE students meet with their reading buddies from first grade.Each pair or threesome take turns reading their book to the other students.This stimulates students' interest in reading as they have a direct, interestedaudience. (from Trina Cassidy, Orange County) Mentors for Visually Impaired Students Regular-education students are enrolled in a specially designed programto assist visually impaired students in the mainstream setting. As mentors,they help the vision teacher by working with visually impaired high schoolstudents and also travel to middle schools to provide reader services, largeprint work, graphic details, and personal life experiences. The regulareducation students earn credit for their work. Such a program can easily beadapted for all types of students with disabilities. (from Sandi Serventi, Leon County) Peer Facilitators for the ESE Reading Program A partnership between peer facilitators, ESE students, and teachers isestablished to assist in the ESE reading program. The peer facilitators arespecially chosen for patience, willingness, academic levels, character, anddependability and work under the supervision of the guidance counselor. ESEstudents are chosen by reading level, desire to improve, and basic need, andwork under the supervision of the ESE teacher. Peer facilitators and ESEstudents work together to practice reading skills and enhance readingabilities.

The same factors are used for placement in a VE class. This sectionprovides a brief description of the factors. These factors can be readilytranslated into guidelines appropriate to the specific use of the VE model in adistrict or school. What are the factors? At what level is the child currently functioning? Functional level/Curriculum Needs Review the child's level of achievement or functioning for all of the specific developmental domains, and academic or vocational areas. Use both standardized test scores and reports of classroom teachers. Only current test results that are considered to be a valid reflection of the child's achievement should be used to determine the functional level. Frequently, group-administered achievement tests do not accurately reflect the capabilities of exceptional students. Observations of classroom behavior and input from the child's current teachers can provide critical information. A review of both regular and special education classroom performance should be taken into account. Determine how well the student functions in a large group situation; how well the student can meet the demands of homework, independent assignments, and the social and behavioral expectations of the environment. Curriculum needs and Pupil-Progression Plan Determine if the child's needs are best met through the requirements of the regular pupil-progression plan or through the special pupil-progression plan for exceptional students. This will involve selecting the type of curriculum and, for secondary students, selecting the type of diploma. Generally, the academic curriculum has been effective for exceptional students who are considered high-functioning or mildly handicapped. The functional life-skills curriculum is generally selected for low functioning students. Medical needs/Physical Impairment Determine need for any support services for medical needs or accessibility requirements due to physical limitations. Behavior and Independence Consider the child's capacity for functioning independently in the school; review the child's history in terms of self-regulation and behavior control. Can a behavior management plan be reasonably implemented in the targeted setting? How will the child's behavior impact the others already in the classroom? Can the child make appropriate decisions independently? Is a crisis intervention teacher needed? Social Skills Determine the child's capacity for functioning in a social environment; review the child's relationships with peers and adults. Is a separate social skills class appropriate for the student? Long-range Career Plans For high school students, review career goals and objectives to determine appropriateness of secondary school placement. Parent and Student Input Input should be obtained from both parents and students regarding these factors. Both can provide information regarding their perceptions of the student's readiness for the proposed placement. What special services are needed? Related Services Determine if any related services are required. This may include counseling, medical services, or other educationally related services. Course Modifications Review the need for course modifications, including modifications to time, communication modes, instructional techniques, or assessment procedures. Determine if needed technology is available to support the performance of the student. Consider the use of the Mainstream Cost Factor to suport consultation between regular education and ESE teachers. Multiple Program Needs Consider the need for services from exceptional student education programs, such as speech, physical or occupational therapy, as well as other educational programs including Chapter 1, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), or vocational education. Transition Services For high school students, review transition plans. This may include involvement of other agencies, such as Developmental Services from Health and Rehabilitative Services, and Vocational Rehabilitation from the Department of Labor. What are the placement options? Least Restrictive Environment Select the most normal educational setting in which the exceptional student can profit from the instruction. To the maximum extent appropriate, exceptional students should be educated with nonexceptional students. Encourage attendance at the student's home school, if possible. Availability of Delivery Models Review the continuum of delivery models currently available in the district. Availability of Support Personnel Input may be obtained from the potential receiving teacher(s) and district staff. This should include a description of the delivery models and characteristics of students served in each. Information regarding the availability of curriculum and support services should be provided. Determine the ease of providing support personnel, if needed, in the targeted setting. [Staffing Consideration for Placement] [Table of Contents] Supporting the Placement of Students An important part of the placement decision made by the staffing committee isthe determination of the ongoing support needed to ensure the success of thestudent in the classroom. The student may require support in a variety ofareas. Does the student require any specialized equipment? Adaptive/Assistive Devices Generally provided to students with physical, visual, or hearing impairments. Augmentative Communication Devices Check with speech and language personnel for availability and appropriateness for individual students. Computerized Instructional Systems Determine if integrated learning system is appropriate and available. Electronic Determine if an electronic tool (word processor, draw program) is essential to student's performance. Are appropriate textbooks and other resource materials available? Braille or large-print materials Materials are available through Florida Instructional Materials Center and Division of Blind Services. Materials available through county textbook inventories Determine if supplementary texts can be provided through the district inventory. Also check the Florida Diagnostic Learning Resource Center for materials on loan. High interest/low vocabulary texts For students with low reading abilities, alternative textbooks might be needed. Check availability in other schools or on district inventory. Materials for developing specific skills or materials compatible with the regular curriculum should be sought. Hands-on/real life materials Authentic learning materials may be obtained from a variety of sources, including volunteer services, business partners, etc. These materials may be critical to meet vocational and occupational objectives. Learning centers Primarily used in elementary schools, learning centers may be shared among teachers or schools. Interactive activities These activities may include an affective curriculum designed to promote social skills and decision-making. Does the teacher have access to necessary information and skills to work with this student? Accessibility to student records Teachers should have access to the student records so that all appropriate information is made available. Parent input Open lines of communication must be maintained to ensure parent support. When parents have input into the process, they will be more likely to work in a partnership with the school. Staff development programs/Inservice training This may be provided through district level program specialists or resource teachers. A support system is needed to help teachers meet the increasing demands of their classrooms. FDLRS library/public library The availability of information through the library system is a real asset for the exceptional student teacher. Community Services Teachers must know how to reach community services including Deaf Services, Division of Blind Services, Job Training and Placement Agency, Vocational Rehabilitation, Florida Instructional Materials Center, Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Public Health Department, Social Services. Service Clubs For example, Sartoma, Lions Club, Kiwanis. SpecialNet, FIRN Electronic communication through SpecialNet or FIRN can open many networks to the exceptional student teacher. University personnel/programs Resources available in the university programs can be very helpful. Contact the special education department or other related areas for assistance. District school psychologist, social worker Information and skills can sometimes be provided through district level support personnel. [Staffing Consideration for Placement] [Table of Contents] Ongoing Review and Monitoring of Placement After a placement decision, provision should be made to allow members of thestaffing team to review a student's progress in the new setting within areasonable amount of time. This review may evaluate the appropriateness ofthe placement given the child's educational needs and the characteristics ofthe class in which the child is placed. Whenever requested, the staffing team may reconsider a placement decision andrecommend a more appropriate educational program. What procedures or guidelines are recommended? Periodic reviews need to be scheduled in order to maintain theeffectiveness of the delivery model. Reviews may occur as often as once a monthwith school-based personnel to discuss progress of the student. Parents need tobe included at all levels of review. Items for Review (Teacher Review) Updated academic information Classroom observations Social skills - appropriateness Behavior management plan If, at any time, the parents, the classroom teacher(s), or school-basedpersonnel feel the placement is not meeting the child's educational needs, astaffing review may be conducted. Additional testing may be warranted; supportservices or curriculum adjustments may be required; or a new IEP may beneeded. Who is responsible? The ESE teacher should accomplish these tasks: Review IEP and assess appropriateness of the plan. Conduct ongoing classroom observations. Conduct academic assessment. Review appropriateness of schedule. Consider motivational factors of the student. Monitor behavior of the student. Monitor attendance. Consult with mainstream teachers, if appropriate. Communicate with parents, if necessary. The mainstream teachers should accomplish these tasks: Review course modifications/adaptations. Monitor test scores and grades.< Identify the demands of the setting. Monitor classroom participation and behavior. Monitor attendance. Assess the appropriateness of the curriculum. The school administration and other support personnel should accomplishthese tasks: Provide support for the various VE delivery models. Support flexible, innovative instructional models. Assist with implementation of behavior management plans. Communicate with parents.< Follow procedural safeguards when placing students in programs. The district administration should accomplish these tasks: Review files for current information. Keep informed about the school situations. Conduct classroom observations, if requested. Be available for consultation, curriculum assessments, etc. The parents should share assessment of home situation, including: behavior at home and in the community social interaction with peers and siblings study habits< changes in routine after-school activities motivation change in career plans health problems. The exceptional student should accomplish these tasks: Share perceptions of the classroom situation. Monitor his or her own academic standing/progress in class. Assess satisfaction with the program. Interact appropriately with peers. Conduct career assessment or make future plans. Conducting Successful Annual IEP Reviews The following suggestions are provided to exceptional student educationteachers to help them prepare for successful IEP review meetings. Come with recommendations for proposed goals and objectives. Greet parents with a smile and tell them why you have called this meeting(i.e., to set educational goals for their student for the next year). Have all participating teachers make positive comments about the student'spast performance. Have each participating teacher explain the proposed goals for the student.Make sure the parents and student understand the goals and give them theopportunity to add others. If this is the first time the student's placement is in a VE setting, makesure parents are aware of the configuration of the classroom and the rationalefor placing their student in this setting. Listen carefully to what the parents and student are saying. Add additionalinformation, if appropriate. You may recommend strategies you have foundsuccessful that can be used at home. Express any concerns you have in a positive manner. Thank the parent and student for attending and end the conference with apositive comment about the student. Remember: Follow through on any promises that were made at the conference. (Adapted from VE Teacher's Handbook, Polk County, draft, 1993) [Staffing Consideration for Placement] [Table of Contents] Dealing with Parental Concerns The State Board of Education Rule requires parental notification when a studentis assigned to a VE class. Beyond that, there should be a close workingrelationship between the parents of an exceptional student and the teacher in avarying exceptionalities class. The parents should be informed about thecharacteristics of and the circumstances within the class, including the classsize, the functional levels of the students, and how this may relate to theprogress of the child. How can participation of the parents be encouraged? Frequent conferences should be held to discuss the student's progress, and theparent should always be requested to attend. Parents need an opportunity toshare their ideas and concerns with the school. If face-to-face conferencesare not possible, telephone conversations may be used. Stay away from writtencommunication only. Keep communication positive in nature. Keep parentsinformed about opportunities for participation in school activities. They maybe interested in attending group functions such as: Parent Information Night Field Trips PTO/PTA participation School Advisory Councils< Parent Advisory Councils Here's a program that works to keep parents involved in the instruction of their children. Call the parents of each student in the class at least once beforeThanksgiving. By dividing up the students by class periods, all parents can becontacted within a 3-5 day period. If a student has no phone, use a handwrittenletter to communicate. The calls concentrate on the child's strengths. Theteacher asks about the student's interests, hobbies and specialaccomplishments. Areas for improvement are then discussed. Parents can makeexcellent suggestions and certainly appreciate the communication. Laying thepositive background makes it much easier to deal with concerns that mightoccur. (from Doris Wayte, Pinellas County) How can parents' concerns about the varying exceptionalities class beaddressed? Invite the parents to visit the VE classroom. Encourage parents to spend time talking about the class with the students andthe teacher. Encourage the parent to talk with other parents of students already in theclass. Make all curriculum materials available for parental review.< Create brochures explaining the different types of delivery models. Present various delivery models at the parent support group meetings tofoster a smooth working relationship with parents. Create a parent library. Ask the parent to serve as a volunteer. Suggest that they seek advice from local or state parent support groups. Refer them to the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Students/ClearinghouseInformation Center or their local FDLRS center for resources and information.

Over the past 20 years, theuse of the varying exceptionalities delivery model has increased. Various taskforces have been formed to examine the issues and concerns and to recommendpractices and policies to ensure appropriate uses of the model. In 1991, representatives from the Florida Teaching Profession/NationalEducation Association (FTP/NEA) urged the Department of Education to review thecurrent policies and practices. Surveys and interviews were used to gatherinput from VE teachers from 17 school districts over two years. This manual, Resources for VE Teachers, was developed at therecommendations of the advisory group formed in response to the FTP/NEAinquiry. It is intended to provide information about the use of the VE modelin Florida and to share classroom practices that teachers have found to besuccessful. In Fall, 1992, VE teachers were asked to submit ideas forinclusion in this manual. The members of the writing team that met in Spring,1993. provided valuable input and insight into the contents of this manual andtheir special contributions are gratefully acknowledged. Debbie Houston,Program Specialist in the Bureau for Education of Exceptional Students, and hersecretary, Myra Orange, also deserve recognition for their facilitation of thisentire effort.

The first section, General Information, includes the definition andState Board of Education rules which apply to the model, as well as briefdescriptions on the history and rationale. The second section, Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Model, providesexamples of guidelines and policies which have been developed in variousschool districts for programs at the prekindergarten, elementary, middle, andhigh school level. Recommendations from previous task forces are summarized inthe description of "Best Practices." The third section, Effective Practices in Varying Exceptionalities Classes, is intended to share the practices that many teachers have found to beeffective in meeting the diversity of student needs. This includes a briefdescription of the characteristics of exceptional students, and suggestionsfor scheduling, grouping, and managing the educational environment. Inresponse to the many concerns raised by VE teachers, information is alsoincluded on managing behavior and using assistants in the classroom. The fourth section, Staffing Considerations for Placement in VaryingExceptionalities Classes, is designed to guide the staffing process. Keyquestions and sources of information can be used by teachers to make sure thatall important factors are considered. The fifth section, Support for Teachers, is intended to help teachersaccess support at both the state and district level. The information for thedistrict level should be added to the appropriate spaces.

State Board of Education Rule Certification Requirements for Teachers The use of the varying exceptionalities class as a delivery model forexceptional student education has a long history in the State of Florida.Currently, teachers of this class comprise the largest group of teachers inexceptional student education classes in this state. The model providesflexibility that enables districts to ignore categorical lines when servingexceptional students who have similar needs. Definition Varying Exceptionalities (VE) Classes: The setting that provides for the assignment of students of more than one exceptionality to one teacher per instructional class period, or more than one exceptionality to one teacher during the school week. Categories of Exceptionalities: For purposes of defining a varying exceptionalities class, the following categories of exceptionalities may becombined: Specific Learning Disabilities Mentally Handicapped (Educable Mentally Handicapped; Trainable Mentally Handicapped; and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped) Emotionally Handicapped (Emotionally Handicapped and Severely Emotionally Disturbed) Physically Impaired Speech and Language Impaired Visually Impaired Hearing Impaired Gifted Profound (including Autistic; Deaf-Blind; Profoundly Mentally Handicapped;and Severely Emotionally Disturbed) Please note that each school district determines which exceptionalities may beserved in a varying exceptionalities class. The list above indicates thatcertain categories of exceptional students may be grouped in classes that arenot considered to be varying exceptionalities classes. For example, ifemotionally handicapped and severely emotionally disturbed students are in thesame class, this class is not designated as varying exceptionalities. [General Information] [Table of Contents] History of the Varying Exceptionalities Model 1947 Rule established. "Where it is not practical nor feasible because of toofew pupils to assign special teachers for each type of exceptional child, combination units will be approved." (Concept deleted a short time later.) 1962 Rule revised. "Varying exceptionalities -- For the employment of a teacher to serve children with varying exceptionalities as defined in these regulations in rural and sparsely populated areas, one unit may be allowed." (Rule repealed in 1974 with the adoption of the Florida Education Finance Program.) 1970s Use of VE model increases somewhat as a result of school-basedmanagement, implementation of PL 94-142 and the concept of least restrictiveenvironment, and the high cost of transportation. 1980-81 Task Force on Varying Exceptionalities. Responding to arequest of the internal auditors, the task force met and made recommendationsregarding definition, class composition, and teacher competencies to beincorporated into State Board of Education Rules. 1980s VE use doubles with increased populations and changes in secondaryrequirements. 1985-86 Subcommittee on Varying Exceptionalities (State AdvisoryCommittee). Site visits were made to 12 districts, and VE teachers weresurveyed to identify issues related to the use of the VE model.Recommendations were made regarding the composition and organization of theclass, placement decisions, class size, support services, and teachercompetencies. 1986-87 Task Force on the Education of Exceptional Students (VaryingExceptionalities). As a result of issues raised by teacher organizationsand the Florida Association for Children with Learning Disabilities (FACLD), alegislative task force was convened. Recommendations were made regardingcertification requirements; VE class size, composition, and staffing patterns;parent involvement; and general policies. In addition, nine best practiceswere identified to assist districts. 1990s VE use increases. Prekindergarten programs increase and show preferencefor a VE model. 1991-93 Varying Exceptionalities Advisory Committee. At the urging ofthe Florida Teaching Profession/National Education Association (FTP/NEA), theBureau of Education for Exceptional Students funded a study to look at the useof the VE model in 17 districts and established an advisory committee. Theresults of the study were widely disseminated and a resource manual for VEteachers was developed. [General Information] [Table of Contents] Why Use the Varying Exceptionalities Model?Enables ESE students to be served in their home schools. Serving ESE students in the least restrictive environment requires thatconsideration be given to providing the services in the school that the childwould normally attend. Allows ESE students to be grouped by program or curricular needs. A VE model facilitates the grouping of students according to theirprogram or curriculum needs. For example, in some districts, a VE model isused to provide programs for students on Special Pupil Progression Plans. Inother districts, a VE model is used for the students in resource classes whoare served in ESE on a part-time basis. When a school has more than one ESE teacher, the use of a VE model allows thechildren to be grouped by age as well as curriculum needs. Thus, an elementaryschool may be able to staff both primary and intermediate units. A VE modelmay also be used where the majority of students are the same exceptionality andonly a few children have a different classification. Many school districtsdetermine the number of teaching units allocated to a school based on thenumber of ESE students and the FTE generated by them, and allow the teachers atthe school to determine how the students will be grouped in classes. Provides flexibility in providing services for small populations of ESE students. In addition to the options described above, a VE model provides for ESEstudents in low prevalence categories. Students with physical impairments ormild sensory impairments often can be appropriately served in a VE model. Focuses the educational program on the individual needs of the students,rather than on the label of the child. The flexibility associated with the use of a VE model can be seen as an assetwhen providing appropriate programs for exceptional students. When parentswant their child to be served in the neighborhood school, a VE model can beused to accommodate that preference. ESE teachers in secondary schools can usethe model to departmentalize and group students by functional levels. While a VE model sometimes carries a reputation as being a "dumping ground," infact, it can remove artificial barriers. What is important, however, isthat the program provided in a VE model have an identity, i.e., a clear senseof purpose. Whether a VE model is seen as the program for special diplomastudents at the high school, the prekindergarten program for high functioningstudents, or the program at the elementary school that enables all of theexceptional students to attend their neighborhood school, the teachers in VEclasses need to understand and support the purposes of their programs. [General Information] [Table of Contents] State Board of Education Rule In 1983, Rule 6A-6.0311, Florida Adminstrative Code, (FAC), Special Programsand Procedures for Exceptional Students, was amended to include requirementsfor varying exceptionalities classes. (3) Varying Exceptionalties. If a school district elects to use a varyingexceptionalities class, it shall be used only to a limited extent in order toprovide special programs for exceptional students. (a) A varying exceptionalities class is the setting which may provide forassignment of students of more than one (1) exceptionality to one (1) teacherper instructional class period, or more than one (1) exceptionality to one (1)teacher during the school week. (b) If a school district establishes varying exceptionalities classes,procedures for the program shall be set forth in district procedures asrequired by Rule 6A-6.0311, FAC. (c) Eligible exceptional students served in varying exceptionalities classesshall be reported for full-time equivalent membership in accordance with Rule6A-6.1.451(7)(8), FAC. (d) Parents shall be notified, as provided in Rule 6A-6.0311, FAC, when thestudent is assigned to a varying exceptionalities class with otherexceptionalities. [General Information] [Table of Contents] Certification Requirements for Teachers The required certification for teachers in VE classes is identified annually inthe Course Code Directory. Teachers in VE classes must have one of thefollowing certification areas: Varying Exceptionalities Specific Learning Disabilities Mentally Handicapped Emotionally Handicapped. The requirements for the Varying Exceptionalities certification have recentlybeen revised and became effective July 1, 1992. They are as follows: A bachelor's or higher degree with a major in exceptional student educationwhich includes courses in the instructional strategies for emotionallyhandicapped, mentally handicapped, and specific learning disabilities. or A bachelor's or higher degree with thirty six (36) semester hours inexceptional student education including the following areas: Foundations of exceptional student education Language development and disorders Assessment of exceptional students Educational management Teaching social and personal skills Methods and materials for teaching reading Teaching skills and concepts of mathematics Methods and content for teaching language arts Characteristics of mildly handicapped students (EH, EMH, SLD) Instructional strategies for teaching students who are mentally handicapped Instructional strategies for teaching students who are emotionally handicapped Instructional strategies for teaching students with specific learning disabilities In addition, teachers already certified in the areas of mentally handicapped,specific learning disabilities, emotionally handicapped, or physicallyimpaired, may qualify for VE certification by adding the appropriate additionalrequirements in terms of the characteristics and instructional strategiescourses specified in the last section.

In 1986-87, the Task Force on Educationof Exceptional Students (Varying Exceptionalities) developed a list of bestpractices to assist districts. Recent surveys of VE teachers have indicatedthat the majority of teachers feel that these best practices are beingimplemented in school districts. 1. A VE model should be used for specific educationalprograms. The Task Force recommended that a VE model may be best utilized at theprekindergarten or high school level. Districts have found a VE modeleffective for programs such as community-based instruction, vocationalprograms, and special diploma programs. 2. A VE model is best utilized for classes and programs where students havemore common curricular needs. The class size, composition, and educational demands must be taken intoaccount when using a VE model at any level. Consideration of the behavior andacademic functioning of students will be critical to the successful use of a VEmodel. 3. Prior to a student's placement in the VE delivery model, thepotential receiving teacher(s) should have the opportunity to observe the childin his or her current educational setting or to become familiar with thechild's educational needs. This may include access to the student's records, phone conferences, orother methods of communication when direct observation is not possible. Whenthe receiving teacher is well-informed about the needs of the new student,support services and other accommodations can be provided. 4. After a student is placed in a VE class, the appropriateness of theplacement is reviewed within a reasonable amount of time or wheneverrequested. Monitoring the effectiveness of a student's placement should be anongoing process. The review may evaluate the appropriateness of the placement,given the child's educational needs. Whenever requested, the staffing team mayreconsider a placement decision and recommend a more appropriate educationalprogram. 5. To the extent possible, full-time and part-time students should be servedin separate classes. Consideration must be made regarding the educational impact ofcombining self-contained students with part-time resource students, who enterand exit the classroom at differing times during the course of the schoolday. 6. Instructional aides are provided as needed. These may include volunteerassistants as well as paid paraprofessionals. Teachers need to understand the district policies and procedures forproviding teacher aides. In addition, participation in the school volunteerprogram can be a ready source of help. 7. Adequate supplies are provided within existing guidelines to maintain thequality of the program. In districts where money for supplies is managed at the school level,the ESE teachers should become a part of the decision making team. 8. Adequate support services are provided within district guidelines tomaintain the quality of the program. Support services should include administrative assistance and relatedservice personnel, including school psychologists and social workers. 9. Parents are well informed about the circumstances in the VE class. There should be a close working relationship between the parents of anESE student in a VE class and the VE teacher. The parents should be aware ofthe characteristics of the class (e.g., class size, functional levels of thestudents, etc.) and the availability of support and appropriate services fortheir child. 10. School or district administrative staff monitor the effectiveness of theprogram for students on an individual basis. The effectiveness of a VE delivery model should be evaluated by lookingat key indicators such as the accomplishments of the students, discipline,participation in the mainstream, etc. [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Sample District Guidelines for Varying Exceptionalities Local school districts determine how a VE model is to be used to deliverexceptional student education programs. In small districts, due to the smallnumber of students, a VE model may be used to provide a wide range of services.In middle and large-sized districts in Florida, a VE model may be used eitherbroadly or only for specific programs or populations. District policy andphilosophy determine the particular application. In VE classes that are seen as successful, students are grouped according tosimilar academic and behavior functioning and needs. Effective teachers in aVE model will need to have a strong curriculum background and will also need tobe well-organized, open-minded, flexible, and creative. They must be able topresent knowledge and skills from many different perspectives. The descriptions in this section are provided as illustrations of the ways thatdistricts have elected to use a VE model in the prekindergarten, elementary,middle, and secondary programs. Recommendations regarding thecharacteristics of children, provision of aides, or pupil/teacher ratio areincluded only as guidelines and are not intended to serve as requirements orofficial state policy. The districts that provided the guidelines are named atthe end of the descriptions. [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Prekindergarten Programs The primary purpose for using the VE model in the prekindergarten program is tokeep students as close to home as possible. This eliminates long bus rides andprovision of services on an itinerant basis. The model provides more costeffective services. Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Students can be grouped by ability or functioning level, rather thanexceptionality. Prekindergarten children can be exposed to better role modelsin skill areas which may not be their strengths. They more readily developsocial and language skills from interaction with their peers. Children who are 3-5 years of age and developmentally delayed are oftenconsidered for placement in a VE model. The disability of the child may bedirectly interfering with social interaction, and the child may need to be in aprogram with children of his or her own age. The family may benefit fromparent training provided along with the program for the child. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 8:1 with a full-time paraprofessional or aide isconsidered best practice for students in this age group. The class size shouldalso consider the needs of the students. Students who require a great deal ofcare and personal support will need to be placed in classes with an evensmaller pupil/teacher ratio or additional teacher aides. The classroom program should be staffed by a teacher who is certified inexceptional student education or early childhood education (as indicated in theCourse Code Directory). Speech/language pathologists, physical therapists, oroccupational therapists should provide programs and services for children asappropriate. The school psychologists and social worker may serve in anevaluative and consultative capacity and assist parents in accessing localagencies, if needed. Program Planned activities are designed to increase functional skills in all sixdevelopmental areas: fine motor, gross motor, language, cognitive, self-care,and social skills. Skill development is encouraged throughmulti-sensory-stimulation and activities such as dressing, pre-speech andfeeding, use of music to facilitate language and movement, and manipulation ofmaterials for improvement of fine motor skills. An interdisciplinary teamapproach is used in the classroom to support the goals and objectivesformulated in the Individual Educational Plan (IEP) of each child. (from Manatee County Guidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Elementary School Resource Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Children are grouped in a VE class with other children who have comparableneeds. They may exhibit delays in individual areas such as language arts,reading, math, motor skills, and social and personal behaviors. These studentsare mainstreamed for the majority of the school day, and the VE class serves toprovide intervention in the area of the child's greatest need and to providesupport to successful performance in the mainstream class. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff For a resource room, the number of students will be based on the number ofhours each student is seen. In most cases, 20-30 students can be served in aresource room. Sometimes additional students who are fully mainstreamed areassigned to the ESE teacher for consultation services only. Each district setsthe caseload requirements for a teaching unit, and actual numbers of studentsvary considerably from these recommendations. Support services are availablefrom the Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resources System (FDLRS), programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Program The schedule in a VE class is determined according to the particular needs ofthe students assigned to the class and must be arranged to accommodate the theschedule of the mainstream classes. In some schools, the VE teacher is using ateam teaching model to provide services in the context of the regularclassroom. Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of themainstreaming experience of all ESE students. Through this model, exceptionaleducation teachers and basic or vocational education teachers join together toplan needed support and accommodations for exceptional students in mainstreamclasses. Through regular conferences and monitoring, the likelihood of successof the student is greatly enhanced. This is particularly critical at the startof a new school year or when the ESE students are first being included inmainstream programs. (from Polk County Guidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Elementary School Self-Contained Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Children are grouped in a VE class with other children who have comparableneeds. They may exhibit delays in multiple areas such as language arts,reading, math, motor skills, and social and personal behaviors. Participationin mainstream classes is generally limited to art, music, and physicaleducation for most students. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff For a self-contained class, a 12:1 pupil/teacher ratio with a full-time aideor paraprofessional is considered best practice for students in this age group.Support services are available from FDLRS, program supervisors, schoolpsychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel and curriculumresource personnel in the school. Program The schedule is determined based on the functioning levels and subject areasneeds of the students as well as the scheduling of students for mainstreamclasses. In many programs, ESE students participate in the music, art, andphysical education programs with their chronological peers. In schools with more than one ESE unit, students can be grouped by age range orby program needs. Teachers generally feel that emotionally handicappedstudents who require full-time services should be placed together. (Polk CountyGuidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Middle School Resource Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model This program is usually designed for mildly handicapped students who do notrequire services in all academic areas or intensive related services or therapyfor behavior or emotional handicaps. Middle school programs are departmentalized or organized by grade level teams.Students typically receive instruction from a number of different teachers,including those in the exploratory subjects. The VE teacher may provideinstruction in basic academic classes such as English and mathematics, butgenerally the content areas and special areas are taken in the mainstream forstudents in resource programs. If the school has sufficient students and ESEteachers, faculty assignments may be made by subject area specialization or tograde level teams. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Aides and volunteers may be essentialif the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personalattention. Support services should be available from FDLRS, programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Program The schedule is organized by grade level, subject area, and in some subjects,by functional level. The number of VE teachers in the school will affect theflexibility of the scheduling. In middle schools with grade level teams, VE teachers are sometimes organizedas a separate department, and students are scheduled in their classes on apull-out basis. Other middle schools have found success with placing the VEteacher on one of the teams and enrolling the ESE students on that team. Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of themainstreaming experience of all ESE students. (See Elementary School:Resource Programs for a description of Cooperative Consultation.) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] Middle School Self-Contained Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model This program is usually designed for exceptional students who require servicesin the major academic areas and may need some related services or intensivetherapy. Students in self-contained programs are taught the academic content areas inVE classes. If the school has sufficient students and ESE teachers, facultyassignments may be by subject area specialization within the ESE department.Students may be mainstreamed for art, music, physical education and vocationalexploration. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Aides and volunteers may be essentialif the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personalattention. Support services should be available from FDLRS, programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Program The schedule is generally organized by grade level, subject area, and in somesubjects, by functional level. If there is only one self-contained unit in amiddle school, the content area subjects may rotate on a three year cycle, toschedule the courses more efficiently. The number of VE teachers in the schoolwill affect the flexibility of the scheduling. [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] High School Resource Programs Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model This program is designed for mildly handicapped students who are served on aresource basis and do not require intensive related services or therapy. High school programs are usually departmentalized. Students receiveinstruction from a number of different teachers. The VE teacher may provideinstruction in basic classes such as English and mathematics, or in supportareas such as learning strategies, social skills or unique skills. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Support services should be availablefrom FDLRS, program supervisors, school psychologists, social workers, schoolguidance personnel, and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Jobplacement specialists and vocational education services are an important aspectof the high school program. Because of the needs for transition services,other agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation may become involved at thislevel. Program The schedule is generally organized by grade level, subject area, and in somesubjects, by functional level. Team teaching has been used successfully inmany districts to support ESE students in mainstream classes. In this model,the ESE teacher and the mainstream teacher work as a team to deliver a class. Cooperative Consultation (Reigel, 1988) can enhance the success of themainstreaming experience of all ESE students. (See Elementary School Programs:Resource Programs for a description of Cooperative Consultation.) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] High School Self-Contained Programs for Special Diplomas The exceptional students who require full-time placement at the high schoollevel in many districts are those who are working towards a special diploma.The full-time students would receive credit in VE classes to meet therequirements of a special diploma. Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Districts may establish guidelines to assist in the recommendation ofexceptional students for participation in a functional life skills curriculumand a special diploma. Low academic levels, particularly low reading ability,are commonly used indicators. In some districts, this determination is made as a part of the eighth gradeplanning process. The district program specialist may review recommendedstudents with teachers and other school personnel. The parent and students mayparticipate in an IEP review in the spring to make the actual decisions. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class period is considered bestpractice for students in this age group. Aides and volunteers may be essentialif the class sizes are large or if the students need a lot of personalattention. Support services should be available from FDLRS, programsupervisors, school psychologists, social workers, school guidance personnel,and curriculum resource personnel in the school. Most special-diploma-seekingstudents should be involved with a vocational program. Because of the needsfor transition services, other agencies such as Vocational Rehabilitation maybecome involved at this level. Program The functional life skills curriculum emphasizes career awareness, socialskills, and pre-employment habits and attitudes necessary for successful workadjustment. Basic skills and problem-solving techniques are presented in areal-life context to prepare students to function independently as adults. (from Palm Beach County Guidelines) [Uses of the Varying Exceptionalities Mode] [Table of Contents] High School Vocational Education Programs The purpose of vocational programs at the high school level is to enablestudents to develop the ability to communicate appropriately with peers andadults, to demonstrate the skills and attitudes essential for employment, andto help students set realistic career goals. Students are involved in jobpreparatory programs to develop specific occupational skills. Characteristics of Students Who Are Served in This Model Students should enroll in vocational programs based on their interest andaptitude. Work experience may be provided either on or off campus. ESEstudents may enroll in regular vocational programs or in specially designedprograms. The VE class generally serves to support the academic and jobtraining requirements of the program. Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Support Staff A pupil/teacher ratio of 12 students per class is conisdered best practice forstudents in this age group. Occupational specialists, vocationalrehabilitation counselors, and ESE specialists and evaluators are needed tosupport this program. For more severely disabled students, job coaches may berequired. Program The program is organized to support the course needs to meet graduation andvocational program requirements. The student's work schedule may occur duringthe school day or may be arranged in off hours. Districts may provide thevocational program through the offerings at a comprehensive high school or inan area vocational-technical program.

The same factors are used for placement in a VE class. This sectionprovides a brief description of the factors. These factors can be readilytranslated into guidelines appropriate to the specific use of the VE model in adistrict or school. What are the factors? At what level is the child currently functioning? Functional level/Curriculum Needs Review the child's level of achievement or functioning for all of the specific developmental domains, and academic or vocational areas. Use both standardized test scores and reports of classroom teachers. Only current test results that are considered to be a valid reflection of the child's achievement should be used to determine the functional level. Frequently, group-administered achievement tests do not accurately reflect the capabilities of exceptional students. Observations of classroom behavior and input from the child's current teachers can provide critical information. A review of both regular and special education classroom performance should be taken into account. Determine how well the student functions in a large group situation; how well the student can meet the demands of homework, independent assignments, and the social and behavioral expectations of the environment. Curriculum needs and Pupil-Progression Plan Determine if the child's needs are best met through the requirements of the regular pupil-progression plan or through the special pupil-progression plan for exceptional students. This will involve selecting the type of curriculum and, for secondary students, selecting the type of diploma. Generally, the academic curriculum has been effective for exceptional students who are considered high-functioning or mildly handicapped. The functional life-skills curriculum is generally selected for low functioning students. Medical needs/Physical Impairment Determine need for any support services for medical needs or accessibility requirements due to physical limitations. Behavior and Independence Consider the child's capacity for functioning independently in the school; review the child's history in terms of self-regulation and behavior control. Can a behavior management plan be reasonably implemented in the targeted setting? How will the child's behavior impact the others already in the classroom? Can the child make appropriate decisions independently? Is a crisis intervention teacher needed? Social Skills Determine the child's capacity for functioning in a social environment; review the child's relationships with peers and adults. Is a separate social skills class appropriate for the student? Long-range Career Plans For high school students, review career goals and objectives to determine appropriateness of secondary school placement. Parent and Student Input Input should be obtained from both parents and students regarding these factors. Both can provide information regarding their perceptions of the student's readiness for the proposed placement. What special services are needed? Related Services Determine if any related services are required. This may include counseling, medical services, or other educationally related services. Course Modifications Review the need for course modifications, including modifications to time, communication modes, instructional techniques, or assessment procedures. Determine if needed technology is available to support the performance of the student. Consider the use of the Mainstream Cost Factor to suport consultation between regular education and ESE teachers. Multiple Program Needs Consider the need for services from exceptional student education programs, such as speech, physical or occupational therapy, as well as other educational programs including Chapter 1, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), or vocational education. Transition Services For high school students, review transition plans. This may include involvement of other agencies, such as Developmental Services from Health and Rehabilitative Services, and Vocational Rehabilitation from the Department of Labor. What are the placement options? Least Restrictive Environment Select the most normal educational setting in which the exceptional student can profit from the instruction. To the maximum extent appropriate, exceptional students should be educated with nonexceptional students. Encourage attendance at the student's home school, if possible. Availability of Delivery Models Review the continuum of delivery models currently available in the district. Availability of Support Personnel Input may be obtained from the potential receiving teacher(s) and district staff. This should include a description of the delivery models and characteristics of students served in each. Information regarding the availability of curriculum and support services should be provided. Determine the ease of providing support personnel, if needed, in the targeted setting. [Staffing Consideration for Placement] [Table of Contents] Supporting the Placement of Students An important part of the placement decision made by the staffing committee isthe determination of the ongoing support needed to ensure the success of thestudent in the classroom. The student may require support in a variety ofareas. Does the student require any specialized equipment? Adaptive/Assistive Devices Generally provided to students with physical, visual, or hearing impairments. Augmentative Communication Devices Check with speech and language personnel for availability and appropriateness for individual students. Computerized Instructional Systems Determine if integrated learning system is appropriate and available. Electronic Determine if an electronic tool (word processor, draw program) is essential to student's performance. Are appropriate textbooks and other resource materials available? Braille or large-print materials Materials are available through Florida Instructional Materials Center and Division of Blind Services. Materials available through county textbook inventories Determine if supplementary texts can be provided through the district inventory. Also check the Florida Diagnostic Learning Resource Center for materials on loan. High interest/low vocabulary texts For students with low reading abilities, alternative textbooks might be needed. Check availability in other schools or on district inventory. Materials for developing specific skills or materials compatible with the regular curriculum should be sought. Hands-on/real life materials Authentic learning materials may be obtained from a variety of sources, including volunteer services, business partners, etc. These materials may be critical to meet vocational and occupational objectives. Learning centers Primarily used in elementary schools, learning centers may be shared among teachers or schools. Interactive activities These activities may include an affective curriculum designed to promote social skills and decision-making. Does the teacher have access to necessary information and skills to work with this student? Accessibility to student records Teachers should have access to the student records so that all appropriate information is made available. Parent input Open lines of communication must be maintained to ensure parent support. When parents have input into the process, they will be more likely to work in a partnership with the school. Staff development programs/Inservice training This may be provided through district level program specialists or resource teachers. A support system is needed to help teachers meet the increasing demands of their classrooms. FDLRS library/public library The availability of information through the library system is a real asset for the exceptional student teacher. Community Services Teachers must know how to reach community services including Deaf Services, Division of Blind Services, Job Training and Placement Agency, Vocational Rehabilitation, Florida Instructional Materials Center, Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Public Health Department, Social Services. Service Clubs For example, Sartoma, Lions Club, Kiwanis. SpecialNet, FIRN Electronic communication through SpecialNet or FIRN can open many networks to the exceptional student teacher. University personnel/programs Resources available in the university programs can be very helpful. Contact the special education department or other related areas for assistance. District school psychologist, social worker Information and skills can sometimes be provided through district level support personnel. [Staffing Consideration for Placement] [Table of Contents] Ongoing Review and Monitoring of Placement After a placement decision, provision should be made to allow members of thestaffing team to review a student's progress in the new setting within areasonable amount of time. This review may evaluate the appropriateness ofthe placement given the child's educational needs and the characteristics ofthe class in which the child is placed. Whenever requested, the staffing team may reconsider a placement decision andrecommend a more appropriate educational program. What procedures or guidelines are recommended? Periodic reviews need to be scheduled in order to maintain theeffectiveness of the delivery model. Reviews may occur as often as once a monthwith school-based personnel to discuss progress of the student. Parents need tobe included at all levels of review. Items for Review (Teacher Review) Updated academic information Classroom observations Social skills - appropriateness Behavior management plan If, at any time, the parents, the classroom teacher(s), or school-basedpersonnel feel the placement is not meeting the child's educational needs, astaffing review may be conducted. Additional testing may be warranted; supportservices or curriculum adjustments may be required; or a new IEP may beneeded. Who is responsible? The ESE teacher should accomplish these tasks: Review IEP and assess appropriateness of the plan. Conduct ongoing classroom observations. Conduct academic assessment. Review appropriateness of schedule. Consider motivational factors of the student. Monitor behavior of the student. Monitor attendance. Consult with mainstream teachers, if appropriate. Communicate with parents, if necessary. The mainstream teachers should accomplish these tasks: Review course modifications/adaptations. Monitor test scores and grades.< Identify the demands of the setting. Monitor classroom participation and behavior. Monitor attendance. Assess the appropriateness of the curriculum. The school administration and other support personnel should accomplishthese tasks: Provide support for the various VE delivery models. Support flexible, innovative instructional models. Assist with implementation of behavior management plans. Communicate with parents.< Follow procedural safeguards when placing students in programs. The district administration should accomplish these tasks: Review files for current information. Keep informed about the school situations. Conduct classroom observations, if requested. Be available for consultation, curriculum assessments, etc. The parents should share assessment of home situation, including: behavior at home and in the community social interaction with peers and siblings study habits< changes in routine after-school activities motivation change in career plans health problems. The exceptional student should accomplish these tasks: Share perceptions of the classroom situation. Monitor his or her own academic standing/progress in class. Assess satisfaction with the program. Interact appropriately with peers. Conduct career assessment or make future plans. Conducting Successful Annual IEP Reviews The following suggestions are provided to exceptional student educationteachers to help them prepare for successful IEP review meetings. Come with recommendations for proposed goals and objectives. Greet parents with a smile and tell them why you have called this meeting(i.e., to set educational goals for their student for the next year). Have all participating teachers make positive comments about the student'spast performance. Have each participating teacher explain the proposed goals for the student.Make sure the parents and student understand the goals and give them theopportunity to add others. If this is the first time the student's placement is in a VE setting, makesure parents are aware of the configuration of the classroom and the rationalefor placing their student in this setting. Listen carefully to what the parents and student are saying. Add additionalinformation, if appropriate. You may recommend strategies you have foundsuccessful that can be used at home. Express any concerns you have in a positive manner. Thank the parent and student for attending and end the conference with apositive comment about the student. Remember: Follow through on any promises that were made at the conference. (Adapted from VE Teacher's Handbook, Polk County, draft, 1993) [Staffing Consideration for Placement] [Table of Contents] Dealing with Parental Concerns The State Board of Education Rule requires parental notification when a studentis assigned to a VE class. Beyond that, there should be a close workingrelationship between the parents of an exceptional student and the teacher in avarying exceptionalities class. The parents should be informed about thecharacteristics of and the circumstances within the class, including the classsize, the functional levels of the students, and how this may relate to theprogress of the child. How can participation of the parents be encouraged? Frequent conferences should be held to discuss the student's progress, and theparent should always be requested to attend. Parents need an opportunity toshare their ideas and concerns with the school. If face-to-face conferencesare not possible, telephone conversations may be used. Stay away from writtencommunication only. Keep communication positive in nature. Keep parentsinformed about opportunities for participation in school activities. They maybe interested in attending group functions such as: Parent Information Night Field Trips PTO/PTA participation School Advisory Councils< Parent Advisory Councils Here's a program that works to keep parents involved in the instruction of their children. Call the parents of each student in the class at least once beforeThanksgiving. By dividing up the students by class periods, all parents can becontacted within a 3-5 day period. If a student has no phone, use a handwrittenletter to communicate. The calls concentrate on the child's strengths. Theteacher asks about the student's interests, hobbies and specialaccomplishments. Areas for improvement are then discussed. Parents can makeexcellent suggestions and certainly appreciate the communication. Laying thepositive background makes it much easier to deal with concerns that mightoccur. (from Doris Wayte, Pinellas County) How can parents' concerns about the varying exceptionalities class beaddressed? Invite the parents to visit the VE classroom. Encourage parents to spend time talking about the class with the students andthe teacher. Encourage the parent to talk with other parents of students already in theclass. Make all curriculum materials available for parental review.< Create brochures explaining the different types of delivery models. Present various delivery models at the parent support group meetings tofoster a smooth working relationship with parents. Create a parent library. Ask the parent to serve as a volunteer. Suggest that they seek advice from local or state parent support groups. Refer them to the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Students/ClearinghouseInformation Center or their local FDLRS center for resources and information.

By placing dividers about every 12 inches, bookscan be easily put into the "cubbyholes." Use plastic colored tape to code thebooks by level or by subject area, so that matching their storage locations iseasy. This same coding system could be used in other ways, perhaps to identifymaterials for individual students. Workbooks with soft covers will survive longer if placed in plastic reportcovers or if their covers are laminated. Some report folders have a clearfront and solid back with a three-ring holder. Have three holes drilled in theworkbooks so that they can be inserted in the folders easily. Books that are not currently needed are best stored out of the classroom. Itmay be possible to find a colleague who needs them. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Filing Worksheets Having access to a variety of worksheets can save the VE teacher a lotof time. But the key time-saver is having a system for filing so that theworksheets can easily be retrieved. Here's a system that works! Collect all loose worksheets and place all duplicate copies together inindividual files. Take the original or best copy of each and number itsequentially, so that each unique worksheet has a different number and there isa numbered corresponding file folder with the duplicates. The originals can then be sorted by topic or skill and placed in three ringnotebooks. You will have notebooks of worksheets for math skills, spellingpractice lessons, science concepts, etc. that you can scan easily to find justthe right one. With the numbering system, you can go to your files and, bymatching the number, locate enough copies of the worksheets for yourstudents. If you find that a worksheet fits in more than one category, just make enough"originals" to place it in all appropriate notebooks. If you are concernedabout putting holes in your originals to place them in the notebooks, put themin the plastic sleeves that can be put in notebooks. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Learning Centers Most teachers think of learning centers for elementary schools, but manysecondary teachers also find the concept very useful. Learning centers areused primarily to provide independent activities for students. They canprovide a structured exploration of a specific subject, topic, skill, orinterest area. The following are characteristics of a learning center: A learning center is self-instructional. When designed properly, no directsupervision of a teacher is required. A learning center can present activities on a variety of levels ofdifficulty. A learning center should have clear objectives. A learning center must include some method of record keeping for studentparticipation and accomplishment. Students need to be taught how to use a learning center. A learning center should be considered as a place where learning occurs, notas a place for recreation. (From VE Teachers Handbook, Polk County, draft, 1993) [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Managing Behavior The VE teacher must be able to manage the behavior of the diverse group ofstudents in the class. Behavior management is a system, method or techniquethat enables students to understand and respond appropriately to school andteacher expectations. A behavior management plan also helps studentsbecome aware of their own need to belong by choosing appropriate behaviors toachieve a special place in the classroom. The purpose of establishing a sound behavior management plan in the classroomis to enable students to be successful intellectually, socially andemotionally. Guiding and nurturing students in these areas enable children togrow up to become independent, creative, problem-solving citizens. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Behavior Management System How do you develop a behavior management system? To develop a successful behavior management system, several steps should befollowed. They include the establishment of a set of classroom rules,guidelines for implementation, and, if needed, a well-defined set of rewardsand consequences. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Establishing Classroom Rules How to Establish Classroom Rules Develop a maximum of five rules for your classroom. Be sure theycorrelate with school and district codes of conduct. State the classroom rules positively. Post the classroom rules in all four corners of the room on the first day ofschool. Include the classroom rules in a letter to parents and have parents sign andreturn it to indicate their understanding and full cooperation for theirchild's success. Teach the classroom rules directly and review them for seven days, statingthe rationale and life value of each. Some instructional activities that can be used include role playing ordramatization, drawing pictures to illustrate the classroom rules, orteacher-directed instruction to make sure that students can recognize anddemonstrate behaviors that follow the rules. You may also find it helpful tomake sure that students recognize behaviors that do not follow therules. Here are some examples of classroom rules: 	Give your best effort daily.	Listen when the teacher or someone is talking.	Raise your hand if you have something to say or to ask.	Cooperate and get along with others.	Complete all of your work. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Implementing Classroom Rules How to Implement Classroom Rules Be consistent. Set standards and expectations and follow them. Follow through with rewards and consequences that are realistic andappropriate. Provide both positive and corrective feedback to students and parents. Provide ongoing parent/teacher communication on a daily or regular basisdepending on the severity of problems and needs of individual students. As needed, go back to "square one." Reteach the classroom rules directlyand review them for several days stating the rationale and life value ofeach. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] Maintain the Momentum How to Maintain the Momentum (or How do I survive in this classroom?) Whenever a student breaks a rule, use verbal correction. Example: "Carol, I see you talking. What's the rule about talking?" Waitfor response. "What will you do in the future if you want to talk? Repeatthat one more time." (Student verbalizes rule three times.) If student saysshe forgot, child should read rule from the chart and write that rule threetimes. Whenever a student breaks a rule and refuses to comply with your directions,use the broken record technique. The teacher repeats the rule conciselyuntil student cooperates. Whenever the "broken record" technique doesn't work, use the choicetechnique. Offer the student a choice of two things he may do, both ofwhich are acceptable to the teacher. It's recommended that one of the choicesbe obviously more appealing to the student. Whenever choice does not work, remove the student from the group until he orshe can act appropriately. This is a form of time out that keeps thestudent in the classroom. Advance the student through the steps only asnecessary. Step 1: Move chair away from the group, but facing the group so the studentcan observe appropriate behavior. Step 2: Leave the student where he or she is but turn the chair facing awayfrom the group. Step 3: Isolate the student from the group but within view of adult. Step 4: Have student draw or write responses to three questions: What did I do that put me in time out? What am I going to do in the future so this won't happen again? What did I miss as a result of being in time out? Assess the student's needs, interests, and behavior patterns andjointly construct a behavioral contract that specifically states what isexpected of the student. Contact the parents and get them to sign and support contract agreement. As a last resort, send student to the office where another alternative may beconsidered. [Managing Behavior] [Table of Contents] R& R for Students To ensure a safe learning environment for all students, you may wish toinstitute R&R for students. An area of the classroom is designated asR&R -- Rest and Return -- and is available to any students who feel theneed to cool down and collect their thoughts when their behavior has gotten outof control. Generally a two-minute stay in R&R is sufficient for thispurpose. If the student won't voluntarily go to the R&R area, he or she is asked bythe teacher to put his head down on the desk for a specified time (e.g., three,five, or ten minutes). If the behavior persists or worsens, the student may be asked to leave theclassroom for a brief time and return when ready to participate. If this isrequired, it is recommended that someone, an aide or responsible student,accompany the student to the alternative area. Make sure that arrangementshave been made ahead of time for this type of crisis intervention. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Keeping Track of the Students On a paper attached to a magnetic board, the names of class members are listed.When a student leaves the classroom, he or she places a single magnet next tohis/her name to indicate the reason for being out of the classroom for a shortperiod. These reasons may include restroom, mainstream class, therapy, etc.When the child returns, the magnet is placed at the bottom of the listindicating re-entry to the classroom. This places the responsibility on thestudents to manage their own coming and going in the classroom. Additionalcontingencies could be set up: for example, limiting the number of studentsgoing out to the restroom at one time. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Silent Signals Sign language can be used for general requests in the classroom. There is asignal students may use to sharpen their pencils, get a drink of water, or goto the bathroom. This decreases the problem of being interrupted whileconducting a lesson. You can signal to the child to go ahead without stoppingyour lesson with the individual group. If you don't know sign language,contact your district coordinator for hearing-impaired programs or your localFDLRS Center. (from Lynn Barbieri, Citrus County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Rewards & Consequences A level system can be used for behavior management. The system must bedeveloped in conjunction with the classroom rules and behavioral expectationsfor the students. Positive reinforcement is provided for behavior that followsthe rules and meets the expectations. In most level systems, a point system is developed to provide concreteindicators to students. Points are awarded to students on a regularlyscheduled basis throughout the day or week. For example, the classroom day maybe divided into 30-minute intervals and a timer set to notify the teacher andstudents. In secondary schools, regular class periods serve as convenientintervals. Points may be awarded for each classroom rule a student follows, andpercentages may be calculated to determine how well the student is doing. Forsome students, the percentages may be calculated to show what percent of timethe student is following each rule. For other students, the percentages may becalculated to show what percent of the rules are being followed. The rewardsare based on the percentages: the higher the percentage, or the higher thenumber of days the percentage was reached, the higher the level of reward.Generally, the levels and rewards are determined once a week, although a dailyschedule may be needed for some students. Most teachers identify several behavioral levels for reinforcement. The levelsare defined in terms of privileges that the student earns. Privileges can beadjusted according to the student's interests. Level 1. Student's behavior is appropriate less than 80 percent of the time. No privileges. Student has no choice in activity or free time. Student maynot attend outside activities or field trips. Level 2. Student maintains appropriate behavior 80 percent of the time. Student may select art or music centers, manipulatives, computers, or otherfree-time activity. Student may attend outside activities and field trips. Level 3. Student maintains appropriate behavior 90 percent of the time. Privileges are the same as for Level 2, plus student may go to media center,run errands, or be a peer tutor. (from Phil Carlson, Palm Beach County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Another Level System Students "make their day" by earning a certain percentage of points. Once theymake ten days, students earn a reward (snack out of classroom school store).Students advance to the next level after earning ten days on the current level.They are also able to earn pro-social points for appropriate pro-socialbehaviors. Each pro-social point is worth $.05 which can be spent in theclassroom store. Individual point sheets are developed for each student with targeted short termobjectives from student's IEP. These sheets are updated every two months.This helps the teachers, aides, parents, and students stay focused on theinstructional objectives. Points are posted daily and discussed. Points aretallied daily and recorded on a point sheet that is sent home for parentsignature and returned the next day. (from Ann Campbell and Vicki Emo, Leon County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Token Economies Token economies are often used in connection with level systems for behaviormanagement. However, they can stand alone. Here are some examples ofeconomies that have worked in VE classes. Students earn play money for following classroom rules,participation, completing assignments, etc. Students may also be finedwhen rules are broken. If they don't have enough money to pay their fines,they receive chips from the teacher. The chips serve as an IOU. A red chipequals $1.00. A black chip equals $5.00. As students earn money later in theday or the week, a student must first pay off his/her fines. The classroombank is displayed on one bulletin board. "Baggies" are kept on this bulletinboard with students' names on them to hold deposits and IOU chips. Money canbe used to purchase items from classroom store which is displayed on anotherbulletin board. Money could also be used for classroom or department auctions,McDonald's Certificates, or earning privileges. (from M. Wolf, Marion County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] More Reward Systems More Reward Systems Students earn $20 of "good behavior money" for every 10 minutes theystay on task within the hour in the classroom. An activity period is allottedon Friday for good behavior money earned. Good behavior dollars are producedin neon colors in different currencies and bear the school logo. (from Nanette Standfast, Pinellas County) To promote a positive behavior management system, students are given anA,B,C certificate for good academics, behavior, or citizenship on whichthey write their names. At the end of class, students fold their awards inhalf and place them in a box. At least once a week a name is drawn from thebox. This lucky student can exchange the A,B,C certificate for a tangibleaward such as a small game, juice box, etc. The A,B,C certificates reinforcespecific behaviors immediately and give students an opportunity to be drawn asa chosen ticket. The more A,B,C certificates earned, the better the student'schances in the ticket drawing. (from Terri Partlow, Orange County) "Kind Acts and Good Deeds Jar" Students have 10 - 15 name cards in anenvelope at their desk. Whenever they do a kind act or good deed, they areallowed to place their name in the jar. This can also be used to rewardappropriate responses to bad situations. Whenever they do their best torespond to a negative situation in a positive manner, they whisper thesituation to the teacher and explain how they have tried to handle thesituation positively. Examples: ignoring rude comment, not hitting back afterbeing hit first, etc. The teacher then asks students to place their names inthe jar for positive behavior responses. Each Friday 3-5 names are selectedfrom the can for special recognition or reward. (from Trina Cassidy, Orange County) [Other Management Techniques] Information on Using Aides, Volunteers, and Peer Support is also available.

Privileges can beadjusted according to the student's interests. Level 1. Student's behavior is appropriate less than 80 percent of the time. No privileges. Student has no choice in activity or free time. Student maynot attend outside activities or field trips. Level 2. Student maintains appropriate behavior 80 percent of the time. Student may select art or music centers, manipulatives, computers, or otherfree-time activity. Student may attend outside activities and field trips. Level 3. Student maintains appropriate behavior 90 percent of the time. Privileges are the same as for Level 2, plus student may go to media center,run errands, or be a peer tutor. (from Phil Carlson, Palm Beach County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Another Level System Students "make their day" by earning a certain percentage of points. Once theymake ten days, students earn a reward (snack out of classroom school store).Students advance to the next level after earning ten days on the current level.They are also able to earn pro-social points for appropriate pro-socialbehaviors. Each pro-social point is worth $.05 which can be spent in theclassroom store. Individual point sheets are developed for each student with targeted short termobjectives from student's IEP. These sheets are updated every two months.This helps the teachers, aides, parents, and students stay focused on theinstructional objectives. Points are posted daily and discussed. Points aretallied daily and recorded on a point sheet that is sent home for parentsignature and returned the next day. (from Ann Campbell and Vicki Emo, Leon County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Token Economies Token economies are often used in connection with level systems for behaviormanagement. However, they can stand alone. Here are some examples ofeconomies that have worked in VE classes. Students earn play money for following classroom rules,participation, completing assignments, etc. Students may also be finedwhen rules are broken. If they don't have enough money to pay their fines,they receive chips from the teacher. The chips serve as an IOU. A red chipequals $1.00. A black chip equals $5.00. As students earn money later in theday or the week, a student must first pay off his/her fines. The classroombank is displayed on one bulletin board. "Baggies" are kept on this bulletinboard with students' names on them to hold deposits and IOU chips. Money canbe used to purchase items from classroom store which is displayed on anotherbulletin board. Money could also be used for classroom or department auctions,McDonald's Certificates, or earning privileges. (from M. Wolf, Marion County) [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] More Reward Systems More Reward Systems Students earn $20 of "good behavior money" for every 10 minutes theystay on task within the hour in the classroom. An activity period is allottedon Friday for good behavior money earned. Good behavior dollars are producedin neon colors in different currencies and bear the school logo. (from Nanette Standfast, Pinellas County) To promote a positive behavior management system, students are given anA,B,C certificate for good academics, behavior, or citizenship on whichthey write their names. At the end of class, students fold their awards inhalf and place them in a box. At least once a week a name is drawn from thebox. This lucky student can exchange the A,B,C certificate for a tangibleaward such as a small game, juice box, etc. The A,B,C certificates reinforcespecific behaviors immediately and give students an opportunity to be drawn asa chosen ticket. The more A,B,C certificates earned, the better the student'schances in the ticket drawing. (from Terri Partlow, Orange County) "Kind Acts and Good Deeds Jar" Students have 10 - 15 name cards in anenvelope at their desk. Whenever they do a kind act or good deed, they areallowed to place their name in the jar. This can also be used to rewardappropriate responses to bad situations. Whenever they do their best torespond to a negative situation in a positive manner, they whisper thesituation to the teacher and explain how they have tried to handle thesituation positively. Examples: ignoring rude comment, not hitting back afterbeing hit first, etc. The teacher then asks students to place their names inthe jar for positive behavior responses. Each Friday 3-5 names are selectedfrom the can for special recognition or reward.

Many teachers are fortunateto have aides or paraprofessionals assigned to their classes. Some teachersuse the school volunteer program to lend a hand. Students can also be awelcome source of assistance to teachers. This section provides somerecommendations for ensuring success with assistants in the classroom. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Common Concerns Who's in charge? The most common problem faced when bringing aides andvolunteers into the classroom involves their authority. Often the students ina VE class do not respect the direction provided by someone other than theirteacher. VE teachers must show the students that aides and volunteers havetheir complete support. Recognition for Effort It is strongly suggested that aides, volunteersand peer support receive recognition on a regular basis. These individualsshould be reinforced for their efforts. They should know that their effortshave been valuable and have contributed to the development and progress of thechildren they have helped. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Teacher Aides Teacher aides are members of the instructional staff at the school. Somedistricts use different titles for this job, but generally the aide's job is toassist the teacher. Duties may include administrative and clerical tasks,arranging the classroom environment for learning, instruction-relatedresponsibilities, and supervisory activities with students. The teacher aide will need both knowledge and skill training to workeffectively in a VE classroom. The school district, often in collaborationwith the regional FDLRS center, can make training available to teacher aides.It is suggested that the aide be involved in an inservice training prior toworking with the students in VE classes. This training should involve a basicunderstanding of child growth and development and a general knowledge ofeducational approaches to learning. They will need to have an understanding ofthe basic causes and characteristics of handicapping conditions for studentswith whom they work. They must understand the purpose of IndividualEducational Plans and how they are developed and carried out. The specific duties of teacher aides varies from district to district. Certainrestrictions may be placed on the range of duties assigned based on the sourceof funding. If aides are paid from federal IDEA funds, they may not provideservices to students who are not eligible for exceptional student education,nor may they work with gifted students. [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Volunteers Volunteers are recruited from the community to assist in classrooms. Mostdistricts and schools have an organized program to facilitate this effort.However, volunteer programs may not always be utilized in VE classes.Sometimes ESE teachers feel that volunteers may not be suited for theirprograms. This is certainly not true. What is needed, is volunteer selectionand preparation procedures that insures their awareness of the characteristicsof the students in VE classesand their readiness to respond appropriately. In many situations, volunteers may have duties that are similar to those of theteacher aides. However, they usually have not been specifically trained fortheir role and the time they have to spend in the classroom is generally morelimited. The volunteer may assist with preparing materials for the classroom,filing student work, and providing important personal contact with students. It is suggested that volunteers spend some time in the classroom beforecommitting to the job. Training is also recommended to prepare volunteers towork with the students appropriately. Where can volunteers be found? If you don't have a ready source of volunteers for your classroom, trythese sources: Church groups and service clubs in the community Business partnerships who provide release time for employees to serve asmentors and volunteers in school programs< Senior-citizen groups Community college and university training programs< [Other Management Techniques] [Table of Contents] Peer Support The use of students to provide assistance in the VE classroom benefits both theESE students and the student volunteers. In some districts, older studentsfrom nearby schools may earn credit by assisting in these classrooms. Peersupport can also involve students from within the VE classroom or from regulareducation classrooms in the school. The student assistant can provideinstructional assistance and be a positive social influence. Selection of Students for Peer Support Peer support students can be selected by an interest survey and teacherrecommendation. Some high school service clubs may be interested in sponsoringa student assistance program. It may be possible to recruit peer supportstudents from within the VE classroom. Older, more mature students can serveas respected role models. Students will need structure and training to serveeffectively as a peer support. The teacher should carefully select thesestudents. The factors that should be considered include reliability,compatibility, behavior, and willingness to make a commitment. The following are examples of peer support programs that teachers in Floridahave used. Reading Buddies Once a week ESE students meet with their reading buddies from first grade.Each pair or threesome take turns reading their book to the other students.This stimulates students' interest in reading as they have a direct, interestedaudience. (from Trina Cassidy, Orange County) Mentors for Visually Impaired Students Regular-education students are enrolled in a specially designed programto assist visually impaired students in the mainstream setting. As mentors,they help the vision teacher by working with visually impaired high schoolstudents and also travel to middle schools to provide reader services, largeprint work, graphic details, and personal life experiences. The regulareducation students earn credit for their work. Such a program can easily beadapted for all types of students with disabilities. (from Sandi Serventi, Leon County) Peer Facilitators for the ESE Reading Program A partnership between peer facilitators, ESE students, and teachers isestablished to assist in the ESE reading program. The peer facilitators arespecially chosen for patience, willingness, academic levels, character, anddependability and work under the supervision of the guidance counselor. ESEstudents are chosen by reading level, desire to improve, and basic need, andwork under the supervision of the ESE teacher. Peer facilitators and ESEstudents work together to practice reading skills and enhance readingabilities.

They feel that they have to work around thedemands of all other programs in the school. A proactive approach is needed tofacilitate appropriate scheduling. The following list provides a number ofsuggestions that may assist the VE teacher in developing the classroom scheduleat the beginning of the school year. Try not to remove ESE students from their homeroom time. Wait untilannouncements are finished. Allow time in the weekly or semester schedule for non-instructional duties,such as paperwork, testing, conferencing with parents and teachers, andplanning. Be firm and assertive about scheduling for the time specified on the student'sIEP. If you must teach more than one subject at a time, make sure you have thesupport you need. For some students and subjects, an integrated andinterdisciplinary approach to instruction works very well. Make individual plans for students that could be used for a period of time.Students could keep track of accomplishments and check off work as theycomplete it. Assignments may be posted on the bulletin board and students canbe responsible for tracking their completion. Stress day-by-day organization which is as critical as the weekly or yearlyplan. Students need to know exactly what to do each day and the rules shouldbe consistently applied. Be aware of practices like Friday testing in the regular classroom. Correlateyour activities as appropriate. Provide lesson plans for aides and volunteers so they will know what to do. [Scheduling] [Table of Contents] Elementary Programs The following suggestions are intended to help teachers in elementaryschools whose ESE students regularly participate in mainstream programs. Use the school's master schedule to identify times when all ESE students arein mainstream programs, such as music, art, and physical education; includelunch and other common times. Coordinate with the regular teacher's classroom schedule. Where possible andappropriate, the ESE student should remain in the regular classroom for classesand activities in which they can experience success. Try to schedule students in the VE class for the subject or area identified onthe IEP at the same time their regular class has this scheduled. Arrange theVE schedule so that students can be grouped by academic or social needs, notnecessarily by grade level or by exceptionality. Sometimes, you may find that the all of the regular classes offer the targetedsubjects, like reading, at the same time of day. The VE schedule becomesoverloaded at certain times during the day and very light at others. The ESEteacher may be able to negotiate with the regular teacher or the schooladministrator to adjust the schedule or to accommodate the ESE students in theregular class. If you have both part-time and full-time students in the class, try toschedule students so that they can be grouped by functional level. [Scheduling] [Table of Contents] Secondary Programs The following suggestions are intended for teachers in middle and highschools. ESE students should be hand-scheduled or scheduled first if a computer programis used to ensure that appropriate courses and instructors are selected. Thiswill help to avoid placing students in inappropriate classes. Providing a consistent structure can assist students in meeting requirementsof many different teachers. Daily reviews of expectations in each class willpromote improved behavior. Help students who are new to the school find their way around. Older studentscan be assigned to help new students for the first few weeks. [Scheduling] [Table of Contents] Grouping for Instruction After the schedule has been set for the VE class, the teacher must determinehow the students will be grouped for instruction. The effective use ofgrouping techniques can result in a classroom that functions as a real learningcommunity. The following section provides descriptions of major types ofgrouping techniques, with guidelines for determining the benefits of each typeof grouping, and recommendations and cautions for effective use of the groupingtechnique. Although each exceptional student has an Individual Education Plan andshould be provided individualized instruction and assessment, students canbenefit from participation in group instruction and group work. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Independent Learning What does this accomplish? Independent learning provides opportunities for students in VE classesto practice needed skills, promote responsibility and individual effort, andbuild time management skills and self-directed work habits. Who benefits? All students in VE classes can benefit from independent learning activities.Even prekindergarten students in play activities are learning independently.Older students requiring drill and practice for skill development andreinforcement may use this method. In self-guided learning activities,students can work at their own pace. How do you make this work? Select the activities. The types of activities used forindependent learning do not have to be limited to paper-and-pencil worksheets.Activity centers can be created in which students can work on interestingtasks. Creative centers promote self-expression. The computer is a naturaltool for an independent learning activity center. Provide a management routine. Students will need to be able to performthe expected behaviors and outcomes of independent learning activities.Students should be able to select, retrieve, and return all needed equipmentand materials. The more you can rely on students to do things for themselves,the more they will gain from the activities. Provide feedback on performance. Even though the activities areindependent, students will need direct feedback on their performance. Many ESEstudents benefit from clear evidence of their progress. Any cautions? Selection of activities. Teachers in VE classes must provide thestructure for independent learning activities. Activities should be carefullyselected so that they are appropriate for the students. They should neither betoo difficult nor too easy. Independent learning activities must besufficiently challenging and even more important, they must be interesting tothe students. Arranging the learning environment.The learning environment in the VEclass must be arranged so that students can easily locate the materialsthemselves. Students also should learn how to get help in ways that do notdisrupt the rest of the classroom activities. Silent signals and learningbuddies are two methods that have worked in many classrooms. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] One-on-One Instruction What does this accomplish? One-on-one instruction is used to provide the most intensive kind ofinstruction. Modeling, prompting, and feedback can be individualized toanticipate and respond directly to the learner's needs. Who benefits? Students requiring personal contact for information to be processed willrequire one-on-one instruction. All students in a VE class may requireone-on-one instruction from time to time. Students who are most likely to needthis type of instruction include the following: New Students--Students who do not know the classroom routine do notknow how to get help independently. Students in Crisis--Students who temporarily lack self-control needmuch direct support and structure. Students Learning a New Skill--Students learning new skills requirecareful attention to the modeling and feedback provided by the teacher.Sometimes this is most efficiently delivered on a personalized basis. Students with Sensory Impairments--Students whose ability to receiveinformation is impaired may require personal contact. Some dual sensoryimpaired students need to have the sign language transmitted in their hand. How do you make this work? The most successful use of one-on-one instruction necessitates carefulplanning. When the VE teacher anticipates the need for this approach, theappropriate conditions can be arranged. A classroom management program isneeded for the other students and could involve peer tutoring, independent taskcompletion routines, and use of assistants and volunteers. One-on-oneinstruction may require the classroom teacher for delivery, but it may also beprovided by teacher assistants or through computer-assisted instruction. Insome cases, the teacher can get the process started, then move aside as othersupport mechanisms take over. Any cautions? As in any ESE class, teachers need to keep the goal of independent learning atthe forefront. In VE classes, students often need a lot of one-on-oneinstruction at first. Plan to fade some of the direct assistance as the childbecomes acclimated to the classroom or more proficient in practicing the newskill. Where groups of students must be instructed together, shift back andforth from whole group participation to individual instruction and response.When students in VE classes are taught how to be independent learners, they canbecome partners in the process. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Large and Small Groups What does this accomplish? For students with similar learning needs, group instruction provides anefficient method for demonstrations, information presentations, and modeling.For students with more diverse learning needs, group instruction can be used toprovide shared experiences. Many VE classrooms use cooperative learning groupsto accommodate the diversity of student learning needs. Who benefits? Students of all ages can benefit from group learning experiences. Veryyoung students may require smaller groups and activities that are relativelyshort. Older students will need activities that are well paced and easy tofollow. Students with disabilities may need to learn how to participate ingroup activities. How do you make this work? Keep grouping flexible. Planning for instruction in a VE class requiresthe teacher to consider the needs of all students in the class. Students maybe grouped for specific skill learning or for concept development. Because ofthe diversity within a VE class, teachers often must group and regroup studentsthroughout the day. Most students can adjust to this type of flexibility aslong as it is predictable. Students can follow a task card, with symbolsrepresenting where they are to be. A timer in the classroom can help to signalchange in activities. Use media to enhance presentations. When information must be presentedto a group of students, visual and auditory aids are particularly useful.These aids can reinforce the key points. Concrete examples are generally themost effective presentation aids. Keep students actively involved. Learning requires active involvement.Listening is rarely sufficient for students in VE classes to gain theinformation and understanding provided through verbal instruction. Use a lotof cues to focus the student's attention. Students can also participate ingroup instruction in a variety of ways. Assign each student a different roleor expectation, then have them collaborate to complete a related task. Combine a variety of activities. Many teachers find group instructionsuccessful when they combine several activities within a class period. Beginthe lesson with an advanced organizer that "sets the stage" and provides anoverview of the lesson or a link to what was done in previous lessons. Thelesson can easily combine whole-group, small-group, and individual activities.Don't forget to end the lesson with a summary or post-organizer. Any cautions? Monitoring student response to group instruction is the key to itseffectiveness. Students will be processing information at different rates andvarying in their participation. The teacher must always check forunderstanding. Group feedback can be effective for some activities. However,individual feedback may also be required. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Students in the Mainstream What does this accomplish? To the extent appropriate, exceptional students should be provided education inthe least restrictive environment. For the majority of ESE students, thismeans participation in mainstream programs with their peers. Who benefits? ESE students can benefit from both the instructional and socializationopportunities available through placement in regular classes. For some,accommodations may need to be provided in terms of instructional methods,communication modes, and assessment procedures. How do you make this work? A structured process has been widely used in Florida to promote thesuccessful integration of exceptional students in mainstream classes.Cooperative Consultation (Riegel, 1988) provides a set of easy to usechecklists and forms through which exceptional education and mainstreamteachers can assess needs and plan realistic alternatives for studentsencountering difficulty in the school setting. The process facilitates opencommunication among the professionals and with the students. The result is ashared responsibility for implementing alternatives and monitoring the outcomesfor the student. The process requires the following steps: Assess the ESE student's educational needs. Assess the demands of the mainstream environment. Determine any modifications or accommodations needed for the ESEstudent. Monitor the implementation of the modifications and the progress of the ESEstudent. Any cautions? Mainstreaming works well when the mainstream teacher, the ESE teacher,and the ESE student have clearly communicated and agreed upon theirexpectations and responsibilities. When success is left to chance, results aregenerally uneven. [Grouping for Instruction] [Table of Contents] Managing the Classroom Environment The way you organize your classroom will contribute to the management ofinstruction. Furniture arrangement, access to equipment and materials, andorganization of materials all play key roles in managing the classroomenvironment. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Planning the Environment As you begin to think about organizing your classroom, here is a list ofthings you may want to consider. Take stock of what you will need. How many students will be in the classroom at a time? Will there be an aide or volunteers? What equipment and furniture is assigned to the room? What instructional materials are available? How can I get furniture, equipment, or materials I need? Organize your space. What kinds of working spaces will be needed? How can the space be divided to accommodate the different kinds ofinstructional activities that are used? How can the furniture be used to create different areas in the room? From VE Teacher Handbook, Polk County, draft, 1993 [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Arranging the Furniture Because of the wide variability in classroom size and location, nosingle arrangement for desks and centers will work in all VE classrooms. Thefollowing arrangements are provided to represent the typical types ofclassrooms and the advantages and disadvantages are listed to help teachersdecide which arrangement works best for them (adapted from The SolutionBook, SRA). CLASSROOM STYLE Benefits This arrangement has been the traditional arrangements in classrooms formany years. It places the teacher at the head of the classroom and faces allstudents to the center of instruction. It is an efficient use of space, andmay be used to keep individual desks away from learning centers, computers, orother special features in the classroom. When large group instruction andpresentation by the teacher is the most frequently used format, this style ispreferred. Problems When students are arranged in rows, the students at the back of theclassroom may have difficulty seeing the chalkboard or other visual aids in thefront of the room. Students also may be too close together for independentwork, and behavior problems may result. CLUSTER STYLE Benefits Grouping desks in clusters can be used in classes to support cooperativelearning activities, and team work. In many VE classes, there are small groupsof students who are working on the same level, and this classroom arrangementcould facilitate their instruction. Praise can be delivered to groups ofstudents as well as to individuals. Problems This arrangement may require more classroom space and leave little roomfor learning centers or other special classroom areas. Because students arefacing each other, behavior problems sometimes occur during independent worktime. Dividers may need to be used to partition the workspace. When wholegroup instruction is used, students may not all be facing the same direction. BOARDROOM STYLE Benefits Grouping desks is sometimes necessary when classroom space is limited.This works well when students are all working together on the same project orwhen students can work well independently. Problems Like cluster style, the arrangement sometimes results in behaviorproblems during independent work because students are facing each other.Students may also have difficulty receiving individual help from theteacher. [Managing the Classroom Environment] [Table of Contents] Organizing Instructional Materials and Supplies Think about how you will arrange and file your instructional materialsso that you, your assistants, and your students can easily access what isneeded. Where and how will you store textbooks, workbooks and other materials that arebeing used? What about the things you don't need right now? How will worksheets be filed? How will supplies be stored?

Consideration must be given to the characteristics and needsof the students, the scheduling of students during the day, the way studentsare grouped for instruction, and the management of the learning environment.This section provides a variety of suggestions that may help the VE teacher. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Characteristics of Exceptional Students As identified in the first section of this document, all categories ofexceptional students may be served in a VE class. The following descriptionshave been developed by the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Students(Educating Exceptional Students, 1993) and are provided to define anddescribe educational characteristics related to each exceptionality. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Autistic Student Characteristics Autism is a behaviorally-defined syndrome characterized by severeproblems in learning, communication, and social interaction. Although autismis a lifelong disability for which there is no known cure, persons with thisdisorder can make substantial progress through intervention programs ineducation, speech and language therapy, and other disciplines. The term "autism" refers to a collection of behavioral symptoms which normallyare diagnosed during infancy or early childhood and may have more than onecause. Behavioral characteristics may vary significantly among individualswith autism. These characteristics include cognitive, behavioral, social, andcommunication deficits. Educational Characteristics Cognitive levels of functioning vary dramatically within thispopulation. Levels may range from the profoundly disabled who display a numberof physical problems, to high functioning individuals who are sociallyintegrated with the community. Many individuals show unevenness in their developmental profile. Splinterskills within and between academic areas often evidence this uneven skilldevelopment. Most individuals evidence speech which is noncommunicative and language skillswhich are dysfunctional. There may be markedly abnormal nonverbalcommunication, such as lack of eye contact or inability to refocus attention asthe situation changes. There may be marked impairment in the ability toinitiate or sustain a conversation. Many individuals may ignore the presence of others and remain aloof andindifferent to social contact. Interest in objects may be greater thaninterest in people. Some may show an inability to make friends with others inthe classroom. Some individuals may lack appropriate affect in relation to environmentalstimulation. They may become extremely upset without obvious provocation,resulting in tantrumming behavior of considerable duration or intensity. Hypo- or hyper-sensitivity are often characteristic reactions to stimuli.Individuals with autism may demonstrate insensitivity or lack of response topain, or they may overreact to a common environmental noise such as a schoolbell. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Dual Sensory Impaired Student Characteristics Students with "dual sensory impairments" have both a vision and a hearing lossand are sometimes referred to as "deaf-blind." The combination of sensorylosses creates severe communication and other developmental and learning needsthat require special education and related services. Communication andmobility are the most seriously affected areas for students with dual sensoryimpairments. Educational Characteristics Students communicate through facial expression, body movement, andvarious vocalizations that may seem unintelligible. Staff should acknowledgeand expand communication attempts so that students can develop effective meansof communication. Students with little functional use of their vision or hearing are oftenunable to understand what is going to happen to them. Staff should developtouch cues (specific signals of events or requests) and use them consistentlyin daily routines. Students with severe impairments react more positively to a stranger ifapproached using a gentle touch to the shoulder as a cue. Students must be taught appropriate touch, tolerating touch, and explorationstrategies. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Emotionally Handicapped and Severely Emotionally Disturbed Student Characteristics The student who has an emotional handicap exhibits one or more of thefollowing characteristics, to the extent that he or she is unable to takeadvantage of or participate in the regular education program: Inability to learn cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or healthfactors. Demonstrates inappropriate types of behaviors or feelings under normalcircumstances. General mood is one of unhappiness or depression. Tendency to develop physical symptoms, pain, or fears associated with personalor school problems. Unable to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships withpeers or teacher. Demonstrates a variety of excessive behaviors, ranging from hyperactive andaggressive responses to severe depression and withdrawal. All student characteristics must be examined as they are impacted by thecontext of educational settings (academic and social), home, and community. Educational Considerations Students should be provided with a structured learning environment to providefor skill acquisition in behavior control strategies, academic achievement, andsocialization. Classroom rules for group control and structure for targeting behaviors shouldbe key elements in the learning environment. Many have academic problems, particularly in reading comprehension, socialstudies, and math problem solving. These areas should be emphasized in thecurriculum. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Gifted Gifted students are rarely served in a VE model. However, students with otherexceptionalities occasionally exhibit characteristics associated withgiftedness, and these may be used as clues to appropriate learninginterventions. Student Characteristics There is no one type of giftedness; therefore, no single instructionalmodification is effective for all gifted students. Most effective teachingstrategies emphasize flexibility and sensitivity to the characteristics ofgifted students, and provision of opportunities to experience the breadth of aconcept to match the student's curiosity. General Characteristics Learn skills efficiently, with little practice. Interpret nonverbal cues and draw inferences independently. Work independently at an earlier age and for longer periods of time. Often have wildly eclectic interests and are intensely focused. Have seemingly boundless energy; may be misdiagnosed as hyperactive. Are able to relate well to adults and older children. Learning Characteristics Show keen powers of observation; have an eye for important details. Prefer structure, organization, and consistency in their environment. Are often skeptical, critical, and evaluative. Have a ready grasp of underlying principles; can make generalizations. Can attack complicated material and analyze it systematically. Have well developed common sense. Behavioral Characteristics Are often well organized, goal-directed, and efficient. Exhibit intrinsic motivation to learn, find out, and explore. Have a highly developed moral and ethical sense. Can integrate opposing impulses. Often seem to be daydreaming. May seek to conceal their abilities.

[Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Hearing Impaired Student Characteristics The term "hearing impaired" refers to people with all types of hearingdisabilities, ranging from a very slight loss to profound deafness. Whetherthe hearing loss occurred before or after the student acquired language oftendetermines the type of support services the individual student will need inorder to succeed. Educational Considerations The diversity of manifestations makes it necessary to consider eachstudent as an individual with unique characteristics and educational needs. Some students have difficulty accepting their hearing loss and areinconsistent in wearing their hearing aids. Hearing aids only partiallycompensate for an individual's hearing impairment. Individual students mayexhibit speech, language, and communication problems. Some students communicate orally; others use speech and sign language.Students may need the assistance of an interpreter or notetaker. Sign languageinterpreters may sign and speak at the same time. Oral interpreters voicewithout using signs. Optimum acoustical conditions must be provided for students with hearingimpairments. Any extraneous noise makes it more difficult for students tointerpret oral language. To reduce reverberation, the classroom should beequipped with sound-absorbing materials such as carpet, cloth curtains, andacoustical ceiling tile. Adequate lighting is needed to help with the comprehension of informationthrough speech reading and visual aids. In addition, amplification is neededto assist students in understanding what is being said. Students may havedifficulty processing both the visual information and the classroomconversation at the same time. Suggestions for Classroom Routines Speak normally when talking; hearing aids increase the loudness of sounds. Write assignments on the board. Encourage students to ask for statements to be repeated. Rephrase thestatements, if they do not understand. Students may fatigue more readily because of the continuous visual andauditory strain of keeping up with the classroom activity. Allow students to sit where they can have direct eye contact with the speakerand interpreter. Avoid standing in front of windows and other light sources when speaking tostudents. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Mentally Handicapped Student Characteristics People with a mental handicap develop at a below-average rate andexperience difficulty in learning and social adjustment. "Mentally retardedmeans significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existingconcurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during thedevelopmental period, that adversely affects a student's educationalperformance" (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA). In educational settings, students with mental handicaps may be determinedeligible for one of three groups based on their ability to learn and theirability to be independent and socially responsible: [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Educable Mentally Handicapped (EMH) Students are mildly impaired in intellectual and adaptive behavioral skills.IQ is approximately 55-70 and assessed adaptive behavior falls below age andcultural expectations. These students can learn about 50% to 75% of what atypical student can learn and understand. They usually have a short attentionspan and do not retain information readily. Educational Considerations Teachers may need to use many clear, unambiguous verbal cues; prompts;physical guidance; and modeling to help these students learn at a moreefficient rate. Students need frequent feedback and reinforcement. Students can learn a broad range of subjects including basic skills, socialstudies, science, and health and personal care. An important component ispreparation for a vocation and community living. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Trainable Mentally Handicapped (TMH) Students identified as TMH are moderately or severely impaired in intellectualand adaptive behavior and have a reduced rate of learning. IQ is approximately25-55 and assessed adaptive behavior falls significantly below age and culturalexpectations. Students can learn about 25% to 50% of what a typical studentcan learn and understand. In addition, they may have cardiac or neurologicalsensory disorders. Educational Considerations Students may require many services provided through an interdisciplinary teamapproach. Curriculum should include activities of daily living, preparation andparticipation in a supported employment program, and transition services forlife after school. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Profoundly Mentally Handicapped (PMH) Students identified as PMH are profoundly impaired in intellectual and adaptivebehavior and have a reduced rate of learning. IQ is approximately 25 or belowand assessed adaptive behavior falls very significantly below age and culturalexpectations. Students have little response to most social stimuli and limitedawareness of their environment. Communication is very limited, and they maydisplay temper tantrums, self-injurious behaviors, self-stimulation, andseizures. Many have other serious conditions as well, such as cerebral palsyor blindness. Educational Considerations Students benefit from social stimulation and communication training. Many students require assistive technology for ambulation, self-care, andhealth maintenance. Teachers need to work with the adult agencies to which these students maytransition after graduation and help the students develop the appropriatebehavioral skills for this transition. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Physically Impaired Student Characteristics A physical impairment is a physically disabling condition resulting froma health impairment, an orthopedic condition, or a traumatic brain injury whichrequires an adaptation to the student's school environment or curriculum.Physical impairments include physical problems present at birth as well asphysical problems resulting from other causes. Neurological problems, such ascerebral palsy, may be included in this category. Health impairments may result in reduced efficiency in school work because oftemporary or chronic lack of strength, vitality, or alertness. Asthma, cardiacconditions, leukemia, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) areexamples of health impairments that could interfere with a student'seducation. Educational Considerations The effect of a physical impairment can vary from little or none to acomplete restructuring of daily life. Severely involved students may requireintensive health care and educational assistance. Physical impairments may interfere with the student's motor functioning,communication, learning skills, or social development. Physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy are often central tothe education of students with physical impairments. The greatest progress isachieved when therapy suggestions are consistently applied in the student'shome as well as throughout the school environment. Programs may need to be made assessible by structural changes (adding rampsor elevators) or schedule or location changes. Physical impairments can affect the student's emotional and socialdevelopment. Avoid overprotection and encourage students to participate withinlimits of safety and health. Adaptive equipment can be used to enable students with physical impairments tofunction more normally. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Specific Learning Disabilities Student Characteristics A specific learning disability is a condition which affects one of thebasic psychological processes involved in understanding or using language. Apsychological process is considered to be the combined operations involved ingathering, storing, or retrieving information through sensory channels. Thedisability can appear in areas such as listening, thinking, reading, talking,writing, or arithmetic. Learning disabilities cannot be attributed to avision, hearing, or motor disability, a mental handicap, an emotionaldisturbance, or environmental deprivation. Specific learning disability delays are typically in spoken language orlistening skills, error patterns in written language (including reading),difficulty in grasping math concepts or performing basic arithmetic operations,and difficulty in applying organizational skills. These characteristics may beevident in several areas of performance. Identification of specific learningdisabilities is possible when a discrepancy exists between a student'sestimated ability and actual performance level. Educational Considerations The disability can have a mild to severe impact on students' academicperformance. Classroom organization providing a high level of structure, defined routines,and clearly stated rules and assignments are helpful to many students. Flexibility in allotment of time to complete assignments and in the use ofclassroom space and equipment provides students an increased opportunity to besuccessful. Modifications in instructional methods, such as activities to support lessons(study guides or advance organizers), assist students to master key conceptsand content. Instructional materials can be modified by compressing or paraphrasing texts,developing additional practice materials, or reducing the number of itemsrequired to show proficiency. Assessment procedures that allow alternative presentation of questions andresponses can enable students to demonstrate competencies. Clear instructionsand expectations must be provided. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Speech and Language Impaired Student Characteristics Speech and language impairments refer to problems in communication,i.e., the ability to understand or appropriately use speech and languagesystems. Such disorders may range from simple sound repetitions or occasionalmisarticulations to the absence of the ability to use speech and language forcommunication. A language impairment is the inability to use the symbols oflanguage through proper use of words and their meanings, appropriategrammatical patterns, and proper use of speech sounds. A speech impairment isdifficulty in producing speech sounds (articulation), maintaining speech rhythm(fluency), and controlling vocal production (voice). Educational Considerations Students with a communication disorder may have difficulty learningbasic academic subjects. As students progress through school, increased demands in the language oflearning can result in great difficulty for students with speech or languageimpairments. Some students may encounter isolation in educational, vocational, social, andemotional areas. Technology can assist students whose physical condition makes communicationdifficult. The use of augmentative or assistive communication devices allowslimited-speaking or nonspeaking students to engage in meaningfulcommunication. [Effective Practices for Varying Exceptionalities Classes] [Table of Contents] Visually Impaired Student Characteristics "Partially sighted" refers to students who have corrected vision between 20/200and 20/70 and who may require the use of special materials for learning. "Low vision" refers to students who may be partially sighted or legally blindand who require adaptations that may include Braille. "Legally blind" refers to students who have corrected vision of less than20/200 or a very limited field of vision and who require the use of specialmaterials for learning. "Totally blind" refers to students who have no light perception and who requireBraille or other nonvisual media for learning. The effect of visual problems on a student's development depends on theseverity and type of loss, the age of onset, and the overall functioning levelof the child. Many children who have multiple handicaps may also have visualimpairments which result in further motor, cognitive, and/or socialdevelopmental delays. Many children who have a visual impairment are notmotivated to explore their environment because of lack of visual stimuli. Theymay appear uninterested, overprotected, and antisocial due to the impact oftheir visual impairment. Educational Considerations Special materials, including Braille, large print, and taped textbooks andsupplemental reading materials; special technology, including adaptivecomputers, low-vision optical aids, and print-enlarging equipment; andmodifications to curricula may be necessary for students with visualimpairments. Students may require special instruction in daily living skills, socialskills, orientation and mobility (independent movement in the environment),communication (Braille), or vocational/career options. Students with visual impairments are typically mainstreamed and receivespecial instruction in Braille, daily living skills, and social behaviors.

Capabilities: Radioactive and Hazardous Waste Stabilization Liquid Waste Treatment Environmental Consulting Research and Development Hazardous Waste Recycling Training Waste Minimization / Pollution Prevention Decontamination and Decommissioning Management Consulting Auditing and Compliance Staff Augmentation Radiation Instrument Repair, Calibration, and Rental Radioactive Material License Consulting GTS Duratek's Research Arm: The Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) GTS Duratek holds an exclusive agreement with the world-class materials research facility that has made glass from over 50 DOE wastes. According to scientists the world over, glass is the most durable waste form known to man. The harmful contaminants of waste molecularly bond with the glass, so there is no longer an environmental pollution threat. Vitrification Technology Is Unique GTS Duratek/VSL minimum additive approach achieves maximum waste volume reduction thereby reducing storage capacity or landfill costs, which often offsets higher treatment costs. For example, on the Savannah River M-Area project, GTS Duratek estimates that its technology will be 40% cheaper in total waste life cycle costs than conventional stabilization methods, which actually increase waste volume. Vitrification Technology Can Be Used for Many Wastes Mixed waste, which is both radioactive and hazardous, from Department of Energy and Department of Defense cleanup efforts Commercially generated, low-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants, hospitals, and laboratories Hazardous waste from various industries that is made into glass can be recycled into value-added products.

(GTS), a high-tech staff augmentation firm. Duratek began processing radioactive waste water for U.S. commercial nuclear power plants in1983, and later expanded its business to include U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear weaponsproduction sites. The selective ion exchange technology Duratek used in its water processing systemswas developed at The Catholic University of America`s Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) and transferredto Duratek through long-term licensing agreements. Duratek manufactured the ion exchange media at itsBeltsville, Maryland, plant. GTS began operations in 1984, supplying temporary field personnel to its parent company,General Physics Corporation (GP), a training and engineering firm. GTS supplemented GPs permanentemployees with skilled contract workers thereby affording the parent company greater flexibility andlower costs in staffing its field projects. GTS excelled in this role and, in addition to sales to GP, quicklybecame a substantial services supplier to its own diverse client base, achieving over $30 million in totalsales in 1989. Duratek sold its commercial nuclear power plant contracts to a competitor in mid-1990, andseveral months later bought GTS. At that time, Duratek held the rights to a low-level radioactive wastevitrification process (waste-to-glass conversion) developed at the VSL. Throughout 1991, GTS and Duratek management streamlined and thoroughly integrated the twoorganizations to form one company: GTS Duratek. Working closely with the VSL, GTS Duratekfocused on developing and deploying innovative waste treatment technology, including a line ofproprietary DuraMelterTM vitrification systems. The Company also continued to serve its staffaugmentation clients while growing and diversifying its service lines to include consulting, engineering,and training supplied under both staff augmentation and self-managed task contracts. Through the following years, GTS Duratek promoted the synergism between its two businesssegments by tailoring its personnel services to complement the development and deployment ofenvironmental technology. For example, the Company added a wide variety of environmental specialiststo its contract personnel resources and developed training programs such as waste melter operations,hazardous material handling and radiation protection.

Prince, President and CEO We accomplished all of our major goals and formed key strategic alliances that will propel ourproprietary "waste-to-glass" technology into worldwide markets. Our stock price rose from$4.00 at the beginning of the year to $14.25 at year's end. Our success is directly tied to meeting all of our important milestones: We set out toform key strategic alliances that would add financial strength, market access, and broadenedcapabilities; to complete plant construction and obtain required government operating permits;and to expand our technology base. We achieved all this and more. Strategic Alliances In January 1995, we closed a financing transaction with The Carlyle Group, aWashington, D.C.-based private merchant bank, making it our controlling shareholder. Carlyle'ssubstantial investment in the Company greatly improved our financial position and provided theresources we needed to rapidly advance our waste-to-glass (vitrification) technology tocommercialization. Through the experience of its partners, Carlyle also provides GTS Duratekwith unique political insight for working in the government arena. In November, we formed an important strategic alliance with BNFL Inc., the U.S.subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels plc. This relationship brings additional financial resourcesfor research and development to the Company. As one of the world's largest processors ofhigh-level radioactive waste, BNFL's selection of GTS Duratek as its strategic ally forvitrification technology is a significant endorsement. We have agreed to pursue up to five majorDepartment of Energy (DOE) environmental restoration projects and to investigate internationalopportunities with BNFL. BNFL is also providing research and development funding over thenext five years to advance our waste treatment technologies. Construction/Permitting Milestones There were several crucial milestones we absolutely had to achieve on time to meetcontractual commitments made to DOE clients and our joint venture partners. Under our DuraChem joint venture with Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc., we set a goal tohave the first vitrification facility for commercially generated low-level radioactive wastecompleted before the end of 1995. In November, DuraChem got its South Carolina operatingpermit, and we began the startup of our DuraMelter 3000SC at Chem-Nuclear's low-levelradioactive waste consolidation center in Barnwell, South Carolina. We committed to complete construction of the world's largest low-level radioactive wastemelter, our DuraMelter 5000, at the DOE's Savannah River Site "M-Area" by early January 1996. On January 10, we informed the client, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, that the facilitywas complete and ready for its operational readiness assessment. We expect to start up and testthe facility during the first half of 1996, and during the 12 months following testing, we willconvert approximately 90,000 cubic feet of radioactive sludge to environmentally safe glass forlong-term storage or disposal. This is the first commercial-scale application of vitrificationtechnology for stabilizing DOE waste, and we view the M-Area project as a prototype for futureDOE waste processing privatizations. We committed to design a DuraMelter 1000HT (high temperature) pilot-scale melter forFernald Environmental Restoration Management Corporation (FERMCO) and have thecomponents fabricated and delivered to the DOE's Fernald site during the summer of 1995. Asof early September, all components were on site. We are also providing consulting support forFERMCO during construction, startup, and testing of this first-of-a-kind melter facility, whichwill process high-radon K-65 silo waste. Technology and Consulting Expertise In late 1995, with the acquisition of the San Leon, Texas, Bird Gulf Coast RecyclingCenter _ now DuraTherm, Inc. _ we entered the business of recycling hazardous waste intovalue-added products. The DuraTherm facility uses patented thermal desorption technology toextract usable fuel from petroleum refinery and petrochemical plant sludge waste. Theby-product from the thermal desorption process is a powdery residue, which we believe is anexcellent candidate for conversion to glass that can be reused. We temporarily suspendedoperations at the facility while we make approximately $3 million of capital enhancements, andwe plan to reopen it during the second quarter of 1996. We acquired Analytical Resources, Inc., a small environmental consulting firm supplyingspecialty environmental consulting services to the DOE. This acquisition gives us the seniorenvironmental management and professional consulting talent we will need to further grow ourenvironmental restoration and waste management services business. Consulting, Training, and Staff Support Our commercial nuclear power plant and DOE professional and technical services alsogrew during 1995. At Duke Power Company's seven nuclear units, we added engineering andquality control to the radiation protection, instrumentation & electronic, and clerical support weare supplying. We now have contracts to supply radiation protection services for nearly one-fifthof the nation's commercial nuclear power units, and our staff at the DOE's Fernald site isapproaching 100 technicians. At the Savannah River M-Area project, we are providing operatorand environment, safety and health (ES&H) training, and a complete radiologicalcontrol/industrial safety organization. Our shareholders should view GTS Duratek as a company that sets an aggressive"milestone" agenda each year then goes out and accomplishes it. We are determined to deliveron our promises and commitments to our clients and, therefore, to our shareholders. By meetingour milestones in 1995, we increased profits by 465 percent over that of 1994. As we go forward, our agenda continues to be aggressive. We have a plan that includesadding new technologies to our portfolio that fit with our core mission of implementingproprietary, low-cost technologies to transform waste into environmentally safe forms fordisposal and, wherever possible, to recycle the material as usable products. The projectshighlighted on the following pages exemplify our progress and our commitment toward fulfillingour plan. We thank our employees for all their hard work in 1995 and our shareholders for theircontinued support. We are committed to even greater achievements in 1996. Sincerely, Robert E.

Please Make a Note of It GTS Duratek's M-Area Vendor Treatment Facility Is Hot! by Mark Clements A Time for Celebration -- On October 18, the DuraMelter 5000, the world's largest low-levelradioactive waste melter, began converting sludge into glass at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)Savannah River Site (SRS). This is the first commercial cleanup effort to use vitrification on a DOE site. "This project is the largest commercial use of vitrification to date. GTS Duratek has created goodpaying jobs in the South Carolina area and is solving a very important environmental problem. In addition,the M-Area cleanup is a key commitment made to the state by the DOE, and GTS Duratek is on track tohelp us meet our milestone," said Mario Fiori, DOE's SRS Operations Manager. GTS Duratek built, owns, and operates the plant, called the Vendor Treatment Facility, or VTF. Overthe next 6 to 12 months, the Company's VTF operations staff will convert approximately 660,000 gallonsof waste into glass. This waste represents only 1% of the radioactive waste at SRS. Upon completion ofthis contract, the VTF will be available to process additional waste streams. At a grand opening hosted by Westinghouse Savannah River Company on October 28, DOE and S.C.state officials, as well as members of the local media, were on hand to see the DuraMelter 5000 convertradioactive waste to glass gems. BNFL/GTSD Team Wins at Hanford by Brad Bowan On September 25, 1996, GTS Duratek announced that it -- as a key member of the BNFL-led team --has been awarded a contract for the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) at the U.S. Department ofEnergy's Hanford Site in Washington state. The Hanford TWRS project is one of the largest and mostdifficult radioactive waste cleanup efforts in the United States. GTS Duratek will provide the technical andsupport services for converting both high- and low-level mixed waste into glass (vitrification). The totalcontract is estimated to be worth $4 billion over 11 years. The initial Phase 1-A is worth $27 million andwill take 16 months to complete. Phase 1-A starts with the design of a facility and initiation of the environmental permitting process. Based on its satisfaction with this work, the DOE will grant permission to begin Phase 1-B, which includesfacility construction, startup, and processing of 10% of the tank waste. Both phases are precursors toPhase 2 -- a project that could last 20 to 30 years -- during which the entire inventory of tank waste willbe converted to glass. The total TWRS project cost is estimated to reach from $20 billion to $40 billion. GTS Duratek's teammates include BNFL Inc, the American subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels plc,one of the world's largest processors of radioactive waste; Bechtel National, Inc., the leading provider ofproject and construction management in the United States; and Science Applications InternationalCorporation (SAIC), a multi-billion-dollar, employee-owned company with extensive DOE environmentalpermitting experience. Rolland Langley, president and CEO of BNFL Inc., said, "This is the first major win for theBNFL/GTS Duratek strategic alliance. It is a great beginning to what we plan to work on together." Robert E. Prince, president and CEO of GTS Duratek, added, "This is the largest vitrification projectin the world and one of the most important projects for the U.S. environment. Since 1991, the GTSDuratek management team has focused on getting both our technology and services primed for thiscontract. This award certainly marks an extremely significant milestone in our company's history." GTS Duratek Hosts Darman Book Signing by Angela Roe GTS Duratek's new corporate headquarters building, under construction, was the backdrop for a recentbook signing the Company hosted for Richard Darman, a managing director of The Carlyle Group, GTSDuratek's controlling shareholder. Darman's book, Who's In Control? Polar Politics and the Sensible Center, discusses how theAmerican bipartisan system has become polarized -- extreme left and right. The "once dependable,pragmatic center" in American politics seems to have vanished as each side seeks to further its own cause. Based on his extensive experience, Darman provides hope in the political system's "capacity for selfcorrection." He believes neither side can be in complete control of national policy; the "sensible center"will return to its rightful place between the left and the right, and compromise can again temper theextremes of the two camps. Richard Darman has served in six U.S. cabinet departments. He was also Assistant to the Presidentand Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan and Director of the Office of Managementand Budget in President Bush's cabinet. Since most of GTS Duratek's home office employees do not have access to Washington insiders, theydidn't know what to expect. Two minutes into Mr. Darman's commentary, they were captivated by hisknowledge, style, and honesty. Mr. Darman's comments about tactics and personalities on Capitol Hillwere entertaining as well as informative. GTS Duratek president and CEO, Bob Prince, said, "One of theadvantages of being associated with The Carlyle Group is that we have the opportunity to be exposed tosome of the most experienced former government executive leaders. It is a great benefit for our employees. We thank Mr. Darman for sharing his thoughts with us." Who's In Control by Richard Darman, published by Simon & Schuster, is available at book storeseverywhere. GTS Duratek Participant on Winning Team at Duke Power-Sponsored Golf Tournament by Stan Tollison It was a hot August 8th, both in temperature and golf scores for the Duke Power ESS/NDE-sponsoredUnited Way golf tournament, held at Woodbridge Golf Links near Kings Mountain, South Carolina. Temperatures of 90+ degrees wore most of the participants down by the end of the day. The team of Matt Bibb and Randy Dyer of Duke Power and Lou Kummer of GTS Duratek turned in ablistering 61 for the win. Four second-place teams turned in scores of 62, and the rest of the teams werearound 68. Twenty teams started, using a scramble format and shotgun start. The winning team turned in ninebirdies and two eagles. The winning hole for the team was the par-five, 488-yard number six, which,coincidentally, was sponsored by GTS Duratek. On top of that, because of the shotgun start, it was the lasthole they played. The team realized that they would need an eagle to cinch the win. Rising to the occasion,they carefully navigated the hole by hitting a great tee shot, followed by an outstanding second shot, whichput them 12 feet from the cup. Randy Dyer sunk the winning putt for the eagle. Prizes were awarded for everything from a hole-in-one to longest drive and closest to the pin on one ofthe par-threes. The winning team took home a free round of golf at a local private golf course and manyother prizes. Duke Power will sponsor another tournament next year, but has promised that all contractors will haveto play with no handicap, left-handed, blindfolded, and in their bare feet with no sunglasses. A great time was had by all with proceeds from the tournament going to the local United Way ofGreater Charlotte. New On-Line Data Base for Computer Services After nearly ten years of providing computer professional staff augmentation support for a wide varietyof clients, GTS Duratek's Computer Services group recently evaluated its business processes to identifyareas where improvements could be made. The main focus of this evaluation was the group's resume data base. It needed a sophisticated butuser-friendly data base that could track candidates, resumes, and clients in a more efficient manner. Afterseveral months of research, demos, and presentations, the group selected a state-of-the-art, on-line database. Now, in the process of implementation, Computer Services is already seeing the benefits of the newtool. With this fully integrated system, work flow is tracked from job opportunity through candidateapplication, submittal, and hire. Recruiters are able to perform both keyword and full-text searches ofcandidate records and resumes, on-line editing, and paperless faxing. GTS Duratek can submit resumes toclients via e-mail with one simple click of a mouse. Information on a candidate's status relating to jobsubmittal, interviews, and offers is tracked automatically by the system. Another benefit of this new data base is that its efficiency results in more time for recruiters to reachlarger numbers of candidates than before. It also allows account managers to spend more time outside ofthe office tracking down new job opportunities. Very clearly, GTS Duratek's Computer Services groupnow has a definite edge over the competition. GTS Duratek Supports DOE ES&H Training Efforts by Jeff Johnston The DOE's Office of Technical Training and Professional Development (EH-74) in the Office ofEnvironment, Safety and Health (EH) has contracted GTS Duratek to provide training to supportimplementation of the Department's Technical Qualification Program (TQP). The DOE created the TQPto enhance the technical knowledge level of DOE federal employees in a variety of disciplines. Under this contract, GTS Duratek provides the DOE with courses addressing radiation protectiontopics in three areas of the TQP: General Technical Base, Radiation Protection Functional Areas, andRadiation Protection Topical Areas. GTS Duratek's in-house subject matter experts and instructional technologists develop trainingmodules using the Instructional Systems Design (ISD) approach. The project consists of three phases:training material development, pilot program implementation, and training implementation. Approvedlesson plans, student manuals, visual training aids, and examination question banks cover all establishedobjectives and meet training requirements outlined in applicable sections of the TQP. The audience forthese training programs includes DOE headquarters employees from the Offices of EnvironmentalManagement (EM), Defense Programs (DP), and EH. As a result of GTS Duratek's support to DOE headquarters, Wackenhut Services, Inc. contracted GTSDuratek to assist in development and implementation of the Radiological and Nuclear PhysicsFundamentals elements of the TQP via interactive television broadcasts. Wackenhut operates the DOE's Central Training Academy (CTA) at Kirtland Air Force Base inAlbuquerque, New Mexico. GTS Duratek authored instructor scripts and developed and edited visual aids(video clips, photographs, still graphics, and animation sequences). In September, the Company's ownDean Iversen and Jeff Johnston donned coat, tie, and makeup and presented the live broadcasts via satellitefrom the CTA to 18 DOE sites nationwide (with an estimated audience of 500 to 1000 DOE personnel). Dean and Jeff secured their place in training history, since sessions were taped for distribution and futuretraining use throughout the DOE complex. Wackenhut has subsequently requested GTS Duratek to develop and present a similar broadcast fornon-radiological industrial safety and health topics within the TQP. This broadcast is tentatively scheduledfor January 16 and 17, 1997. DuraTherm Builds Industry Recognition by Joyce Frassanito DuraTherm, GTS Duratek's 80%-owned-subsidiary, recently received recognition for its advancedthermal desorption technology from the petroleum industry press and government entities. Oil & GasJournal, the leading paid subscription publication of the petroleum industry, featured DuraTherm'srecycling technology as the cover story for its September 16 issue. Hydrocarbon Reprocessing includedDuraTherm DesorptionTM in its August environmental issue. The U.S.-Asia Environmental Partnership(US-AEP) chose DuraTherm for the first issue of its Tech Report newsletter. That organization ischarged with matching Asian environmental needs with U.S. environmental experience, technology, andpractice. DuraTherm Receives Recycling Approval by Joyce Frassanito The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has approved the recycling ofprocess residues, from operation of the thermal desorber, into prefabricated concrete building products. Recycling eliminates the need for costly disposal of the process residue as hazardous waste. Brad Hogan,vice president of DuraTherm, originated the idea and led the project to obtain the state's acceptance. Theconcrete blocks, or "DuraBlocks," can be used for sea walls and other environmentally importantstructures. Recycling of the process residue into a useful product significantly lowers overall operatingcosts. Robert Hensel, president of DuraTherm, said, "This will provide our customers with a uniqueopportunity to have their listed waste residues incorporated into a recycled product that will not be subjectto Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. We have also recently developed theability to process more difficult waste streams, broadening the range of waste that we are able to acceptfrom our customers." Robert E. Prince, president and CEO of GTS Duratek, added, "DuraTherm can now recycle a processwaste residue into a useful product that has historically cost over $100 a ton for disposal in a hazardouslandfill. They are making a big step towards being a total recycling facility. Not only is it good for theenvironment to recycle this residue, it is also good business." We're Moving . . .

By Angela Roe "GTS Duratek has grown and prospered in Howard County over the last 12 years, and we look forward to a bright future here." Robert E. Prince, President & CEO, GTS Duratek On a brilliant sunny morning in June, most of the GTS Duratek employees in the Columbia, Maryland, office just got up and walked out. Was it mutiny? . . . sick day en masse? . . . not even close. There was something pretty special going on about a mile down the road and not one of them wanted to miss it. When they arrived, there were already a lot of people there: reporters, photographers, caterers, and state / county officials. Robert E. Prince, GTS Duratek's president and CEO, was excited _ and not only because of what was about to happen. (As you read on in this issue, you'll find out what Bob was looking forward to that evening.) This was the day that GTS Duratek had been dreaming about for a long time. This was the day that it was to break ground for the new corporate headquarters _ a $3.3 million facility, featuring a striking two-story glass entrance. A big smile was on the face of every person who stood at the podium to deliver praises to GTS Duratek; Manekin Corporation, the builder; and Howard County / Maryland State governments. The speakers included Cole Schnorf, senior vice president, development, Manekin; Richard Alter, president and CEO, Manekin; James Brady, secretary, Maryland State Department of Business and Economic Development; Beverly Wilhide, assistant to the county executive, Chuck Ecker; Richard Story, executive director, Howard County Economic Development Authority; and Robert Prince, president and CEO, GTS Duratek. GTS Duratek has been at the Guilford Road location for six years. It has since expanded into what used to be storage space and coworkers are trying ever so hard to smile and be polite as they step over each other in the hallways and hold meetings in the lunch room or even at their desks due to the insufficient number of conference rooms. This will be but a fond memory in December 1996, when they move into the spacious two-story, 35,000-square-foot facility. The new building will not only house the corporate offices, but will provide space for materials warehousing, pilot-scale melter testing, and ion exchange media production. GTS Duratek will lease from Manekin, but does have an option to buy the building at a later date. Plans include space for an additional 22,000-square-foot future expansion. GTSD Is Part of the Mixed Waste Solution at LANL By Ray Walker The Los Alamos office of GTS Duratek is providing technical and physical support for the Low-Level Mixed Waste Work Off Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. The objective of the project is to ship wastes off site for treatment and disposal rather than treating waste at LANL. The GTS Duratek team support includes performing historical reviews, sampling and repackaging mixed waste, analyzing analytical data, and profiling the mixed waste for treatment and disposal at potential commercial and U.S. Department of Energy treatment/disposal facilities. The results of the low-level mixed waste work off project have been excellent, with four successful off-site shipments completed in FY�96 and five more planned for later on this fiscal year. M-Area: Our Flagship Project By Mark Clements GTS Duratek has been involved in extensive systems testing since it was given the green light to begin operations at its Vendor Treatment Facility (VTF) at the U.S. Department of Energy�s Savannah River Site (SRS) in April. During the testing phase, GTS Duratek made the decision to enhance the system, which will extend the startup period, to ensure that it will be ready to run safely and efficiently for a long period of time. The DuraMelter 5000, the centerpiece of the Company�s vitrification system at the VTF, is a prototype for the melter to be built at the Hanford Tank Waste Cleanup in Richland, Washington, and is roughly one-third its size. The design changes being made now will further GTS Duratek�s knowledge for that important contract, due to be awarded in the fall of this year. Once systems testing is complete, radioactive operations will begin. The first batch of actual waste to be processed has been transferred to the chemical feed addition tank. Vitrification Day was held at SRS on May 29. The media was given a tour of the VTF. A brief presentation was made by Robert E. Prince, president and CEO, GTS Duratek. Also in May, the GTS Duratek crew held its First Annual Family Day. Bob Prince traveled to the site to personally thank everyone for their dedication and hard work on site and congratulate them on their success.When all is said and done at M-Area, it won�t spell the end for the VTF. The waste that will be processed at M-Area represents only one percent of the waste that is at SRS, and GTS Duratek is negotiating with Westinghouse Savannah River Company � who maintains and operates SRS � to send other waste streams to the VTF once this project is finished. CRU-4 Passes Tests with Flying Colors By Sarah Bennett and Emory Toomey Things are heating up at the Fernald Environmental Management Project, located outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. The DuraMelter 1000-HT is now up and running. This is GTS Duratek�s largest high-temperature melter, capable of producing up to three tons of glass per day. It is designed to operate at 1350oC, 200oC above other DuraMelters. Besides supplying Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Company (FERMCO) with the DuraMelter 1000-HT, GTS Duratek also supplied a gem machine that is capable of cutting the glass stream from the melter into "gems" (flattened marbles) and conveying the gems into designated drums. "DuraGems" were chosen because of their easy handling characteristics. The Construction Acceptance Tests were successfully completed on both the melter and gem machine in late April. Bakeout of the melter (the process of taking the melter from room temperature to its operating temperature and full of glass) commenced on May 18. This process took about three weeks and a total of about 6,000 pounds of glass was added to the melter. Integrated testing of the melter and support systems (feed and off-gas systems and the gem machine) began following bakeout. The GTS Duratek staff and representatives from The Catholic University of America�s Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL), the Company�s partner, assisted FERMCO through their Campaign 1 Systems Operability Test (SOT). Throughout this test, FERMCO successfully processed runs of 20% and 40% slurry-fed solids, which produced several hundred pounds of DuraGems. The SOT for Campaign 1 was completed on July 29. At present, GTS Duratek is preparing to support FERMCO through Campaign 2 which will encompass a 36-hour Melter Acceptance Test and an 8-hour Gem Machine Acceptance Test. These tests are currently anticipated to begin in mid to late August. The GTS Duratek support crew will remain assembled at Fernald through the end of September, and the VSL will supply scientific coverage through that period as necessary. Bob Prince Wins Entrepreneur of the Year Award By Angela Roe GTS Duratek�s president and CEO, Robert E. Prince, was honored as Entrepreneur of the Year for Maryland�s Technology category at an awards dinner on June 26 � the same day as the ground breaking for the new headquarters. What a day! Bob Prince won the award based on his achievements in bringing Duratek Corporation and General Technical Services together and creating a company " . . . on the cutting edge of providing an effective solution to one of our most pressing environmental [waste] problems." Robert F. Shawver, executive vice president and CFO of GTS Duratek had this to say on behalf of all employees: "The employees of GTS Duratek are all proud to be part of the success of GTS Duratek and its leader. We look forward to following Bob�s leadership in achieving future successes for all of our clients and shareholders. Through his example, Bob Prince has shown us all how to dream and achieve, and we congratulate him on this honor." What did Bob Prince have to say for himself? He was, of course, modest. "This award is not only for me, it�s for the whole company. We�ve got an excellent team of people who work together to accomplish aggressive goals, and we get the job done. The reason GTS Duratek is so successful is that we have the people part right." Entrepreneur of the Year is sponsored nationally by Ernst & Young LLP, the Entrepreneur of the Year Institute, the Center for Entrepreneur Leadership, Inc. at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. Local sponsors were The Baltimore Sun, Piper & Marbury, and Sprint. DuraTherm Passes Environmental Audits By Joyce Frassanito The DuraTherm Recycling Center returned to operations in May, following a major improvement and expansion program. Since then, the facility and its staff have undergone and passed numerous formal environmental audits and site visits by representatives from major petroleum, petrochemical, and environmental companies. This audit/approval process is an essential step for new customers when they first begin to use DuraTherm as part of their waste management programs. When choosing waste management vendors, these international companies impose a laundry list of stringent acceptance criteria before authorizing the vendors to process their waste. Surprisingly, not all of the criteria are directly related to the vendor�s waste processing capability. Some examples of the areas looked at include: professional expertise, range of capabilities, community relations, parent company�s stability and reputation, financial strength, regulatory permits and compliance, industry acceptance, and physical condition of the vendor�s facility. So far, DuraTherm has a 100 percent approval record, and its staff looks forward to continuing improvements in production and revenue contribution throughout the rest of the year.

Ensuring that these capabilities continue to serve the best interests of the research community requires periodic and open dialog between the earth sciences community and the program manager. The Antarctic Working Group for Geology and Geophysics is an ad hoc body whose role is to provide feed-back about current and planned research support capabilities available to Antarctic earth science projects supported by the National Science Foundation. The working group affords a broad conduit for exchange of information between the program manager and the earth-science research community. The group addresses concerns and priorities within the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics program, making recommendations for action where appropriate. It also provides a forum to raise and discuss general programmatic issues associated with new opportunities in earth science research as it perceives them, or as they are recognized by the wider earth-science community.

The working group meets formally twice a year at the N.S.F. building in Arlington, Virginia. Meetings are typically for a day and a half. Agenda items are those suggested either by OPP or by members of the working group. We welcome, however , suggestions to enhance effectiveness of OPP projects and logistics base from the earth science community, and we seek input on some topics currently under discussion. Topics that will be on the next agenda meeting include: Comprehensive report on Marine Geology and Geophysics capabilities and activities Update on marine corting capability and formation of a study group Potential use of the Nathanial B. Palmer as a platform for land-based geology Update on the development of a repository for signiificant specimens of Antarctic rocks and fossils together with a data base of present location of prior Antarctic rock and fossil collections.

The announcement presents "an opportunity for support of basicresearch to investigate and resolve, to the extent possible, recentlyreported evidence suggesting a biological origin for certain phenomenawithin Martian meteorite ALH84001. Up to $1.3 M will be madeavailable for this purpose in FY97 by the NSF Office of Polar Programsand the Division of Chemistry. This is not expected to be acontinuing program; in the future, proposals in this topical areashould be submitted to appropriate disciplinary programs. "The recent announcement of possible evidence of life in a Martianmeteorite (McKay et al., Science, v. 273 , p. 924-930, 16 August 1996)raises important and exciting issues about the origin of life in thesolar system and indeed in the universe. Because the evidencepresented is not conclusive, however, additional research evaluatingthese intriguing but controversial findings is appropriate. Besidesaffecting our understanding of life in the universe, results shouldlead to improved avenues for examining material that might be returnedfrom Mars in the future. "NASA has recently announced a separate but related researchopportunity (see NASA announcement NRA 96-OSS-14, released 29 November1996; available at: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/research/htm). NSF and NASA will coordinate award decisions in order to precludeduplication. "For further information, contact: Scott Borg (703 306-1033 or sborg@nsf.gov) of the Office of Polar Programs, or Margaret Cavanaugh(703 306-1842 or mcavanau@nsf.gov) of the Division of Chemistry, or Chris Maples (703 306-1551 or cmaples@nsf.gov) of the Division ofEarth Sciences." INTERACTION WITH MIDDLE-SCHOOL SYSTEMS Teachers and researchers with commitments to both the Antarctic and K-12 education programs may be interested to know of an initiative funded in part by the Office of Polar Programs, with the acronym "GLACIER." GLACIER, Global Links: Antarctic Climate and Ice Sheet Evolution Research,is an outgrowth of the WAIS Initiative. It is funded jointly by the Officeof Polar Programs and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.GLACIER is a collaborative project under the direction of Rice University(John Anderson) and Education Development Center (Clarice Yentsch). Theproject has two primary components, both under development: 1) a website designed to introduce Antarctica and its role in the globalsystem to the general public: http://zephyr.rice.edu/glacier and 2) a middle school inquiry-driven, cooperative-learning curriculum based onexploration of the Antarctic realm. The curriculum is designed tointegrate with the traditional Earth Science curriculum to provide ayear-long thematic framework for the science classroom. NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR HELICOPTER SUPPORT FOR REMOTE FIELD CAMPS As logistical operations for the continental system continue to evolve, new scenarios for helicopter support of USAP field research are being developed. The following briefly outlines 4 possible scenarios for helicopter-supported field work at remote sites. 1. Helo support for individual field teams. Helo support might be offered to small field parties requiring one-time, short-term (generally a few days only) support in order to reach otherwise inaccessible targets, or when major time efficiencies could be achieved through helo support. A single helicopter could support such an operation within an expanded McMurdo operations area (up to 300 nautical miles from McMurdo), where transit times are short and fuel caches can be staged with relative ease. A temporary, rudimentary camp (preferably tents only) would be established at the field site for the helo crew. This type of support request would need to be justified by the project P.I. as part of the overall logistical support request for the project. 2. Helo support for one or more field teams working in a common area. Helo operations could be provided during a series of short-term "support windows" of several days duration over the course of a field season. During these windows, field teams could complete camp moves and day trips to selected targets. Such operations could be carried out at field sites within approximately 600 nautical miles from McMurdo by 2 helicopters (to meet safety requirements). A temporary, rudimentary camp (preferably tents only) would be established at the field site for the helo crew. This type of support request would need to be justified by the project P.I.s as part of the logistical supportrequest, including statements explaining cooperative use of the helo support by multiple field parties. 3. Major helo-supported field camp. This model follows previous multi-project helo camps, such as at Beardmore (1985, 1990) and Shackleton Glacier (1995). Multiple field parties would be supported by helos based at a staffed field camp and supplied by fixed-wing aircraft. To justify the major logistic support that must be dedicated to such an operation, interested scientists should organize a workshop and produce a report to the NSF program manager outlining the scientific research goals and appending letters of interest from potential camp participants. Subsequently, a call for proposals would be made to the Antarctic earth science community. 4. Ship-based support. On-land field parties may be supported by helos based on a U.S. Antarctic Program research vessel (R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer or Polar Duke) or a U.S. Coast Guard vessel (Polar Star or Polar Sea). Helicopters cannot be deployed off the R/V Laurence M. Gould. Single or multiple field parties would be provided with ship-to-shore transit and local support on land. Helo support could be provided either during a dedicated cruise for that field party, or in conjunctionwith compatible marine cruises. This type of support request would need to be justified by the project P.I. as part of the overall logistical support request for the project. Specific questions regarding logistics feasibility should be addressed to OPP Operations personnel. Important note: Helicopters presently used in the USAP include A-Star 350 and Bell 212 aircraft, although these may change depending on project needs. Helicopter support in many of the cases outlined above may be augmented by or substituted with support from fixed-wing aircraft (LC-130 Hercules or Twin Otter). Consultation with OPP Operations personnel will help to identify the most feasible options for any particular science reques. AVAILABLE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND FACILITIES FOR REMOTE FIELD PARTIES Remote field parties in Antarctica include any science project working away froma fixed base or ship. Remote parties may be supported by a variety of resourcesintended to provide transit to the field site and local support. These resources include the following: helicopters (presently including A-Star 350 and Bell 212 aircraft, operated oncontract by Petroleum Helicopters, Inc.) LC-130 Hercules aircraft (operated by New York Air Guard for NSF) Twin Otter aircraft (operated on contract) R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer (operated on charter from Edison-Chouest Offshore), a 308-foot ice-class ABS A2 vessel R/V Polar Duke (operated by Rieber for ASA), a 219-foot ice-class 1AA vessel [the Polar Duke will be replaced by a new vessel of similar specifications currently under construction by Edison-Chouest in Louisiana; the new vessel, to be christened the R/V Laurence M. Gould, will begin sea trials in 1997]� SOAR airborne geophysics facility (operated as a contracted facility in support of aerogeophysics aboard an instrument-modified Twin Otter) Investigator(s) should consider any of these resources as possible options for support of their science project. Consultation with OPP Operations personnel will help to identify the most feasible options for any particular science request. Additional information may be obtained from Antarctic Support Associates . NEW WORKSHOP OPPORTUNITY Geological and Geophyscial Investigations of the East Antarctic Margin: A Workshop Discussion This workshop will examine new earth science research cruise initiatives along the Wilkes Land, Prydz Bay, Enderby Land and Queen Maud Land margins of East Antarctica. The objectives will be be divided into the following sub-disciplines: a) nearshore marine research with an emphasis on paleoclimatic studies; b) continental shelf to oceanic crust marine research stressing questions of breakup and rifting geometry; c) onshore pre-Tertiary geological and geophysical research looking at Gondwana assembly and breakup events; and d) onshore Late Tertiary studies, also primarily of paleoclimatic significance. The unifying element between these disciplines is the essential need to develop a circumpolar view of Antarctic earth sciences. Specific goals of the workshop are: Identify key earth science research objectives along the East Antarctic margin using research vessels. Develop collaborative efforts with other international programs along the East Antarctic margin, especially Australia, Japan and South Africa. Discuss logistical requirements and encourage coordinated projects Dates, Location and Participation The workshop will be held on February 21 to 23, 1997 at the Byrd Polar Research Center in Columbus, Ohio. The convenors of the workshop are Anne Grunow (Byrd Polar, email: grunow.1@osu.edu) and Amy Leventer (U of Minnesota, email: leven004@gold.tc.umn.edu). The workshop will be limited to 28 participants from US institutions, plus 4 international scientists invited to the meeting. We hope to have each of the 4 subgroups listed above equally represented (approximately 8 scientists per group). Applicants should send a detailed letter of interest to one of the workshop convenors no later than Jan. 24. If there are more than 28 applicants, participants will be selected based on unfilled subgroups and statements of interest. There are limited funds available to assist with airfare and hotel/meal expenses. OLDER COLLECTIONS The working group has been discussing the need for a US Antarctic rock and fossil repository. From extended discussions with members of the US community over the past year, there is clearly a perceived need to provide some sort of comprehensive material data base. It is also apparent that the US earth science community is at a serious competitive disadvantage with regard to use of previously collected Antarctic material for new scientific ventures. To address this problem, the WG has recommended to Scott Borg that he explore with the Smithsonian Institution and other interested institutions the possibility of developing an Antarctic rock and fossil repository for significant specimens. This facility would include a physical repository as well as a retrievable database. In the meantime, we are aware of the urgent need to deal with collections that are at some risk of being lost, as a result of retirements in particular. We suggest that interested individuals provide information about their collections that could be captured in a database. A preliminary database format that includes a list of information categories that may be included in a permanent database (including sample type, geographic location, collector, etc.) may be obtained from Terry Wilson (twilson@mps.ohio-state.edu). Questions concerning collections that are at risk may be directed to Scott Borg at NSF (sborg@nsf.gov).

Ensuring that these capabilities continue to serve the best interests of the research community requires periodic and open dialog between the earth sciences community and the program manager. The Antarctic Working Group for Geology and Geophysics is an ad hoc body whose role is to provide feed-back about current and planned research support capabilities available to Antarctic earth science projects supported by the National Science Foundation. The working group affords a broad conduit for exchange of information between the program manager and the earth-science research community. The group addresses concerns and priorities within the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics program, making recommendations for action where appropriate. It also provides a forum to raise and discuss general programmatic issues associated with new opportunities in earth science research as it perceives them, or as they are recognized by the wider earth-science community.

It is one of the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities found in humans, occurring once in approximately every 800 to 1,000 live births. Over 250,000 people, in the United States alone, are affected by Down syndrome. When was Down syndrome discovered? For centuries, people with Down syndrome have been alluded to in art, literature and science. It wasn't until the late 19th century, however, that John Langdon Down, an English physician, published an accurate description of a person with Down syndrome. It was this scholarly work, published in 1866, which earned Down the recognition as the "father" of the syndrome. Although other people had previously recognized the characteristics of the syndrome, it was Down who described the condition as a distinct and separate entity. Throughout the 20th century, advances in medicine and science enabled researchers to investigate the characteristics of people with Down syndrome. In 1959, the French physician, Jerome Lejeune, identified Down syndrome as a chromosomal anomaly. Instead of the usual 46 chromosomes present in each cell, Lejeune observed 47 in the cells of individuals with Down syndrome. It was later determined that an extra partial or complete 21st chromosome results in the characteristics associated with Down syndrome. Why is Down syndrome referred to as a "genetic condition?" The human body is made of cells; all cells contain a center, called a nucleus, in which genetic material is stored. This genetic material, known as genes, carries the codes responsible for all our inherited characteristics. Genes are grouped along rod-like structures called chromosomes. Normally, the nucleus of each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, half of which are inherited from each parent. In Down syndrome, however, the cells usually contain not 46, but 47 chromosomes; with the extra chromosome being a number 21. This excess genetic material, in the form of additional genes along the 21st chromosome, results in Down syndrome. Because 95 percent of all cases of Down syndrome occur because there are three copies of the 21st chromosome, it is often referred to as "trisomy 21." Chromosomes may be studied by examining blood or tissue cells. Individual chromosomes are identified, stained and numbered from largest to smallest. The visual display of the chromosomes is known as a karyotype. What causes Down syndrome? Down syndrome is usually caused by an error in cell division called non-disjunction. However, two other types of chromosomal abnormalities, mosaicism and translocation, are also implicated in Down syndrome--although to a much lesser extent. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome which a person may have, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of the number 21 chromosome present in all, or some, of their cells. This additional genetic material alters the course of development and causes the characteristics associated with the syndrome. Nondisjunction is a faulty cell division which results in an embryo with three number 21 chromosomes instead of two. Prior to, or at, conception, a pair of number 21 chromosomes, in either the sperm or the egg, fail to separate. As the embryo develops, the extra chromosome is replicated in every cell of the body. This faulty cell division is responsible for 95 percent of all cases of Down syndrome. Why nondisjunction occurs is currently unknown, although it does seem to be related to advancing maternal age. Many people are surprised to find out that 80 percent of children born with Down syndrome are born to women under 35 years of age. This is because younger women have higher fertility rates. It does not contradict the fact that the incidence of births of children with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. Although nondisjunction can be of paternal origin, this occurs less frequently. Because this error in cell division is often present in the egg prior to conception, and women are born with their complete store of eggs, it has been postulated that some environmental factors may be implicated in nondisjunction. However, despite years of research, the cause (or causes) of nondisjunction, is still unknown. There seems to be no connection between any type of Down syndrome and parents' activities, before or during pregnancy. Mosaicism occurs when nondisjunction of the 21st chromosome takes place in one of the initial cell divisions after fertilization. When this occurs, there is a mixture of two types of cells, some containing 46 chromosomes and some containing 47. Those cells with 47 chromosomes contain an extra 21st chromosome. Because of the "mosaic" pattern of the cells, the term mosaicism is used. Mosaicism is rare, being responsible for only 1 to 2 percent of all cases of Down syndrome. Some research has shown that individuals with mosaic Down syndrome are less affected than those with trisomy 21; however, broad generalizations are not possible due to the wide range of abilities that people with Down syndrome possess. Translocation is a different type of chromosomal problem and occurs in only 3 to 4 percent of people with Down syndrome. Translocation occurs when part of the number 21 chromosome breaks off during cell division and attaches to another chromosome. While the total number of chromosomes in the cells remains 46, the presence of an extra part of the number 21 chromosome causes the features of Down syndrome. As with nondisjunction trisomy 21, translocation occurs either prior to or at conception. Unlike nondisjunction, maternal age is not linked to the risk of translocation. Most cases are sporadic, chance events. However, in about one-third of cases, one parent is a carrier of a translocated chromosome. For this reason, the risk of recurrence for translocation is higher than that of nondisjunction. Genetic counseling can be sought to determine the origin of the translocation. What is the chance of having a second child with Down syndrome? In general, it is estimated that the risk of having a second child with trisomy 21 or mosaic Down syndrome is about 1 in 100. The risk is higher if one parent is a carrier of a translocated cell. Are any prenatal tests available to detect Down syndrome? Yes. There are two types of procedures available to pregnant women: screening tests and diagnostic tests. Screening tests estimate the risk of the fetus having Down syndrome; diagnostic tests tell whether or not the fetus actually has the condition. The most commonly used screening tests are the Triple Screen and the Alpha-fetoprotein Plus. These tests measure quantities of various substances in the blood (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and unconjugated estriol) and together with the woman's age, estimate her risk of having a child with Down syndrome. These screening tests are typically offered between fifteen and twenty weeks of gestation. Screening tests are of limited value and are often performed in conjunction with a detailed sonogram. These tests are only able to accurately detect about sixty percent of fetuses with Down syndrome. Many women who undergo these tests will be given false-positive readings, and some women will be given false-negative readings. The procedures available for prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome are chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis and percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS). Each one of these procedures carries a small risk of miscarriage as tissue is extracted from the placenta or the umbilical cord to examine the fetus's chromosomes. The procedures are about 98 to 99 percent accurate in the detection of Down syndrome. Amniocentesis is usually performed between 12 and 20 weeks of gestation, CVS between 8 and 12 weeks and PUBS after 20 weeks. How is Down syndrome diagnosed in the newborn? The diagnosis of Down syndrome is usually suspected after birth as a result of the baby's appearance. It is a particularly difficult time, coupled with the natural stresses of childbirth. Although there is no easy way to be informed, most families agree that having the baby present, being together, and being told as soon as possible is the best way to proceed. There are many physical characteristics which form the basis for suspecting an infant has Down syndrome. Many of these characteristics are found, to some extent, in the general population of individuals who do not have Down syndrome. Hence, if Down syndrome is suspected, a karyotype will be performed to ascertain the diagnosis. Some infants with Down syndrome have only a few of these traits, while others have many. Among the most common traits are: *Muscle hypotonia, low muscle tone *Flat facial profile, a somewhat depressed nasal bridge and a small nose *Oblique palpebral fissures, an upward slant to the eyes *Dysplastic ear, an abnormal shape of the ear *Simian crease, a single deep crease across the center of the palm *Hyperflexibility, an excessive ability to extend the joints *Dysplastic middle phalanx of the fifth finger, fifth finger has one flexion furrow instead of two *Epicanthal folds, small skin folds on the inner corner of the eyes *Excessive space between large and second toe *Enlargement of tongue in relationship to size of mouth Do babies with Down syndrome have medical problems? Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for certain health problems. Congenital heart defects, increased susceptibility to infection, respiratory problems, obstructed digestive tracts and childhood leukemia occur with greater frequency among children who have Down syndrome. However, advances in medicine have rendered most of these health problems treatable, and the majority of people born with Down syndrome today have a life expectancy of approximately fifty-five years. Adults with Down syndrome are at increased risk for Alzheimer�s disease. Whereas approximately 6% of the general population will develop the disease, the figure is about 25% for people with Down syndrome. Many individuals with Down syndrome have the changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer�s, but do not necessarily develop the clinical disorder. How does Down syndrome affect a person's development? All people with Down syndrome have some level of mental retardation; however, the level usually falls into the mild to moderate range and is not indicative of the many strengths and talents that each individual possesses. Children with Down syndrome learn to sit, walk, talk, play, toilet train and do most other activities--only somewhat later than their peers without Down syndrome. Because speech is often delayed, careful attention should be paid to the child's hearing, as retention of fluid in the inner ear is a very common cause of hearing and speech difficulties. Early intervention services, which begin shortly after birth, help children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. Quality educational programs, along with a stimulating home environment and good medical care enable people with Down syndrome to become contributing members of their families and communities. People with Down syndrome are highly responsive to their physical and social environment. Those who receive good medical care and are included in the activities of the community can be expected to adapt successfully--to attend school, make friends, find work, participate in decisions which affect them and make a positive contribution to society. The person with Down syndrome has the same emotions and needs as any other person and deserves the same opportunities. What does the future hold for people with Down syndrome? People with Down syndrome are people first. They may have some of the characteristics generally associated with this condition, but they are overwhelmingly unique and must be treated as individuals. Over the past few decades, beginning with Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, continuing with The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, and culminating with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1991, people with Down syndrome have been granted equal protections under federal law. Ensuring equal treatment and access to services is a struggle that every family of a child with Down syndrome faces. Daily, these individuals strive to accomplish the same goals as everyone else: self-fulfilment, pride in one's achievements, inclusion in the activities of the community and the challenge of reaching one's full potential. Daily, people with Down syndrome venture out into the community: to schools, jobs and leisure activities. Some live with family, some with friends and some independently. They form ongoing interpersonal relationships and some may marry. Women with Down syndrome are fertile and can have children. The opportunities available to people with Down syndrome today have never been greater. However, it is only through the collective efforts of parents, professionals and concerned citizens that acceptance is becoming widespread. It is the goal of the National Down Syndrome Society to ensure that all people with Down syndrome are provided the opportunity to achieve their full potential in all aspects of community life. Questions and Answers About Down Syndrome Why should we be concerned about Down syndrome? Chromosomal abnormalities are a widespread medical problem, with Down syndrome being the most common genetic condition. One in every 800 to 1,000 children is born with Down syndrome. More than 50 percent of miscarriages are caused by a chromosomal abnormality. As many as 25 percent of all miscarriages are caused by a \223trisomy,\224 which is the presence of three copies of a particular chromosome, rather than the normal two. The most common form of Down syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21, because it involves an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. Twenty to 25 percent of children conceived with Down syndrome survive past birth. What impact does Down syndrome have on society? Individuals with Down syndrome are becoming increasingly integrated into society and community organizations, such as school, health care systems, work forces, and social and recreational activities. Individuals with Down syndrome possess varying degrees of mental retardation, from very mild to severe. Most people with Down syndrome have IQs in the mild to moderate range of mental retardation. Due to advances in medical technology, individuals with Down syndrome are living longer than ever before. In 1910, children with Down syndrome were expected to survive to age 9. With the discovery of antibiotics, the average survival age increased to 19 or 20. Now, with recent advancements in clinical treatment, as many as 80 percent of adults with Down syndrome reach age 55, and many live even longer. In the United States, approximately 250,000 families are affected by Down syndrome. Approximately 5,000 children with Down syndrome are born each year. As the mortality rate associated with Down syndrome is decreasing, the prevalence of individuals with Down syndrome in our society will increase. Some experts project that the number of people with Down syndrome will double in the next 10 years. More and more Americans will interact with individuals with this genetic condition, increasing the need for widespread public education and acceptance. Is Down syndrome transmitted from the mother or father? The additional genetic material which causes Down syndrome can originate from either the father or the mother. Approximately 5 percent of the cases have been traced to the father. Who has the highest risk of having a child with Down syndrome? Down syndrome affects people of all races and economic levels. Women age 35 and older have a significantly increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome. A 35-year-old woman has a one in 400 chance of conceiving a child with Down syndrome, and this chance increases gradually to one in 110 by age 40. At age 45 the incidence becomes approximately one in 35. Since many couples are postponing parenting until later in life, the incidence of Down syndrome conceptions is expected to increase. Therefore, genetic counseling for parents is becoming increasingly important. Still, many physicians are not fully informed about advising their patients about the of incidence of Down syndrome, advancements in diagnosis, and the protocols for care and treatment of babies born with Down syndrome. Why is it important to raise children with Down syndrome at home? A greater understanding of Down syndrome and advancements in treatment of Down syndrome-related health problems have allowed people with Down syndrome to enjoy fuller and more active lives. Children raised at home and included in all aspects of community life can best reach their potential and function in society with a greater degree of independence. Parental love, nurturing, and support, as well as early intervention programs, educational opportunities, and community involvement, have a direct relationship to the degree that a person with Down syndrome is able to achieve his/her potential. Why are medical researchers following Down syndrome work so closely? Down syndrome is a developmental disorder. As researchers learn more about the molecular genetics and other aspects of Down syndrome, they also obtain valuable information about human development and can advance the study of many biological processes. In addition, individuals with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of certain medical problems, and the study of Down syndrome may yield important breakthroughs in those areas. Research in Down syndrome provides a way for looking at many important problems:Heart disease - Up to 50 percent of individuals with Down syndrome are born with congenital heart defects. The majority of heart defects in children with Down syndrome can now be surgically corrected with resulting long-term health improvements. However, scientists continue to search for the cause of this problem, and look for means of prevention. Alzheimer's disease - Estimates vary, but it is reasonable to conclude that 25 percent or more of individuals with Down syndrome over the age of 35 will develop the clinical signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia. Leukemia - Individuals with Down syndrome have a 15 to 20 times greater risk of developing leukemia. The majority of cases are categorized as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, which tends to occur in the first three years of life, and for which there is a high cure rate. A transient form of leukemia is also seen in newborns with Down syndrome, disappearing spontaneously during the first two to three months of life. Why hasn't Down syndrome received much attention in the past? Even though Dr. Jerome Lejeune discovered in 1959 that it was an extra 21st chromosome that caused Down syndrome, it is only in the last few years that a focus has been placed on the study of the 21st chromosome. Why? Because we now have the technology to isolate specific genes and genetic material. The momentum is increasing. Chromosome 21 is the first chromosome to be fully mapped, and is a prototype for the federally funded genome mapping project. Up to 1,000 genes exist on the 21st chromosome. We have already identified between 30 to 35 genes and gene products - and new findings are occurring rapidly. Researchers continue to look for the genes related to the development of intelligence and the physical characteristics associated with Down syndrome. Once identified, it is hoped that the biochemical process which causes Down syndrome can be decoded, leading to the development of an intervention and cure. What is the National Down Syndrome Society doing to further research? NDSS is currently sponsoring three scientists through the NDSS Science Scholar Award Program initiated in 1983. Under this grant program, each researcher receives $30,000 a year for two years to carry out scientific research into the causes and/or amelioration of Down syndrome. To date, more than 20 scholars have been supported under this program. NDSS also sponsors a series of annual symposia focusing on Down syndrome research. This sharing of information, technology, and the collective knowledge of the world's foremost researchers is expected to produce an acceleration of advancements in a variety of areas. The proceedings of these scientific symposia are published annually and are available through NDSS. How can I obtain further information?

Truth: Down syndrome is the most commonly occuring genetic condition. One in every 800 to 1,000 live births is a child with Down syndrome, representing approximately 5,000 births per year in the United States alone. Today, Down syndrome affects more than 250,000 people in the United States. Myth: Most children with Down syndrome are born to older parents. Truth: Eighty percent of children born with Down syndrome are born to women younger than 35-years-old. However, the incidence of births of children with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. Myth: People with Down syndrome are severely retarded. Truth: Most people with Down syndrome have IQs that fall in the mild to moderate range of retardation. Children with Down syndrome are definitely educable, and educators and researchers are still discovering the full educational potential of people with Down syndrome. Myth: Most people with Down syndrome are institutionalized. Truth: Today people with Down syndrome live at home with their families and are active participants in the educational, vocational, social and recreational activities of the community. They are integrated into the regular education system, and take part in sports, camping, music, art programs, and all the other activities of their communities. In addition, they are socializing with people with and without disabilities, and as adults are obtaining employment and living in group homes and other independent housing arrangements. Myth: Parents will not find community support in bringing up their child with Down syndrome. Truth: In almost every community of the United States there are parent support groups and other community organizations directly involved in providing services to families of individuals with Down syndrome. Myth: Children with Down syndrome must be placed in segregated special education programs. Truth: Children with Down syndrome have been included in regular academic classrooms in schools across the country. In some instances they are integrated into specific courses, while in other situations students are fully included in the regular classroom for all subjects. The degree of mainstreaming is based in the abilities of the individual; but the trend is for full inclusion in the social and educational life of the community. Myth: Adults with Down syndrome are unemployable. Truth: Businesses are seeking young adults with Down syndrome for a variety of positions. They are being employed in small and medium sized offices: by banks, corporations, nursing homes, hotels and restaurants. They work in the music and entertainment industry, in clerical positions, and in the computer industry. People with Down syndrome bring to their jobs enthusiasm, reliability, and dedication. Myth: People with Down syndrome are always happy. Truth: People with Down syndrome have feelings just like everyone else in the population. They respond to positive expressions of friendship, and they are hurt and upset by inconsiderate behavior. Myth: Adults with Down syndrome are unable to form close interpersonal relationships leading to marriage. Truth: People with Down syndrome date, socialize and form on-going relationships. Some are beginning to marry. Women with Down syndrome can and do have children, but there is a 50 percent chance that their child will have Down syndrome. Men with Down syndrome are believed to be sterile, with only one documented instance of a male with Down syndrome who has fathered a child. Myth: Down syndrome can never be cured. Truth: Research on Down syndrome is making great strides in identifying the genes on chromosome 21 that cause the characteristics of Down syndrome. Scientists now feel strongly that it will be possible to improve, correct, or prevent many of the problems associated with Down syndrome in the future.

Approximately half of all infants born with Down syndrome have a heart defect. Many of these defects have serious implications and it is important to understand them and how they may adversely affect the child so that we may provide the most appropriate medical care. Question: What are the most common heart defects in children with Down syndrome? Answer: The most common defects are Atrioventricular Septal Defect (formally called Endocardial Cushion Defect), Ventricular Septal Defect, Persistent Ductus Arteriosus and Tetralogy of Fallot. Question: What is an Atrioventricular Septal Defect? Answer: An Atrioventricular Septal Defect is caused by a failure of tissue to come together in the heart during embryonic life. This results in a large opening in the center of the heart, with usually a hole between the two pumping chambers (a Ventricular Septal Defect) and between the two collecting chambers (an Atrial Septal Defect) as well as abnormalities of the two atrioventricular valves, the mitral and tricuspid valves. This defect occurs in nearly 60% of the children with Down syndrome who are born with congenital heart disease. In less severe cases, Ventricular Septal Defects and Atrial Septal Defects can also occur separately. Question: What is Persistent Ductus Arteriosus? Answer: The ductus arteriosus is a channel between the pulmonary artery and the aorta and during fetal life diverts blood away from the lungs. After birth this channel usually closes on the first day of life. If it does not close, it is termed "persistent" and results in an increased flow of blood into the lungs. Question: What is Tetralogy of Fallot? Answer: This is a term given to a heart condition in which there is both a Ventricular Septal Defect and a narrowing of the passage from the right ventricle to the lungs causing Pulmonary Stenosis. The Pulmonary Stenosis causes the blue blood in the right ventricle to cross the Ventricular Septal Defect into the aorta and produces what is commonly called a "blue baby." Question: What are the effects of Atrioventricular Septal Defect, Ventricular Septal Defect and Persistent Ductus Arteriosus? Answer: These defects result in increased blood flow going to the lungs as the blood goes through the septal defects or the ductus from the high pressure left heart into the low pressure right heart. This flooding of the lungs results in a buildup of pressure in the pulmonary circulation and this higher pressure and high flow leads to damage to the pulmonary circulation, and pulmonary hypertension. In the first few months of life, signs of heart failure may be prominent with rapid breathing and failure to grow and gain weight. Later, progressive damage to the blood vessels and the lungs may result in reversal of the shunt and blueness of the skin (cyanosis). Question: What is the relationship of heart defects to the respiratory system? Answer: The lungs of children with Down syndrome do not develop as fully as in the general population. Consequently, the growth of blood vessels throughout the lungs is limited. The narrowed arteries of the lungs hold potential for long-lasting damage in the face of increased pressure and flow of blood through the lungs. Question: How are the defects diagnosed? Answer: Some children with Down syndrome and major heart defects will present with heart failure, difficulty breathing and failure to thrive in the newborn period; however, because in some children the defect may not be at first apparent, it is important that all children born with Down syndrome, even those who have no symptoms of heart disease, should have an echocardiogram in the first 2 or 3 months of life. Question: What is the recommended treatment? Answer: Heart surgery to correct the defects is recommended and it must be done before age 5 or 6 months in order to prevent lung damage. Although the complexity of the defects raises the risk of surgery slightly above that of surgery on children without Down syndrome, successful surgery will allow many of the affected children to thrive as well as any child with Down syndrome who is born with a normal heart. There may be residual defects (such as imperfect valves, in cases of Atrioventricular Septal Defect), but their effect on health is often minimal. Question: What are the guidelines for choosing a hospital? Answer: Look for a medical center in a major metropolitan area which has experience in open heart surgery on infants, and experience in operating on infants with Down syndrome in particular. A hospital which conducts at least ten such operations a year, with a good survival rate, would be considered an experienced hospital. Question: What should be considered in selecting a surgical team? Answer: Again, experience, together with the parents' rapport with the physician, should be the determining factor in the choice. It is important that an experienced anesthesiologist be selected, as children with Down syndrome often have airway problems. SUMMARY * Congenital cardiac defects occur in up to 50 percent of children with Down syndrome. * Early diagnosis via echocardiogram is crucial within the first two months of life, even if no symptoms are present. * The majority of heart defects in children with Down syndrome can be surgically corrected with resulting long-term health improvements. * Experience and success are the key factors in selecting a hospital and surgical team for heart surgery on infants with Down syndrome.

ENDOCRINE CONDITIONS IN DOWN SYNDROME by Dr. Ernest McCoy Professor of Pediatrics University of Alberta Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of endocrine problems than the general population. The endocrine system refers to a set of glands which includes the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands. Question: What is hypothyroidism? Answer: Hypothyroidism results from a malfunctioning thyroid gland, which decreases the synthesis of the hormone thyroxin. Thyroxin is the hormone that promotes growth of the brain and other body tissue. Question: How common is hypothyroidism? Answer: Hypothyroidism is the most common endocrine problem in children with Down syndrome. One study showed these individuals to be 28 times more prone to congenital hypothyroidism than the general population. It is estimated that approximately ten percent of children with Down syndrome have congenital or acquired thyroid disease. Incidence of thyroid disease in adults with this genetic disorder varies from 13 to 50 percent. Hypothyroidism can occur at any time from infancy through adulthood. Question: How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Answer: All individuals with Down syndrome should be tested for hypothyroidism at birth, and at periodic intervals (at least every two years) thereafter. The indicators of hypothyroidism---enlarged tongue, constipation, poor circulation---are also found in individuals who are not hypothyroid, so the blood test for thyroid function is an important diagnostic test. As the thyroid hormone affects normal development of the brain, testing of infants is particularly crucial. Question: What treatment exists for hypothyroidism? Answer: The thyroid hormone, thyroxin, is readily replaced through medication. Question: What is hyperthyroidism? Answer: In this case, the thyroid gland is overactive. Symptoms are swelling in the neck, abnormal sweating, and rapid pulse rate. No evidence exists as to whether hyperthyroidism is more prevalent in individuals with Down syndrome than in the general population. Question: What is the treatment for hyperthyroidism? Answer: This thyroid malfunction can be treated pharmacologically, blocking the synthesis of thyroid hormone through medication. It can also be treated with radioactive compounds to destroy the gland, or by surgically removing a portion of the thyroid gland. Question: Are people with Down syndrome more prone to diabetes? Answer: There is not sufficient data available at this point to know if there is increased risk for children with Down syndrome to develop type 1 diabetes as compared to the rate for their peers in the general population. However, research suggests that individuals who develop one type of endocrine autoimmune disorder, such as thyroiditis, are more likely to develop a second disorder, such as type 1 diabetes. Question: What is the status of research on use of the growth hormone for children with Down syndrome? Answer: Use of growth hormone for children with Down syndrome is still in experimental stages. There are reports of increased rates of growth in children with down syndrome who received the hormone for a brief period; however, these reports were not controlled studies, so there is no scientific evidence that long-term administration of the hormone would increase final height. Question: Can any growth hormone be administered to any Down syndrome child? Answer: At present, doctors are licensed to prescribe growth hormone for individuals with Down syndrome only when there is a demonstrated deficiency of that hormone. It is strongly advised that such treatment be obtained only through a clinical trial until long-term benefits are demonstrated. SUMMARY * Approximately 10 percent of children with Down syndrome, and between 13 to 50 percent of adults with this genetic disorder, have thyroid disease. Hypothyroidism, an underfunctioning thyroid gland, is the most common condition. * Hyporthyroidism must be diagnosed by a standard blood test, beginning at infancy and continuing at regular intervals throughout the life span. * Hyporthyroidism is easily treated with replacement thyroxine hormone; treatment is particularly crucial for hypothyroid infants, as the hormone affects normal development of the brain. However, this thyroid disease can be developed at any time in the life span. * Hyperthyroidism is an overactive thyroid gland. Diagnosis is also by blood test. The condition can be treated by medication, surgery, or use of radioactive iodine to destroy the gland. * Insufficient evidence exists on the issue of whether individuals with Down syndrome are more prone to type 1 diabetes. Research does suggest that individuals who develop one type of endocrine autoimmune disorder, such as thyroid disease, run a higher risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes. * While some short-term uncontrolled studies on the use of growth hormone for children with down syndrome have demonstrated growth spurts, there is no long-term research to demonstrate an increase in final height. Growth hormone should be administered only as part of a clinical trial until long-term benefits are demonstrated. Books/Newsletters: Endocrine Conditions in Down Syndrome, McCoy, E. (1995).

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE by Dr. Ira Lott Professor of Pediatrics University of California at Irvine Alzheimer's Disease, a degenerative neurological disorder characterized by progressive memory loss, personality deterioration and loss of functional motor capabilities, is far more common in individuals with Down syndrome than the general population. However, not all individuals with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer's disease, and even those showing Alzheimer's-type symptoms may not have Alzheimer's disease since other conditions can mimic the symptoms. Question: How common is Alzeheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome? Answer: Estimates vary, but it seems reasonable to conclude that 25 percent or more of individuals with Down syndrome over age 35 show clinical signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia; the percentage increases with age. In the general population, Alzheimer's disease does not usually develop prior to age 50, and the highest incidence, in people over age 65, is between 5 and 10 percent. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the Down syndrome population is estimated to be 3 to 5 times greater than in the general population. Question: What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? Answer: Early symptoms include loss of memory and logical thinking; personality change; decline in daily living skills; new onset of seizures; changes in coordination and gait; and loss of continence in bladder and bowel habits. Question: Aren't these symptoms common to some other diseases and conditions, especially depression? Answer: Yes. Alzheimer's disease is difficult to diagnose. It is important to be certain Alzheimer's-type symptoms do not arise from other conditions, namely thyroid disorders, depressive illness by psychiatric criteria, brain tumor, recurrent brain strokes, metabolic imbalances, and various neurological conditions. Question: How is final diagnosis ascertained? Answer: The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made on the basis of clinical history, showing a slow, steady decrease in cognitive function, and a variety of laboratory tests which provide contributory evidence, including electroencephalogram, brain stem auditory evoked response, computerized transaxial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging among other tests and measurements. Question: Is there a base line test that can be repeated at intervals to determine specific decrease in cognitive function? Answer: Psychologists use questionnaires that assist in the early detection of dementia. It is recommended that individuals with Down syndrome be tested at age 30 to provide a baseline reading, and periodically thereafter. If the tests show deterioration, further tests must be made to rule out diseases which present similar symptoms. Question: What information has research yielded thus far about a link between Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome? Answer: Current research shows that the extra "gene dosage" caused by the abnormal third chromosome of Down syndrome may have a causative relationship for Alzheimer's disease. Interest is also focused on the early onset of Alzheimer's in individuals with Down syndrome, which may be related to the early aging of the Down syndrome brain. Question: How can research into the Alzheimer's-Down syndrome be advanced? Answer: Research into the linkage has been slowed due to the paucity of Down syndrome brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Contributions to a brain tissue repository for purposes of extending knowledge about the relationship between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease will help to advance research in this area. For information for families and physicians considering such a donation, please contact the National Down Syndrome Society at 800-221-4602. SUMMARY * Individuals with Down syndrome are 3 to 5 times more likely than the general population to develop Alzheimer's disease. Onset of Alzheimer's may begin as early as age 30 in the Down syndrome population as compared to age 50 in the general population. * Symptoms of a variety of other diseases and conditions mimic the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease: personality change, decline in daily living skills, memory loss, changes in coordination and gait and other changes. Diseases and conditions such as depression, thyroid disorders, brain tumor, recurrent brain strokes, metabolic imbalances, and various neurological conditions must be ruled out prior to diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. * It is recommended that individuals with Down syndrome take a baseline test of cognitive function at age 30, and that this test be repeated annually to determine any deterioration in this function. Some Alzheimer's disease symptoms can be treated, although there is no current means of curing or arresting the disease. * Current research suggests a causative link between the extra "gene dosage" from the third chromosome 21 of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. To advance research, donations of brain tissue from individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease are being sought.

SEXUALITY IN DOWN SYNDROME by Dr. William Schwab Associate Professor Department of Family Medicine and Practice University of Wisconsin Human sexuality encompasses an individual's self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and social experiences relating to dating, marriage, and the physical aspects of sex. Sex education, appropriate for the developmental level and intellectual attainment of individuals with Down syndrome, helps in engendering healthy sexuality, preventing unwanted pregnancy and diseases, and in alleviating other problems related to sexual function. Question: Do individuals with Down syndrome have sexual feelings? Answer: In the past, sexuality was not considered an issue for young people with Down syndrome because of the inaccurate belief that mental retardation was equivalent to permanent childhood. In fact, all people with Down syndrome do have intimacy needs, and it is important that these be recognized and planned for in education, residential and other programs and settings. Question: Do children with Down syndrome develop physically the same way as their peers in the general population? Answer: Children with Down syndrome experience the same sequence of physical and hormonal changes associated with puberty as other children their age. Question: Do children with Down syndrome experience the emotional upheavals characteristic of adolescence? Answer: The emotional changes characteristic of adolescence are also present in children with Down syndrome, and may be intensified by social factors. Any adolescent who lives in the community, attends school, and is exposed to media inevitably develops an awareness of sexuality. Teenagers and young adults with Down syndrome often express interest in dating, marriage and parenthood. They can be expected to experience typical adolescent changes in mood and outlook. Question: What kind of sex education is appropriate for individuals with Down syndrome? Answer: To be effective, education must be individualized and understandable, focusing not only on the physical reproductive aspects, but also positioning sexuality within the context of all interpersonal relationships. An ideal curriculum will ensure that the individual's understanding of relationships, sexual intercourse and parenting is factual, realistic, and socially acceptable. Question: How can healthy sexuality be encouraged for individuals with Down syndrome? Answer: Creating an environment conducive to healthy sexual expression must be considered in designing educational, vocational, recreational and residential programs. Positive sexual awareness can only develop through self-esteem, understanding of social relationships, and personal interaction/communication skills. All these factors influence how intimacy needs are met. Question: Do women with Down syndrome have any special needs or concerns in regard to birth control? Answer: Women with Down syndrome are fertile and may use any method of contraception without added medical risk. The method chosen will depend on personal preference, ability to use the contraceptive effectively, and possible side effects. Surgical sterilization may also be performed without added risk for women with Down syndrome who are in stable medical condition; however, availability of this procedure to women who are developmentally disabled may be controlled by state law. Question: Are there any special needs for individuals with Down syndrome in regard to disease prevention? Answer: Men and women with Down syndrome have the same susceptibility to sexually transmitted diseases as the rest of the population. Use of condoms during sexual intercourse is the best known form of protection against AIDS, herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases. Question: How can a person with Down syndrome be protected against sexual abuse? Answer: It is highly recommended that age-appropriate education in protective behaviors should begin in childhood and be reinforced throughout the life of the person with Down syndrome. Individuals with Down syndrome must be taught the boundaries of normal physical interactions in the social sphere, as well as the self-assertion skills to enlist help if necessary. FEMALE SEXUALITY IN DOWN SYNDROME Question: Do girls with Down syndrome have normal menstrual periods? Answer: Menstruation for girls with Down syndrome is no different than for their peers in the general population. On the average, they begin menstruating at age 12 1/2, but may begin as early as age 10 or as late as age 14 without being in any way abnormal. Most girls with Down syndrome have regular cycles with the same minor irregularities typical of their peer group. Question: If a women with Down syndrome experiences major irregularities of the menstrual cycle, what problems with this point to other than pregnancy? Answer: Alterations in a previously regular cycle may be due to the normal process of aging, or may be a sign of emerging hyperthyroidism. Ongoing irregularity of menstrual cycle warrants medical examination. Question: If a woman with Down syndrome becomes pregnant, will the baby be normal? Answer: At least half of all women with Down syndrome do ovulate and are fertile. Between 35 and 50 percent of children born to mothers with Down syndrome will have trisomy 21 or other developmental difficulties. Question: When is the onset of menopause for women with Down syndrome? Answer: Menopause may occur at a wide range of ages. Typically it takes place after age 40. MALE SEXUALITY IN DOWN SYNDROME Question: Are males with Down syndrome fertile? Answer: Scientific information about the fertility of men with Down syndrome is limited. While most textbooks indicate that no man with Down syndrome is known to have fathered a child, geneticists in England recently reported a case in which the paternity of a man with Down syndrome was confirmed. It is likely that additional cases will be recognized---especially as more men have the opportunity to live in the community and develop intimate relationships. It is not known if the offspring of men with Down syndrome are more likely to have Down syndrome or other anomalies. It does seem clear that, in general, men with Down syndrome have a lower overall fertility rate than that of other men of comparable ages. An individual's status can be partially assessed by having a semen analysis done, but this may not be definitive. Therefore, if a couple desires pregnancy prevention, contraception should always be used. Question: Does the boy with Down syndrome mature later than his peer group in the general population? Answer: The onset of puberty in boys may be slightly delayed, but this is not a major factor. Genital anatomy is comparable to that of boys who do not have Down syndrome. SUMMARY * People with Down syndrome experience the same range of sexual feelings as the general population. * Teenagers with Down syndrome undergo the same changes at puberty as all adolescents, though these changes may be slightly delayed for boys with Down syndrome. * There is at least one known case of a man with Down syndrome fathering a child. While the overall fertility of men with Down syndrome may be reduced, it is still advisable that couples use contraception whenever pregnancy prevention is desired. * At least 50 percent of women with Down syndrome are fertile. Healthy females can use contraception without added medical risk. * Education is an appropriate and highly desirable component in developing positive sexual awareness for the individuals with Down syndrome.

THE NEUROLOGY OF DOWN SYNDROME by Dr. Ira Lott Professor of Pediatrics University of California at Irvine Neurology, the study of the human nervous system and its disorders, is important in the clinical care treatment of a person with Down syndrome. The nervous system is always affected in Down syndrome; among the most common involvements of the nervous system are developmental disabilities (retardation in mental development and motor capabilities), hypotonia, atlantoaxial dislocation, and seizures. Question: What does the term "developmental disabilities" mean in relation to Down syndrome? Answer: This term refers to incomplete development of the brain, which leads to both mental retardation and to slowed and/or incomplete mastery of physical coordination. Question: What is known about brain pathology in regard to developmental difficulties? Answer: Pathology in the Down syndrome brain includes a slightly smaller brain size for age, a shorter diameter for the anterior-posterior brain measurement, an unusually steep slope to the posterior portions of the brain, and an insufficiently developed superior temporal gyrus. It is not known in what way these features contribute to the developmental disabilities of Down syndrome. Question: Has any progress been made in the pathology of the Down syndrome brain through research? Answer: Research in this area is being actively pursued, especially since it may yield clues to Alzheimer's disease and to the neuroscientific effects on learning and memory. Question: Is IQ (intelligence quotient) a meaningful measure in Down syndrome? Answer: No. IQ is not an adequate measure of the functional status of people with Down syndrome. For example, individuals with Down syndrome may have difficulty with grammar, but understand individual words, or have a sense of when to speak, at a par with their mental age. Question: What can be done to help people with Down syndrome to achieve their full potential in the face of such disabilities? Answer: A variety of intervention programs, designed to begin in infancy and continue throughout learning years, help children with Down syndrome maximize their capabilities. Question: What is hypotonia? Answer: Hypotonia refers to the reduced muscle tone that occurs in virtually all infants with Down syndrome. It is commonly seen in the flexor group, muscles which act to flex a joint. The muscle weakness ranges from mild to moderate to severe. Question: How is hypotonia diagnosed? Answer: Common hypotonic symptoms are a lagging head when the child is pulled into a sitting position, and arching of the back when carried upright or lying on the stomach. In addition, hypotonic children will tire more easily and adopt movement patterns requiring the least expenditure of energy. Question: Are there any effective interventions for hypotonia? Answer: Hypotonic conditions tend to improve with age. Gross motor programs offered by occupational and physical therapists have been shown to diminish hypotonic symptoms. These programs improve large body movements, such as walking, turning, sitting, standing and climbing stairs. Enrollment of children in an early intervention program which includes gross motor programs is recommended at the earliest feasible age, generally between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Question: What is atlantoaxial dislocation? Answer: Atlantoaxial dislocation refers to a problem caused by hypotonia. The ligaments at the first two cervical vertebra are more relaxed than they should be, putting the individual at risk of spinal cord compression and injury. Question: How common is atlantoaxial dislocation? Answer: The cervical spine instability occurs in 10 to 20 percent of children with down syndrome; however, actual spinal compression is rare. Question: What are the symptoms of atlantoaxial dislocation? Answer: If symptoms are present, they include neck pain, change in gait, onset of weakness in the extremities, spasticity, limited neck movement, and bowel/bladder incontinence (particularly after toilet training has been accomplished). However, most children with x-ray evidence of atlantoaxial dislocation have no apparent symptoms. Question: What preventive measures should be taken? Answer: Since most children with atlantoaxial dislocation do not exhibit symptoms, lateral cervical x-rays are recommended for all children with Down syndrome after age two. If the instability is present, but there are no symptoms, the appropriate precaution is to limit "high risk" activities which might overstress the neck. These activities include high-jumping, diving, gymnastics, trampoline, and butterfly strokes in swimming. To devise a safe exercise program for a symptom-free child with atlantoaxial dislocation, consult your doctor. Question: Is there any treatment for atlantoaxial dislocation? Answer: If symptoms are present, the atlantoaxial joint can be surgically fused. Question: What is the incidence of seizures in Down syndrome? Answer: In the young child with Down syndrome, seizures are no more common than in the general population. Beginning at age 20-30, the incidence of seizure disorder rises substantially in the Down syndrome population. Research is ongoing as to whether the frequencies of seizures in individuals with Down syndrome is related to the aging of the brain. Question: What is the typical seizure for a person with Down syndrome? Answer: Seizures for individuals with Down syndrome commonly look like epileptic seizures: jerking of arms and legs, and loss of consciousness. Seizures can also take a mixed form, with staring spells and momentary lapses of attention. Question: What is the treatment for seizures? Answer: Seizures can be controlled with standard anti-convulsant medication. SUMMARY * The most common involvements of the nervous system in Down syndrome are hypotonia, atlantoaxial dislocation, and seizures. * The reduced muscle tone of hypotonia affects most infants with Down syndrome and ranges from mild to severe. * Hypotonic conditions improve with age; however, gross motor movement programs provided by physical and occupational therapists have been proven useful in diminishing the symptoms of hypotonia. * Atlantoaxial dislocation refers to a weakness of neck muscles that affects approximately 10 to 20 percent of children with Down syndrome. Most cases are asymptomatic. Preventive measures against neck injuries call for lateral cervical x-rays for all children with Down syndrome after age 2. If atlantoaxial dislocation is present, high-risk activities such as jumping, diving, etc., should be limited. * In cases of atlantoaxial dislocation where symptoms are present, the atlantoaxial joint can be surgically fused. * Seizures are equally common in the child with Down syndrome as compared to the general same-age population. After age 20, the incidence of seizures in the Down syndrome population increases substantially as compared to the general population. Seizures can be controlled by standard anti-convulsant medication. Books/Newsletters: �The Central Nervous System.� In: Medical Care in Down Syndrome: A Preventive Medicine Approach.

Today it is common to see youngsters with Down syndrome, in every part of the country, included in their neighborhood schools. Boys and girls, in rural, urban, and suburban locations, at the preschool, elementary, and secondary level are able to enjoy the company of their peers and the activities of the regular school setting. Inclusion in the regular classroom is only one of the many options available to children with Down syndrome. It is, however, an important one. This brochure is designed to familiarize you with the philosophy and practice of inclusion and in doing so, help you make the most informed decision about your child's education. INCLUSION IS... A PHILOSOPHY. It is a belief in every person's inherent right to participate fully in society. Inclusion implies acceptance of differences. It means making room for a person who would otherwise be excluded. Translating this philosophy into reality is a process that requires collaboration, teamwork, flexibility, a willingness to take risks, and support from a whole array of individuals, services, and institutions. A PRACTICE. It is the educational process by which all students, even those with disabilities, are educated together, with sufficient support, in age-appropriate, regular education programs in their neighborhood schools. The goal of inclusive education is to prepare all students for productive lives as full, participating members of their communities. EVOLVING. As people learn more about inclusion, they understand that "full inclusion" means that students with Down syndrome are part of the regular education system--even if their curricular goals and needs differ from those of their classmates. REWARDING FOR ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED. When inclusion is carried out appropriately, research has demonstrated benefits to students with Down syndrome as well as to their peers. Friendships develop, students without disabilities learn to appreciate differences, and students with disabilities are more motivated. All of this is carried home and into the community. INCLUSION IS NOT.... A PASSING FAD. Numerous federal district court decisions have affirmed the right of students with Down syndrome to attend regular classes full time when the educational benefits for the student warrant such a placement. Inclusion, with its focus on outcomes, is the spirit of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the trend for the future. DUMPING. It does not mean that a child with special needs is placed in a classroom without adequate support and appropriate services. It does not mean that undue burdens are placed on teachers and peers. Thoughtful planning, continual monitoring, and sufficient support are all part of successful inclusion programs. EASY. Parents, educators, peers, and administrators are all partners in the inclusion process and must work together to make it successful. On-going problem solving is involved. MAINSTREAMING. Inclusion is more than mainstreaming. Mainstreaming implies that a child from a special education class visits the regular class for specific, usually non-academic, subjects. Inclusion means that a student with special needs is part of the regular class, even if he or she receives occasional services in another setting. WHAT MAKES INCLUSION SUCCESSFUL? *A Commitment to the philosophy of inclusion and a belief in the equal value of all students must be shared by everyone. Many school districts make explicit mention in their mission statements that the educational goals of students with disabilities are of equal value to those of other students. *Accountability assures that all individuals, at the district, building, and classroom level delegate tasks appropriately and fulfill their responsibilities. The department of special education should have clearly defined policies for program implementation. *Careful assessment and planning guarantees that the student's curriculum is appropriate; adequate support is provided; and long and short-term goals are met. Assessment should focus on the child's strengths, and parents should actively participate in the design of the Individualized Education Program (IEP). *Collaboration requires that all participants be equal partners. Teachers will be working together in and out of the classroom; peers will become allies and friends; and parents will continually be interacting with the school system. The need for teamwork is constant and only through cooperative effort does inclusion work. *Flexibility must be present at every stage of the inclusion process. Because teaching models are often altered, curriculum adaptations made, and unique needs addressed, all participants must be willing to accept compromise and try new situations. *Funding must be available for the necessary support services. Some research has shown that districts which are implementing inclusion are not spending more than their segregated counterparts; rather, they are shifting costs. *Good Leadership sets the tone for the entire process. Principals and superintendents must convey a positive attitude towards inclusion and foster a supportive environment in which new and challenging situations are dealt with in a flexible manner. Teachers who have the encouragement and backing of their supervisors are often the most successful initiators of change. *Social skills and peer relationships are two of the most important foundations for, and by-products of, inclusion. Peers are positive role models for speech and appropriate behavior. As allies and friends, peers offer support in and out of the classroom: in cooperative learning situations; in peer support groups; and in after school activities. Friendships develop which extend beyond the classroom. *Support includes everything necessary to meet the goals established in the IEP. Additional personnel may be present in the classroom; peers may form a support network; curricula may be adapted; teaching methods may change; physical accommodations may be made; and therapies may be given. Support can be extensive or minimal, depending on the needs of the particular student. For teachers, support may mean encouragement from supervisors; collaboration with peers; team teaching; feedback from parents; or access to the many resources available on inclusion. *Transition planning alleviates potential problems. Before the school year begins, teachers and staff should have appropriate training; the student with Down syndrome should be familiar with his or her surroundings; and peers should receive orientation. Knowledge about Down syndrome, and the abilities of people with Down syndrome, will lessen the apprehension of teachers and classmates. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO FOSTER YOUR CHILD'S INCLUSION? *Become aware of your rights under federal and state laws. Learn about IDEA and what it means for your child. If you request an appropriate inclusion program, your school system is required to provide it. A child cannot be placed in a more restrictive environment unless the school system has shown that inclusion was unsuccessful despite the provision of appropriate support and services. *Communicate with the school system. Help administrators and teachers develop methods that will work well. Provide insight and awareness regarding the needs and goals of your child. *Learn about successful inclusion practices. Contact parents, organizations, and schools that have made inclusion work. Write for information from the growing number of national organizations that have a proven commitment to inclusion. Form support networks. Avail yourself of the numerous publications and videos available. *Participate in the design of your child's IEP. The goals and objectives listed in the IEP will determine not only what your child is taught, but how and where that teaching will take place. Since the passage of Public Law 94-142 in 1975, educational options for children with Down syndrome have expanded greatly. IEPs are now provided for all children with special needs; parent involvement in the planning process is sought; and advocacy and support is widely available. Inclusion represents the latest effort to provide all children with the best education possible in the diversity of their neighborhood school.

This promotes collaboration, teamwork, and an appreciation of differences while fostering long-term relationships. IDEA--The federal law supporting special education and related service programming for children and youth with disabilities. Also referred to as Public Law 101-476, IDEA reauthorized and expanded the provisions guaranteed under Public Law 94-142 in 1990. Public Law 94-142--The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. This law mandates a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for all children with disabilities; education in the least restrictive environment (LRE); and individualized education programs. It ensures due process rights and is the core of federal funding for special education. It was renamed and amended in 1990 and is now known as IDEA. FAPE--A free appropriate public education refers to special education and related services which are provided at public expense to meet the educational goals defined in the child's IEP. IEP--The individualized education program is the written plan for each school year which delineates the goals and special services necessary to meet the child's needs. Parents, teachers, and administrators take part in the preparation of the child's IEP for the academic year. LRE--The least restrictive environment provision of the IDEA states that to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with children who do not have disabilities "and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of .... children from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily." Teaching--A broad term referring to different groupings of teachers. One common method is to have a regular education teacher team up with a general education teacher and together be responsible for all the children of the class. All team teaching is based on shared responsibility and collaboration.

Nationwide Study Finds Inclusive Education Rewarding for All Involved The inclusion of students with Down syndrome in typical classrooms is a more rewarding experience than expected for both students and classmates, according to a recently released national study. Inclusion is the educational process by which all students, with or without disabilities, are educated together, with sufficient support, in age-appropriate, regular education programs in their neighborhood schools. Support is often provided in a "push-in" (in-class aid), or "pull-out" (visits to a resource room) basis. The majority of teachers who participated in the nationwide study, commissioned by the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) and conducted by Gloria Wolpert, Ed.D., reported that entire classes benefit from working with a student with Down syndrome. Almost all teachers who responded found inclusion enjoyable, with some calling it the single most interesting and rewarding experience of their careers.The NDSS study was conducted to determine the success, or lack of success, of inclusive practices, and to identify the common characteristics of the most successful programs. The study included a nationwide survey of parents and teachers. .Overall, both parents and teachers find current inclusive practices successful, but there is room for improvement. The study found that more appropriate teacher preparation and more time for conferences between teachers, therapists, parents and support personnel would be beneficial to all involved. Factors which directly affect the success of an inclusive experience, as measured by both parents and teachers, include a match of teacher personality and style to the skills of a student. Teachers who are flexible, willing to modify classroom materials, and who utilize hands-on learning tools, are the bests catalysts for achievement. Those parents whose children with Down syndrome had friends in class rated the inclusion experience the most successful, and reported great benefits in the areas of communication, self esteem and independence. Teacher preparation is important for success, but surprisingly, formal training from the school district does not appear to be relevant. A copy of the Educational Challenges Inclusion Study, which includes suggestions for classroom practice, can be obtained after October 1, by sending a check or money order for $10 to cover printing and postage, to the NDSS Educational Challenges Program, 666 Broadway, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2317. New 1996 Teaching Partnership Poster Brings Inclusion Message To Grades 4, 5 and 6 The National Down Syndrome Society is proud to launch the second phase of its Teaching Partnership program, which brings our message of inclusion, understanding and friendship to grades 4, 5 and 6. The second phase was developed in response to the overwhelmingly positive feedback received from our first phase, which targeted grades 1,2 and 3. In this phase, a combination poster/lesson plan was distributed to 43,000 elementary schools, prompting hundreds of children to write essays about their new understanding of their classmates with Down syndrome. All this would not have been possible without the generous support of many of people, like you, who have an interest in inclusive education. The second phase of the Teaching Partnership program targets slightly older students, in grades 4,5 and 6. Both the poster and accompanying lesson plan center on the theme, "Friendship Knows No Boundaries." It offers in-class exercises to help students understand what it�s like to have a developmental disability, and fosters friendships among all students. This practical, educational tool enables teachers to explore these issues, and create a more inclusive classroom in which all our children may thrive. The National Down Syndrome Society needs your help in bringing this innovative teaching tool to our nation�s schools. Production and postage expenses to reach every school with a 4th, 5th or 6th grade class would total about $100,000. This cost would be prohibitive without special assistance from our supporters. But, if every person who receives this newsletter offers even a small contribution, we will be well on our way to bringing our message of inclusion to every school in the country.Your donation to the Teaching Partnership program is a contribution to a more accepting, inclusive society that will benefit all of us. Please help us teach all our children to be understanding and accepting of one another�s differences, by sending your tax-deductible contribution in the enclosed envelope.

The poster, available through the National Down Syndrome Society to mark October as National Down Syndrome Awareness Month, will be sent free of charge to all educators and parents who request them. A small fee is charged for multiple copies. The front of the poster portrays two sisters, one with Down syndrome, embracing each other, and the theme, "None of us are the same on the outside. All of us are the same on the inside." The reverse side contains tools for teachers to discuss Down syndrome with their students, and encourage children to accept those who are different. "Recognizing that many children are first exposed to people with Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities in the classroom, we feel that it is important for elementary school teachers to address the issues of awareness and acceptance," explained Myra E. Madnick, executive director of the National Down Syndrome Society. "We developed this poster to help teachers introduce the subject and encourage positive relationships among all children." The National Down Syndrome Society works to promote a better understanding of Down syndrome and the potential of people with Down syndrome; to support research about this genetic condition; and to provide services for families and individuals involved with Down syndrome. NDSS disseminates information about the inclusion of children with Down syndrome in the regular classroom. For more information about Down syndrome, inclusive education, or to request a poster, call the National Down Syndrome Society at 1-800-221-4602. News & Views The only magazine written by and for young adults with Down syndrome made its premiere in September 1994. Edited by Chris Burke, this magazine talks about what it is like to have Down syndrome in the nineties. People from all parts of the United States and abroad contribute articles, letters, games, and opinions on current events. No other magazine tells this story in the same way. Available by subscription through the National Down Syndrome Society. The Educational Challenges Program This two-year study of inclusive education examines the nature of the public school experience for children with Down syndrome. Directed by Gloria Wolpert, Ed.D., this study is the first national survey of inclusion for children with Down syndrome and explores the full spectrum of options that are, or should be, available to all children with Down syndrome. As part of the Educational Challenges Program, NDSS has developed a pamphlet on inclusion and an annotated resource list of organizations and materials available to help parents and professionals. http://www.pcsltd.com/ndss/ Last Updated: November 25th, 1996 by webmaster@pcsltd.com Copyright © 1996 National Down Syndrome Society.All rights reserved.WT01-B04-257IA090-000969-B049-88http://ndss.org:80/res.html 206.249.5.81 19970117204544 text/html 4507HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 20:47:30 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 27-Nov-96 23:23:41 GMTContent-length: 4315Content-type: text/html RESEARCH RESEARCH Scientific Symposia In an attempt to increase communication among the world's most distinguished scientists, working in fields related to Down syndrome, the Society hosts international scientific conferences on relevant research topics. The proceedings of these conferences are published and distributed worldwide. To date, the Society has hosted ten Scientific Symposia. Science Scholar Award Each year the Society awards research grants to promising young scientists who have demonstrated extraordinary skill and achievement in seeking a better understanding of Down syndrome. Since 1983, twenty post-doctoral researchers have received the coveted, two-year salary grants of $60,000. Science Scholar has a Personal Motivation Each evening when neuroscientist Alberto Costa, M.D., Ph.D., returns home from the laboratory where he works to understand the functions of specific genes along the 21st chromosome, he is greeted by the baby girl who inspires him. Dr. Costa�s daughter, Tyche, was born with Down syndrome one year ago, and has brought a renewed sense of purpose to his research. "I am working for my daughter," said Dr. Costa, explaining that Tyche was named for the Greek goddess of good fortune. He and his wife, Daisy, chose the name before the birth of their daughter, which had followed two lost pregnancies. "We were very excited when we realized that this child was going to make it to term. We felt that she is a gift of good fortune." If Dr. Costa is successful in unraveling the mysteries of the 21st chromosome, it could open the doors to pharmacological intervention that would benefit thousands of individuals with Down syndrome. "Then," Dr. Costa continued, "Tyche would truly live up to her name." Dr. Costa, one of most talented and promising young neuroscientists in the nation, is the 21st recipient of the National Down Syndrome Society�s prestigious Science Scholar Award. As a Science Scholar, he will receive a two-year salary grant of $60,000. He was selected by the NDSS Science Advisory Board, following a nationwide evaluation of highly qualified applicants. Science Advisory Board Chairman Charles Epstein, M.D., explained that the Board was duly impressed with Dr. Costa�s previous accomplishments, proven talent and proposed research strategy. "Dr. Costa has demonstrated considerable knowledge of the neurophysiology of Down syndrome, and he certainly is motivated," explained Dr. Epstein, of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of California in San Francisco. Working with mice that were developed as genetic models of Down syndrome, Dr. Costa is studying the effects that an extra copy of specific genes has on the functions of the brain. Individuals with Down syndrome have three copies, rather than two, of the 21st chromosome, although it is not known exactly which genes on this chromosome are responsible for the specific characteristics associated with this condition. Dr. Costa, who has dedicated the last eight years of his career studying electrophysiology and molecular biology in relation to the brain and nervous system, is performing his research study at the Jackson Laboratory and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, in collaboration with Senior Staff Scientist Muriel T. Davisson, Ph.D. Dr. Costa earned his medical degree from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and his doctorate in biophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, he had several years of postdoctoral training in Pharmacology and Neuroscience, at the University of Maryland and Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Costa has earned numerous awards and his work has been published extensively in scientific journals. http://www.pcsltd.com/ndss/ Last Updated: November 25th, 1996 by webmaster@pcsltd.com Copyright © 1996 National Down Syndrome Society.All rights reserved.WT01-B04-258IA090-000970-B001-363http://ndss.org:80/ethan1.html 206.249.5.81 19970117205324 text/html 5711HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 20:54:03 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 13-Jan-97 23:47:21 GMTContent-length: 5522Content-type: text/html NDSS - Ethan Page Ever since Ethan was a few weeks old, he's been attending an early intervention program designed especially for infants and children with Down syndrome. He's already enhancing his speech and language skills and receiving sensory stimulation through play, and in the coming years, he'll begin an intensive reading program. And, as he develops, his program will be tailored to meet his specific needs - whether they are in the areas of muscle coordination, fine motor skills or language development. Thanks to programs like the one Ethan attends, children with Down syndrome are achieving more than ever. Some of the typical problems associated with this genetic condition have been successfully mitigated by early stimulation and interaction. Although these programs are helpful, we are still limited by our understanding of the functions of the human brain, and exactly how children with Down syndrome acquire new skills. QQ Dear Friends of NDSS, w w w We can help Ethan and his peers reach their potential. Through research breakthroughs in the areas of language processing, cognitive abilities and behavior, we are able to learn more about how Down syndrome affects the development of these related skills. And, once we learn the basics, we can incorporate these findings into the early international programs that have already helped so many children with Down syndrome. w w w Since its inception, the National Down Syndrome Society has made research one of its top priorities. Through its Science Scholar Program, NDSS has supported 20 researchers who are seeking the causes of, and answers to, many of the medical, genetic, behavioral and learning problems associated with Down syndrome. These gifted scientists were each awarded two-year, $50,000 grants to carry on their work and contribute to the body of knowledge on Down syndrome. Our researchers have focused not only on the genetic aspects of Down syndrome, but the practical applications of knowledge in the areas of speech and articulation, physical therapy, behavior and education of children with Down syndrome. Current projects include a study of the possibility that children with Down syndrome may have far greater linguistic understanding that their speech patterns would indicate. A careful separation of the language processes will help us better understand how these skills are acquired, and improve the educational opportunities for all children with Down syndrome. w w w This year, as we are considering applications for our 1996 Science Scholar Program, NDSS has increased the Science Scholar Award to $60,000, to cover the ever-increasing costs of conducting research. The scientist who is selected this year will apply this grant toward reducing the complications associated with Down syndrome, and increasing the potential of all people born with this condition. The knowledge they uncover today promises to have important benefits for the broad community of people with Down syndrome, especially young children such as Ethan. w w w The NDSS Science Scholar Award is funded entirely through contributions by individuals who care about the future of all children. Thanks to your generosity, Ethan and his peers can come closer to realizing their full potential. We ask you to continue to support, and help Ethan look forward to a brighter future. Please help us find answers today, to help our children tomorrow. Send your generous, tax deductible contribution today. Thank you, Elizabeth F.

The Society, bolstered by the testimony of individuals with Down syndrome, has made appearances before several House and Senate committees. Chris Burke travels worldwide to enlighten parents and professionals about the needs of people with Down syndrome and to advocate for their inclusion in community life. POSITION STATEMENT ON THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE IDEA ISSUE The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was enacted in 1975 to end the exclusion and segregation of children with disabilities from public education programs. It provides that all children with disabilities, including Down syndrome, be educated to the maximum extent possible with students who are not disabled. IDEA supports special education, and related service programming for children and youth with disabilities and is sometimes referred to as Public Law 101-476. The IDEA was reauthorized and expanded under Public Law 94-142 in 1990. Since the passage of Public Law 94-142, educational options for children with Down syndrome have expanded greatly. Individual Educational Plans (IEP's) are now provided for all children with special needs; parent involvement is sought; and advocacy and support is widely available. The IDEA is up for reauthorization before the 104th Congress. Hearings and staff briefings within both houses of Congress have raised numerous issues about the law, particularly with regard to the implementation of Part B and how special education will fit in the general environment of national education reform. Questions have also been raised regarding IDEA's funding and the removal of discretionary programs such as parent training and information centers. POSITION The National Down Syndrome Society recognizes the need for the federal government to play an active role in overseeing access to public education for students with disabilities. Congress enacted IDEA because of the failure of states to provide an appropriate education to children with disabilities. Federal supports for individuals with disabilities and their families must be fully funded. The federal budget cannot be balanced by compromising the educational needs of students with disabilities. For students with disabilities, IDEA is a civil right to education, not a program mandated capriciously by the federal government. Research, training and technical assistance projects in IDEA must not be eliminated. They provide invaluable opportunities to educators and parents on how to effectively educate persons with developmental disabilities. Part B must not be open for revision. Part B (P.L. 94-142) of IDEA requires states to provide a free appropriate, public education for all children with disabilities. This includes special education, related programs, and supplemental aids and services necessary to sustain a child with a disability in the regular education classroom. Part B also includes important protections for children with disabilities. All of the basic and essential protections (e.g., IEP, due process, parent participation rights) of IDEA would be at risk if Part B is opened for change. The National Down Syndrome Society urges Congress to implement and rigorously enforce the provision of IDEA. This will guarantee all students with disabilities access to a free, appropriate, public education. POSITION PAPER ON MEDICAID BLOCK GRANTS ISSUE Medicaid provides access to essential health care services for children with special health care needs. To qualify, children with disabilities must first meet poverty guidelines and have a disability that is on the SSI medical. Children in more than 30 states may also qualify for Medicaid through special home and community based waivers and amendments. Though family income is not always taken into account in these programs, many families, have inadequate coverage that often does not provide them the type or extent of care that they require. Medicaid has allowed children with special health care needs to receive important preventative and restorative health services while being nurtured at home by their families in their communities. Under Medicaid regulations, any health care service approved by Medicaid which is considered medically necessary for a child must be provided. This provision allows children who are eligible for Medicaid to receive appropriate corrective and preventative services, supplies, and equipment (including assistive communication devices, durable medical goods, nutritional supplements, personal assistance, speech therapy, PT, OT, among others). As a part of the Welfare Reform debate, proposals in both the House and Senate bills would put federal Medicaid dollars into a block grant that would go directly to states along with 4% cap on growth rate (current rate is 10%). This equates to a 30% funding reduction for each state and the abolishment of the "Medicaid Waiver" for people with developmental disabilities. POSITION Keep federal standards in place for Medicaid. If individual states determine eligibility requirements, health care services may be significantly compromised for persons with developmental disabilities and mental retardation. Do not cut Medicaid funding for children who have chronic health care problems. Independence is the ultimate goal of health care for people with disabilities. A piece of assistive technology may make the difference between independent living or institutionalization. Do not remove the Individualized Functional Assessment (IFA) process. The IFA should be retained as part of the eligibility determination process because the real indication of severe disability is significant limitation of functional ability, rather than whether an impairment meets a black-and-white test of specified medical criteria. Maintain cash assistance for families of children on SSI. The SSI Children's program provides modest monthly cash benefits to eligible children who are poor and severely disabled so that they can stay at home and be raised by their families. Cash assistance is important to poor families. Families generally make informed decisions on behalf of their children, and any changes in SSI would dramatically affect a most vulnerable population. The National Down Syndrome Society urges a separate federal Medicaid block grant for long term care and financial support for children and adults with developmental disabilities. The National Down Syndrome Society also urges for the continuation of SSI benefits to families, with low incomes, who have children with severe disabilities; and the continuation of the individualized Functional Assessment to determine eligibility; accurately measuring the child's functional abilities, not their medical category. http://www.pcsltd.com/ndss/ Last Updated: January 28th, 1996 by webmaster@pcsltd.com Copyright © 1996 National Down Syndrome Society.All rights reserved.WT01-B04-260IA090-000970-B002-231http://ndss.org:80/aff.html 206.249.5.81 19970117210001 text/html 6370HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 21:01:32 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 27-Nov-96 23:23:42 GMTContent-length: 6178Content-type: text/html AFFILIATE PROGRAM AFFILIATE PROGRAM Affiliate Membership Program Parent groups, individual families and Down syndrome organizations from around the country can join with the Society to undertake activities which will benefit all people with Down syndrome.

Hundreds Attend National Conference Audio Cassettes Still Available If you were not able to attend the NDSS national conference in Phoenix this summer, you probably know somebody who did! Some 500 parents, professionals and individuals with Down syndrome gathered to learn the latest scientific information, opportunities for growth, network and share stories, during A Promising Future-Together, June 26 through June 29. Topics of interest included alternative and unconventional therapies, inclusion, advocacy, nutrition, employment, health care and reading skills. Parents and professionals attended their own "tracks" which targeted specific needs and interests, while young adults with Down syndrome and their siblings each had programs tailored to their needs. The conference was enhanced by the participation of the Down Syndrome Medical Interest Group (DSMIG)- an independent organization of physicians, researchers and health professionals who work in the field of Down syndrome. The DSMIG hosted its meeting before the conference, and many members subsequently participated or spoke in conference programs. A pre-conference Affiliate program was also well-attended, providing useful round table discussions and valuable networking time. Audio cassettes of many conference proceedings are available for purchase through Convention Recordings International, Inc., by sending in the attached order form to 6983 Sunset Drive South, St. Petersburg, FL 33707, or calling (813) 345-8288. The 10th Annual Lloyd Bentsen Award Presented at NDSS Conference The National Down Syndrome Society is honored that our national conference, A Promising Future - Together was the forum for the presentation of the 1996 Lloyd Bentsen Award to Robin Bolduc. Lloyd Bentsen, former U.S. Senator and Secretary of the Treasury, presented the award with the entire conference in attendence. The prestigious award seeks to highlight to unique accomplishments of men and women who strive to make a difference in the lives of children with Down syndrome and their families. The award carries a $10,000 honorarium to the winner. The award was established in 1987 by the Kelsey-Seybold Foundation for Medical Research and Education, to foster better recognition for family-centered, community based care for children with special needs. The Foundation created the award in honor of Sen. Bentsen and his devotion to helping children with special needs. As a Congressman, he championed bills to help children with special health care needs. As a father and grandfather, he is well aware of the challenges parents face when their children require special medical consideration. In celebration of the award�s 10th anniversary, Sen. Bentsen has chosen to focus on families of children with Down syndrome. This year the Lloyd Bentsen Award honors Robin Bolduc for her dedication to advocating on behalf of children with Down syndrome and their families. Both as a professional advocate and as a volunteer and friend, Ms. Bolduc has advocated for countless numbers of individuals with disabilities, in the areas of education, community services, transportation, civil rights, access, personal choice and other issues. While advocating on local, state and national levels as past president of Pennsylvania Schools Are For Everyone (SAFE), she also worked to assure that her own daughter with Down syndrome received an appropriate education in her home school. Because the district�s teachers did not have training in inclusive education or adaptive curriculum, Ms. Bolduc has provided much of this training herself. * * * * * * * * * * * * ORDER FORM All orders must be prepaid.

The information listed below will give you all the specific steps to be taken to assure a successful walk. However, parent groups may want to add their own ideas or suggestions. In fact, we would like to share any of your great ideas or suggestions with other parent groups. l. The first step is to determine if there is sufficient interest in the "Buddy Walk" among members of your group and the larger community. To determine this, hold an initial informational meeting with your members to promote Down syndrome and explain the national attention and visibility that will be gained from conducting a "Buddy Walk." 2. Determine the scope of your walk - what geographic areas could be effectively included in your walk. If there is more than one parent group in a county, you might consider joining forces and having a county walk. We are suggesting a 5K (3 mile) walk as a start. 3. At the first meeting, select one or two people to act as Team Captain or Co-Captains. This is a very responsible position since the Captain(s), in addition to acting as spokesperson, will also handle all the details of the walk. 4. Plan a future meeting to include representatives from all the areas that will be participating. Most importantly be sure to include representatives from the county, municipality, and law enforcement agencies. Also, invite representatives from schools, churches, social service agencies, community clubs, organizations, corporations, and especially, the press. The larger the Committee, the larger the sphere of influence. From this group select team leaders who will handle specific duties and report back to the Team Captain. e.g., publicity, registration, traffic control, sight approvals, solicitation, etc. 5. Select the sight for the Walk. It can be in a park, on a boardwalk, at a shopping mall, school property, etc. 6. Once a sight is selected, it is important that you make contact with municipal and police authorities to gain approval for use of the sight. Depending on the region you are in, you may have to secure municipal, county or state approval. 7. When you have gained approval of a sight, begin disseminating information and promotional materials. a. Send a press release to your local area newspapers. (NDSS will provide) b. Arrange to have the Public Service Announcement read on the radio. (NDSS will provide) c. Visit area schools, churches, local businesses (supermarkets), and corporations to distribute posters and registration forms. (NDSS will provide) d. Ask schools to conduct a competition among classes - the most students walking from a class wins. e. Ask corporations to conduct a similar competition - the most employees from a department wins. Note: Camera ready artwork for the NDSS logo will be provided by NDSS to be used for t-shirts and other posters. 8. Most importantly, have each child with Down syndrome ask a "buddy" to walk with him/her. The buddy can be a parent, family member, friend, school teacher, etc. 9. Arrange for a photographer to be present at the Walk to photograph each child and his/her buddy as they finish the Walk. 10. In the morning prior to the Walk, offer coffee, juices and donuts to the walkers. 11. After the Walk, plan a picnic for the walkers. Ask local vendors to donate food and supplies for the picnic. 12. Hang a large banner at the Start and Finish lines. Ask a local musical trio or band to perform at the Finish line for the walkers. BE SURE ALL PRESS AND CABLE TV COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INVITED TO ATTEND TO COVER THE WALK. If you choose to make the Walk a fund-raiser, the following steps can be taken: 1. Using the enclosed registration form, each person who has agreed to walk may solicit for donations either based on miles walked or a flat donation. 2. Walkers can be charged a registration fee. 3. Solicit area businesses, corporations, community clubs to sponsor: a. NDSS banners (sponsor's name can also be on banner). b. Picnic foods. c. Breakfast foods. d. Photographer to take children and buddy photos. e. Posters and other printed materials. BE SURE TO HAVE SIGNAGE AT THE EVENT LISTING ALL THE SPONSORS. The key to success is to begin planning your event as soon as possible and allow sufficient time to organize all the details. Conclude you 1997 Walk by thanking each and everyone involved who assisted in anyway. Make sure people know how successful your event was and how much you look forward to having them participate again next year. Hold a wrap-up meeting shortly after the event to thank the Committee, critique the event, and make changes for next year.

Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. Leads NDSS Fund-Raising Campaign The National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) is proud to announce that Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., former Connecticut governor and senator, will serve as Honorary Chairperson of Thresholds - Opening Doors to Opportunity, its new fund-raising campaign that has already raised $1.1 million toward its goal. Thresholds is the Society�s five-year strategic plan to improve the lives of people with Down syndrome through projects and services in education, research and advocacy. Thresholds incorporates the most ambitious fund-raising project in NDSS� 17-year-history, with a goal of raising $3.5 million in gifts and pledges from the private sector throughout the next year. The National Down Syndrome Society does not receive any government funding. "We�re thrilled that Gov. Weicker has agreed to play an important role in this campaign. His long history as an advocate for the rights of the disabled makes him the natural choice for Honorary Chair," said Elizabeth Goodwin, NDSS Co-Founder and Board President. Gov. Weicker is the author of many laws on behalf of people with disabilities, and is one of the principal authors of the Americans with Disabilities Act. He is currently Chairman of the firm Dresing, Lierman, Weicker of Bethesda, MD. The General Chairperson of Thresholds is longtime NDSS Board Member Thomas F. Robards. Mr. Robards is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Republic New York Corporation. "The Thresholds campaign will allow NDSS to aggressively take the lead in finding solutions to the diverse challenges related to Down syndrome," he said. "I am excited and encouraged by the enthusiastic support Thresholds has received so far." Thresholds is an outgrowth of a comprehensive, nationwide assessment of the needs of people with Down syndrome, as well as an evaluation of the work of NDSS. The program includes the expansion and enhancement of current programs and initiation of a number of new projects in research, education and advocacy. These projects include the development of teaching tools to help educators encourage more inclusive and accepting behavior in the classroom, additional educational materials and seminars for new parents of children with Down syndrome, educational efforts aimed specifically at health care professionals who work with people who have Down syndrome, as well as programs to assist individuals with Down syndrome in mastering specific life skills. Other Thresholds projects include the expansion of the Society�s current research efforts, as well as additional grants to encourage applied research. Plans also incorporate the development of a pilot program to look at housing alternatives, advocacy training from the grassroots to the federal level, and a blue ribbon panel to address the many bio-ethical issues involved in treating people with Down syndrome. http://www.ndss.org/ Last Updated: November 27th, 1996 by webmaster@pcsltd.com Copyright © 1996 Primary Consulting Services, Ltd.All rights reserved.WT01-B04-263IA091-000971-B012-240http://ndss.org:80/ndssnews.html 206.249.5.81 19970117210535 text/html 5608HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 21:05:13 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 27-Nov-96 23:50:25 GMTContent-length: 5416Content-type: text/html The National Down Syndrome Society --  News Items NDSS News Items Caroline Kennedy Addresses Women�s Luncheon NEW YORK, NY -- Caroline Kennedy addressed a record-breaking gathering of NDSS supporters during the annual Women�s Luncheon last spring. After a colorful introduction by NDSS Board member Anna Quindlen, Ms. Kennedy spoke about the great strides that have been made in recent years by people with developmental disabilities. Drawing from her family�s long-time support of programs such as the Special Olympics, and legislation to provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities, Ms Kennedy stressed the need to include people with developmental disabilities in all aspects of community life. Kim Simons, 21, of Chappaqua, NY, presented Ms. Kennedy with a token of appreciation, and spoke about her experiences growing up with Down syndrome. The National Down Syndrome Society is grateful for the dedication of the Women�s Luncheon Committee, whose efforts made the luncheon the most successful in NDSS�s history. Special thanks go to the committee chairperson, Debra Martindale Goll, under whose guidance the event made a smooth transition to its new venue, The Plaza Hotel. Plans are underway for the 1997 Women�s Luncheon, to be held this spring in The Plaza Hotel in New York, NY. If you are interested in attending, becoming a member of the organizing committee, or opportunities for corporate sponsorship, please call 1-800-221-4602. National Drama Features Down Syndrome Storyline - The popular daytime drama Guiding Light is doing its part to raise awareness and acceptance of individuals with special needs, through a ground-breaking new storyline about a child with Down syndrome. While network television has depicted characters with this condition, this is the first time a series has explored the issues faced by parents before and immediately after a child is born. As Guiding Light intends to develop this storyline as accurately and dramatically as possible, with guidance and fact-checking provided by the National Down Syndrome Society, all people with Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities can benefit from a greater understanding fostered by this program. The storyline has emerged with the birth of "Meg" born to soap characters Fletcher Reade and Holly Lindsey-Reade (played by Jay Hammer and Maureen Garrett). Meg, who is played by Jacqueline Falchier of Maplewood, NJ, (born September 1995), has Down syndrome and was cast with assistance from the National Down Syndrome Society. "We�re thrilled with Guiding Light�s programming decision to feature a child with Down syndrome, and their willingness to work with us in creating such a responsible depiction of a family�s experiences, explained Myra E. Madnick, executive director of NDSS. "Baby Jacqueline doesn�t realize it yet, but she�s going to help teach millions of people that children with Down syndrome have many wonderful abilities and talents. She�ll be instrumental in changing attitudes and increasing acceptance. She�s the youngest advocate we have." Baby Jacqueline and the National Down Syndrome Society�s role in the story line were also the topic of a CBS Day&Date story (July 12, 1996), which applauded the programming decision. Future Guiding Light story lines will include the types of situations a baby with Down syndrome and his or her parents encounter. The National Down Syndrome Society has recently provided the Guiding Light writers with information about early intervention programs that assist infants with Down syndrome in the areas of language, muscle development and fine motor skills. Siblings� Relationship Explored through Performance Two brothers from Israel recently toured the United States, performing their touching play about one brother�s Down syndrome and its affect on their relationship. Ofer Shikartsi, 35, and Dekel Shikartsi, 21, have performed On the Other Side of the House, more than 500 times in Israel, and have teamed up with the very competent Janet Neeman, who offers consecutive Hebrew translation for English-speaking audiences. In a sensitive, gentle and often humorous manner, the play offers insight into the life of Dekel, who has Down syndrome. Dekel also presents a sampling of his original poetry, including his biographical, An Angel with Down Syndrome. Following the performance, the actors are available for candid discussions with the audience. The Shikartsi brothers have tentatively scheduled another United States visit for this winter. For information about scheduling a performance for your organization, please call Renee Schreiber, Director of Cultural Events for the Consulate General of Israel in New York, at (212) 499-5442. http://www.pcsltd.com/ndss/ Last Updated: November 25th, 1996 by webmaster@pcsltd.com Copyright © 1996 National Down Syndrome Society.All rights reserved.WT01-B04-264IA091-000971-B012-285http://ndss.org:80/other.html 206.249.5.81 19970117210633 text/html 808HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 21:08:30 GMTLast-modified: Tuesday, 27-Aug-96 20:23:20 GMTContent-length: 619Content-type: text/html The National Down Syndrome Society Other Useful Down Syndrome Links On The Internet The Tidewater Down Syndrome Association What's Up with Downs? http://www.pcsltd.com/ndss/ Last Updated: June 28th, 1996 by webmaster@pcsltd.com WT01-B04-265IA091-000971-B013-103http://ndss.org:80/ndss.html 206.249.5.81 19970117211053 text/html 428HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 21:10:20 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 20-Dec-96 21:16:37 GMTContent-length: 240Content-type: text/html NDSS HomepageWT01-B04-266IA091-000971-B013-407http://ndss.org:80/contr.html 206.249.5.81 19970117211506 text/html 4438HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.12Date: Friday, 17-Jan-97 21:17:14 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 13-Jan-97 23:39:15 GMTContent-length: 4249Content-type: text/html NDSS - Contribution Form Welcome to the NDSS Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) page.

Albany-Lebanon Sanitation is dedicated to the concept and practice of environmental preservation. We are constantly seeking new technologies and services which will not only preserve our environment, but provide more efficient and economical collection, recycling, and disposal of waste materials. By recycling, less energy is required than when using virgin resources, both in the initial extraction of resources and in manufacturing new products. Recycling conserves valuable natural resources and saves millions of dollars of valuable materials that would otherwise be buried in landfills. For the environment, processing recyclables into new goods produces far less air, water and land pollution. Recycling costs money, but it is still a good investment. The revenue derived by selling your recyclable materials offsets about 20% of the costs of offering the service. These short-termed costs are offset by long-term gains of saving resources, energy and landfill space. By changing our destructive habits we will begin to sustain a healthier environment and preserve our finite resources for future generations. This is why Albany-Lebanon Sanitation has made a commitment to recycling. Please become a part of this growing endeavor.

Recyclethe lids from jars with your tin. No window glass, lightbulbs, pyrex or ceramics. BACK TO THETOP Tin Cans/Aluminum Remove label, top and bottom. Rinse clean and flatten wheneverpossible. Rounded end cans do not need to be flattened. Foil, TVdinner trays and beverage cans are all accepted. Noappliances or scrap metal. BACK TO THETOP Bottle and tub shaped rigid plastic containers only Why can we only recycle bottle & tub shaped plastics? TheGarten Foundation in Salem (where we take our plastics), has a newPlastics Recovery Facility (PRF) which is the first in the world ableto sort plastic bottles and tubs with all seven plastic resin codenumbers. Previously, the only way to recycle plastics was to keepeach resin code number separate from the time it's picked up to thetime it goes to market. This PRF can not only take all 7 resin codenumbers but can take them mingled together!, but only if they arebottle or tub shaped. The system that separates the plastics by resincode can only "see" these shapes. Bags, trays, etc. are impossiblefor this system to sort. Examples of Recyclable Plastic Containers Kitchen Milk Soda Water Juice Yogurt & Margarine Ketchup & Syrup Cooking Oils Bathroom Shampoo Conditioner Lotions Household Cleaners Dish Detergent Window Cleaner Kitchen & Bath Cleaner Automotive Windshield Washer Antifreeze Laundry Liquid Detergent Fabric Softener Bleach BACK TO THE TOP Do Not Put These Items In The Recycling Bin (Even a small amount of contaminants can ruin anentire shipment of recyclable plastics) Lids, Caps and Spray Pumps Bags or Wraps Pails (Ice Cream) Food Storage, Freezer Containers (Tupperware) Containers - 5 Gallons or Larger Flower Pots and Garden Plastics Trays, Microwave Dishes Hazardous Waste Containers (Pesticides, Herbicides, Solvents, Motor Oil, Paints, Adhesives) Styrofoam (Please enclose in a bag and put in trash). If In Doubt, Throw It Out... Unrecyclables Will Be Left In Your Recycle Bins! Why do I need to sort my recycling? Separating each commodity in your bin is important becauseeach commodity needs to go into a separate compartment on our trucks.When the truck is full, each compartment is emptied into large boxesat our site and are then hauled to markets where they are recycled.Our drivers cannot sort everyone's bin because that would requirespending extra time at each stop which would mean we would need toquadruple (or more) the number of recycling drivers we have! And thatwould mean higher rates for our customers. Albany-Lebanon Sanitation 's recycling program has experienced stronggrowth during the past 5 years, as indicated by this graph: The large increase from 1992 to 1993 can be attributed to the startof mixed paper recycling and curbside yard debris recycling.

Food waste and yard debris make up about 25% of our garbage. Grass clippings and leaves can take years to decompose in the landfill. Uses For Compost Compost contains nutrients and holds nutrients in the soil untilplants can use them, but is not a substitute for fertilizers. As A Soil Amendment Mix compost into vegetable and flower gardens each year beforeplanting. As A Potting Mixture Add one part compost to two parts commercial potting soil, or makeyour own mixture by using equal parts of compost and sand or perlite.BACK TO THE TOP What To Compost Grass clippings Leaves Flowers Old plants Twigs Old potting soil BACK TO THE TOP What NOT To Compost Diseased plants Weeds with seeds Invasive weeds like quack grass or morning glory Pet feces Dead animals Meat or fish parts Dairy products such as milk, butter, or cheese Grease, cooking oil, or oily foods BACK TO THE TOP How To Compost Soil Saver HOT COMPOSTING (Compost Turning) Rich compost is created when you alternate layers of organic waste. It is easiest to estimate this ratio by alternating layers of "green stuff" and "brown stuff" as the compost pile is built. Example: A layer of grass clippings ("green stuff") twice as thick as a layer of brown leaves ("brown stuff") is a good ratio. Keep the material as moist as a squeezed-out sponge. Occasional watering may be required to moisten the pile if it becomes too dry. Turn the material (at least 4-5 times during the summer) with a pitchfork, shovel or compost turner so it's well aerated. You can turn the pile once a week but more frequent turning will inhibit composting. Your compost is ready to use when it is a dark brown or black color, crumbly, humus-rich top soil, with the sweet aroma of the good earth. A link for more information:Composting BACK TO THE TOP Problems Will my composter attract flies? Not if you dig your food scraps into the compost or cover any foodscraps or "green stuff" with a layer of soil or "brown stuff." Will my composter attract animals or rodents? To prevent the attraction of animals, do not add meat products, dairyproducts, fat or fish to your composter. Again, cover food scrapswith soil or "brown stuff." Lay a sheet of hardware cloth or rabbitcage wire on the ground beneath your composter to keep rodents out. Why does my composter smell like ammonia? You have too much "green stuff." Add more"brown stuff." Why does my composter smell rotten? There is too much moisture in the composter. Turn the pile and addporous material such as leaves or sawdust.

A wide range of topics are covered and various studies and activitieshave been described in detail so that they can be reproduced by our clients. Inaddition to featured articles, you will also find several "Tips &Tricks"that you might find useful. Volume 1 Creating a Policy Benchmark (92KB)June1994 Most plan sponsors have adopted an asset allocation policy for their totalfund. With StyleADVISOR, you can create a policy benchmark for your assetallocation, and also find the optimal mix of managers in order to closely trackthat benchmark Volume 2 Eulogy to the Floating Bar Graph August1994 (Notcurrently available on the Web. Call for your copy.) For over twenty years, plan sponsors, money managers, and consultants haveused the "Floating Bar Graph" to display how a manager has donevis-a-vis a universe. We have developed a new Manager versus Universe graph,which literally provides 100 times the information as the obsolete bar graph.For a hard copy of this newsletter call (800) StyleAD (789-5323). Volume 3 What Are the Best Style Indices to Usewith StyleADVISOR (280KB) November 1994 We provide a number of domestic equity style indices for our StyleADVISORusers (Wilshire, Prudential, S&P BARRA, Russell)....Because of the differentways in which these indices are constructed, they will give different results instyle your analyses. Find out which are the best. Volume 4 International Style Analysis (404KB)January1995 Style Advisor clients receive international style indexes on 26 countriesand 8 regions. Performing a style analysis on any one country or region is assimple as a domestic equity analysis. However, it is not quite as easy forinternational managers who diversify among many coutries and regions. Thisarticle suggests several approaches. Volume 5 Skeptics Corner (267KB) March1995 I know that I don't have to convice our StyleADVISOR users thatstyleanalysis works, because they have seen the results first hand, For those ofyou who would like to demonstrate the validity of this approach to others, thedetailed results of some of the many studies we have done on this subject canbe found in this newsletter. Volume 6 Using StyleADVISOR to Detect Derivativesin a Portfolio (267KB) May 1995 One of the many derivative casualties occurring in the last few years wasthe Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Fund. I wondered if StyleADVISORcould have provided a clue as to the riskiness of this fund during the 1993-94period. I found the answer to be a resounding YES. Find out how StyleADVISORcan detect leverage in a mutual fund, without ever looking at the portfolioholdings. Volume 7 Obtaining the Optimum Manager Weights toTrack Your Benchmark (499KB) June 1995 Plan sponsors are responsible for the "style bets" that they takeaway from their market benchmark. StyleADVISOR shows you what those betsare,and will allow you to find the optimum weights for each manager to mostclosely track a benchmark. Volume 8 POD Universes (433KB) August1995 StyleADVIVSOR users now have the ability to create a different kind ofuniverse called POD, or Portfolio Opportunity Distribution. This is aninnovation developed by Ron Surz. Instead of using the actual returns of agroup of managers, POD's calculate the return series for a group of portfoliosof randomly selected securities... Volume 9 Style Additions (549KB) October 1995 Here we talk about some of the new enhancements to StyleADVISOR, such asbeing able to use your customized style benchmark as the benchmark in yourrisk/return analysis with just a point and click. Volume 10 New Graph (666KB) November1995 We have recently added a new graph which measures annual excess returnoverthe style benchmark on the vertical axis, and standard deviation ofexcessreturn on the horizontal axis. This measure of a manager's skill can bemost revealing when comparing multiple managers. We show a number of examples inthis newsletter. Volume 11 The Invested EAFE February 1996 A new International Benchmark. The EAFE index's heavy weighting in Japan(approx 45%), makes it less than appropriate for the majority of internationalydiversified managers. Zephyr Associates has created a new internationalbenchmark which is country weighted, not cap weighted. You will find it in yourIndices supplied with StyleADVISOR directory. This benchmark has a significantlyhigher R2 than the EAFE to most international managers. (Sorry, Notcurrently available on the Web. Call for your copy.)

Volume 13 Does Value Beat Growth? (493KB)May1996 Those of you who have been working with style analysis for some time mayhave noticed that small growth managers seem to have a much higher propensity tobeat their style benchmark.

You'll feel part of an exciting chapter in Americanautomobile history and learn all about new technologies that will make ourlives and environment healthier and better. The event has grown from a smallprivate "club" with a half dozen members into a world-class event whichattracts over four dozen electric, solar electric, and hybrid electricvehicles built by designers pushing the limits of pollution-free vehicletechnology. "The American Tour de Sol has reflected and influenced the rapid changes in electric vehicle development over the past six years,"explained Nancy Hazard, director of the ATdS. "We started with solar racingcars to promote solar energy, then moved on to practical electric vehiclesand now we're focusing more on production vehicles - those already availableon the market." In 1991, Governor Cuomo of New York waved the flag on 26vehicles. that race began in Albany and ended up at historic Plymouth Rock.Times have changed and the fleet, now numbering 50, will be the largest everas it races from Waterbury, Connecticut to Portland, Maine. What makes this race so exciting each year is the variety of vehicles whichcompete and the stunning improvements in performance that take place fromone year to the next. Just a few years ago, electric vehicle designers werescratching their heads trying to find a way to beat the 100 mile barrierwithout recharging. Last year, eight vehicles consistently beat the 100 milemark while a Solectria Corporation-built vehicle topped 214 miles withoutstopping to recharge. If history is any indicator, even better performanceswill be seen in this year's event. A large number of vehicles come from the Northeast but entries are alsocoming from California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Germany and Japan.While vehicles compete in five different categories, all of the vehicles inthe American Tour de Sol fall into one of two basic types: high-tech,solar-powered vehicles designed strictly for competition or practicalelectric-powered vehicles designed for everyday use. Vehicles will travel atotal of 300-600 miles over the course of the week as they race fromWaterbury, Connecticut to Portland, Maine. The race is a road rally-typeevent which means vehicles are required to travel a specific distance eachday - roughly 50-70 miles, but are also given an opportunity to drive extralaps to demonstrate range capabilities and improve their score. All requiredmiles will be driven on public, secondary roads at normal driving speeds,while extra laps are often driven on interstate highways. The scoring systemmakes efficiency and driving range (the distance traveled withoutrecharging) the keys to winning. In addition to the solar racing vehicles and the practical electric-poweredconversions, which are cars using the body of an existing gasoline poweredcar, there are also electric-powered motorcycles and scooters,electric-powered buses, small one-person electric vehicles, and a number of"hybrid" vehicles. These hybrids combine other types of power with electricpropulsion. For the first time, the rally will feature a pre-productionprototype sedan, designed by an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VEHICLE CATEGORIES The production category was created two years ago to showcase the electric vehicles already on the market and available for purchase.Only vehicles that have actually been sold can enter this category. Entriesthis year include a Ford Ecostar, Solectria Corporation vehicles from theVermont and Connecticut EV (electric vehicle) demonstration projects, and aU. S. Electricar bus. The Connecticut and Vermont projects arepublic/private partnerships conducting on-the-road evaluations of EVs andsponsoring entries in the 1995 ATdS. What makes these vehicles unique isthat they are all vehicles currently in regular use on the roads. "We haveabout 400 people test driving a Solectria Force," says Harold Garabedian ofthe Connecticut EV project. "We are constantly collecting data and surveyingusers. Out of the hundreds of users so far, the reaction has beenuniversally positive. The one concern people had was about the vehicles'range but in nearly ten thousand miles of driving not one person has had anyproblems related to vehicle range." The Ford-built Ecostar entry is similar to the vehicle that won theproduction category championship last year. Connecticut-based NortheastUtilities is sponsoring this entry and organizing the race team. The production category is also expected to contain the first ever masstransit vehicle to compete in an electric vehicle competition. The bus,manufactured by U.S. Electricar of Santa Rosa, CA, holds 22 passengers andis actually in service right now at the University of Massachusetts-Lowellshuttling passengers from the local train station to the university campus.Sponsored by New England Electric System and UMass-Lowell, the team plans to demonstrate the practicality of swapping battery packs to extend drivingrange. TEENS COMPETE IN THE COMMUTER CATEGORY The Discover Channel cable television network is sponsoring thecommuter category this year. This category features 20 vehicles -the largest number of entries in any category. A high school-built entryfrom Bolton (Conn.) High School is returning for its third year in the ATdS.In last year's event, this race team traveled more than 140 miles onstandard lead-acid batteries without recharging - an ATdS record forvehicles using that type of battery. "We've been working on the car sincethen," according to Chris Laughman, a senior student at the school andveteran EV racer. "Some minor improvements in aero dynamics and suspensionshould increase our efficiency. We expect to beat our own range record." Other top competitors this year are being sponsored by Boston (Mass.) EdisonCompany which is heavily involved in helping to create both a market and aproduct for the electric vehicle industry. Boston Edison plans to enter twoSolectria Corporation-built vehicles. (Solectria is the defending championin this category.) One of those vehicles is an exciting new pre-productionprototype vehicle called the Sunrise. Given this car's anticipatedperformance, sleek design and expected sales price, the folks at BostonEdison believe the Sunrise may be the electric vehicle the American carbuyer has been waiting for. "The American Tour de Sol is an important partof our road testing," says Jim Hogarth of Boston Edison. "We really expectthis vehicle to take the world by storm." SOLAR RACING CATEGORY PROVIDES GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE If you want to move away from the "practical" type of vehicle for a momentand get a look at some wilder, high-tech vehicles, you will want to payclose attention to the solar racing category. The designers of thesevehicles toss aside the needs of the average motorist and try to push thelimits of what can be done by using only the sun's power. Built primarily bystudent teams, these vehicles are small, lightweight, and have large "wings"made up of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to electricity. Theyneed a lot of flat area to collect enough solar energy. Some teams to watch are the Salisbury School team which returns as defending champion and the ConVal High School team, veteran solar racers who areentering a two person vehicle this year. The team that will surely travelthe farthest to enter the race this year is Team Soffix from Nagoya, Japan.They are planning to bring a vehicle which competed in Australia last yearat the World Solar Challenge. Another interesting team comes from a highschool in Grand Rapids. Michigan. A dozen youngsters from Ottawa Hills HighSchool are entering the American Tour de Sol for the third consecutive year.Their electric vehicle project is an integral part of the curriculum attheir school. Students not only design and build the vehicle, they alsohandle all the logistics necessary to racing the vehicle and even raise themoney needed to finance the project. Last year, this student-built entrydemonstrated a range of 80 miles, despite some serious technical problems.This year, their faculty adviser predicts the team will more than doublelast year's range performance. "This program is not just about electricvehicles, though," says teacher Bob George. "Our students are all selectedbecause they are having difficulty succeeding in school. Yet last year, 76percent of our kids went on to post-secondary schools. That 's what thisprogram is really about for us." HYBRID VEHICLES EARN SEPARATE CATEGORY One of the newest additions to the American Tour de Sol this year will bethe competition between hybrid-powered vehicles. Many people believe thatthe hybrid vehicle is the most likely to succeed in the near-term on theAmerican market. A hybrid vehicle is an electric vehicle that also uses asmall on-board gas-powered generator to recharge its batteries and extenddriving range. Although there have been hybrid entries in past years, thisis the first time that four hybrid powered vehicles will compete againsteach other. One of these hybrids is being entered by a team from CornellUniversity. Their team has more than 50 members and has been working onalternative vehicles for three years. This year's vehicle uses electricpower for the motors and a compressed natural gas (CNG) generator torecharge the batteries. "The public consistently mentions limited range as aconcern with EVs," says Robert Thomas, an engineering professor andcoordinator of the Cornell team. "We believe hybrid vehicles address thatproblem and provide a good transition to fully electric or evenhydrogen-powered vehicles in the future." The Cornell students come from avariety of academic disciplines and are all divided into various projectteams. For instance, one team specifically handles all the "business" issuesincluding raising the 50-70 thousand dollars that is needed each year tofinance this project. Another hybrid vehicle is being entered and sponsored by noted actor andenvironmental activist Dennis Weaver. The vehicle, dubbed Surge 1, isdesigned and built by Weaver's cousin, Troy Reed, an automotive engineerworking in Tulsa, Oklahoma. "Electric vehicles are one important way toaddress the degradation of air quality," said Weaver. "The road rallycompetition is an entertaining way to help spread a serious message - thatthere are practical solutions to environmental problems already available tous." OPEN CATEGORY ADDS DIVERSITY The final category in the 1995 American Tour de Sol is the Open category. Asits name suggests, this category allows vehicles to compete even though theydo not fit the specifications of any of the other categories. For example,there are four 2-wheeled vehicles and an equal number of one-person EVscompeting this year. Attracted by the huge audience provided by the AmericanTour de Sol, German designer, Helmut Schiller, is traveling from Europe todemonstrate his pre-production prototype of an electric powered motorscooter. He expects to manufacture the vehicle for sale in Europe and theUnited States in 1996. "This race is the best way to introduce this newvehicle to the American public," according to Schiller. ENJOY FESTIVITIES AT THE START AND FINISH The race will be enhanced this year by a couple of companion events at thestart and finish of the race route. Waterbury and Portland have organizedfestivals to coincide with the beginning and end of the ATdS. Bothcommunities have also been involved in actively promoting and sponsoring therace this year to help draw a large local audience. Attending the AmericaTour de Sol is sure to be an unforgettable experience. Whether you arecompeting in the race, working as a volunteer on the event, bringing thefamily to get a close look at the vehicles or lining up for the "ride anddrive" demonstrations, you're sure to come away with a new understanding ofthe future of transportation. Cleaner air, less dependence on foreign oil,better use of energy and more jobs here at home - these are just some of thepossibilities linked to these new vehicle technologies. There are stillobstacles in the road but, after all, that's what makes the roadinteresting.
