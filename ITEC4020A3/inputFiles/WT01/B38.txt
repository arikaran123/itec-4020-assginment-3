McCoy is professor of Southeast AsianHistory at the University of Wisconsin,Madison. Educated at Columbia and Yale, he has spent the pasttwenty years writing about Southeast Asian historyand politics. Dr. McCoy participated inCauses and Cures: National Teleconference on the NarcoticsEpidemic Saturday, November 9 1991, at MarbleCollegiate Church in Manhattan. PD: How did you come to write The Politics of Heroin; CIAComplicity In The Global Drug Trade? AM: In 1971 I was a graduate student doing Southeast AsianHistory at Yale University. An editor atHarper & Row, Elisabeth Jakab, read some articles in a volume I had edited about Laos, which made somegeneral references to the opium trade inLaos. She decided this would be a great idea for a book and asked me todo a background book on the heroin plaguethat was sweeping the forces then fightingin South Vietnam. We later learned that about one third of theUnited States combat forces in Vietnam,conservatively estimated, were heroinaddicts. I went to Paris and interviewed retired general Maurice Belleux,the former head of the French equivalent ofthe CIA, an organization called SDECE [Servicede Documentation Exterieure et du Contre-Espionage]. In anamazing interview he told me that Frenchmilitary intelligence had financed all theircovert operations from the control of the Indochina drug trade.[The French protected opium trafficking inLaos and northern Vietnam during the colonialwar that raged from 1946 to the French defeat in 1954 at DienBien Phu.] The French paratroopers fighting with hill tribes collected theopium and French aircraft would fly theopium down to Saigon and the Sino-Vietnamese mafia that was the instrument of French intelligencewould then distribute the opium. Thecentral bank accounts, the sharing of the profits, was allcontrolled by French military intelligence. He concluded the interview by telling me that it was hisinformation that the CIA had taken over theFrench assets and were pursuing something of the same policy. So I went to Southeast Asia to follow up on that lead and that'swhat took me into doing this whole book. Itwas basically pulling a thread and keep tuggingat it and a veil masking the reality began to unravel. PD: What was the CIA's role in heroin trafficking in SoutheastAsia? AM: During the 40 years of the cold war, from the late 1940's tothis year, the CIA pursued a policy that Icall radical pragmatism . Their mission was tostop communism and in pursuit of that mission they would allywith anyone and do anything to fightcommunism. Since the 1920's the League of Nations, the forerunner of theUnited Nations, and the United States haveprohibited opium and cocaine products fromlegal sale. These products had already emerged as vast globalcommodities with very substantial production zonesand large markets, large demand for thosecommodities both in the third world and the first. The historic Asia opium zone stretches across 5,000 miles ofAsian mainland from Turkey to Laos alongthe southern borders of the Soviet Union and the southern border of communist China. It just so happenedthat one of the key war zones in the coldwar happened to lay astride the Asian opium zone. During the long years of the cold war the CIA mounted majorcovert guerilla operations along theSoviet-Chinese border. The CIA recruited as allies people we now call drug lords for their operationagainst communist China in northeasternBurma in 1950, then from 1965 to 1975 [during the Vietnam war]their operation in northern Laos and throughoutthe decade of the 1980's, the Afghanoperation against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Powerful, upland political figures control the societies andeconomies in these regions and part of thatpanoply of power is the opium trade. The CIA extended the mantle of their alliance to these druglords and in every case the drug lords usedit to expand a small local trade in opium into a major source of supply for the world markets and the UnitedStates. While they were allied with the United States these drug lordswere absolutely immune to any kind ofinvestigation. If you're involved in any kindof illicit commodity trade, organized crime activity like drugtrafficking, there is only one requisite forsuccess, immunity, and the CIA gave themthat. As long as they were allied with the CIA, the local policeand then the DEA stayed away from the drug lords. Finally, if there were any allegations about the involvement oftheir allies in the drug trade, the CIAwould use their good offices to quash those allegations. This meant that these drug lords, connected with the CIA, andprotected by the CIA, were able to releaseperiodic heroin surges, and [in Latin America] periodic cocaine surges. You can trace very preciselyduring the 40 years of the cold war, theupsurge in narcotics supply in the United States with covert operations. PD: How does the CIA's policies affect drug interdiction? I'vespoken for example to former DrugEnforcement Administration officer Michael Levine, who has expressed anger that he was pulled off casesbecause he got too close to someone who,while being a big trafficker, was also an asset of the CIA. AM: Mike Levine speaks from personal experience. In 1971 MikeLevine was in Southeast Asia operating inThailand as an agent of the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration [DEA]. At the same time I was conducting theinvestigation for the first edition of my book. Mike Levine said that he wanted to go up country to Chiangmai,the heroin capital of Southeast Asia atthat point, the finance and processing center and hub of an enterprise. He wanted to make some majorseizures. Through a veiled series of cutouts in the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, instructions were passed to his superiors in the DEA, who told him hecouldn't go up and make the bust. He waspulled off the case. He said it wasn't until he read my book a number of years laterthat he understood the politics of what wasgoing on and he realized why he had been pulledoff. All of the upland drug lords that were producing thenarcotic, the heroin, were in fact CIAassets. Now he understands it. That is not just a single incident, so let's go back to basics.What is the institutional relationshipbetween the DEA an the CIA? The Federal Bureau of Narcotics [FBN] was established in 1930 as an instrumentof the prohibition of narcotics, the onlyUnited States agency that had a covert action capacity with agents working undercover before World WarII. During the war when the OSS [Office ofStrategic Services] was established, which is the forerunner of the CIA, key personnel were transferredfrom the Federal Bureau of Narcotics totrain the OSS officers in the clandestine arts. That close institutional relationship between the DEA [directdescendant of the FBN] and the CIAcontinues up to the present day. The long time head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a man named HarryAnslinger, who headed that bureau from 1930until his retirement in 1962, was a militant anti-communist who spent a lot of his time incounter-intelligence operations. There's avery close relationship between the two agencies. During the cold war the main priority abroad for the UnitedStates government was anti-communism, andwhenever theCIA mounted an operation, everyother U.S. agency was subordinated to the CIA's covertoperations. That meant that when the CIA was running one of its covert actionwars in the drug zones of Asia, the DEAwould stay away. For example, during the 1950'sthe CIA had this ongoing alliance with the nationalist Chinese innorthern Burma. Initially mounting invasions ofChina in 1950-51, later mountingsurveillance along the border for a projected Chinese invasion ofSoutheast Asia. The DEA stayed out of SoutheastAsia completely during that period andcollected no intelligence about narcotics in deference to theCIA's operation. Let's take two more examples that bring it right up to thepresent. [First] the Afghan operation: from1979 to the present, the CIA's largest operation anywhere in the world, was to support the Afghanresistance forces fighting the Sovietoccupation in their country. The CIA worked through Pakistanmilitary intelligence and worked with the Afghanguerilla groups who were close to Pakistanmilitary intelligence. In 1979 Pakistan had a small localized opium trade and producedno heroin whatsoever. Yet by 1981,according to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, Pakistan had emerged as the world's leadingsupplier of heroin. It became the supplierof 60% of U.S. heroin supply and it captured a comparable section of the European market. In Pakistanitself the results were even moredisastrous. In 1979 Pakistan had no heroin addicts, in 1980 Pakistan had5,000 heroin addicts, and by 1985,according to official Pakistan government statistics, Pakistan had 1.2 million heroin addicts, the largestheroin addict population in the world. Who were the manufacturers? They were all either militaryfactions connected with Pakistanintelligence, CIA allies, or Afghan resistance groups connected with the CIA and Pakistan intelligence. In Mayof 1990, ten years after this began, theWashington Post finally ran a front page story saying high U.S. officials admit that Gulbuddin Hekmatyar[leader of the Hezbi-i Islami guerillagroup], and other leaders of the Afghan resistance are leading heroin manufacturers. This had been known for years, reported in the Pakistan press,indeed in 1980 reported in McClean'smagazine. In fact in 1980 a White House narcotics advisor, Dr. David Musto of Yale University, went on therecord demanding that we not ally withAfghan guerilla groups that were involved in narcotics. His advice was ignored and he went public inan op-ed in the New York Times. Another example: Let's take the cocaine epidemic. In 1981 ascocaine began surging north into the UnitedStates, the DEA assigned an agent named Tomas Zepeda, in June 1981, to open up an office in Honduras.By 1983 Zepeda was collecting very goodintelligence indicating that the Honduran military were taking bribes to let the aircraft through their countryto come to the United States. Zepeda was pulled out of Honduras and that office was closed bythe DEA. They didn't open another office inHonduras until 1987 because Honduras was afrontline country in the contra war. If Zepeda's reports aboutinvolvement of the Honduran military hadbeen acted upon, the DEA would have been forced to take action against the Honduran military officerswho were working with the CIA to protectthe contras. In short, there was a conflict between the drug war and the coldwar. Faced with the choice, the UnitedStates government chose the cold war over the drug war, sacrificing a key intelligence post for theDEA in Honduras. The same thing happened in Afghanistan. During the 1980's fromthe time that heroin trade started, therewere 17 DEA agents based in Pakistan. They neithermade nor participated in any major seizures or arrests. At a timewhen other police forces, particularlyScandinavian forces, made some major seizuresand brought down a very major syndicate connected with formerpresident Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan. PD: What is the role of banking in the heroin trade? What, ifany, are the connections to the Bank ofCredit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal. AM: There have been three times in the past 15 years in which theCIA's money transfer activities havesurfaced. The first came in the late 1970's whenthe Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, investigated a Nassau bankcalled the Castle Bank. It's a very interestingbank. It was set up by a man named PaulHelliwell, a very senior CIA operative who had retired from theagency. He set up this bank and it grew into aLatin American network of banks. It wasused by the CIA to launder money. In essence, what appears to emerge from the investigation of theCastle Bank in the late 1970's, was thatthe CIA did not want to move operational funds for covert operations through normal banking channels,where they could be uncovered, either bythe United States or abroad, where they could come to the knowledge of opponents of the agency. They preferred to work through allied banks. Banks that weresecure, that were a little bit loose intheir accounting procedures. When the Castle Bank was uncovered, the IRS announced a major investigationof the bank's money laundering activities.Suddenly the IRS cancelled the investigation and the Wall Street Journal was told by informed sources in theIRS that the CIA had blocked theinvestigation. As soon as Castle Bank collapsed, a small merchant bank based inAustralia, operating offshore betweenAustralia and southeast Asia, suddenly mushroomed into a global network of banks, acquiring Latin Americanand European structures that had belongedto Castle Bank. This bank in Australia called the Nugan-Hand Bank began very quickly in the late1970's, to acquire a board of retired U.S.intelligence officials, either CIA or various military intelligence services. The most prominent example, the former Director of CentralIntelligence, William Colby, became thelegal council of Nugan-Hand Bank. The bank was founded by Frank Nugan, an insecure and incompetentAustralian lawyer, and by Michael JohnHand, a man with a high school degree who had gone to Vietnam with the Green Berets. He had served in Laos inthe 1960's as a contract CIA operative,fighting with three of the people who became very prominent in the CIA's privatized operations, ThomasClines, Theodore Shackley and RichardSecord, all very big names in the Iran-Contra scandal. Michael John Hand was the one who worked with William Colby aslegal counsel. One of their big operationswas to buy a former U.S. naval base in theTurks and Caicos islands in the Caribbean. Australian policeinvestigators who examined that contract, drawn upby William Colby for Michael John Hand,concluded that the plausible explanation they could discover for that contract was to establish away-station for cocaine smuggling betweenColombia and the United States. We do know the bank was pioneering in the smuggling of heroinbetween Southeast Asia and Australia. Inthe late 1970's Australia had very strict bankinglaws, and anytime you got foreign exchange you had to account forit. The Nugan-Hand Bank helped Australianorganized crime figures get their moneyoverseas so they could buy heroin and ship the heroin back toAustralia. The Australian police investigators documented that Michael JohnHand worked very closely with Australia'stop criminal drug traffickers to finance the first shipments, the pioneering shipments, of heroin toAustralia from Southeast Asia. In 1980 that bank went belly-up and it collapsed, Frank Nugancommitted suicide, and then a reallyamazing event occurred. Thomas Clines, the former CIA chief of station from Laos, a man of greatprominence in the Iran-Contra scandal, flewto Sydney, Australia and exfiltrated Michael John Hand, whodisappeared in the United States and was neverseen since. Then we come to BCCI. Although we haven't gotten to the bottom ofit by any means, we haven't even begun toask the questions, much less get the answers.BCCI mushroomed in the 1980's and seemed to serve as a similarconduit as Castle Bank and Nugan-Hand Bank. TheManchester Guardian published an exposesaying that the CIA paid its operations in the United Kingdom through BCCI, and it's known that the CIA paidthe Afghan guerrillas, who were based inPakistan, through BCCI. There's one rather large question that nobody is asking aboutBCCI. It's a Pakistani bank, it boomsduring the 1980's, in exactly the same period that Pakistan emerges as the world's largest heroin center.We know the Pakistan military officersinvolved in the drug trade had their accounts with BCCI. There's a three way relationship that really cries out,screams, demands, a congressionalinvestigation. The relationship between BCCI and the CIA operations inAfghanistan and Pakistan; how much moneywas the CIA moving through those accounts? Secondly,the relationship between the Pakistan military connected withthat operation and BCCI. Thirdly, therelationship between the booming heroin tradeof Pakistan and BCCI. I think what we'll possibly discover isthat the CIA was shipping its funds intoPakistan through BCCI, protecting BCCI therebyfrom serious investigations elsewhere in the world. That thePakistan military were in fact banking their drugprofits, moving their drug profits from theconsuming country back to Pakistan though BCCI. In fact theboom in the Pakistan drug trade was financed byBCCI.The interrelationship between theAfghan resistance and the CIA and the Pakistan drug trade canall be seen through the medium of BCCI, the bankerto both operations, the resistance and thedrug trade. PD: What are the alternatives to the drug war? AM: In the 1980's, indeed over the last 20 years, society hasbeen given two choices in the drug war. Theescalating repression against the drug trade by Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush while the media gaveairtime and space to only one sustainedcritique.That critique put forth by the Drug Policy Foundation argues that the drug war wasn't working andtherefore we should pursue a policy oflegalization. Simply turn the whole policy of repression on its head, instead of trying to wipe out the drugtrade we legalize it. Let me first of all review the drug war. Is it working? No it'snot. The current drug war budget is $11billion, a very large amount of money. Of that$11 billion, 86% is devoted to the suppression of cocainetrafficking between the United States andColombia and cocaine trafficking in the U.S. as well. However, while we're devoting 86% of our drugwar budget to cocaine, use of cocaine hasgone up by 15 percent. Every single indicator shows cocaine addiction is rising at the same time weare fighting this drug war. The White House is claiming victory in the drug war, WilliamBennet, the drug czar who retired severalmonths ago, claimed a victory, President Bush has alluded to a victory in the drug war, and so has thecurrent drug war czar, Mr. Bob Martinez.What they claim as a victory is a victory over casual drug use. Well let's face it casual drug usedoesn't count, if some kid tries drugs anddoesn't like it that's nice but that's not the problem. The problem is repeated use, and every single indicator saysrepeated use is up. The drug war is notworking. It's filling up our prisons. The prison population doubled under President Reagan, and we nowhave over 400 prisoners per 100,000population versus 35 per 100,000 in Holland. We have the largest prison population per capita in the worldand it's going up. At the same time ourheroin use is going up and our cocaine use is going up. The reason why is because our effort in the drug war has beenconcentrated in interdicting the supply ofdrugs in the United States and over the last 20 years we have fought this drug war on a bilateralbasis. The United States in 1972 went intoTurkey and said "wipe out your opium trade" and inthe 1980's they went into Colombia and said"wipe out your cocaine processingindustry". In the early 1980's the U.S. went into Boliviaand said "wipe out coca cultivation inthe western part of your country". This is bilateral interdiction, where the U.S. as a sovereignpower deals with another sovereign stateand applies pressure on that sovereign state to get action on drugs. There is a misperception about the nature of heroin and cocaine.These are not petty vices, these arecomplex global commodity trades involving vast areas of production and enormous consumption. It's acommodity comparable in every respect tocoffee or tea. When you bring down the baton of law enforcement on a complexglobal commodity trade something curiousand something paradoxical, something almostmagical happens. The genius of capitalism, its magic, itsalchemy, transform the lead of repressioninto the gold of stimulus. Every time we applyrepression upon narcotics production on this bilateral basis westimulate production, and ultimately we stimulateconsumption because of the law of supplyand demand. In 1972 President Richard Nixon wiped out the Turkish opium cropwith his first drug war, the grandmother ofdrug wars. This grandmother of drug wars totallywiped out Turkish opium production, and for a while it disruptedthe French connection between Turkey, whichhad supplied French labs in Marseille,which in turn supplied New York. It looked like victory until you see what really happened. Turkeyonly grew 7% of the worlds opium. Acrossthe 5,000 mile band of mountains from Turkey in the west to Laos in the east lay the rest of theworlds opium production, the other 93percent. Turkey had a shortfall of production, that meant there was ashortfall in supply of illicit opium. Sothe price went up as would always happen, short supply and the price goes up. That meant farmerselsewhere in the opium zone, from Iran,Afghanistan increased their production as happens every single time. The repression creates a shortfall insupply which raises price and thenstimulates production everywhere around the world. What then is the solution to the problem? Somewhere between thepoles of repression and legalization thereis an alternative strategy which I call regulation.I don't think we should really fool ourselves to consider legalization. It's politically impractical, it's nevergoing to happen. If we legalize the drug we are not going to legalize it for kids,this is a country that just raised thedrinking age for the socially acceptable drug, alcohol from 18 to 21. You give me the name right now ofone legislator who is going to stand up andsay "I favor crack for kids, vote for my bill," nobody will ever introduce such a bill. Even if by somemiracle you got a legalization bill itwould exclude 21 year olds and it would mean that the big drug, crack cocaine would have 89% of its clienteleexcluded from legalization. I favor regulation because if cocaine and heroin are commoditieslet's deal with them as such. You don'trepress commodities, you regulate them. Accept the fact that there is no quick fix to this trade, it'sbeen around for 200 years as a major globalcommodity, as an illegal commodity it's been around for 70 years and it's likely to be around for another70, maybe 200 years. Recognizing that you then cancel your bilateral interdictionefforts and transfer your funds to themultilateral effort being run by the United Nations.The multilateral effort by the United Nations actually doesreduce production slowly, painfully over aperiod of decades. Ultimately we're going to have to seek an amelioration, not asolution, on the streets. We're going tohave to address the complex of causes as to why people use drugs. That is where we have to concentrateour money.

Honk Kong merchantsserve as intermediaries between the foreigners and the Chineseauthorities. 1767 Opium Imports Rise Opium from Bengal continues to enter Chinadespite the edict of 1729 prohibiting smoking. It increases infrequency from 200 chests annually in 1729 to 1000 annually by1967. However, much is for medicinal use. Tariffs are collectedon the opium. 1772 The East India company establishes a limited monopoly overBengal opium; the company has general control but the operationis in the hands of contractors, who advance company funds to thefarmers, purchase the opium produced, and sell it to the companywhich then auctions it off to merchants in Calcutta. Britishcompanies are the principal shippers. 1773-86 Limited Monopoly Warren Hastings, the first governor generalof India, recognizes that opium is harmful and at first opposesincreasing production; later he encoiurages the the control ofopium by the company hoping that by monopolizing and limiting thesupply he will discourage its consumption. This limited monopolylasts throughout his administration and beyond, but when theChinese market is discovered, the monopoly shifts fromcontrolling to expanding cultivation. 1779 Opium Imported First mention of actual trading in opium atCanton. 1780 Prohibition Attempted British traders establish an opium depotat Macao. Another imperial edict prohibits consumption of opiumand reiterates prohibition of its sale. 1787 British Trade in opium is still less important than tradedebate in commodities; directors of the East India Company, overopium. recognizing China's objections to the importation ofopium, make offers to prohibit the export of Indian opium toChina. However, company representatives in Canton declare thatthe Chinese are never sincere in their declared intentions ofsuppressing illicit traffic, as long as the officials issueprohibitory edicts with one hand and extend the other to receivebribes from the illegal trade. deletia 1796 Prohibition Alarmed by increasing use, the emperor issues anAttempted edict forbiding importation of opium, as well as exportof Chinese silver that is being used as a medium of exchange. Noweven legitimate trade is limited to barter. Nonetheless, illegalpurchase of opium with silver continues. 1797 Trade Monopoly The company assumes full control of Bengalopium. 1799 Trade, A strong edict by authorities at Canton, cultivationban. supporting the emperor's decree of 1796, forbids opium tradeat that port. A concurrent drive against native poppy growing isinitiated. Opium becomes an illicit commodity. Trade diverted, The 1799 edict increases traffic throughsmuggling. Macao and other areas beyond government controlenabling UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH. The British declare only theirlegitimate cargo, leave opium on board to be picked up by Chinesemerchants who smuggle it ashore in small, fast boats. 1800 Anti-Opium Opium becomes identified with official policydevelops. corruption, criminals and antigovernment secretsocieties. An imperial edict prohibits domestic cultivation andrepeats the prohibition against importing opium. China developsan anti-opium policy, at least on paper. Edicts continue to beissued reiterating prohibitions against importation, sale, andconsumption of opium. 1804 Canton Trade Resumes Opium trading resumes at the port ofCanton. Though the 1799 edict is still in force, it has littleeffect and no immediate practical change in policy ensues. Opiates Britain 1800-1917 " Patent medicines and opium preparations such as_Dover's Powder were readily available without restrictions.Indeed, Laudanum (opium mixed with alcohol) was cheaper than beeror wine and readily within the means of the lowest-paid worker.As a result, throughout the first half of the 19th century, theincidence of opium dependence appears to have increased steadilyin England, Europe and the United States. Working-class medicinaluse of opium-bearing nostrums as sedatives for children wasespecially prominent in England. However, despite some well known cases among 19th centuryEnglish literary amd creative personalities--Thomas de Quincey,Byron, Shelley, Coleridge, and Dickens--recreational use waslimited, and there is no evidence that use was so excessive as tobe a medical or social concern."

Such persons who only care to profitthemselves, and disregard their harm to others, are not toleratedby the laws of heaven and are unanimously hated by human beings.His Majesty the Emperor, upon hearing of this, is in a toweringrage. He has especially sent me, his commissioner, to come toKwangtung, and together with the governor-general and governorjointly to investigate and settle this matter. All those people in China who sell opium or smoke opiumshould receive the death penalty. If we trace the crime of thosebarbarians who through the years have been selling opium, thenthe deep harm they have wrought and the great profit they haveusurped should fundamentally justify their execution according tolaw. We take into consideration, however, the fact that thevarious barbarians have still known how to repent their crimesand return to their allegiance to us by taking the 20,183 chestsof opium from their storeships and petitioning us, through theirconsular officer [superintendent of trade], Elliot, to receiveit. It has been entirely destroyed and this has been faithfullyreported to the Throne in several memorials by this commissionerand his colleagues. Fortunately we have received a specially extended favor fromis Majesty the Emperor, who considers that for those whovoluntarily surrender there are still some circumstances topalliate their crime, and so for the time being he hasmagnanimously excused them from punishment. But as for those whoagain violate the opium prohibition, it is difficult for the lawto pardon them repeatedly. Having established new regulations, wepresume that the ruler of your honorable country, who takesdelight in our culture and whose disposition is inclined towardsus, must be able to instruct the various barbarians to observethe law with care. It is only necessary to explain to them theadvantages and disadvantages and then they will know that thelegal code of the Celestial Court must be absolutely obeyed withawe. We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li[three li make one mile] from China. Yet there are barbarianships that strive to come here for trade for the purpose ofmaking a great profit. The wealth of China is used to profit thebarbarians. That is to say, the great profit made by barbariansis all taken from the rightful share of China. By what right dothey then in return use the poisonous drug to injure the Chinesepeople? Even though the barbarians may not necessarily intend todo us harm, yet in coveting profit to an extreme, they have noregard for injuring others. Let us ask, where is your conscience?I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbiddenby your country; that is because the harm caused by opium isclearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to yourown country, then even less should you let it be passed on to theharm of other countries - how much less to China!

These descendantsof the Tatars appreciated Chinese civilization and adopted aconciliatory attitude toward their subjects. They refused,however, to allow intermarriage with the Chinese, for theyrealized that only their blood difference kept them from beingassimilated and conquered. By and large, however, the Manchusgradually became Chinese in their attitudes and habits. The Manchu emperors were remarkably successful. The reign ofChien-lung (1736-1795) was a time of great expansion. The Manchusgained Turkestan, Burma, and Tibet. By the end of the eighteenthcentury Manchu power extended even into Nepal, and the territoryunder the Ching control was as extensive as under any previousdynasty. . . . . . . The Western Response The foreigners were especially irritated by the high customsduties the Chinese forced them to pay and by the attempts ofChinese authorities to stop the growing import trade in opium.The drug had long been used to stop diarrhea, but in theseventeenth and eighteenth century people in all classes began touse it recreationally. Most opium came from Turkey or India, andin 1800 its import was forbidden by the imperial government.Despite this restriction, the opium trade continued to flourish.Privately owned vessels of many countries, including the UnitedStates, made huge profits from the growing number of Chineseaddicts. The government in Peking noted that the foreignersseemed intent on dragging down the Chinese through theencouragement of opium addiction. [See Opium Factory: The stacking room at an opium factory inPatna, India. Opium smuggling upset the balance of trade anddestroyed China's economy.] In the meantime, the empire faced other problems. The armybecame corrupt and the tax farmers defrauded the people. Thecentral bureaucracy declined in efficiency, and the generallyweak emperors were unable to meet the challenges of the time. Thebalance of trade turned against the Chinese in the 1830s, and theBritish decided to force the issue of increased trade rights. Thepoint of conflict was the opium trade. By the late 1830s morethan 30,000 chests, each of which held about 150 pounds of theextract, were being brought in annually by the various foreignpowers. Some authorities assert that the trade in opium alonereversed China's formerly favorable balance of trade. In thespring of 1839 Chinese authorities at Canton confiscated andburned the opium. In response, the British occupied positionsaround Canton. In the war that followed, the Chinese could not match thetechnological and tactical superiority of the British forces. In1842 China agreed to the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking.Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain, and other ports, includingCanton, were opened to British residence and trade. It would be amistake to view the conflict between the two countries simply asa matter of drug control; it was instead the acting out of deepcultural conflicts between east and west. The French and Americans approached the Chinese after theNanking Treaty's provisions became known, and in 1844 gained thesame trading rights as the British. The advantages granted thethree nations by the Chinese set a precedent that would dominateChina's relations with the world for the next century. The"most favored nation" treatment came to be extended sofar that China's right to rule in its own territory was limited.This began the period referred to by the Chinese as the time ofunequal treaties - a time of unprecedented degradation for China.The humiliation the Central Kingdom suffered is still rememberedand strongly affects important aspects of its foreign policy.Meanwhile, the opium trade continued to thrive. The British and French again defeated China in a second opiumwar in 1856. By the terms of the Treaty of Tientsin (1858) theChinese opened new ports to trading and allowed foreigners withpassports to travel in the interior. Christians gained the rightto spread their faith and hold property, thus opening up anothermeans of western penetration. The United States and Russia gainedthe same privileges in separate treaties.

Atthat time and as a result of the article, several questions wereraised, so I have decided to expand on the topic to try to answerthem. The following information and quotes come from the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This publicationcan be obtained at no charge by calling 1-800-729-6686 and askingthem to send "(SMA) 93-1988" (Pregnant, Substance-UsingWomen) or more simply, "TIP 2." The informationcontained in TIP 2 comes from a rather lengthy 90-page bookletwith a full two-page list of contributors known as the ConsensusPanel. There is also another full page of Tip FieldReviewers who "were selected to review and commenton the draft document based on their knowledge of and concern forthe special needs of pregnant, substance-using women." The consensus is that methadone maintenance "is a well-documentedapproach to improve outcomes for both the woman and her fetus[and] is strongly encouraged for all pregnant, opioid-dependentwomen [emphasis mine]. It provides the followingadvantages: Reduces illegal opioid use as well as use of other drugs. Helps to remove the opioid-dependent woman from the drug-seeking environment and eliminates the necessary illegal behavior. Prevents fluctuations of the maternal drug level that may occur throughout the day. Improves maternal nutrition, increasing the weight of the newborn. Improves the woman's ability to prepare for the birth of the infant and begin homemaking. Reduces obstetrical complications. Medical withdrawal of the pregnant, opioid-dependent womanfrom methadone is not indicated or recommended[emphasis mine]. Few women will have the motivation or thepsychosocial supports to accomplish and maintain totalabstinence. The goal, therefore, is to achieve the besttherapeutic dose possible with which the woman feels comfortable.The neonatal abstinence syndrome can be treated with minimalcomplications. Despite the above caution, at times, medical withdrawal mayneed to be considered due to logistical or geographic barriers.In these cases, the decision to undertake such a programmust be a joint decision between the obstetrician, the woman, andher counselor, with the understanding that few women will beappropriate candidates for this approach [emphasis mine]. The woman should understand that she must prove she is acandidate for medical withdrawal by complying with prenatal andtherapy appointments and supplying clean urines. If at any timethe woman is unable to comply with these requirements, no furtherdecrease in dosage of methadone should be ordered. . . .Patientsshould be allowed to discontinue withdrawal at any time, for anyreason, without feelings of guilt [emphasis mine]. Theyshould be then be placed into a methadone maintenance program ata therapeutically sound dose. Clinicians need to be particularlyaware that a decrease in methadone dosage could precipitate arelapse to drug use. Patients in continuous treatment who returnto illegal drug use should be placed back on methadone. Methadoneis preferable to the use of illegal street drugs. . . . .Medical withdrawal from methadone is usually done indecrements of 2 to 2 � mg every 7 to 10 days. This procedureshould only be done in conjunction with an obstetrician who canmonitor the effects on the fetus. Intrauterine demise(death of the fetus in utero) has been documented as acomplication of medical withdrawal even when done under optimalconditions, such as hospitalization and close fetal monitoring"[emphasis mine]. It is clear that the consensus is that pregnant women who aredependent on opiates should be placed in a methadone program assoon as possible and should not be detoxed during the pregnancy.The dosing guidelines are the same for pregnant as well asnonpregnant substance users. "Based on current and emergingresearch, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) suggeststhat maintenance doses below 60 mg are not effective and hencenot appropriate. Arbitrary low-dose policies for pregnant andnonpregnant patients is often associated with increased drug useas well as reduced program retention. Based on current informedconsensus, the most prudent course is to rely on individuallydetermined methadone dosing that is measured by the absence ofsubjective and objective abstinence symptoms and the reduction ofdrug hunger." If you are pregnant and an opiate user, it iscrucial that you find a program that will maintain you onmethadone for your health and that of your developing fetus. New Hampshire is one of the few states that does not havemethadone maintenance, but they recently passed a bill (June1996) that would allow pregnant opiate users access to methadone.The downside is that there is a stipulation that "the lengthof time for methadone use after birth shall not exceed 3months." The months following birth of the child should nothave the added stress and complication of a methadone detox. Ifthese women are not ready for detox, they will most likely returnto drug use instead of using the respite from drug chasing toenjoy their child. If they were allowed to remain on methadonemaintenance, this could be avoided. The good news is that a former legislator (seestory on page 2--Harm Reduction Conference) is researchingmethadone and running for office again this year. Advocate DanSundquist is on the job also. Thanks for the information,Dan. Top of Page MethadoneConsumers' Meeting & Harm Reduction Conference METHADONE CONSUMERS MEETING & HARMREDUCTION CONFERENCE Methadone patients and advocates from across the UnitedStates met in Oakland, California on September 17, 1996 to set upa Methadone Consumers' Advocacy Agenda. These patients andadvocates are doing something to change treatment back to Dr.'sDole and Nyswander's caring model instead of resigning themselvesto the current prohibitive policies of methadone treatment in theUnited States. "At the Tuesday Consumer Meeting, we formed a Committee thatput together The Methadone Consumers Platform," saidJoycelyn Woods, Executive Vice-President of NAMA. "It wasread at the Final Plenary and was the only report from groupsthat got several cheers--more than several in fact. The cheerswere for statements like ‘No Blind Dosing', ‘NoDischarge without Due Process', and ‘No Discharge fordisplaying symptoms of our disease' (using drugs). So I think webrought down the house." Through Joycelyn and e-mail, I met former New Hampshire StateRepresentative, Patricia M. O'Keefe, who was "co-sponsor ofboth a needle exchange bill and a bill to remove the prescriptionrequirements to purchase syringes and decriminalize possession ofsuch items." Ms. O'Keefe said of the conference, "Ithought it was really well organized, and...I came away from itwith a much clearer vision of harm reduction. One area reallyimpressed me--some presenters that were on methadone maintenancereally blew me away and made me realize that I don't know enoughabout the treatment, that I had preconceptions of methadonemaintenance that were inaccurate and distorted, probably similar(but not so extreme) to those in the legislature that have to beeducated about the treatment. I never realized I had thesestereotypes in my head until I witnessed these highly functioningindividuals. . . .I am kind of embarrassed by my ignorance. ..[but] I look forward to researching the subject and rectifyingthe situation." This is wonderful commentary, and Ms. O'Keefe does not need to beembarrassed about not knowing about methadone maintenancetreatment. Look at the ignorance in the medical professionregarding substance abuse and methadone maintenance, look at theanswers to the many myths we have been publishing, and look atsome of the ignorance even in the field of methadone maintenanceput forth by counselors and doctors who should be knowledgeableabout their business. There is no shame in being unaware--theshame is in staying unaware and the perpetuation of the negativestereotypes of the methadone-maintained patient. Top of Page MedicalMaintenance by Beth Francisco As with so much about methadone maintenance, Iknew nothing of this thing called Medical Maintenance when Ifirst started as a patient advocate in August 1995. The concept,when I first learned of it, fascinated me. But, why should it?Because we have been so brainwashed into thinking that we arecriminals, moral degenerates, and undeserving that it justdoesn't occur to us think of ourselves as patients. We are told,if not implicitly then at least we are certainly given thefeeling, that we are not entitled to this life-savingmedication--that it is a privilege. To those of you who read Dr.Payte's, "Insulin Treatment in Diabetes. . .," inSeptember's Methadone Today, apply that last statement to histhesis. It's absurd when applied to insulin for diabetes, but webelieve it about methadone. Well, I don't believe it anymore. D. Novick et al (1988 June 10 JAMA 259; 3299-3302) wrote in"Medical Maintenance: A New Model for Continuing Treatmentof Socially Rehabilitated Methadone Maintenance Patients"about the study of the first 40 medically maintained formerheroin addicts. These patients are seen in the atmosphere of adoctor's office, with an appointment during regular hours, alongwith other medical patients. At the visits, the patient submits aurine, takes a dose of medication in front of the doctor or hisstaff, completes a questionnaire, and is interviewed. He or shemay receive up to 28 days' medication at the doctor's discretion.These patients do not receive the counseling that is mandatory inthe clinic setting but may be referred to counseling if needed. Some of the requirements for Medical Maintenance are: 1. Five years in methadone maintenance treatment. 2. Employed or other productive use of time for the past threeyears and legitimate income. 3. No criminal involvement for past three years. 4. No drug or alcohol abuse for the past three years. 5. Record of reliability in methadone maintenance, i.e. regularattendance at counseling sessions, urine submissions, no requestsfor replacement bottles of methadone, and have obeyed clinicrules. 6. Decision that long-term methadone maintenance will benecessary, i.e. unsuccessful detox attempts, judgement of patientand doctor. 7. Emotional stability. 8. No socializing with illicit drug users (to diminishdiversion). 9. Recommendation from clinic with thorough knowledge ofpatient's history. 10. Patients must be volunteers and agree to participate inresearch evaluations. This study began in June 1983; as of January 1988, "infollow-up ranging from 12 to 55 months, 33 (82.5%) of 40 hadremained in medical maintenance, yielding an annual retentionrate of 94%. Five (12.5%) patients had been discharged because ofcocaine abuse and returned to a conventional methadonemaintenance program." Three of the 33 patients had briefincidents of substance abuse but were "resolved withcounseling and increased frequency of office visits with urinemonitoring. Only four instances of lost medication occurred inthe 1381 patient-months of this study. No overdoses of methadonewere reported by patients or their families." Of an additional 37 patients who were added to MedicalMaintenance "between April 1987 and May 1988, 36 haveremained stable during 1-14 months of treatment, with nodocumented substance abuse. One patient was transferred back tohis previous program after having repeatedly exceeded his dailymethadone dose. Thus, of the 77 patients admitted to medicalmaintenance since its inception, 69 (90%) have remained intreatment as of this writing (June 1988)." Other patients were added to Medical Maintenance in 1989 to total100. Patients were followed in Medical Maintenance for a total of3.5-9.25 years. As of September 1992, the number of patients ingood standing was 72. Of the other 28 patients who left MedicalMaintenance, only 15 were unfavorably discharged--11 for cocaineuse, 3 for misuse of medication, and one (1) was discharged forrepeatedly failing to keep appointments. Patients perceived the benefits to be "that of being treatedin a more professional atmosphere. They have reported improvedself-esteem from being regarded as medical patients rather thandrug abusers, from being rewarded with a degree of trust aftermany years of excellent performance in treatment, and from nolonger being required to receive unnecessary supportive services.. . . Patients have also stated that the 28-day reportingschedule markedly reduced problems in work attendance andmaintaining confidentiality. . . Medication in tablets ratherthan as a liquid which required constant refrigeration alsoallowed patients to take extended business trips or vacations.Finally, the physician-patient relationship is improved, sincetreatment decisions are based on clinical indications rather thanimpersonal regulations." This is a great outcome when we stop to think about it. Out of100 heroin addicts who were out on the street costing themselvesand society untold grief, 85 were salvaged and contribute tothemselves, their families and society because of methadone andmedical maintenance. Granted, most of them would probably haveremained in the clinics if they had not been accepted for medicalmaintenance, but after five years of repressive clinic rules,they had earned by their exemplary behavior the chance to be freeof some of the restrictions . We need more doctors who are knowledgeable about substance abusewho would be willing to integrate methadone patients into theirpractices. Of course, there is the problem of regulation , theDEA and other government agencies; and believe me, as methadonepatients we know about regulations and sympathize with thosedoctors who would be willing to do this. We would, however, alsobe eternally grateful. Even though I have once-a-week take homes, I have a 45-minutedrive each way to the clinic in good weather and drive a car withover 100,000 miles on it. After eight years, I am more than readyto find a local physician who would be able to prescribe for meon a monthly basis. Some of us just do not need weekly or twicemonthly counseling sessions, nor can we afford them. To Top of Page DepressiveEpisodes in Methadone Detoxes There may be a good reason why many have adifficult time detoxing off methadone. According to Philip Kanofet al, in the American Journal of Psychiatry (1993March), "development of an organic mood syndrome is a commonoccurrence in patients undergoing slow detoxification frommethadone maintenance treatment and is associated with a pooroutcome. Even with these 24 highly-motivated patients, the failure ratewas substantial. The patients were selected for detox becausethey were not using any illicit drugs, were not involved in"drug-culture-related activities", were employed andhad stable family relationships. Thirteen (over half) of thepatients involved in the study did not complete thedetoxification.. All of the patients were stabilized and maintained at a startingdose for 2-5 weeks before start of detox, and all data obtainedat this time was referred to as the baseline. The study wasdouble blind which means that neither patient nor investigatorsknew the patient's dose. All of the patients' daily doses weredecreased by 5mg weekly until their dose reached 15mg. At thattime, the daily dose was decreased by 3mg weekly. Using 3 different rating scales, 2 of which were subjective andone objective scale, these patients were self- and staff-ratedfor signs of opiate withdrawal on a weekly basis. "Patientswho failed to complete detoxification manifested significantlygreater increases from baseline in symptoms of dysphoria asmeasured by" subjective and objective signs of opoidwithdrawal. "The results indicate an association between theemergence of clinically significant symptoms of dysphoria andlack of success in therapeutic detoxification from methadonemaintenance." Symptoms including fatigue, insomnia, loss ofappetite, etc. suggest "criteria for a major depressiveepisode as defined in DSM-III-R. However, the prompt reduction insymptoms of dysphoria following restabilization on methadone. ..clearly demonstrates the organic etiology of the prominent mooddisturbance." Does this mean that all is lost and that we will be dependentforever on methadone? These researchers feel that there may begood evidence that anti-depressants should be started beforedetox in order to prevent or treat depressive symptoms. Also, allof these subjects were detoxed at the same rate, but we are allindividuals and need to detox at our own rate. Some of us mayneed to stop the detox several times to become restabilizedbefore continuing. The point needs to be made, however, that methadone maintenanceis a legitimate treatment for opioid dependence, and it is notthe be all and end all of every methadone-maintained person todetox. The world will not come to an end if we have tried todetox and have been unable. The subjects selected seemed to bedoing just fine before they started to detox. Remember thecriterion for being selected--the subjects were not using anyillicit drugs, they were employed or going to school, were notinvolved in drug-related activities, and they had improved andstabilized family relationships. What do we define as success?Let's not put people in impossible situations. If a person wantsto detox, that's fine--more power to them if they can do it. Ifthey can't, but have made all those other improvements in theirlives, why can't we leave them alone? Top of Page DrugPolicy Foundation Grant With the next issue of Methadone Todaywill come funding from the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). Many ofyou know how we have struggled to keep the newsletter in printand mailed over the past year, and this grant comes just in timeto save it. We appreciate the opportunity that the DPF grant hasgiven us to keep the lines of communication open and encourageeven more patient and clinic participation. Thank you, DPF!!! The DPF puts out a pamphlet which states that it was establishedin 1986 and is the "leading independent forum foralternatives to the failed drug war, including legalization,medicalization and harm reduction. The basic premise of theFoundation's work is that a war is not a domestic policy. . ..The Foundation counters drug-war spawned misinformation andhysteria through accurate research and a widespread educationalcampaign. Because of [their] work, the media and the publicincreasingly recognize the destruction and futility of the drugwar." Now that the funding problem is not at crisis level (we can stilluse a dollar or two from our readers to defray costs), and wewill be putting out an issue every month, we are hoping that manymore of you will submit articles for publication. If yousubmitted an article that did not get published, it may not havereached me. However, mail comes directly to me now, and I will domy best to include every person's efforts. Don't worry aboutspelling--that is the function of the spell checker and the wordprocessor. We want your ideas, stories and concerns. This is yournewsletter. Has something happened to you at a clinic that youfeel is unfair? Have you ever been in jail and been deniedmethadone treatment? How about the hospital? Do you have acounselor or other staff member who has gone to bat for you whenno one else would? What were you like before methadone, and whatare you like now? We know you have an amazing story, and we wantit. If you prefer, we don't have to publish your name. The DPF has notified us that the only condition of funding forthe newsletter is that we do not publish any articles that couldbe construed as lobbying. Although we have published some in thepast, they have been assured that we will not do so during thenext year using any of their funding, equipment or supplies.According to Webster's Dictionary, ‘lobbying' is defined as"a group of people trying to bring pressure to bear onlegislators to pursue policies favorable to their interests.Please keep this in mind when submitting articles. This is an appropriate place to offer thanks to NPL andespecially Arlene Heiser for their generous support in makingsure we have had access to equipment and supplies for printingMethadone Today. Thanks to Sterling for allowing me to interrupthis work space (doing so with good grace) while making copies ofthe newsletter, to the counselors for not saying much whengetting in their way, to Kemmer for allowing me to disruptWednesday mornings, and to Dr. Burk just for being himself. Thanks to Penny for writing the rough draft of the body of thegrant. To Joycelyn Woods, Executive Vice-President of NAMA, manythanks for her help and support every day through e-mail communication and especially for helping us through thegrant process when all the while she was busy writing her own..Who says methadone patients don't have their "stuff"together? Top of Page TheUse of Insulin in the Treatment of Diabetes: An Analogy to Methadone Maintenance by J. Thomas Payte, M.D.1 A five-year study was conducted on 300 insulin-dependentdiabetics. The purpose of the study was to determine if the useof insulin resulted in any long-term benefit to diabetics. Theconcept was based on two widely accepted hypotheses: (1) that aformerly insulin-dependent diabetic could learn to live acomfortable and responsible life without insulin, provided thathe or she wanted to badly enough; and (2) that the use of anyexogenous substance to replace or simply substitute for adeficient endogenous substance is conceptually unacceptable tomodern scientific thinking and may be inherently evil. It is obvious that exogenous insulin, being highly suspect at theoutset, should be used in the lowest possible doses and for theshortest time possible. In this study, treatment with insulin waslimited to two years and the daily dose was limited to a maximumof 40 units. The posttreatment follow-up period varied from threedays to three years, depending on the duration of survival.During the treatment phase (insulin maintenance), random urinesamples were collected under direct supervision and tested forglucose at least weekly. A positive urine glucose resulted in awarning to the patient. After three positive urine tests, thedose of insulin was reduced by five units daily for each positiveurine test. This policy was intended to increase motivation onthe part of the patient to provide urine specimens negative forglucose. If positives continued, the insulin was eventuallydiscontinued and the patients were placed in the follow-up group.The authors of the study felt that patients would have a betterchance of reentry into insulin maintenance at a later date if (a)the patients survived and (b) patients accepted fullresponsibility for their insulin dependence and were willing togo to any lengths to recover. All patients were required to endure one hour of individual orgroup counseling each week, which addressed such subjects as mealplanning, hygiene for the feet, pancreatic imagery, and dietaryassertiveness. Counseling patients fell into one of threecategories: those who had no need or desire for counseling; thosewho might need counseling but were entirely unwilling toparticipate; and those who both wanted and needed extensivecounseling, but the counselors were so busy spending an hour aweek with the others that they were unable to meet the increaseddemands and needs of this group. Avoiding this bothersome,time-consuming, and costly process of individualized treatmentalso served to reduce the risk of enabling the patients'maladaptive behaviors by what could seem to be a reward system.The resulting uniformity of service assured that the needs of noone were met. It was hoped that by making the treatmentunpleasant that motivation for recovery would be enhanced. Half the participants failed to complete the two-year treatmentwith insulin maintenance. Some patients simply dropped out oftreatment, but most were terminated for continuedglucose-positive urines. This was despite repeated warnings andin absolute defiance of the reductions in insulin dosage witheach glucose-positive urine. It was concluded that thispopulation is poorly motivated, difficult to work with, and islacking the resources needed to effect the major life changesrequired for recovery. Many of this group died during follow-up.Some survived with amputations, blindness, neuropathies, andother conditions associated with the unhealthy life-styles of thediabetic. The remaining half did manage to complete the two-year treatmentand even appeared to experience relatively good health andseemingly normal functioning. Of course, this illusion ofapparent good health was at the expense of continuing to maintainthe insulin-dependent status with daily insulin. Someinvestigators speculated that insulin might be continued over alonger period of time and at higher doses. This notion wasquickly rejected as being absurd because good health should notbe obtained at just any cost. As the patients approached thetwo-year period, the insulin doses were tapered over the finaltwo months. All subjects began having positive urine tests andagain were showing active insulin-dependent diabetes. The obviousconclusion is that insulin does not help the insulin-dependentdiabetic and is not effective in treatment. The high mortalityrate of posttreatment patients suggests that insulin may have hadsome delayed, deadly toxic effects. This concept should be thesubject of future research. COMMENT This "insulin spoof" was originally written withthe idea to share it among friends and colleagues. Somewhatsurprisingly, the spoof was well received by many who urged thatit be shared with a wider audience. Initially, the intention wasto transpose rather typical and illogical clinical thoughtprocesses about methadone maintenance to another more familiarchronic and incurable disease. The transposition to a disease that is much more widelyunderstood made the line of reasoning clearly absurd in the newcontext. Yet when this pseudologic is applied to chronic opioddependence and methadone maintenance, few people find anythingwrong or out of place. One might conclude that the vision of someis clouded by the philosophical and ideological considerationsthat erect barriers to understanding, accepting, and implementingthis lifesaving treatment modality for those chronic intractableheroin addicts who need it. Any humor in this parody is quickly lost when one estimates theloss of life and other costs associated with untreated heroinaddiction that can be attributed to a persistent shortage ofmethadone treatment slots. This shortage is due, in part, topersistent negative attitudes toward the methadone treatmentmodality. 1Chairperson, Committee on Methadone Treatment,American Society of Addiction Medicine; Founder and MedicalDirector, Drug Dependence Associates, 3701 West Commerce Street,San Antonio, Texas 78207 Top of Page HairTesting for Drugs--A Case for Discrimination Our laws against certain drugs began as a result ofdiscrimination against minorities. The first two laws againstopiates were passed in response to discrimination of the Chinese;they were thought of as an inferior race. In 1910, legislationwas requested regarding cocaine since its use was touted to bethe direct incentive to the crime of rape by Negroes. Thus, thestage was set for greater and greater social control and loss ofliberty. When urine testing began in the workplace, it was for those whohad jobs such as air controller, pilot, etc.--those who had to beaware of public safety concerns. Now, any employer can testanyone for drugs--from the person who routes airplanes to the onewho sweeps the floor. It is bad enough that a person has tosubmit to tests that allow an employer to have access to what wasdone over the weekend, even when proficiency testing is availableand could properly show fitness for work. Proficiency testingtells the employer if you are able to do the job--withoutinvading your privacy. Now, however, the big push is for hair analysis, which tells youremployer what you did all last year. Despite the problemsassociated with urine testing (threat to personal liberties, laberror, false positives, etc.), the time it takes the body tobreak down a drug is relatively the same in all races; not sowith hair testing. This method allows whites, who used drugs atthe same time as their African-American counterparts, to escapedetection while African-Americans are either denied jobs orfired. According to a study done by Gary Henderson, Ph.D., at theUniversity of California at Davis, at the same dose,non-Caucasians had up to 12 times as much cocaine in their hairas Caucasians. Also, the drug stays in the hair for longerperiods of time--greater than 10 months for one non-Caucasian. The reason for this may be that cocaine binds to melanin, asreported by Robert Joseph et al at the American Academy ofForensic Sciences in Nashville, February 19-24, 1996. Some of thefindings were: Male, African, black hair--10 times more binding for cocaine thanmale Caucasian brown/black hair. Untreated, male African black hair bound cocaine almost 500 timesmore than blond Caucasian hair. Bleached male African hair--four times that ofblond male Caucasian hair. Green et al, Journal of Analytical Toxicology(March/April 1996), in an animal study, reports that the ratio ofmethadone in black to white hair is 21 to 1--this despite thefact that the melanin content in the black hair used in thisstudy was only 3.5 times greater than that of the white hair. These are not the only problems with hair testing. There is nouniformity in the testing cutoff point (point at which it isagreed that a test is negative), and there are no set testingtechniques. In other words, four different labs may use fourdifferent ways to produce results. There is also the problem ofenvironmental contamination, among others. The best that can be said for hair testing is that it indicateswhether a person has used drugs or not. However, the problems faroutweigh the benefits (if any) of such a test. Why in the worlddoes an employer need to know whether a person took drugs 6months ago? In fact, why do they need to know if a person tookdrugs last night? If a person can pass a proficiency test(computer testing for awareness, alertness, and ability to do thejob competently) that is all the employer needs to know. According to H. Westley Clark, M.D., J.D.,, M.P.H., University ofCalifornia, "African Americans, Hispanics, and East Indiansare at greater risk. . ." for detection of drug use. Theyalso test for a longer period of time than Caucasians. "Hairanalysis is a very good technique to foster discrimination. [It]has the aura of science, [and] it is pushed by scientist [sic]who can use fancy terms and fancy language to reassure employers,politicians and courts that only drug users are being identifiedby the techniques involved." Dr. Clark suggests that African Americans could bleach their hairto "level the playing field." Or, we could all go onestep further and shave our heads. 1Clark, H.

Top of Page Buprenorphinevs Methadone Buprenorphine is an analgesic for use in the treatment ofopiate addiction. It produces less euphoria than morphine andheroin, and "some studies also suggest that withdrawaleffects are less severe with Buprenorphine than withmethadone." As with LAAM, it is released slowly so thatdosing may be every other day instead of every day as is donewith methadone. A study done by Dr. Eric Strain et al at Johns Hopkins Universityfound that patients who were treated with Buprenorphine stayed intreatment as long as those who received methadone. In anotherstudy by Dr. Rolley E. Johnson et al, done with about the samenumber of patients (162), the retention rate was somewhat less(42% as compared to Dr. Strain's 56% retention rate). Buprenorphine "is administered under the tongue via a smallsyringe. Patients do not swallow the medication but allow it tobe absorbed through the mucous membranes that line the inside ofthe mouth." Another difference is in the dose--8 mg ofBuprenorphine seems to be equal to 50-60 mg of methadone. In Dr.Strain's study, if a patient's urine tests showed opiates, thedose "could be increased to a maximum of 90 mg of methadoneor 16 mg of Buprenorphine." The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) "officials arequick to caution that approval of Buprenorphine would notdiminish the importance of methadone in the treatment of heroinaddiction. ‘It's certainly not our intent to supplantmethadone,' Segal says. ‘Rather, NIDA wants to expand thedrug treatment armamentarium and the overall number of patientsin treatment."1 1Bowersox, J.

Thanks, TheEditor Volume I, Number 7 - 6 (August - June 1996) Articles What is thePurpose of Drug Laws? - by John Lystad NOTICE - In Memory ofIra Sobel - by Beth Francisco LAAM: The Real Deal - by IraSobel Dangerous Prescedent - by BethFrancisco Sad Tales FromNassau County Jail - by Donna Schoen (Reprinted fromMethadone Awareness October 1995) Why IV UsersDeserve Clean Needles - Maia Szalavitz Recovery and HarmReduction - Beth Francisco The Seven DayIssue: Sneak Attack!!! - Ira Sobel WHATIS THE PURPOSE OF DRUG LAWS? by John Lystad My name is John, and I am currently in amethadone program since I have long past the stage where I couldtolerate what I would have to do in order to support my habit ofheroin. Here is a short essay on how I view restrictive druglaws. Let us not forget that drug addicts are human beings and as suchare guaranteed certain rights in the Constitution--the Bill ofRights. Is this not correct? Consider for a second that modernmedical science has recently determined addiction to be geneticin nature and not a choice. Even without that, don't we have theright to the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hurt otherpeople at least in the physical sense? If so, why are we treatedworse than violent offenders when it comes to punishments handeddown by the courts? It seems absurd that a nation could actuallyrelease a murderer from prison so as to make room for a drugoffender. As far as I can see, drug use in and of itself is avictimless crime if there is no legal or emotional stigmaattached to it. When extreme artificial importance is attached tosomething such as the propaganda supporting the "drugwar," a common result is fascination, neurosis, andirrational behavior. If an adult wishes to use a mind or bodyaltering substance, it should be up to that individual. No one owns your body except yourself so, therefore, shouldn't"you" be the deciding factor of what goes into it? Ifnot, who is to decide and on what basis or whose consideration?It seems that for all my adult years, somebody or something hasbeen preventing me from exercising my freedom of choice in afundamental way. It has been decided for me one of the most basicof human rights--what I can or cannot put into my own body. Am Inot smart enough or important enough to decide for myself whatgoes into my own body? Why was "drug prohibition" started in the first place?When the Harrison Narcotic Act was passed, there was hardly anydrug problem at all. Out of all the drugs available when theywere legal, there was maybe one addict out of a thousand people,and anyone could just go to the corner store and buy drugscheaply. Now, after over eighty years of this vicious drug warPuritanism, just look at the marvelous result. Drugs, havingbecome profitable, are everywhere. Enough is enough; besides, Ihardly think there is anyone on the face of the planet who isbetter qualified than me to decide what is right for me. Since I was born, I have never seen a day when drugs have notbeen hunted down, demonized, condemned, scapegoated, and oh yes,widely used and hugely profitable. I do not advocate drug usebut, at the same time, I do not condemn it. After all, "drugprohibition" causes the very thing it is supposed tosuppress--large scale use. This widespread usage comes from thefact that if you know you have something that people will alwayswant and have always wanted, then lo and behold it's suddenlymade illegal, you can practically set your price, thus producinghuge profits for any person willing to risk selling it. Many people seem to think that addicts are involved in crime somuch because they are high on drugs; nothing could be furtherfrom the truth. In reality, it's more like this: The addict wakesup in the morning with a terrible knowledge that he/she must comeup with an almost unreal amount of money just to sustain theirhabit in order to be able to function for one more day. Since nohonest job can afford them enough money to support their habit atprohibition prices, the addict must resort to crime if no otherlegal way exists for them to continually come up with exorbitantamounts of money. In early addiction, many people, if employed, can afford a lightindulgence on their salary alone. It is common, however, that asthe addiction grows, the job will no longer support the growingappetite for the drug. This causes absenteeism because a persongoing through withdrawal is likely to miss work in order to comeup with some quick money, legal or not, just to feel better. Ofcourse, this costs the employer money and often leads totermination of the employee which in itself has a tendency inmany people to increase their desire to use. There is another problem with highly restrictive drug laws. Theyare terribly expensive to maintain. Who pays? We all do in ourtaxes that no longer go toward truly beneficial social programsthat improve our quality of life so as to be able to pay $30,000per inmate per year to keep drug offenders in overcrowded jails.Law enforcement and penal institution budgets must also becontinually increased to keep up with the unnecessary but nowabundant drug-related crime. Our ill-conceived drug policy also takes an emotional toll. Whonowadays isn't worried about becoming the victim of crime? Couldthis lead to an automatic distrust of people unknown to us? Whateffect does this have? What parent isn't worried about theirchild becoming a casualty of drug-selling violence or peerpressure? Schools are infested with drug"entrepreneurs" marketing their product. Why? As longas drugs are illegal, they will be unnaturally profitable, andwherever there is a lucrative market for something, people willtake advantage of it and cash in. So, ultimately, anti-drug lawsproduce more, not less drug consumption. If you're hip to hypocrisy, look at the U.S. as regards Columbiaor Panama. America told Columbia to stop growing coca or suffereconomic consequences while, at the very same time, the U.S. istheir biggest customer for it, making it a most profitable crop.Second, think of the Noriega incident where America actuallyinvaded another sovereign nation to kidnap its president,ostensibly because he didn't do what the U.S. told him to doregarding the coca trade. I say "ostensibly" because Ibelieve the real reason America captured Panama's president andput him in prison is because he had somehow become a threat tosome powerful people's business interests. I wonder how Americawould feel if Panama invaded America and took the presidenthostage? Not too good I would imagine. Cocaine production will never decrease as long as there is alucrative market for it, and as long as people keep making a bigfuss about it, there will always be a lucrative market. This issimply an aspect of the law of supply and demand that holds truefor all goods and services. It's time America stopped confusing a medical problem with acriminal one. The damage already done is immeasurable. Thedangers of holding on to our greed-inspired drug policies includethe very real possibility of losing some of the most preciousthings that this country was founded on--Life, Liberty, and thepursuit of happiness, free from unreasonable intrusions into someof the most private aspects of our lives under the guise of lawand order. To top of Page NOTICE- IN MEMORY OF IRA SOBEL by Beth Francisco Ira Sobel died Sunday, July 7, 1996. He hadbeen hospitalized the week prior for symptoms resulting fromHepatitis C. According to Joycelyn Woods, ExecutiveVice-President of NAMA, he checked himself out of the hospitalagainst medical advice and started having chest pains a few dayslater. He called 911 but by the time they arrived, he was dead. Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver, and it is common amongaddicts due to the sharing of needles and other infectedparaphernalia. Active addicts and those who have not used inyears are susceptible to this virus. Interferon is used to treatHepatitis C, along with strict diet, good personal hygiene, andabstinence from alcohol. Ira experienced a bout of Hepatitis C in March 1995. In his ownwords from an article he wrote: I experienced severe pain in my legs and ankles. My legs swelledup and became bloated. I had water retention. I was unaware thatthis swelling to my legs is a tell-tale sign of something bad. Iwent to a liver specialist who took my blood, and he directed meto have a sonogram. Signs of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) are: Elevated liver enzymes Blood transfusion history Sex with an IV drug user Intravenous use history Swelling of hands or feet (Edema) Scab-like lesions over arms and legs Many of you have commented that you enjoyed reading Ira'sarticles. I still have some that he sent me to publish, so youwill see his name in print periodically (In fact, the article byIra "LAAM: The Real Deal" was written justbefore he died. He was having trouble faxing it to me, and hedecided he was only going to try one last time--fortunately forus, it worked because he died soon after). Just out of thehospital, he was worrying about the newsletters for which hewrote. Ira made a great contribution to Methadone Today, and wewill miss his enthusiasm for methadone advocacy. I know I willcertainly miss his Sunday phone calls to find out how thenewsletter was going. Ira was a great support to me and MethadoneToday. Top of Page LAAM: TheReal Deal by Ira Sobel (New York City) I was recently informed by my counselor that my program willbe offering Levomethadyl Acetate Hydrochloride (LAAM) in January1997. Right up front I will say that LAAM is not along-acting methadone!!! It is a different medication altogether.LAAM is growing due to its false claims made by thepharmaceutical company, Roxane. The company puts out a colorfulbrochure with claims that by switching to their drug, it"gives your patients time for a productive life." Whathooey!!! Believe me, it's all about diversion and how the DEA is going todeal with it. I will try to be objective but again, I say that weon methadone should know all about every change and proposaltaking place in the methadone treatment field. In this case, LAAMis just another part of the big picture--just a tip of theiceberg. There are many new changes and proposals taking place inthe methadone treatment field, such as: 1. The 7 Day a week, no take-home issue. 2. The conversion from one type of methadone to another type,such as the changeover from orange diskette to cherry methadose.There are at least 4 different types of methadone being dispensedin methadone programs in New York city. 3. LAAM, marketed under the name ORLAAM, is being offered at moreprograms throughout the United States. I have written articles relating to each new development. In theJune 1996 issue of Methadone Today, I wrote"The Seven Day Issue: Sneak Attack!!!" concerning theDEA and their fight for all patients on methadoneto report to the clinic 7 days a week with no take-homes. Thebasis for these proposals are directly linked to loitering anddiversion. To stop diversion, the DEA wants to stop alltake-homes. The DEA has not been successful in busting cocaine cartels. The"War on Drugs" is a failure. So, the powers that bedecided to go after people on methadone throughout the country. AReal Sneak Attack!!! In October 1995, I wrote an article for Methadone Awarenesscalled "Winds of Change" in which I depicted thedifferent types of methadone being used in New York City. In thatpiece, I talked about the fears and crucial questions everyperson on methadone has about the possible changeover. I spoke to many patients who expressed concern when they learnedof changes and about the new types of methadone. For years it wasfelt that the orange diskette would be the only form of methadonedispensed to all people on methadone. Currently, there are atleast four different types being used in New York City. They are:Orange diskette, Cherry Methadose, White Diskette, and ClearLiquid, made from powder. When a methadone program changes typesof methadone, there is a transitional period whereby thepatient's body must adjust to the new medication. So, it seemsnatural for the patients to have trepidation concerning thechange from one type of methadone to another. I see a similarity between the types of methadone development andnow LAAM in that the critical questions and fears remain thesame, such as, "Will I feel different or normal? Will Iexperience a feeling of sickness or anxiety? Will this newtype of medication hold me?" That's the bottom linehere. It all boils down to the fear of the unknown that makespatients fearful of any change. And that includes me. Methadone vs. LAAM The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LAAM, whichis the first alternative medication to treat opiate addiction inyears. It is touted to be a synthetic opiod similar to methadonebut, brothers and sisters, that is not the case. LAAM "isfundamentally a different medication because it produces a lowerlevel of narcotic effects than perceived by the methadonepatient." This quote was made by Walter Ling, at a symposiumin New York City, co-sponsored by The National Institute on DrugAbuse (NIDA) to brief heroin treatment practitioners on the useof LAAM. Mr. Ling was the principal investigator on two LAAMstudies. LAAM was developed in 1948 as a pain killer. When LAAM was testedin 1952, it was found that the drug could prevent withdrawalsymptoms for 72 hours. That is the major selling point to LAAM.The simple fact that the drug lasts up to 72 hours, compared tomethadone which lasts from 24-36 hours, is LAAM's ace in thehole. LAAM has some similarities to methadone, but it is notmethadone. Yes, LAAM is a synthetic narcotic and yes, it lasts upto 72 hours so patients can reduce the number of times they haveto report to the clinic if they choose LAAM1 LAAM is fundamentally a different medication than methadone, andmore and more clinic systems are making the switch to includethis medication. Roxane, the pharmaceutical company that producesORLAAM, puts out a pamphlet entitled, "Information forPatients and Family Members" to explain the changeover frommethadone to LAAM. Peace. 1That is, unless they have earned once - ortwice - per - week take home privileges. There are no LAAM takehomes. Top of Page Dangerous Precedent by Beth Francisco On March 29, 1996, President Clinton signedinto effect Public Law 104-121. This law eliminates addicts fromeligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and SocialSecurity Disability (SSD). The new eligibility requirements areeffective "immediately for any new or pending claim forSSI/SSDI benefits based on the disability determination forsubstance abusers where alcoholism and/or drug addiction is acontributing factor material to the eligibilitydetermination" (AMTA News Report, May 1996). For thosealready receiving benefits, they will be terminated January 1,1997 unless they reapply by July 29, 1996 and qualify under theredetermination for something other than alcohol or drugaddiction. This is a dangerous precedent. If drug and alcohol problems arenot included in the definition of disability, this could affectMedicaid and insurance companies' funding of drug and alcoholtreatment. It is very unfortunate that legislators voted this inand that our President allowed it. It is very easy to attack addicts, the poor, women, and children.It is very easy to take away from the powerless in society, thosewho have no voice. This was the easy way out. Addicts have beenso demonized that it is very easy to disallow benefits to them.It is the old adage--penny wise, pound foolish. Yes, it may looklike a few dollars are being saved, but the fact of the matter isthat for every $1 spent on drug and alcohol treatment, there is a$7 saving to society. For every $1 spent on methadonetreatment, there is a saving of $12 to $14. Does it stilllook like the same good deal now? Top of Page SADTALES FROM NASSAU COUNTY JAIL Reprinted from Methadone Awareness - October 1995 by Donna Schoen (Long Island, NY) Several months ago, a friend called me upunusually upset. The father of her child (who was a patient atL.I.J. MMTP) called her from Nassau County Jail. Sick with theAIDS virus, the jail was refusing to medicate him with hismethadone. Phone calls from his program were received by thejail, pleading with them to medicate this patient. After all, hisbody was going through hell from the withdrawal from themethadone and from being sick with the virus. After 7 days of leaving Mr. J.B. sick, crying and begging like adog, they finally gave him methadone - a blind 7-day detox.Whatever the blind dose was, it was inadequate. He stillsuffered. After the 7-day inadequate detox, he was givenClonadine - which is a blood pressure medication which is alsoinadequate in detoxing someone off of opiates. Being a Patient Advocate, I was outraged at hearing this. I couldfeel his suffering. As chairperson of the Patient Committee atLong Island Jewish, and a member of NAMA, I started hearing moreand more tales of the mistreatment of methadone maintenancepatients at Nassau County Jail. I've heard at least 40 storiesfrom people that I know were there. I was at Rikers Island back in 1992, and I know they have the‘KEEP Program' there. I believe Suffolk County also makesprovisions for methadone patients. All I could think was"What's wrong with these people? How can they treat humanbeings like this?" They are treating us like dogs. They makeus squirm and beg like dogs for our methadone. It is done on acase by case basis. If they decide to detox you, they will. Hard,fast and dangerously!!! And they leave you hanging for dayswhile deciding this. People have likened the doctor there to someone out of theGestapo. The stories were outrageous. All I could think of isthat something has to be done. Any of us living here in NassauCounty could end up there and in the same situation as thesepeople. I started asking people for their stories about theirstays in the N.C. Jail. Aside from Mr. J.B.'s story (which I justgave), here are excerpts from some of the stories which Ireceived: Mr. R.C. "I repeatedly informed the detectives andthen the guards at NC Jail that I was on a Methadone Program andon a dosage of 100 mgs. I told them that a detox from such a highdose could be detrimental. The guards told me "That's yourproblem. It's not our fault that you're a drug addict."While in lock-up, I started having heart palpitations and wasrushed to Nassau County Medical Center (NCMC), where I wasmedicated. But no one would tell me what amount was beingadministered." (**What other person, asides from a desperate addict, wouldaccept being given a medication and not knowing what dose theywere receiving??!) Mr. M.G. "My fifth and most terrifying experience went like this:I came down to 40 mgs. in anticipation of spending 4 months inNassau County Jail Hell. I received a 9-day detox. About 3 daysafter the end of my detox, I got really sick and was unable tostop vomiting. In the course of 1 month, I lost at least 40pounds. I visited NCMC at least 2 times and was told it was astomach virus. I was put on a liquid diet and I stayed in theshower all day and threw up all night. I told them I was sick andwithdrawing, but none of the doctors at the jail wanted to hearthat. To make a long story short, they gave me exploratorysurgery, and I have the 12-inch scar to prove it. The only thingthey found was a partial obstruction, which the surgeon said wasformed from vomiting for such a long time. I wouldn't wish thistreatment on an enemy! Nassau County needs a change! It's longoverdue!" (**Mr. M.G. had similar experiences with other detoxes atNassau County Jail, but none as devastating as this one.) Mr. B.D. "I went to Nassau County Jail on A DWI in January 1992.I told the doctor that I was on methadone and was legally on aprescription for Xanax (see note below). I never saw an actualdoctor, just a guy with a limp. They said, "Get this guy outof here." They sent me to NCMC. They chained me to a bed andlet me withdraw. They gave me Ipecac syrup to induce vomiting.After 2 days, I was finally given methadone. They never gave meanything to detox me from the pills. I was chained to a bedfor 21 days. Then I was returned to the jail. I hadn'tslept in 44 days. After I got back to the jail, I had aseizure. Another inmate, (Mr. S.) Had full-blown AIDS. Hewas on 100 mgs. of methadone. The doctor told him that themethadone was killing him. They scared him into stopping themethadone. He ended up in unbearable pain, had dementia and wasgiven dialysis. He died." (**Xanax is one of the most dangerous detoxes. Anyone that isdetoxing is vomiting enough on their own without being givensomething to induce vomiting. Inducing vomiting on a person thatis detoxing is cruel and dangerous. This could cause the personto dehydrate, among other things.) Something must be done. Although the right thing would be tomaintain meth patients on their present dose (like diabeticsare), the least that could be done is for the jail to institute a"KEEP" program. None of these people deserve to betreated like this. This is the 1990's - not the Dark Ages!Methadone has been used successfully for 30 years. We should notbe thrown in a cell like animals, left without our medication andsick like dogs. Do these people have any compassion? I guess not.Something has to change. Note from the editors of Methadone Today: Althoughthese stories happened in Nassau County Jail, any city, Anywhere,USA could be substituted. It is a sad fact that this is what wehave come to because addicts have been so demonized that peopledon't care what happens to them. If an animal was treated the waythese people were treated, there would be animal rights activistsknocking down doors and screaming for resignations. But, theseare "just" addicts, and"they" didn't go to jail to be fed their drugs. That'sthe mentality of this country when discussing drugs, I'm sad tosay. Something certainly does have to change, and that"something" is people's attitudes about a medicalproblem that has been made a criminal "justice"problem. Top of Page WhyIV Users Deserve Clean Needles by Maia Szalavitz They hadn't seen such a crowd on DelanceyStreet in years. Two weeks ago, ACT UP and Jon Parker's NationalAIDS Brigade, incensed by the mayor's decision to close thecity's needle exchange program, came to hand out syringes andbleach. The Guardian Angels came to stage a counter-protest. Whenthe cops moved in, the shouting reached a feverish pitch. As theTV cameras focused on activists being handcuffed, a few addictstook advantage of the confusion, grabbed some bleach, and fleddown a side street. Opponents of safe drug-use programs have long argued thatdistributing needles and bleach only encourages addiction. Theymaintain that people who use drugs are seeking death and won'ttake steps to protect themselves from AIDS. They say that addictslike to share needles. They are wrong on all three counts. I first shot drugs in 1986. A friend gave me my wings. I heardringing emptiness in my head and wanted the sensation to lastforever. My friend had injected me with his own works. As I wenton to shoot heroin, I continued to share--but only when thereweren't enough needles to go around. When sociologists first sawneedle sharing, they labeled it a "sub-culturalritual." The myth was that sharing was somehow part of thehigh--like passing a joint. But no one asked addicts why theyshare. The media was all too willing to point out negativeattributes of drug users, but when it came to needles we weresuddenly supposed to be generous. In fact, I never saw needle sharing as a ritual and never heardof anyone who has. Needles are not meant to be reused. The seconduser gets a duller point. When you shoot someone else's blood,you might get a highly unpleasant reaction--called a"bonecrusher" on the street. The only person I've known who was eager to share was notoriousfor it--because no one else liked to do it. He was the poorest ofthe crowd of junkies I knew. He injected other people's bloodbecause he thought there might be dope left in it (He later diedof a cocaine overdose, leaving behind a pregnant, HIV-positivegirlfriend). A second myth is that addicts don't care enough about life toprotect themselves from AIDS. While I was doing heroin, I didn'twant to die; I wanted to live without pain. I told myself heroinwas keeping me from suicide. AIDS did not offer suchpromise--only slow, painful, almost certain death. Two months after I started shooting up, a counselor from SanFrancisco showed me how I could protect myself by cleaning myworks. From that time until I got straight, I was never without abottle of Clorox. I cleaned my works compulsively, just as I usedthem. My experience is hardly unique. In San Francisco, before 1986,only 12 per cent of drug users surveyed said they cleaned theirneedles. But three years later, after a massive street educationcampaign, the portion had jumped to almost 80 per cent. Infectionrates among IV users in San Francisco haven't risen above 15 percent since the campaign got underway. Some needle exchange opponents look at these figures and saybleach alone might do the trick. But with bleach, needle sharingstill occurs, and with it the chance that HIV might betransmitted. San Francisco's success isn't just due to bleach;though needles are illegal there too, the city quietly toleratesan informal exchange program. In cities where needle exchange is openly permitted--Seattle,Portland, Tacoma, Sydney, Hong Kong, Paris, London, Glasgow,Liverpool, and Amsterdam--HIV infection rates have stabilized atlow levels. In Edinburgh, after a police crackdown on syringes in1987, infection rates abruptly jumped 10 per cent; six monthsafter needle exchange was instituted, no further increase wasseen. Meanwhile, according to a 1988 New York County LawyersAssociation study, in nine states where needles are illegal therate of infected IV users is six times higher than in stateswhere needles can be bought over the counter. The state with thehighest rate of all is New York, where as many as 150,000 addictsare believed to be infected and each day risk spreading the virusto other addicts, to their spouses, to their unborn children. Opponents of needle exchange are blinded by a third myth: thatdistributing needles encourages drug abuse. But there has been noincrease in cities where needles are exchanged. In fact, in someof these cities, drug abuse has declined. Some opponents, particularly in minority communities, believethat the government purposefully tolerates drug dealing andmistake the effort to save lives through needle distribution as aform of genocide. They believe the only way to stop AIDS amongusers is drug treatment. But those in the minority community whowork with addicts daily, like Yolanda Serrano of the Associationfor Drug Abuse, Prevention, and Treatment, are vocal advocates ofneedle exchange. They understand that even in the best rehabprograms only a very small fraction stay clean for life. On my last day using drugs, I weighed only 80 pounds. I hadpulled out large clumps of my hair and I was an etiolatedgrayish-green. I was 23 and looked twice my age. I looked like anAIDS patient in the final stages. I found myself begging a friendfor his heroin--pleading, groveling, humiliated. Suddenly I had amoment of clarity. I saw that I was near death. This moment can't be artificially induced. Being around otherswho are recovering helps, but the desire to quit must come upfrom within. And once it's there, the sight of a needle isn'tgoing to remove it. That's why the Pavlovian argument againstneedle exchange fails. The sight of a needle is no more likely tomake a recovering addict shoot up than the sight of a spoon. And needle exchange can be a bridge to treatment. When I wentwith Jon Parker's brigade to the streets of Bushwick, where Iused to cop dope, within minutes addicts surrounded him, as ifdrawn magnetically. They didn't just take the needles and run.They listened so they could learn how to stay safe. And theyasked about getting clean. When you give addicts needles, you're giving them the rightmessage--that someone cares enough to want them to stay free ofAIDS even if they continue to use drugs. Dead addicts don'trecover. Top of Page Recoveryand Harm Reduction by Beth Francisco Since the beginning of the so-called "DrugWar" and "zero tolerance," our government has beenwaging war on the citizens of this country without regard for therealities of life. It is unrealistic to demand zero tolerance,especially when we know that addiction is a disease andgenetically passed on from one generation to the next. However,the Drug Enforcement Agency has become a bloated, powerfulbureaucracy that does not intend to give up its power without afierce fight. This also applies to some other agencies who wieldtheir power and will not let go. This in the face of interferingwith harm reduction policies and treatment of addiction in anyother way than total abstinence. Recovery and success do not haveto mean total abstinence and, in fact, to wait for totalabstinence to deem an addict successful dooms mostto total failure. Addiction is a medical problem and belongs withthe medical profession--not the criminal justice system. I found a newsgroup on the Internet devoted to harm reduction,and several disturbing items were emailed to me. The first was anarticle concerning a needle exchange project in New Jersey. Twovolunteers doing needle exchange work were arrested by theMiddlesex County Prosecutor's Office. This is absolutelyintolerable in this day of AIDS. In a perfect world, no one wouldbe addicted, and no one would be using IV drugs, but this is nota perfect world. To arrest people devoted to harm reduction isimposing death sentences on addicts who are PEOPLE who happen tohave a disease. For anyone interested in contacting the DA whoordered the arrest, his name is Robert Gluck, P.O. Box 71, NewBrunswick, NJ 08903. Another item from the San Francisco Chronicle, April 19 (UPI)concerned "Illegal Mexican black tar heroin contaminatedwith an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria [which] killed twoaddicts and sickened another 15." One of the ways healthofficials got the word out to addicts was through the needleexchange program. Of course, this happened in San Francisco andthe needle exchange activists who were arrested were in NewJersey, but how many addicts contracted AIDS through needlesharing while these activists were in jail? One is too many! Probably none of us knew John Szyler, but we all probably knowsomeone like him. He was an addict, the founder of the ChicagoRecovery Alliance, and his definition of recovery was "anypositive change." John died Saturday, May 4th with threebags of heroin at his side--one was used. It is unknown whetherhe overdosed, had "an allergic reaction, poison orwhatever--John had little control over the chemical compositionof the drug [or] its contaminates." Because addicts cannotgo to their doctors and because doctors usually want nothing todo with addiction because they will have the Drug EnforcementAgency breathing down their necks, addicts do not know what theyare getting when they buy a drug. Sad--this person was describedas "a man who loved life and lived it to the fullest. He wasan example to all around him by his kindness and advocacy forpeople with HIV and for drug users. He will be severely missed byall who knew him." I did not know John, and you probablydon't either, but he most likely did not have to die. Had he beenable to go to a physician for his addiction, he would probably bealive today to continue to be an example for his kindness. Hey,everybody out there with all this power over life and death, weare people--we are addicts, yes, but we are people, and we do notdeserve a death sentence. We, in methadone treatment, are in a different phase ofrecovery. Most of us are not using street drugs anymore, but weare still treated like criminals. We are looked down upon. We aretreated not as people with a medical problem, but we are treatedlike a person with a moral deficiency. We do not deserve thatkind of treatment; we need to be treated as any other person whohas a medical problem, and it is about time for a wake-up callfor our politicians. We no longer (if we ever did) have a"war on drugs." What we have is a "war onaddicts" in this country. We have totally impossible lawsregarding drug possession--on one hand, we have the Supreme Courtsaying that addiction is not a crime, but just possessing thematerials needed to relieve the addiction is a crime. What'sgoin' on here? It is time we found out which politiciansare for us, which are against us and force them to take a standone way or the other. Addicts are people, not criminals. Top of Page TheSeven Day Issue: Sneak Attack!!! by Ira Sobel (New York City) The issue at hand is in black and white. TheDEA wants all people on methadone to report to the clinic 7 daysa week. The charge: DIVERSION OF METHADONE. That's everyday, brothers and sisters. It won't matter if you are working andhaven't had a dirty urine in years. The DEA doesn't discriminate.It will be across the board and that, unfortunately, means all ofus. I have to admit that if these proposals go through, we onmethadone will suffer. The basis for these proposals are directly linked to loiteringand diversion. That's the bottom line. The DEA does notcare to talk about "good" patients or "goodprograms!!!" No, all they see is diversion. In their eyes,every person on methadone diverts their take-home medication.Anyone who has read one of my articles on the concept of methaphobiawill understand when I say that the DEA is one of thebiggest methaphobic organizations in the USA today.That's fact!!! The DEA is getting their noses into the wrong arena. Every personon methadone is in recovery. Statistics will reveal that the DEAshould stick to busting cocaine cartels and stay out of themental health and addictions field. In truth, the DEA has notbeen successful in bringing international drug dealing operationsto their knees. The so-called "war on drugs"is a failure. So the powers that be decided to go after people in methadoneprograms throughout the United States. A real sneak attack. Itdoesn't matter to them that methadone is a treatment modality.So, they employed the same surveillance techniques and undercoveroperations they regularly utilize in order to catch cocainebarons. So, to the DEA, each person on methadone is a criminal. The DEA is fervent in their aim to have every person on methadonereport to their clinics 7 days a week. There are thousands ofpeople on methadone who have matured out of committing felonycrimes and drug-related activities. Methadone has been the keyfactor in helping thousands upon thousands of recovering peopleto change from their previous life of failure and defeat into thenew life of integrity and victory. The DEA sees diversion, andall I see is that hidden population of methadone patients whohave stopped committing crimes, are gainfully employed, ownbusinesses, are going to school, getting job training, areraising children, and haven't had a dirty urine in years. Thelast contact with the "old life" iscoming to the clinic. Sometimes the program is located in thesame neighborhoods where they used to buy and use drugs. So, theyfight for phase changes. These people have simply beat drugs andhave been assimilated into the mainstream, the work force, thestraight world. Loitering is one of the most negative behaviors to affectmethadone treatment. The central problem is that some non-workingpatients have too much time on their hands. If these patients hada structured schedule, whether inside their methadone programs orreferred out to other agencies, programs, services, and schools,then the authorities and people who live in the community wouldbegin to see less loitering and patients hanging out near theclinics. People in programs have a lot of talent that just needsencouragement and support. If there were programs like day carefrom 9 to 5, patients could be transformed into productivemembers of society. Methadone programs should adopt a plan togive patients realistic goals to strive for. It would enable uson methadone to excel at something constructive. This is veryimportant because anyone on methadone knows first hand the slurs,chides, and put downs made by family, law enforcement groups, andpeople in general who know nothing of the reality of methadonemaintenance. With a new component, patients everywhere would geta boost in the self-esteem department! Since I walk by many programs here in New York City, it's simpleto tell whether the program has a loitering problem or not. Inits place could be a combination of program security, outreachworkers, counselors, and other staff members. I would love to seea counselor motioning with his arms to the patients outside tocome on in because we have so many new activities! "Welcome,welcome!" I would love to see that. The sooner the welcome,the better! I believe that together we can change people's attitudes aboutmethadone treatment by reducing loitering and diversion andfinding new interests for the patients by: 1) Runningprograms/classes inside the clinic, 2) Having GED classes so thatpatients can get their high school diploma, 3) Indoctrinatingmore methadone awareness meetings at every clinic, 4) Setting upa patient committee to address the loitering issue and otheraspects of the program, and 5) Dosing patients at a dose highenough to eliminate the need for diversion (as evidenced byscientific instead of criminal justice guidelines). This wouldentail a holistic approach for the good of the program, thepatients themselves, and the community at large. I think that a patient committee could be set up with eightpatients, two staff members, and the doctor of the clinic. Thisgroup can help patients with problems, institute more services atthe clinic, and run methadone awareness meetings. I also feelthat having GED classes would help those who had problems inschools or are self conscious about their shortcomings withreading and comprehension. To require attendance at the clinic 7 days a week will hurt allpatients in the program, but it will be the "goodpatients" who have successfully demonstrated their progressin the program who will suffer the most. They areinvariably on a one or two-day-a-week pickup schedule and havebeen for years because of their courageous fight to beat drugsand advance themselves in the workplace. Patients who work full time will be forced to report to theclinic daily, before work. This proposal is really unfair becausethe DEA doesn't want to know that many patients are working todaydue to being on methadone which has allowed them to stop druguse. Methadone treatment works. When a patient hasn't had a dirtyurine for a specified amount of time, that patient gets asupervised urine, and then the phase change goes through. Thistranslates into coming to the clinic less frequently. These arethe patients (and there are many) who work towards progressing inthe program. And by working, we patients are beating the oddsthat are against us. That is why everyone on methadone, who isemployed or who is otherwise using their time constructively, isa winner. Most clinics close before 5:00 p.m., so if we cannot come on acertain day due to our jobs, we will suffer the consequences--NOMEDICATION! So, the person is stuck. Which is moreimportant: The job or the methadone? For most, there will be nojob without the methadone. This is a crucial point. Manypeople have made the wrong choice and are now back on drugs. TheDEA doesn't want to know what a relapse is or if the person hasbounced back and is making strides in methadone treatment. There are some providers and owners of methadone programs who aremore interested in policing their programs and making money offpatients than finding new ways to improve treatment and makeservices available for you and me (State and Federal agencyregulations have to share in the blame--timewise, she sheerenormity of the tons of paperwork that has to be dealt withexcludes this. Paperwork is more important than the patient'slife). Loitering will cease when methadone programs startadopting goals for us to strive for, and this will only beaccomplished when medical treatment is turned back to medicine.Despite the odds against us, the majority of patients, likemyself, do not loiter and/or divert. We are in recovery, andthere are hundreds of people who go to 12-step and otherself-help groups. WE ON METHADONE MUST BE UNITED IN ORDER TO FIGHT AGAINST OURCOMMON NEMESIS In this case, that means the DEA. Diversion is ruiningeverything for everybody. We patients who report to the clinicone or two days a week are the ones who will get burned the most,and anyone working toward that goal will lose all initiative todo well. The DEA is pushing for this change in policy which willaffect the entire methadone system in the United States ofAmerica. We must be aware of these proposals, and we as patientsmust be united in order to change policy. Methadone advocates areincreasing. The National Alliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA)is expanding day by day. New chapters are forming. In essence,these are exciting times for everyone on methadone. We have asole purpose: PATIENTS' RIGHTS. That is for you inMarysville, California; you in Milwaukee; you in Gary, Indiana;and you in Detroit, Michigan. We are all brothers and sisters living on the same spirit! Wewill make our stand together. I declare, "All patients onmethadone throughout the USA must unite to fight against theoppressors, the persecutors, the enemies, the methaphobics, theDEA." - Peace.

Historical Perspectives -by Jon MethadoneAwareness: Get up, Stand Up!!! - by Ira Sobel Fightingfor Life: Health Hazards and Methadone Why Am I Still on Methadone?After all these years on methadone, I occasionally take apersonal inventory to check to see my progress on the programwhich directly affects my life. After 2� years (on this secondgo-around), my reasons for remaining in methadone treatment havebasically not changed. The bottom line is that methadone worksfor me. I'm no longer out of control and heavily addicted toopiates and prescription narcotics. I no longer hurt myself in aself-destructive death mission. What a relief. All that negativebehavior is off my shoulders. When I enrolled on a methadoneprogram, all that street hustling, petty arguments over pettythings, stress, frustration and insanity left me phase by phaseas I got better. Why Aren't You on Methadone? A major point is thatI no longer have to get high every few hours in order to stay oneshot away from being dope sick. Methadone is long lasting. Itseffects last up to 36 hours. That should be the number one reasonwhy so many heroin addicts should surrender and get on methadone.By taking methadone as prescribed, there shouldn'tbe any problems with being maintained or being sick. It's the useof other drugs with methadone, like crack and alcohol, that makesthose on the program feel depressed, confused and unbalanced. Theunhealthy effects of all- night drinking, hangovers and crackbinges keep these people down and going nowhere. People shouldknow the facts that powdered drugs have killed before, and thereis no telling when and who will die next from an overdose. So, byenrolling in a methadone program and putting down the needles andpowdered drugs, the chances for a brighter future is verypromising. Methaphobia: Losing its Grip. I live one day at atime, and I do not worry myself about not being drug free orwhether if/when I'm going to detox off methadone or not. I feelcomfortable with my decision, and I don't care what others think.I remain on this medication because it has helped me so much. Ibelieve that as long as I remain on methadone, things are goingto get better and better. Those methaphobics get upset becausewith all of their chiding and all of their putdowns, you knowwhat? They are getting boring! "Why can't you get offit?" "You are weak." "You are a loser."I've heard that shit so many times in my life that it has becomeboring!!! Boring!!! I mean, why should I risk everything I've built up for myself onsomeone else's whims and expectations. Most of the methaphobicsthat take this position don't even know who I am or my fellowpatients. They really do not care about me and you. They justlike to play God, doctor and pharmacist. These methaphobics meannothing to me. We cannot change the nature of a methaphobic or stop theirunresponsive, close-minded, stigma-spewing tirades. I've coinedan appropriate phrase--METHAPHOBIA--a state of mindin which someone, or a group, displays an intense fear, bias andprejudice against people on methadone and methadone programs.There are those methaphobics that would feel justified indismantling the whole methadone system. That's methaphobia at itsmost extreme. As I said: Methaphobics are BORING!!! Methadone in the Age of AIDS. I realize now that Imust present the bigger picture of the importance of methadonemaintenance in the age of AIDS. With all of the inappropriateactions and all of the self-destructive behavior by active users,methadone treatment becomes an important link in minimizinghealth hazards to users. Most of all, enrolling in a methadoneprogram reduces the risk of acquiring all of thesenumerous health hazards which is a keynote in harm reduction. I believe that harm reduction must take on a holistic approach inorder to decrease self-destructive behavior, reducethe transmission of diseases and viruses, and carrythe message to every IV user that there is a better way to live.That users should stop abusing themselves, get in a methadoneprogram to take care of their powerlessness over opiates and theneedle, and stabilize their minds and bodies in order to gethealthy because this self-abuse takes its toll on one's selfrespect. Methadone enables the person time to build a firmfoundation for their lives. In this way, IV users candiscover harm reduction practices, and this enables them toaspire to greater heights in taking proper care of themselves.This translates into cleaning needles properly and getting testedfor HIV and Hepatitis C. Health Hazards and Shooting Galleries: An Intimate Glance.So you say: What health hazards are you talking about? Suchhazards as: contracting hepatitis and AIDS, venereal diseases,the possibility of death resulting from an overdose, poor health,arrest and incarceration. Pertaining to harm reduction in the ageof AIDS, contracting viruses and diseases are at the top of thelist. Shooting galleries are the breeding ground for AIDS, Hepatitis C,endocarditis, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, infections andopen wounds that are getting worse. Health hazards are all aroundanyone who enters the premises. There are real people dying inthese dark, cold and colorless rooms. That is why we have to getthe message out there to those most in need that gettingout of the gallery and getting on a methadone program,which has been successful in detoxing addicts off heroin andmaintaining addicts for 30 years, will dramatically changepeople's lives and, most of all, reduce theseobsessive self-abuse tendencies. People living in these galleries are the ones most affected byhealth hazards. There is an urgency for thedevelopment of harm-reduction practices as soon as possible.Cleaning needles properly is more important than anything to theIV user and again, cleaning needles properly with bleach reducesthe exchange of viruses and diseases. Shooting galleries are filthy, and the squalor attacks yoursenses as soon as you enter the room. The smell of urine iseverywhere. There is blood and feces all over, both human andanimal, broken needles and syringes, torn newspapers on theground, glass from broken bottles, bloody toilet tissue, bloodywater in cups, bloody rags and paper towels. The sight of ratsscurrying across the floors and walls is a natural occurrence.People have sex in shooting galleries, babies are born, andpeople overdose and die every day in shooting galleriesthroughout New York City and across the USA. We must helpthese people get out of the galleries!!! Fighting for Life. There are many people who forgotwhy they got on methadone. They forget how bad life really was inthose last months of active addiction. They get frustrated andstart "stinking thinking." "Why am I onmethadone?" "Why did I get on it?" "Why do Ineed it?" "It doesn't help." "It was amistake?" For those patients who have been in the programlonger than the birth of the AIDS virus should realize now thatbeing on methadone keeps viruses and diseases away and, as longas we take methadone correctly, we can live a joy-filled life. We will also overcome the methaphobics. We will stop going toshooting galleries. The hustling ceases, the scams and schemesleave you, you stop using powdered drugs and needles, you putdown the bottle, you get a job or begin job training, you go backto school, do volunteer work, and if you maintain your faith inyourself and belief in a higher power, you are on your way. It'sthe fight of your life but by getting in a methadone program andby using harm- reduction practices, you can change your life andlive respectably and healthy. PEACE Top of Page Patients toDose at Clinic 7 Days a Week? by Beth Francisco Could be! Every Wednesdaymorning, a few of us meet for the advocacy group and try to getothers involved. Some of you say you do not have time, you havemore important things to do, and others say you are just notinterested. We wonder what it will take to get you interested.Will you be interested when the regulations are stiffer, or willit be when we have to come into the clinic seven days a week todose? There is serious talk of this at the state level. Will itbe when funding is cut for methadone maintenance treatment? Thereis always that threat hanging over our heads. Or, will you havetime when there are no clinics at all? According to the National Association of Alcoholism and DrugAbuse Counselors, "The Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration (SAMHSA) is now operating under its 5thtemporary spending bill (known as a Continuting Resolution or CR)until March 15th." The House passed an appropriations billfor SAMHSA, but nothing has been done with it by the Senate todate. "Under the House appropriations bill drug and alcoholtreatment and prevention. . . demonstration programs are cut from$506 million. . .to $142 million. If there is no change to theCR, the $360 million shortfall will force the termination of manydemonstration programs. Now, this may or may not affect usdirectly, but any cuts in addiction treatment are a threat to us. What we need to do is write to our Senators and Representativestelling them that treatment and prevention in the area ofaddiction are proven cost cutters. For every $1 spent on drug andalcohol treatment, $7 is saved in costs to society, and "$12to $14 is saved for every $1 spent on methadonetreatment" (emphasis mine). We need to write to ourrepresentatives in Washington and Lansing. Talkabout your success stories and how methadone has saved you fromprison or death. Talk about your success in any area, and comparethat to your life on the street. You can type a letter, handwriteit, e-mail it, or snail-mail it, but just do it--thencome to an advocacy meeting. If we don't stand up for ourselves,no one else is going to. If you do not mind coming into the clinic every day or if you donot mind harsher rules and regulations, you can continue what youare doing. However, if we want to improve the way we are treatedand have a say in that treatment, every single one of us needs tobecome involved. You do not have to spend a lot of time onadvocacy, but you do need to let everyone know that you careabout what happens to you. Top of Page MethadoneClinics in Trouble--Patients and Society Will Lose! by Jon Wilson Methadone treatment in Michigan is in serioustrouble. The most effective treatment for narcotics addiction isin danger of being eliminated in this state. Thousands ofsuccessfully recovering addicts will be forced back into thestreets. Some may detox successfully and do well in drug freetreatment programs, but most will not. According to studies byDole, Nyswander, McClellen, Payte, Joseph and others, those whoattempt to detox abruptly, or at all, are likely to return toopiate use. Methadone's effectiveness has been proven, yet we arein danger of losing it as a treatment alternative in Michigan. If methadone is so effective, why would Michigan eliminate it?This question cannot be easily answered. However, some reasonsfor phasing out the treatment are more apparent than others.Substance abuse is a very unpopular issue. Medicaid and privatehealth insurance providers do not want to pay for substance abusetreatment at all. Since methadone is the most controversial formof substance abuse treatment, it is an easy target. Due tosociety's stigmatization of substance abusers, people intreatment for addictions are perceived as having littlecredibility and virtually no power to fight back. Medicaid andprivate insurers have already taken steps to greatly reduce oreliminate benefits to substance abusers. Additionally, methadoneis a political hot potato. Some legislators and other electedofficials are reluctant to air their views on methadone publicly.This is not surprising since insurance companies employ highlypaid lobbyists to promote their best interests. And the drug freecomponent of the substance abuse treatment industry also has aninterest in the demise of methadone. Politicians have declared a "war on drugs."Their answer is to build more prisons. By the same token, theyare aware that many addicts have never committed any crime asidefrom possessing their drugs of choice. Another group of addicts,those who are addicted to legally prescribed medication havelittle chance of contact with the criminal justice system. Manyaddicts and their families are registered voters. Families arepleading and crying for treatment for their sons and daughters,husbands, wives, mothers, and fathers. They are not likely tovote for someone who wants to incarcerate their loved ones. Much to the dismay of the insurance companies, some form ofsubstance abuse treatment must receive political support. Thedrug-free treatment industry has tailored itself to the whims ofMedicaid and other third-party billers. Insurance companies havea powerful ally in their efforts to squash methadone. Who betterto discredit methadone than the drug free lobby? The drug-freetreatment industry is largely responsible for perpetuating themyth that methadone is legal dope. Politicians are in bed withinsurance companies and the drug free industry while rantingabout the lack of prison beds. It is ironic that the government'sown literature on the treatment of opiate addiction is promethadone. One of the most powerful weapons in this battle of politics,money, and power is the negative appearance of methadonetreatment. The erroneous point of view that methadone is nothingmore than a legal way to control addicts is at the heart ofsociety's negative impression of the drug. Most successfulmethadone patients are aware that methadone, like other legallyprescribed drugs, is sometimes diverted to the street and sold onthe black market. Diversion is one of the government's excuses toimpose stricter controls on methadone. Many methadone clinics arelocated in the inner city where police protection is scarce. Itis not difficult for those seeking black market methadone toloiter near clinics. Methadone opponents attempt to use this factto validate methadone mythology. It is necessary to separate factfrom fiction so that the real issues can be resolved. Themajority of methadone patients want nothing to do with those fewwho abuse or divert methadone. Recovery is a precious commodity;no serious patient would jeopardize it. The methadone industry in Michigan has been harassed repeatedlyover the past year. Clinics have been raided, governmentofficials have disrupted the lives of patients by coming to theirhomes to question them, and the media has blatantly lied aboutmethadone treatment. The latest tactic in Michigan's scheme todismantle methadone treatment comes from the Michigan Departmentof Social Services. Without notifying the clinic involved, DSSmailed letters to patients of Michigan's largest clinic statingthat the clinic would no longer be eligible to bill Medicaid. Theletter stated that Medicaid patients should begin to transfer toother programs immediately and that their transfers should becomplete by March 21, 1996. The letters were mailed while theclinic's administrators were in Washington D.C. to meet withlegislators to discuss the future of methadone in Michigan. Thestate has used similar scare tactics in the past without success.If Michigan succeeds in its efforts to close its largest clinics,others will follow. Contrary to popular belief, recovering addicts are not powerless.While it is true that addicts have little credibility, it issurprising how much their credibility improves once they havewritten to their legislators. Methadone patients who are not nowregistered to vote have been urged to do so by methadone patientadvocacy groups. There are approximately 2,000 methadone patientsin Michigan who have proclaimed their membership in DetroitOrganizational Needs in Treatment (DONT) and The NationalAlliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA). There are also a numberof individuals in Detroit who have joined Methadone as ALegitimate Treatment Alternative (MALTA), another NAMA affiliate.In addition to their ongoing voter registration drive, Michigan'smethadone patients are now organizing a letter-writing campaign.Patients are writing to their legislators to promote the positivetherapeutic aspects of methadone treatment and to voicedisapproval over government harassment of methadone programs. Patients can potentially play the most important role in thisbattle. Unfortunately, most clinics and their administrativestaffs have not thought to ask their patients to voice theiropinions on the matter. This stems from the archaic,paternalistic attitude that exists among methadone treatmentproviders. But this does not mean that clinics are not concerned.They simply haven't informed their patients of the problems inMichigan. Their concern has manifested itself as an attempt toform a methadone treatment providers association, tentativelycalled Michigan Alliance of Methadone Providers (MAMP). Theformation of MAMP is their effort to form a political voice andto provide a united front against the unrealistic, irrationaldemands of managed care organizations. The methadone treatmentproviders in this state have tried unsuccessfully to form analliance in the past. The attempt failed because few could agreeon anything. Now, as managed care organizations approach clinicsindividually to negotiate treatment costs, there is the potentialfor a "free for all" whereby Michigan's clinics willstab each other's backs while competing for funding and patients.It's the old "divide and conquer" strategy. Michigan'smethadone treatment providers are aware of this and are worriedabout their fate. Ask anyone who attended the first two meetingsof MAMP this year. All but two of the states' clinics wererepresented. Reports from the meetings indicate that those whoare long-time competitors were concerned enough about Michigan'sproblems to sit down to explore possible solutions. One finalnote: It is interesting that Michigan's methadone patients aremore politically organized than the state's methadone providers;they also get along with one another much better. Top of Page Confidentialityin Treatment by Penny When one signs up as a patient in a methadoneclinic, they are told that all of their information isconfidential. Yet the true question is, "What do they meanby confidential?" According to Random House Dictionary,confidential is "a secret or private matter, not to bedivulged or communicated to others." We assume that ourcounselor is the one that is privy to our most personalinformation and concerns. The doctor is next, knowing what isimportant for our medical concerns; the nurse knows our names anddoses. The person at the front desk knows our financial concernsand what appointments we have to keep, but how much farther thanthat does it go? I have been on methadone approximately fifteen years. In those 15years, I have been in clinics in six states. I have experiencedpublic clinics, private clinics, and clinics somewhere inbetween. Yet, at all of them, they told me that any informationabout me was confidential. They told me that also meant theycould not even give information to my husband without mypermission. Most clinics have weekly meetings where they discuss clients.That has meaning for us because other counselors and clinicemployees learn sometimes very intimate information about us.When we go to counseling and "open up," we do not thinkit should go past our counselor, yet it does. A special conflictcomes up when a married couple is in a clinic. Clinics should notassume that all information one spouse confides is open to theother spouse; this even includes medical information. Yet, theyoften abuse this confidentiality and sometimes of great detrimentto the couple. A clinic in Tennessee that my husband and I entered several yearsago abused our confidentiality to the utmost. During the physical(blood work) part of our intake, they discovered certain factsabout each of us. They sat my husband and I down in the doctor'soffice with our counselors present, and the doctor proceeded totell us what they found. The doctor told me I was pregnant andthat my husband had syphilis. This had special meaning for usbecause we had spent most of the prior few months apart. As canbe guessed, this caused major problems in our marriage. It turnedout, after seeking our own medical tests, that if the clinic'slab had done their job appropriately, they would have discoveredthat my husband always tests false positive. As for me beingpregnant, it was my place to tell my husband--not theirs. Thismajor breach of confidentiality almost destroyed my marriage. This was not the only incident where methadone clinic employeescaused rifts in our marriage. Recently, results of a breathanalysis on my husband was readily divulged to me. This time, aformal complaint was filed. After approximately six months, myhusband still has not gotten a reply to his complaint. Counselors of married couples also pass information back andforth about what is discussed in counseling. This information issometimes passed on to the other spouse; other times, thisinformation may be used against the other spouse in some form ofpunishment by the clinic. As a general rule, I try to be somewhatcareful as to what I say about my spouse. It might come back tohaunt me. Clinic employees need to be very careful about what they say toother employees and/or patients. After all, they have supposedlypromised "complete confidentiality" to the patient, andprofessional ethics demand no less. Top of Page MethadoneTreatment by Ken Methadone is a necessary part of our overallsuccess in conquering the addiction that holds us firm in itsgrasp. Even so, we thoroughly repulsed and disgusted some peopleby the way we choose to treat our addiction. Life is acompetition and we, as patients of a methadone clinic, arecompetitors. We now have the tools, skills, and support that weneed to overcome one of life's greatest evils, and we must acceptthe responsibilities of treatment. We pay for each breath we take by a crushed and digested past;life is a tough business. We have built each of our lives upon amountain of painful memories; each of our bodies is a livingmonument that positive change can accomplish anything. We live ina civilization where there are many appointments--some to servethe greater good, some the greater evil. We, as substanceabusers, have seen both sides of life's appointments and havesurvived! We, as addicts, have heard the sound of time beginningto run out on us. It made us realize that life is important andthat it does matter what happens to us. We are destined to befree; because once we enter the drug-free world, we areresponsible for everything that we do. Then we are answerable toourselves and to the world we cherish most highly--our own! Wecan reach no higher than our arms--so do we aim for less than themost? We have beaten an enemy that is not only our enemy but anenemy to all people of the world--an enemy of humanity. We walkedbrazenly through a kingdom that had not been worth it. We hadwalked the mountains and the valleys of life--a shadowed life ina shadowed world. But, now we walk in a free and unrestricted world. We just keeplooking to the horizon and realize that anything can happenbeyond it. All things inevitably lead to the same horizon. Thechief difference between us and the straight world is that webetter recognize the challenges that destiny gives to eachperson. Do not let somebody else make a decision for you or standin judgement of you. If there is a battle to get through, battlefor what you believe. If someone is to be judged, we must not bethat judge as we are all brothers and sisters and must make ourown decisions. Maybe we are throwbacks to another time, of another kind, toanother ideal, but this much we should realize and etch upon ourvery souls: we are alive today because of our decision to helpourselves, and we need not be ashamed of that decision. ForeverPeace! Top of Page NarcoticsAnonymous NA by Nancy R. I am writing this article in response to IraSobel's article, "Methaphobia," in Methadone Today(December 1995, Vol. I, No. III). I would like to comment on hisstatement that they do not allow methadone patients to share atNA meetings. Maybe the NA groups in New York (where Ira is from)have that policy, but it is not that way at the meetings inDetroit and the surrounding suburbs! I also read a similarstatement in Larry S.' article, "12-Step Support forMethadone Patients," in Methadone Today(August 1995, Vol. I, No. I). Since the summer of 1994, I have been regularly attending NAmeetings, usually four to five meetings a week. I go to someregular meetings but also try out new ones. I have attendedmeetings in Detroit, Oakland County, Macomb County, and St. ClairCounty. At all these various meetings, they have never told me Icannot share at a table because of being a methadone patient(and, yes, I am honest about it). I think it is important Ilet methadone patients know this, so they won't be discouragedfrom trying NA meetings. You see, there are only a fewscattered Methadone Anonymous (MA) meetings (which Larrymentions), but there are a few hundred AA and NA meetings in thearea! If you are interested in trying an NA meeting, GO! If you happento attend a meeting where they will not let you share, try adifferent meeting! Better yet, remind them of NA's ThirdTradition: "The only requirement for membership is thedesire to stop using!" Also, the Tenth Tradition states,"NA has no opinion on outside issues. . . " (andmethadone is an outside issue!) In fact, I would like to quote from NA's "Basic Text"(the blue book) part of the writing for Tradition Nine (4th ed.,p. 50): "Desire is our only requirement . ..any addict, regardless of drugs used. . .is free to practice theNA way of life. . . .All addicted persons are welcome andequal in obtaining the relief they are seeking from theiraddiction; every addict can recover in this program on an equalbasis. . . .Membership in NA is not automatic. . .when a newcomerwalks in the door. . .any addict who has a desire to stop usingcan become a member of NA." Self explanatory, yes? An even better quotation begins on page 145, under TraditionThree in NA's book, It Works: How & Why:"Any addict who walks into a meeting, even a usingaddict (emphasis mine), displays a level of willingnessthat cannot be discounted. . . .still-using addicts arewelcomed into our meetings with special encouragement to keepcoming back . . . .these addicts are members in every respect(emphasis mine) as long as they have the desire to stop using,and they are entitled to the same consideration and support asany other member." So, at most NA meetings, you will probably have no hassle orproblems about being on methadone. Possibly, someone may suggestyou think about getting off methadone, but you can always tellthat person that methadone is keeping you CLEAN and you willdetox when you and your doctor feel you are ready! We need toeducate some people about methadone, as there is still muchmisunderstanding about it. To live drug free (with or without methadone), we need to changeour old ways of thinking and our old, using friends. In NA, youmeet new friends--clean, recovering addicts who are learning tolive and enjoy life WITHOUT using drugs. I have even met a numberof people in NA who have successfully detoxed off methadone andare still drug free. I think NA is a wonderful program! It is a spiritual (notreligious) program. I have come to enjoy meetings where we"share" about our lives, our problems, our successes,and how we stay clean. Besides meetings, we have NA dances,picnics, skating parties, barbeques, etc. If you can find a Methadone Anonymous or Methadone Awarenessmeeting, try that too. I hope more methadone clinics start MAmeetings. Meanwhile, TRY AN NA MEETING! It changed my life! Top of Page HistoricalPerspectives by Jon Many in the field of chemical dependency becameaware of the problem as it emerged from the 1960's youth culture.Because of our training, we now know that the history ofnarcotics addiction is long and complex. We are fascinated thatPoe and Freud were addicts and that Edison stayed awake for daysunder the influence of cocaine wine while perfecting thephonograph. We have heard stories of soldiers from the Civil Warto Vietnam returning from the battlefield with opioiddependencies. We know that drug use flourished in the nineteenthcentury with legal morphine, opium, and cocaine. The history ofaddiction is well documented, but what about the history ofaddiction treatment? Those who work with methadone patients have read of the Dole andNyswander studies of the 1960's. We know of the U.S. PublicHealth Service Narcotic Hospital which opened in Lexington,Kentucky in 1935. While Lexington represented the first federallyapproved attempt at treatment, it did not represent the firstsincere efforts to help addicts. At the turn of the century, the treatment of narcotic addictionwas limited to quackery. Treatment was based on the personaltheories of the few physicians willing to address the problem.Most drugs were legal, and many of the "cures" weresimply opium-based patent medicines. When the Harrison Act of1914 passed, many addicts turned to the black market for drugs,others continued to maintain on physician-prescribed heroin,morphine, or cocaine. A 1919 Supreme Court decision placedrestrictions on physicians, which limited their ability toprescribe drugs of abuse. This marked the beginning of the clinicera. From 1919 to 1923, thirty-five clinics in 12 states dispensedmorphine to patients. Some of the clinics dispensed heroin andcocaine. The most well-known clinic of this era was operated byDr. Willis Butler. Dr. Butler attempted to detoxify his patientsgradually. He understood that detox was not a realistic goal formany patients and simply maintained them. This was a tremendousdisplay of insight more than forty years before Dole andNyswander's first experimental clinic. In addition to hisoutpatient dispensing clinic, Dr. Butler also operated aninpatient facility for his patients who were in the final stagesof the detoxification process. Upon completing the program, eachpatient received a certificate signed by seven doctors. This mayhave been the first employment of the team approach in addictionmedicine. In 1923, the government ordered the clinics closed. The study ofaddictions' treatment retreated into the dark ages until the1960's when Dole and Nyswander compiled data similar to that ofDr. Butler. The first successful therapeutic use of methadonerevolutionized the treatment of narcotics addiction. Methadonewas found to be more effective than morphine maintenance due toits longer duration. Unfortunately, the chemical treatment ofnarcotic addiction continues to be unfairly stigmatized. Top of Page MethadoneAwareness: Get Up Stand Up!!! by Ira Sobel (New York City) For the better part of two decades, I've beenon and off methadone maintenance programs. I've had to deal withfamily, friends, co-workers, and those in recovery with theirprejudice and bias against methadone. I've been treated like ajunkie with no will power. I'm sick and tired of having toexplain myself to them. I am proud of my choice of treatment. Iam an opiate addict. My drugs of choice are synthetic narcotics.I am not on methadone because my drug of choice is crack. I'm ona methadone program to recover from my powerlessness overopiates. My active years, before getting back on the program,were just that: active and out of control. People like us on methadone have been stigmatized enough. It'sabout time that we get up, stand up, and be proud of ourrecovery. We have been unduly classified by some as being anon-entity in terms of a valid treatment modality. Where havethese people been for the past thirty years? That's how longmethadone has been used to both maintain and detox addicts fromheroin. It was created by Drs. Dole and Nyswander, and Dr. Kreekand Herman Joseph, to treat opiate addicts using a long-actingnarcotic that when taken as prescribed enables a person to becapable of doing things like having a job, going to school,getting job training, and traveling again because when we aredoing dope, we aren't able to do anything. Our drug habit rulesour world. You are on a fence and going nowhere but down. Butwith methadone, people can build a foundation for their livesthat is so much better than they had while they were doing heroinand other narcotics. First, people should be taught that you don't feel euphoria orget "high" when you are on a maintained dose ofmethadone. When it's used properly, the person does not achieve astate of being high. Whereas heroin gives the user a feeling ofecstasy, methadone keeps a person maintained without the feelingof doing heroin. We have been slurred by people in recovery, those in the field ofaddiction, and by people in general. They feel that the entiremethadone concept is just substituting one drug (methadone) foranother (heroin). I've heard that slur one time too many in mylife. Those people should be educated about the mind, addiction,and what role methadone plays in the treatment of opiateaddiction. We on methadone must continue to fight ouroppressors together. We have to fight for our choices. We havealso been maligned by unbelievers, black-balled by 12-stepprograms, and called names. Let's not hide in the closet. We arenot anonymous. We accept the fact that we are on methadone tosave our lives, and we should know all about the medication weare taking. At Methadone Awareness (MA) meetings, we learn to dispel mythsand rumors laid at our feet by the misinformed. I believe thatthe only way to share this common knowledge is by indoctrinating"methadone awareness" meetings. In this setting, peopleon methadone can share about their recovery, personal problems,successes, important health issues, and facts about methadone.The patients should know the answers to so many questions weshare. Methadone awareness is more than just a meeting. It is a learningexperience. People who attend MA meetings learn fact from fictionand how well methadone has afforded us. Patients who continuallyshow up at meetings have found something that works for them.Although Alcoholics Anonymous is 60 years old, the roots of MAmeetings are just beginning. I've gone to many 12-step programsin my day, but going to methadone awareness meetings makes mefeel real comfortable because it seems so natural. Methadoneawareness meetings feel so freeing in the divine order of things. One of the most important things I've said in all of my articlesand stories is in "The Orange Colored Cure." I wrote(and still feel this way) that "being on methadone is notthe end of your life but the beginning of your recovery fromactive opiate addiction." MA meetings expand one's thinkingabout methadone. We discover together that methadone is a safemedication and we find out that there are a lot of similaritiesbetween us. We each share many of the same fears. By attendingmethadone awareness meetings, we help each other to stem the tideof adversity and beat the odds that are against us. When I attend MA meetings, I speak from my heart and learn to behonest with myself and people in the meetings. Another aspect isto share my feelings and facts about methadone. At one meeting Iattended, someone said that methadone was "poison."That was that person's feeling about methadone. I shared thatthere are so many good points about being in treatment that itoverrides any negativity that is being voiced. We must be "aware" of these issues, and this awarenesswill unite us in our recovery. In MA meetings, we become positiveand learn to have self-esteem and to have pride in ourselves. Weare not anonymous, nor are we hiding in the wings and goingnowhere. The basis for MA meetings is our common fight to beatdrugs and obtain the best treatment so that together we learn howto have gratitude and humility for our recovery!!! PEACE.

Perception - by Beth Francisco Medicaid, Methadone,Managed Care & Budget Cutbacks by Beth Francisco As promised at the voter registration drive in Pontiac, I havebeen looking for information regarding the effect of the newRepublican Congress' policies concerning Medicaid and managedcare and what that means for methadone patients. From what I havebeen able to discover, it doesn't look good. The Republican"Contract [ON] America" wants to "cut federalentitlements, and instead give block grants to the states."1 Republicans say they want block grants instead of entitlementsfor flexibility because they believe they "would have morediscretion over the way the money is spent."2 This is notterribly encouraging in Michigan with the governor we have, as weall know Engler is not exactly concerned about the poor,minorities, women, or addicts. The only reason any of thesegroups have gotten any relief is because of federalentitlements--with one of his first strokes of the pen, he didaway with many needed programs. One of the first federal cuts for addicts is from "The HouseWays and Means Committee [since it] is removing substance abuseas a disability under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)program. Just last year, Congress enacted a new law which limitsSSI payments for addicts and alcoholics to three years. Underwhat the House is proposing for welfare reform, those on SSImight be cut off altogether. Worse still, the committee hasdecided that these people...would not only lose their SSI, butwould become ineligible for Medicaid"3 If addicts are cutfrom Medicaid, it will be suicide, especially for those whodepend upon it to pay for their methadone maintenance. We are so concerned with saving money and cutting the federalbudget that it is absolutely illogical (and downright stupid) tocut addicts off from the one thing that keeps many of them out ofprison. It costs about $2,600 per year to maintain an addict onmethadone, and it costs ten times that much to "treat"addiction by throwing the addict in prison. When addicts cannotafford methadone treatment, there is always the threat of areturn to the streets where an addict can easily be 100 times thedrain on society when s/he has to return to larceny and burglaryto maintain their habit. The question is, "How can the addict afford the price on thestreet if s/he can't afford the methadone clinic?" When theaddict is maintained on methadone, s/he is usually makingimprovements in their life--getting an education, working tosupport self and family, and improving relationships. The addicthas neither the time or inclination to engage in negativebehaviors such as larceny, burglary, or any number of otherthings the addict has to do just to "maintain" on thestreet. The addict maintained on methadone is not exposinghim/herself to AIDS on a regular basis as they were whenexchanging needles. The price of one case of AIDS in money aloneis a thousand times the cost of yearly methadone maintenance, notto mention the human misery. In plain language, when the physicaland/or psychological addiction is taken care of, the addict isjust like any other person who wants to improve his lifeconditions. As we all know, when the addict is on the street,nothing matters except the next fix. What is really idiotic is the price of methadonemaintenance in the first place. It doesn't have to cost $2,600per year; the reason it does is because of the governmentalregulations on it. According to Substance Abuse ReportNewsletter: Methadone regulations are too restrictive and should be relaxedin favor of clinically useful guidelines, according to a reportby the Institute of Medicine [IOM]. While stopping short ofrecommending abolishing the regulations altogether, the report,released December 21, calls for making methadone easier to usefor treatment facilities and patients alike.4 When regulations call for arbitrary rules and regulations fromsomewhere in the great beyond that has nothing to do with reallife and real people, costs rise. The doctor, counselor, andaddict are in the best position to know how to treat theaddiction--not some senator in Washington or Lansing and not someprogram director who doesn't know us and probably never will. As far as Medicaid managed care, budget cutbacks will definitelybe pushing for more of it. "Managed behavioral health careorganizations contract with HMOs or states to provide Medicaidservices. They then turn to their provider panels forcost-effective care."5 The definition of managed care is: a system used by groups (including insurance carriers andcorporations) to manage costs while maintaining quality of healthand medical services. Specific approaches used by the payer ofservices include: pre-certification, utilization review, casemanagement and medical necessity review.6 The idea behind managed care is to save money by having a primaryprovider decide what type of health care you will be allowedunder the system. The primary provider decides if you needmethadone treatment, so the bottom line is, before you sign upfor anything, find out how your primary provider feels aboutmethadone maintenance or any other treatment you now receive on aregular basis. 1"Treatment Providers and State DirectorsFear Effect of Welfare Reform" (1995, March 15).

America Online (Downloaded 1995, Oct.18). Top of Page Reporter SkewsRitalin Story by Jon On November 16 and 17, WXYZ, Channel 7 inDetroit, aired a two-part series on Ritalin, a drug commonlyprescribed to children with Attention Deficit HyperactivityDisorder (ADHD), Ritalin has long been known as one of the mosteffective treatments for the disease. It has been under recentscrutiny due to efforts to ease restrictions on the drug inMichigan and elsewhere. Proponents of the drug's therapeutic usebelieve that its current Schedule II status makes Ritalinunnecessarily difficult for ADHD patients to obtain. Some believethat relaxed regulation of Ritalin will encourage abuse. Ritalin has been abused for more than twenty years by adolescentsand adults. Ritalin's rise in popularity in Michigan may be duein part to the state's strict laws which prohibit mostamphetamines. Ritalin is a stimulant but not technically anamphetamine. When prescribed properly, Ritalin is not used as anamphetamine substitute. There is no evidence to suggest thatRitalin is abused any more than other drugs with abuse potential.Yet, Channel 7's report implies that Ritalin abuse is rampant.Reporter Shellee Smith proclaimed that "Michigan is quicklybecoming one of the Ritalin Capitols of the world." Smith's sensationalistic rantings can do nothing to preventRitalin abuse. The heavily biased report focused largely on thenegative ramifications of Ritalin abuse but said little of thetherapeutic aspects of the drug and the thousands of children andadults who benefit from its use. Ritalin patients are stigmatizeddue to the atmosphere of ignorance that surrounds mental illnessand drug therapies. Deceiving the public with overblown,misleading information about any public health issue isdangerous. Smith's report may potentially spread panic among thefamilies of Ritalin patients who have suffered the hardships ofcoping with their loved one's ADHD. Shellee Smith seems to beusing sensationalistic tactics to sell her report under the guiseof protecting the public from the "evils" of Ritalin.Who will protect the public from Shellee Smith's recklessness? As with any psychoactive substance, Ritalin has abuse potential.Smith drew the focus away from more significant aspects of theissue in order to exaggerate this point while employing scaretactics that would appeal to any parent's worst fears. Ritalinabuse among adolescents and adults does exist in Michigan andelsewhere. All drug problems are serious, especially whenchildren and adolescents are affected. But Smith falls far shortof proving a Ritalin epidemic in Michigan. Her report providedlittle hard data and instead relied on a number of adolescentsfrom an area treatment center who appeared to be singled outbecause of their Ritalin dependencies. The appearance of anepidemic can be easily created if one uses a sample group ofhand-picked subjects possessing only those characteristics thatsupport one side of the issue. This brand of yellow journalism isnothing new to Shellee Smith. Earlier this year, she did asimilar report on methadone. The story was shamelessly slanted byemploying amateurish editing techniques and other instruments ofdeception such as the use of half truths and distortion of facts.She referred to methadone patients as addicts who "line upto get their fix" at the methadone clinic. Channel 7videotaped patients inside clinics and, in some cases, allowedtheir faces to be shown. Smith ignored any positive, therapeuticqualities of methadone treatment while implying that addicts weresupporting their habits with hard-earned tax dollars. The report seemed to imply that all methadone patients were innercity welfare cheats getting high for free. Meanwhile, thousandsof methadone patients within Channel 7's viewing area were leftto explain to their families that they were not patrons of legaldope houses. Targeting methadone patients is a cheap way torevive plummeting ratings which, ironically, are the result ofthe station's abandonment of its star anchorman who was at thetime receiving treatment for his own addiction. Smith obviouslydid little or no research on Ritalin or methadone. Her source forthese hatchet jobs is the worst kept secret in Detroit T.V. news.It appears that she has been relying on her federal significantother for information instead of doing hard investigativereporting. Top of Page Methaphobia by Ira Sobel We are living in a day and age when 12-stepprograms are known everywhere as a successful institution for somany people. Alcoholics Anonymous began with two individuals andit has become the most effective tool used by people in recoveryafflicted with the disease of addiction. People are joining12-step programs every day by the number. Lost souls are cominginto the rooms on our hands and knees defeated by our sickness. For 60 years the goal of Alcoholics Anonymous has been "tostay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety."That quote is taken from the preamble that is read before mostmeetings. Each 12-step program is based on that one statement. Itmeans that you are in these rooms to get sober for yourself andto help others all you can to achieve sobriety. No addictshould be turned away who asks for help. This is anintegral part of AA and every other fellowship. In a sense, the preamble welcomes newcomers to the program, aprogram where addicts think more about helping others thansatisfying their own wants and needs. It is a selfless program, aplace where an addict can feel safe. It gives the newcomer asense of belonging, that he or she has somewhere to go for help.People go to meetings just to be in the company of other addictsso that they can get better. There is an underlying tension that exists between people thatbelong to the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship and people inrecovery on methadone. People that attend NA meetings regularlyconsider themselves in recovery and people on methadone programsare not. Essentially this schism exists because those that attendNA meetings refuse to accept people on methadone because theyfeel we are not drug-free, that it would be the drug speaking.Their policy is that no one can share if they took amood-altering drug in the last 24 hours. So the practice has beento not let someone on methadone share or qualify. NA is wrong. Methadonemaintenance is not mood altering if you take methadone asprescribed. I think they have an extreme case ofmethaphobia!!! Methaphobia is a state of mind in which someone or a groupdisplays an intense fear and a bias against methadone patientsand methadone programs. It is very much like people in NA havebuilt-in forgetters. Those who espouse on NA principles put downmethadone as an institution. Basically, these people like to playGod, doctor, lawyer and pharmacist!!! We are all addicts and as long as I have a desire to stop usingdrugs, I should be able to share my experience, strength and hopewith a room full of addicts in all phases of recovery!!! That'sbecause I'm in my phase of recovery. A person on methadone can begoing to a specific NA group for six months without being able toshare while another person, who comes intermittently and has oneday back, is allowed to share!!! If the time of the meeting is 4p.m. and the person was using "some time yesterday"then we have to count hours. I mean shit, is there some kind oftime table they use in NA!!! It's so petty that I have tolaugh!!! I mean shit, does the NA meeting list have this timetable written on it?? Ridiculous. I have my own story about how NA didn't accept me as part of thegroup and how I learned about methaphobia the hard way. When Iwas discharged from my last detox in early 1986, I began going tomeetings. At the time, any meeting whether it was a beginnersmeeting, or a traditions meeting, or CA or DA was important to myrecovery. Meetings, meetings and more meetings. At the verybeginning, I chased recovery like I chased an opiate. I would goto 2-3 meetings a day all over the city. I went to CocaineAnonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and then I went to NarcoticsAnonymous meetings. One of the first things I learned at the beginning was to berigorously honest. So, I went to my first NA meeting that washeld at Water View Hospital. It was a "big book"meeting. Since I felt it was my duty to come clean about mydetoxing off methadone, I told people I "was down to 15mgs." This was a mistake. I was unaware of the methadoneclause of NA. The concept of methaphobia was all new to me. To mynaive mind, I was doing the right thing. You know, it's aboutbeing honest today, but because of NA, I found out that day that,unfortunately, it's not about being stupid!!! Right there, that instant in time, before the meeting evenstarted, I was blackballed. I didn't even have a chance atsharing. One girl said that I had a "ticket in my backpocket." I didn't find the compassion and understanding fromNA. It's too rigid. I do not go to NA meetings. If I can't shareand voice how I am doing in one fellowship, then I've gone toother fellowships for the support I very much need. To this day, I still have a major resentment against NA. Now, Idon't propose a full boycott of NA meetings. What I do suggest isthat if people in recovery need a place to go, they should attendother 12-step groups. I also hope that people like us onmethadone should attend MA meetings at your program and at otherprograms. At MA meetings, we share so honestly about the heavyodds against you and me. People at MA meetings display an intensedesire to get well. It's so exciting when people cheer forsomeone that shares about their good fortune. There is anintimacy that exists in MA meetings that I've never experiencedwith other 12-step support groups. These meetings are so new andrefreshing. An MA meeting is not filled with aging people thatnod out. No, it's about people who want to get better. Inessence, I've let go of my resentment and I've learned not tofight NA but to go to MA. That's where I want to be. PEACE. Top of Page Counselingand Compulsiveness by Michelle My counselor gave me an assignment last week tomake a pro and con list of an issue I was struggling over. Indoing so, I began to grasp the beneifts of list making as aproblem-solving tool. So, I made another list for why I should goback to school now and a list for why I should wait; a list ofreasons to tell my family about methadone and a list of theresons not to; a list of the things I still miss about drugs anda list of the things I don't. In short, I reduced the majordilemmas of my life into several numbered phrases that fit onsmall pieces of scrap paper. When I brought the finished productto my counselor's office, he noticed a pattern in the nature ofmy "self help." I had compulsively listed the pros andcons about being compulsive about my compulsions. Everything thatI had addressed was based on overdoing something and the problemsthat taking everything to the extreme had caused me, yet I haddone even this in excess, producing twenty-some lists. I remember something I heard long ago spoken by a true substanceabuser: "If you can't be intense about something, why beanything at all?" I took this statement to heart because itwas exactly how I felt. I had to be the most, the worst, thewildest, or whatever superlative fit the situation. Mycompetitiveness stemmed from a fear of anonymity but essentiallywas part of my character makeup. I was, and still am, anextremest, and it seems inevitible that my ultimate drug ofchoice would be the superlative of them all--heroin. With a personality like mine and a hankering for intensity, Ivisited the usual spots (some against my will) and landed here atthe clinic where superlative sorts line up every day. Not all theother patients desire things in the way that I do (borderlinenutso), but we all have had at least a small taste of what itmeans to be driven. Let's face it, being an addict takesinitiative and know-how. The point that my counselor made afterreading my lists and noticing my compulsiveness was that thisenergy needs to be used in productivity. Was this something thatI had never heard? No, but for the first time I consideredletting myself be the best instead of the worst. The worst, thebaddest, the meanest, the wildest--that was always a sure thing.the best is something that I'm definitely going to have to workhard at. Top of Page UrinalysisPolicies by Beth Francisco Most of us who have been in treatment for anylength of time have had trouble with "dirty urines"--wehave either had the problem of the test picking up a substancethat should not be there or of having "no methadone"detected. There are three things which can cause these instances: 1. An over-the-counter drug caused a false positive. 2. The lab made a mistake. 3. We have "used" something we should not have, or wehave not taken the methadone. There are many over-the-counter drugs which cause falsepositives. Steps are being taken to see that no one is falselyaccused of something they did not do. The new lab we will beusing will be saving urine samples for a period of time. If thereare any questions, they can be re-tested. Also, I am supplyingcounselors with a list of the drugs I am familiar with that cancause false positives. These results are not engraved in gold as there is always thepossibility of human error. Again, if you feel there is amistake, the sample can be re-tested. Talk with your counselorregarding procedure. Although false positives and human error are a real concern forus, there are those who play with the program and use other drugsto supplement their methadone. You know who you are. It does notmake you a bad person, but it does cause problems for the programand, most importantly, for yourself. If you are using othersubstances, talk with your counselor--be honest. Your counselor should have a pretty good idea if you are tellingthe truth or not. If your drug of choice shows up in your urinescreen every other time you drop and re-testing shows the sameresult, your protests will certainly be suspect. If, however, youare doing what you are supposed to be doing, you should be takenat your word. That is why it is important to let your counselorknow what is going on with you. If you have been following yourtreatment plan but all of a sudden show behavior changes, andthen come up with a dirty urine, you might have some explainingto do. An honest relationship with your counselor is essentialand beneficial to you in more ways than one. Top of Page Clean, Depressed,& Confused by Rose Before entering the methadone program, I had nolife. i could not function without a blow I believed that nothingcould help me. I always said I would never use methadone. But Iwent to the clinic out of desperation. the medication helped meto stop using heroin. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed mycounseling sessions. For two years, I did everything that I was supposed to do. Ibegan to like myself. My appearance improved, I gained weight,and I felt good. My clinic's doctor and my counselor recognizedmy progress and granted me take-home privileges. I was beginningto live again. Just when I thought that things couldn't be better, a terriblething happened. The man whom I loved for fourteen years died. Ithadn't occurred to me that I might have to cope with being alone.I was half crazy out of my mind and felt I had nowhere to turn. ..I relapsed. I don't think that I believed I would find the answers I waslooking for by returning to heroin. I was running from myproblems as I had in the past. The help I needed was right undermy nose. I told my counselor the truth about my relapse andstarted attending group therapy at the clinic. I had thesolutions I needed within me. The support I received from mycounselor and the group helped me to find them. I was back on the right track and doing well. I had nearly ninetydays clean again. Then I saw the clinic doctor for a routinemedical exam. The doctor asked why I suddenly had several opiateurine reports after having a clean record. I explained thecircumstances, but she revoked my take-home privileges anyway. tomake matters worse, she said that my privileges would be restoredninety days from that day instead of ninety days after my mostrecent positive urine report. The story doesn't end here. I was feeling depressed about whathad happened to me. I didn't think there was anything left to gowrong. Then I got the news: Another urine report was positive foropiates! When I relapsed, I was honest with my counselor andadmitted to using heroin. But this time, I was clean! I realizethat this might arouse suspicion in some people, but I have noreason to be dishonest. Something must have gone wrong at thelab--maybe the samples were switched. My counselor said thatnothing could be done. I would have to wait ninety days againbefore I would get my take-home privileges. I believe that myclinic and the lab that they hire should work harder to eliminateerror. It's difficult enough to fight a drug problem withoutbeing penalized for the mistakes of others. Top of Page Principlesvs. Personalities by Beth Francisco Many of us are familiar with the term"Principles before Personalities" from Twelve-Stepmeetings we have attended in our attempts to be free from drugsand/or alcohol. The 12th Tradition states, "Anonymity is thespiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us toplace principles before personalities." The definition ofprinciple is "an essential truth upon which other truths arebased", or "a rule by which a person chooses to governhis conduct, often forming part of a code." The definitionof personality is, "the totality of characteristics whichmake up a person." Addicts are not the only ones guilty of breaking this tradition.One of the most egregious expressions of putting personalitiesbefore principles is the double-standard by which HarryAnslinger, the first commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics,treated street addicts as opposed to those with good connections.Senator McCarthy was of "sufficient prominence" to havehad the protection of the commissioner while he obtained hisnarcotics from a Washington pharmacy without interference fromBureau agents. However, Anslinger was opposed to any treatmentwhich supplied narcotics to addicts on the street, and herigorously enforced laws against them. He depicted those whosmoked marijuana as monsters, and his campaign against it wasliberally strewn with ads about them as wild-eyed drug fiends whobutchered whole families. If Anslinger's principles trulyopposed drugs instead of the people he slandered, McCarthy'snarcotic use would have been included in his opposition. Thispreferential treatment is clearly a violation of "Principlesbefore Personalities." We can all learn from this by asking ourselves in any situation,"Are my values consistent? Do I treat everyone in aconsistent manner, or do I give preferential treatment?" Ifyou recognize yourself breaking the rules, ask yourself"Why?" Do you break the rules for people you like andapply stricter rules to those you don't? Sometimes we don'tlisten to what a person has to say because we don't care forhim/her personally, and often that is the very thing we need tohear. I would often sit in a meeting listening intently to whateach person said, then at the point that a certain"personality" spoke, I would tune her/him out because Ididn't like that person. That's a red light, bell-ringingsituation for me. Finally, "Principles before Personalities" means thatwe watch out for that intruder, the ego. We allwant recognition; we all need recognition, and there's nothingwrong with that. However, when working toward our common goal ofrecovery, it's not about you, and it's not about me; it's aboutus. Recovery is a journey; we all have something to offer on thatjourney, and none of us can do it by ourselves, contrary to whatthe ego tells us. Top of Page First AdvocacyMeetings Held by Jon DETROIT - The first methadone patientadvocacy meetings took place in Detroit and Roseville last month.Interest in patient advocacy has spread rapidly throughout thestate. Though it is largely centered in the Detroit metropolitanarea, inquiries have come from as far away as Grand Rapids andMuskegan. Patients from Flint and Toledo, Ohio have alsoexpressed an interest in the movement. Back issues of Methadone Awareness, the newsletterof the Philadelphia and Atlantic City chapter of the NationalAlliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA) have been circulatingaround Detroit for several months. A group of Detroit patientswere already in the process of forming an advocacy group whenthey became aware of NAMA through Methadone Awareness.Meanwhile, a counselor at a Detroit clinic read about NAMA in AddictionTreatment Forum. Soon, another newsletter, the M.A.L.T.A.Messenger began circulating around clinics in Detroit.Methadone as A Legitimate Treatment Alternative (MALTA) is a NAMAaffiliate in California. Detroit patients were infuriated this year by malicious attackson methadone by the local broadcast media. Two of Michigan'slargest clinics were targeted, but all of the state's methadoneprograms have felt the impact of the heavily biased reports.Patients were left to try to explain to their families andemployers that methadone is not legal dope. Some were pressuredby their spouses to detox. In Lansing, attempts are being made to limit public assistancebenefits to methadone patients. Patients have been harassed bygovernment officials attempting to persuade them to go into28-day inpatient programs. These are only a few of the problemswith being a methadone patient in Michigan. These and otherissues have prompted the formation of the organization, DetroitOrganizational Needs in Treatment (DONT). The first meetings havebeen successful. DONT is in the process of becoming a chapter ofNAMA. Top of Page DONT IgnorePatient Advocacy in Michigan by Jon Detroit Organizational Needs in Treatment(DONT) is the new methadone patient advocacy organization inMichigan. there is a critical need for methadone patient advocacyin Michigan. There is a critical need for methadone patientadvocacy in Michigan. Negative media coverage, harassment fromthe government, and clinics with inhumane policies are some ofthe problems we face. Together, we can form a strong voice sothat our pleas can he heard. DONT will create avenues ofcommunication between patients, givernment officials, and programadministrators. We must find a middle ground where we can cometogether to strive for understanding of one another. We cannot continue to lay quietly in the background whileofficials in Washington and Lansing make decisions about ourlives. We cannot endure policy changes without our consultation.Many of us are registered voters. DONT members who are notregistered to vote will register. Most of ushave the power to choose the clinics where we receive treatment.As individuals, we had little impact when quitting programs toexpress dissatisfaction. And, all too often, we left one programonly to find more dissatisfaction at another. As a group, we havepower and discourage members from remaining in programs withunreasonable policies. Unfortunately, some of us are beginning to lose the right tochoose. Patients with Medicaid are being ordered out of theirprograms and are forced to enroll in whatever program the statedecides they should be in. It is not our intent to make irrational demands. We simply wishto be treated with the respect and dignity afforded to patientsreceiving other kinds of medical treatment. Methadone is aneffective treatment for our disease. Those of us who aresuccessful in methadone treatment are serious patients. We feelthat we get inadequate recognition or none at all. Thos fewpatients among us who are not interested in treatment get adisproportionately high level of attention. It is those very fewwho make no attempt to seek recovery who tend to loiter nearclinics or divert their medication. Yet, these few patients aregiven the spotlight when politicians need a cause to promotetheir own self-serving agendas. These are also the patients whomthe media portrays as "typical" methadone patients.Cancer patients have diverted medication. Yet there are no knowncases of cancer patients being refused treatment for diverting orbeing portrayed as typical by the media or government. We intend to begin communication with clinics and governmentofficials by wiping the slate clean. We are concerned with thepresent and the future. We invite the State of Michigan, CSAS,and all methadone programs to work with us, to hear our concerns.We know that we are not on a one-way street. What do you needfrom us? We will work with you to eliminate the negativeappearance of methadone treatment. We will help to eliminatediversion and abuse. In return, we simply ask that you hear ourpleas--we must have the respect and dignity we deserve. Top of Page Take Home Med Policies: What Is Fair? by Nancy R. I have been on methadone for over twenty years.I continued using street drugs such as heroin and Dilaudid forthe first ten years of my methadone treatment (1975 to 1985). Butduring the second decade, 1985 to present, I have used onlymethadone. My urines have been negative for illicit drugs. Ibegan to use methadone as it was intended to be used and turnedmy life around. I work full time and am taking college courses atnight to complete work on my bachelor's degree. I got married andhave reestablished family ties. I am involved with NarcoticsAnonymous and feel that I am growing spiritually. I creditmethadone with saving my life! So what is my complaint? My concern is with the State ofMichigan's regulations concerning take-home privileges. Under theregulations, methadone patients who have been prescribed 100mg ormore per day must receive special permission from state andfederal authorities to have take-home privileges. One time perweek take-home medication is out of the question unless you havea serious medical condition or travel hardship. I am most comfortable at 150mg. I have been trying to decrease mydosage to below 100mg so that I can be eligible for once-a-weektake homes. I believe that the state should drop this arbitrarydosage of 100mg for determining eligibility for the number ofdoses a patient is allowed to take home. This decision should beleft to the clinic's physician. Dosage and take-home priviligesshould be determined on an individual basis. My clinic doctor andcounselor know my ;unique history. They know how much I haveimproved my life. They also know that I lead a busy life withwork and school. Going to the clinic every day under thesecircumstances seems like a punishment. Shouldn't I be able tohave take-home medication while maintaining at a dose that I amcomfortable with? Haven't I earned this privilege? I feel strongly about this. This particular regulation affectsmany patients. Our advocacy group must work together to learn howstate regulations are changed in order to provide moreindividualized treatment for methadone patients. To Top of Page Perception by Beth Francisco We are a society of drug takers. We have a pillfor everything from headache to backache, to go to sleep or stayawake, contraceptives or fertility pills, and we want to feelgood right now. The problem is, the government has decided whichdrugs are no good for us and which are okay. People can't helpbut be confused--myself included. It was okay for me to takenarcotics for a long time while addicted under the care of adoctor. There was no social stigma, they were affordable, and Icould function. When I first started buying drugs on the street,I was taking the same drug that I got from the doctor, but it wasat that point that I became stigmatized as a weak, incompetentperson. What had changed? Not the drug certainly, and I still hadthe same pain, so what had changed? My status, overnight, and thefact that I had to buy my drug at such an inflated price thateverything I had saved and worked for became the drug dealer'sproperty. I was sent to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me as manic-depressive(this was the diagnosis of the day--now it's called bi-polar),and he prescribed Lithium and an anti-depressant. "Don'ttake their drugs--take mine!" was the message I got. I tookhis drugs, and I couldn't function. I had to hang on to the wallsto walk because I was so disoriented, and I couldn't writebecause my hand jerked too badly. When I told the doctor I couldnot take his medication, he said, "Well, I'llprescribe another drug to counteract the other drugs." Thatmakes a lot of sense! If I did take his drugs, Iwould not be a social outcast, but I wouldn't be able tofunction; if I didn't take mine, I wouldn't be ableto function. If I did take mine, I would be an outcast anda criminal because possession is a crime. This is madness--theaddict, just by virtue of being an addict, is labelled as a badperson.

Amphetamines Introduction At risk groups and social factors Effects of amphetamine use Effects of withdrawal from amphetamine use INTRODUCTION In the past, amphetamines have been used to treat a number of medical conditions such as epilepsy, obesity, narcolepsy, depression and hyperkinetic children. Since amphetamines were prescribed and promoted quite readily after World War II, people assumed that these drugs were less harmful, if harmful at all. Recent studies, however, have shown amphetamines to be both potentially addictive and quite toxic. Another concern are the recent signs of increased availability and use, and the knowledge that amphetamines can be bought quite cheaply. The best known members of this group of stimulants in Australia, in decreasing order of potency, are dexamphetamine (eg dexedrine), methamphetamine (eg methedrine) and the amphetamines (eg benzedrine). Amphetamines are potent sympathomimetic amines of a simple structure with a multiplicity of biological effects that include hyperthermic, anorectic, cardiovascular and central nervous system stimulant actions. The stimulant action of amphetamines is similar to the naturally occurring hormone adrenalin and is thought to work by stimulating and exciting all areas of the nervous system, including the brain. Since a major action of amphetamines is to inhibit sleep and fatigue, a present concern is the self medication of amphetamines by truck drivers, students and businessmen, who use amphetamines to stave off normal fatigue and enable them to work for days with little sleep or food. AT RISK GROUPS AND SOCIAL FACTORS Young males Those who frequent nightclubs � an effect of amphetamine use is that it facilitates energy and activation allowing users to dance all night Students, particularly at exam time Truck drivers � it allows them to drive for long periods without rest and make more trips per week Those people who are prescribed amphetamines for medical purposes and who develop a dependence for them eg diet pills (Duromine) The drug has a reputation of facilitating social and sexual interactions: implications for HIV transmission, ie if enhanced sexuality is not accompanied by safer sexual practices amphetamines are often used in a casual fashion accompanied by alcohol. The setting is not conducive to the use of clean needles and amphetamine use is an independent risk factor for HIV infection. Injecting drug user are increasingly emerging as a polydrug abusing group and as amphetamines are cheaper than heroin on the street more IDUs are including amphetamines in their repertoire of drug use. EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE USE The effects of amphetamines depend on a number of factors which include the dosage, the mode of administration, the individual and the circumstances under which the drug is taken. Immediate effects at low doses Effects at high doses Long-term effects Social problems Tolerance and dependence Immediate effects at low doses Sensations of euphoria Enhanced self awareness and self confidence Increased visual awareness Heightened alertness Increased capacity for concentration Greater energy Users become hyperactive, talkative, excited, irritable and restless Reduction of appetite Increased breathing and heart rate Raised blood pressure Dilation of the pupils. Effects at high doses Dry mouth Fever Stereotyped movements Sweating Headache Blurred vision Dizziness Flushing Pallor Tachycardia Tremor Loss of coordination Collapse Jaw clenching/tension Nausea/vomiting Gastrointestinal disturbances Insomnia Rapid or slurred speech Seizures Hyperthermia Cerebrovascular accidents can result from haemorrhagic stroke or ischaemic events secondary to vascular occlusion Possibility of permanent organic brain damage in connection with psychosis associated with chronic amphetamine abuse At high doses, amphetamine abusers may experience distortions and gross alterations in body image which are often extremely frightening Amphetamine psychosis this is a paranoid psychosis with disorientation in some place or person amphetamine psychosis is often preceded by restlessness, irritability and increased perceptual sensitivity symptoms include delusions of persecution, ideas of reference, and often bizarre visual and auditory hallucinations amphetamine psychosis can often only be distinguished from paranoid schizophrenia by the short time it takes the symptoms to disappear, usually a few days or weeks after drug use is stopped. Long-term effects Malnutrition � since amphetamines suppress appetite, illnesses related to nutrition and vitamin deficiencies occur and there is increased susceptibility to disease Violence � intense and sudden acts of aggression can occur. Aggressive acts are often related to paranoia, feelings of persecution, and distortion of perception Multiple drug use � depressant drugs such as alcohol and barbiturates may be used in combination to combat the side effects of amphetamine use, such as sleeplessness Blockage of blood vessels � impure amphetamines may contain particles which can block small blood vessels and lead to kidney damage, lung emboli or stroke Depression � often a vicious cycle exists. A patient suffering from chronic depression takes amphetamine for relief, becomes dependent, tries to discontinue its use, suffers depression as a withdrawal symptom, and renews amphetamine use. Social problems Violent aggressive behaviour The use of amphetamines by drivers of heavy road transport vehicles causing serious road vehicle accidents Spread of HIV and other infections through the use of non-sterile injecting equipment (sharing) Belief of users that amphetamines are not harmful and therefore those dependent on amphetamines are unlikely to contact drug services Amphetamine use by adolescents may affect psychosexual development Misdiagnosis of amphetamine psychosis as paranoid schizophrenia Use can result in criminal activity When used to treat hyperkinetic children some children may show an exaggeration of original symptoms as well as experience the side effects associated with amphetamine use. Tolerance and dependence Tolerance develops to many of the actions of amphetamines. These include euphoria, anorexia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension and increased excretion of noradrenaline. Little tolerance seems to develop to the anti-sleep actions of these drugs EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWAL FROM AMPHETAMINE USE Psychostimulant withdrawal is generally described in three phases � crash, withdrawal and extinction. The characteristics of these phases are as follows: Crash � the initial period which classically follows a 'run' of use. The most common effects experienced include fatigue and exhaustion. Effects may last several hours to several days. Withdrawal � this phase may last for a number of weeks or even months and is typically characterised by: lethargy/fatigue long but disturbed sleep irritability strong hunger deep depression that may lead to attempted suicide fits of violent action anxiety attacks psychic disruption and loss of self-control which may result in aggression headaches trouble breathing sweating muscle cramps gastrointestinal cramps severe secondary reactions ie influenza, pneumonia. Extinction � normal mood and behaviour is interrupted by episodic craving often in response to conditioned cues. These cravings may last minutes or hours and may continue to occur months or years after cessation of amphetamine use. The most florid symptoms usually dissipate within a few days or weeks of cessation of use of amphetamines. Often, a significant improvement in mood, energy, and paranoid thinking occurs within days. Other symptoms such as normal sleep patterns, memory loss, confusion and paranoid thinking and perceptual abnormalities may persist for perhaps six to twelve months. After that time, residual symptoms, if present, are generally slight and not disabling, and are noticed primarily by the user. Abstinence is probably the most important therapeutic device, however, some crises may yield to phenothiazine tranquillisers as first aid despite its risk of lowering seizure threshold. Currently there is a trend for using tricyclic antidepressants as part of the management of psychostimulant dependence.

DARE Scare: Turning Children Into Informants? WP 1/29/94 9:00 PM By James Bovard DRUG ABUSE Resistance Education (DARE) is currently beingtaught by police officers to more than 5 million children in morethan 250,000 classrooms each year. The brainchild of former LosAngeles police chief Daryl Gates, the DARE program is directedmostly at fifth and sixth graders, though its activities can spankindergarten through 12th grade. Gates made headlines in 1989with his suggestion that drug users be taken out and shot, andhis brand of philosophical moderation permeates the DARE approachto drug abuse. On its face, DARE seems unobjectionable. It seeks to maximizeyoungsters' hostility to drugs by teaching them perils of drugsand reinforcing the message with DARE frisbees, DARE wristwatchesand an official DARE song ("Dare to keep a kid off dope/Dareto give a kid some hope"). Students are also able to win orpurchase DARE pencils, erasers, workbooks and certificates ofachievement. But along with the anti-drug paraphernalia may come a moreominous effect: children informing on their drug-using parents. The program was created partly as a result of Gates'sfrustrations with police sting operations in the schools. Untilthe late 1980s, Los Angeles police officers routinely wentundercover as high school students in order to implore realstudents to buy drugs from them. In 1987, the American CivilLiberties Union complained, "When other adults try to getyoung people involved with drugs, we call it contributing to thedelinquency of a minor. When the LAPD does it, we call it theschool-buy program." Finding young people who would buy drugs proved quite easy.Unfortunately, it had little effect on drug use by students. AsGates told the Los Angeles Times last September, "We keptbuying more and more. It was appalling, depressing. I finallysaid: `This is crazy. We've got to do something.' " The result was DARE. Winning the trust of youngsters is anessential feature of DARE. Policemen sit and talk with childrenduring lunch hour and play games with them during recess. Thefederal Bureau of Justice Assistance noted in a 1988 report thatDARE "students have an opportunity to become acquainted withthe (police) officer as a trusted friend who is interested intheir happiness and welfare. Students occasionally tell theofficer about problems such as abuse, neglect, alcoholic parents,or relatives who use drugs." One of the first lessons found in DARE teaching materialsstresses the "Three R's": "Recognize, Resist andReport." The official DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4contains a worksheet that instructs children to "Circle thenames of the people you could tell if . . . a friend finds somepills"; the "Police" are listed along with"Mother or Father," "Teacher"or"Friend." The next exercise instructs children to checkboxes for whom they should inform if they "are asked to keepa secret" - the police are again listed as an option. Roberta Silverman, a spokeswoman for national DAREheadquarters in Los Angeles, rejects the idea that DARE teachesor encourages informing. "When students begin the DAREprogram they are specifically advised not talk about theirparents or friends. We are very clear that when DARE instructorsare in the classroom, they are there as teachers, not lawenforcement officers." Silverman says that the DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4is not part of the DARE core curriculum. "It lays thegroundwork for what the officers do later. It's more like genericsafety instruction, teaching kids about personal safety. The partabout keeping a secret is to get kids talking about molestation.It has nothing to do with drugs or with getting them to turntheir parents in." Silverman also says that "any time achild makes a disclosure (of parental drug use) to an officer,the DARE officer would be required like any other teacher toreport that to the proper authorities or agencies." Not surprisingly, children sometimes confide the names ofpeople they suspect are illegally using drugs. A mother andfather in Caroline County, Md., were jailed for 30 days aftertheir daughter informed a police DARE instructor that her parentshad marijuana plants in their home, according to a story in TheWashington Post in January 1993. The Wall Street Journal reportedin 1992 that "In two recent cases in Boston, children whohad tipped police stepped out of their homes carrying DAREdiplomas as police arrived to arrest their parents." In1991, 10-year-old Joaquin Herrera of Englewood, Colo., phoned911, announced, "I'm a DARE kid" and summoned police tohis house to discover a couple of ounces of marijuana hidden in abookshelf, according to the Rocky Mountain News. The boy satoutside his parents' home in a police patrol car while the policesearched the home and arrested the parents. The policemanassigned to the boy's school commended the boy's action. Police and DARE officials keep no statistics on how many drugbusts result from the program. And DARE officials say thatreports of kids informing on their parents cannot fairly beattributed to DARE. "I think to focus on these few incidents is to do adisservice to people who are at the forefront of preventionefforts in this country," DARE's Silverman said. "Thereare 25 million kids who have been exposed to DARE and a handfulof cases of informing that may or may not be related to DARE atall." Nine-year-old Darrin Davis of Douglasville, Ga., called 911after he found a small amount of speed hidden in his parent'sbedroom because, as he told the Dallas Morning News, "Atschool, they told us that if we ever see drugs, call 911 becausepeople who use drugs need help . . . . I thought the police wouldcome get the drugs and tell them that drugs are wrong. They neversaid they would arrest them. . . . But in court, I heard themtell the judge that I wanted my mom and dad arrested. That is alie. I did not tell them that." The arrest wrecked hisparents' lives, said the Dallas newspaper; both parents losttheir jobs, a bank threatened to foreclose on their homes and hisfather was kept in jail for three months. Silverman says that the details of the case prove how murkysuch cases are. While Darrin Davis had been in a DARE program,she says that he did not report his parents to the DARE officerand that there was evidence that the parents were also involvedin drug trafficking, thus putting their child at risk. "It's making a mountain out of a molehill," shesays. Whatever DARE's effect on families, its record atdiscouraging drug use is the subject of some controversy. A studyfinanced by the National Institute on Drug Abuse on the effect ofDARE on Kentucky students between 1987 and 1992 reported "nostatistically significant differences between experimental groupsand control groups in the percentage of new users of . . .cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol and marijuana." More recently, the National Institute of Justice hiredResearch Triangle Institute (RTI) to survey and evaluate all thepublished research on DARE, and RTI's preliminary conclusionswere largely negative. The RTI's evaluation concluded that only eight publishedstudies of DARE's effectiveness were statistically valid. SusanEnnett, one of the lead researchers on the RTI project, concludedthat these eight studies found that DARE's effects on drug use bychildren ranged from "limited to nonexistent." DAREsays that other experts have criticized the methodology of theRTI study and notes that it has not yet completed the peer reviewprocess. DARE claims that of 23 studies of DARE, 20 found theprogram effective in shaping anti-drug attitudes and behavior. At a March 1993 conference about drug education at theUniversity of California at San Diego, social science researchersagreed that after 10 years of operation there is little evidencethat DARE actually reduces drug use among the young. WilliamHanson, one of the early advisers to DARE and currently aprofessor at Wake Forest University, said, "I think theprogram should be entirely scrapped and redeveloped anew." Many Americans, numbed by politicians' harsh rhetoricregarding drug use, may feel that policemen should be able to useany means available to detect drug users. Many DARE instructorshave the best of intentions. But is that an excuse for governmentprograms that endanger the bonds between children and parents?

The Drug Abuse Resistance Education logo -- "D.A.R.E. ToKeep Kids Off Drugs" -- is on bumper stickers, T-shirts,even Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes. Police, taxpayers and businessgive $700 million a year. It's also a favorite of dozens ofmembers of Congress. But a raft of scientific studies says D.A.R.E., the 17-weekcourse taught by uniformed police, doesn't achieve its mainlong-term goal: stopping kids from smoking pot, drinking booze orusing other drugs. "I've got nothing against D.A.R.E., but we need to getsome white light on this issue so we can wisely decide how tospend our money and on what programs," says Tom Colthurst,who recently organized a national conference on drug education atthe University of California-San Diego. But D.A.R.E. executivedirector Glenn Levant calls the studies flawed and notcomprehensive: "Scientists, will tell you bumble bees can'tfly, but we know they can." Levant says a proper national study would cost $3 million-$5million and take seven years to finish. Studies have focused mostly on specific cities, and costseveral hundred thousand dollars each. Experts agree recent research on D.A.R.E. is not perfect: Itis difficult and expensive to measure the behavior of largenumbers of children over several years. But they say the researchis better than studies on other drug programs. "Almost everyresearcher would agree there's enough information to judgeD.A.R.E.," says Rand Corp. researcher Phyllis Ellickson. "It's well-established that D.A.R.E. doesn't work,"says Gilbert Botvin of the Institute for Prevention at CornellUniversity Medical Center. Created in 1983 under the direction of former Los AngelesPolice chief Daryl Gates, D.A.R.E. exploded after the Bushadministration gave it heavy federal subsidies. The program uses lectures, role playing and other techniquesto teach children to avoid drugs. And by all accounts, the kidswho take the course and the police who teach it think it'sterrific. D.A.R.E. "does no harm and by far, nothing butgood," says Scott Mandel, a Los Angeles-area teacher."D.A.R.E. really works," says Mike Miller, Round Rock,Texas, police officer and D.A.R.E. teacher. "Surveys fromacross the nation show kids who take the D.A.R.E. course are muchless likely to use drugs later in life." That's not what most studies show. To investigate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness, researchers lookedat two similar groups of children: One group takes D.A.R.E.; theother does not. Then, researchers followed the children'sbehavior for several years. Since 1987, studies -- most funded bylaw enforcement agencies involved in the program -- have beenconducted at 20 North Carolina schools; 31 Kentucky schools; 11South Carolina schools; 36 Illinois schools; and 11 Canadianschools. The results were similar. The 1991 Kentucky study, the National Institute on Drug Abusereported, found "no statistically significant differencesbetween experimental groups and control groups in the percentageof new users of ... cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol,marijuana." A 1990 study funded by the Canadian government found"D.A.R.E. had no significant effect on the students' use ofany of the substances measured.... They included: tobacco, beer,pop, marijuana, acid, Valium, wine, aspirin, uppers, downers,heroin, crack (cocaine), liquor, candy, glue and PCP." To make sense of the various studies, the Justice Departmenthired the Research Triangle Institute of Durham, N.C., to conducta statistical analysis of all D.A.R.E. research. A preliminary report from the RTI -- analyzing eight studiesinvolving 9,500 children -- says D.A.R.E. has "a limited toessentially non-existent effect" on drug use. D.A.R.E. did have a positive effect on children's knowledgeand attitudes about drugs, the report says. It also added thesocial skills needed to say no to drugs. But even on these measures, D.A.R.E. didn't do as well asother drug programs, including local classes taught by teachersand students. D.A.R.E. America has launched a behind-the-scenes lobbyingcampaign against the final RTI report, due in November. "We're working with D.A.R.E. to ... voice theirconcerns," says Winnie Reed, the National Institute ofJustice official overseeing the study. The pressure has angered some academic researchers."It's repugnant, out of line and very unusual," saysDennis Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Research in Law andJustice at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Rosenbaum -- a D.A.R.E. supporter -- says the group is itsown worst enemy because it has spent so much effort attacking theevaluations, rather than learning from research. Even some state and local D.A.R.E. programs are backing awayfrom D.A.R.E. America's fight. "If we aren't getting the jobdone, we ought to be man enough to try something else," saysTim DeRosa of the Illinois state police and long-time D.A.R.E.activist. Some government officials are aware of D.A.R.E.'sshortcomings. "Research shows that, no, D.A.R.E. hasn't been effectivein reducing drug use," says William Modzeleski, the top drugofficial at the Department of Education. The department has considered asking Congress to repeal a lawrequiring states to give D.A.R.E. a total of $10 million or morea year from federal Drug Free Schools money. But D.A.R.E. continues to have high-level government support. On Sept. 9 -- National D.A.R.E. Day by congressional decree-- D.A.R.E. officials and students lunched with dozens of Congressmembers and met Attorney General Janet Reno. Later, they visitedfirst lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Drug czar Lee Brown, who started the program in Houston whenhe was police chief, remains a booster. "My experience hasbeen positive," Brown says. "The research has pointedin many different directions, but my conclusion is it's better tohave it than not have it. I know first-hand that young people areimpressed by it and look up to the D.A.R.E. officer as a rolemodel." Yet many drug education experts fear that D.A.R.E.'spolitical clout is siphoning drug education money from betterprograms. "D.A.R.E. has a following and sales force that isextremely powerful in fighting for scarce resources," saysUniversity of Michigan researcher Lloyd Johnston, who conductsthe government's survey of teen drug use. "But its growth istotally out of scale to its effectiveness." Johnston and others aren't sure why D.A.R.E. isn't workingbetter. Some think it targets children too young; some think teachersand older students get better results than uniformed police;others say the program relies on psychological theories thatdon't work. Levant thinks critics are just jealous of D.A.R.E.'s success."We're like apple pie," he says. "But I guess youcan always find someone who doesn't like apple pie." -- CliffSchaffer's Home Page WT01-B38-15IA031-000655-B044-340http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/govpubs/usdta.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122114702 text/html 186951HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 11:46:46 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 06:10:46 GMTContent-length: 186732 U.S. DRUG THREAT ASSESSMENT: 1993 U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration U.S. DRUG THREAT ASSESSMENT: 1993 DRUG INTELLIGENCE REPORT Availability, Price, Purity, Use, and Trafficking of Drugs inthe United States SEPTEMBER 1993 DEA-93042 EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT COCAINE Availability/Price/Purity In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated as successful law enforcement operations led to a short-term (3-month) impacton cocaine trafficking from South America. During April through June1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted in anincrease in the kilogram price in many major U.S. metropolitan areas.Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine was readily availableas kilogram prices in virtually all major metropolitan areasreturned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993 indicate thatkilogram prices remain at low levels. Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gramlevels averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992compared to 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. Atemporary decline in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during Julythrough September 1992. However, by year's end, purity at all levelshad once again increased. Use Regarding the use of cocaine, the National Household Surveyon Drug Abuse for 1992 indicated that the number of past-year andpast-month users of cocaine has decreased significantly since 1985.Nevertheless, frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown astatistically significant change during the past several years. According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniorsand 10th graders. Among 8th graders, however, survey data indicatedincreased use of cocaine. Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) showsthat the estimated number of nationwide cocaine-related emergency roomepisodes, which had been increasing at a fairly constant rate from theearly-to- late 1980s, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990.During the latter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodesincreased once again and appears to have stabilized at high levels sincethat time. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the smoking ofcocaine continues to be the predominant route of administration used bypatients admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. Thepercentage of patients who indicated that smoking was their primary methodof administration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to41.4 percent in FY 1992. Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing ofrecently booked male and females arrestees, as reported by the DrugUse Forecasting Program (DUF), remained high in many major U.S.cities in 1992. In fact, rates of cocaine use during the past year were substantially higher than those for opiate and marijuana use. Trafficking Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly citedCentral American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-boundcocaine shipments. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported fromsource countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments aretransported to the United States by land, sea, and air directly or through Mexico. Cocaine traffickers, perceiving enhanced law enforcementactivity along the United States-Mexican border and in the westernCaribbean, have subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into theUnited States. DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers areincreasingly using routes employed four to six years ago. Thisdiversification includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the easternBahamas as well as increased importation into the eastern United States. The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulkquantities of cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.Government drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions reportthe use of cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine amonglegitimate goods. Additionally, cocaine trafficking organizationscontinue to use maritime vessels such as pleasure craft and fishing vesselsto smuggle cocaine from source countries into the United States.Moreover, traffickers utilize low-profile vessels designed to eluderadar detection for smuggling cocaine into Puerto Rico. Several DEA field divisions report cocaine traffickingorganizations have increased their use of airdrop operations. Cocainetraffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in the Caribbean and off thecoast of, as well as within, Central America and Southern Mexico.Additionally, South American cocaine traffickers have acquired several largecargo aircraft, thereby increasing cargo capacity while overcoming thelimited flight range of smaller aircraft. U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexicanborder continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early1992 indicate that cocaine traffickers have decreased the averagesize of cocaine shipments and shifted transportation routes to lesstrafficked ports of entry. For example, in response to an enhanced lawenforcement presence in southern California, traffickers are increasinglyusing U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to transportcocaine to California. Domestic Distribution The primary domestic importation points for cocaine remainArizona, southern California, south Florida, and Texas. The principalcities utilized by Colombian cartels for distributing bulkquantities of cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New YorkCity. Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to usecommercial and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postalservice to transport cocaine. Concealed compartments within vehicles arecommonly cited by DEA field divisions. Moreover, cocaine traffickersusing tractor-trailers frequently secrete cocaine in hiddencompartments and among legitimate produce. Extensive use of commercial trucksto transport cocaine from the Los Angeles metropolitan area todestinations throughout the United States occurred during the past year. The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United Statesremains highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases ofoperation are comprised of multiple cells operating within majormetropolitan areas including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City,Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receiveorders directly from top-level cartel managers in Colombia, and operateindependently of other cells within the same metropolitan area. The operatorsutilize the latest technology, such as computers, pagers, facsimilemachines, etc., in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are oftenbought in bulk quantities and then discarded after being used for severalmonths or less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone interceptefforts. In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in theUnited States is not as compartmentalized as that of the CaliCartel. The drug trafficking groups which comprise the Medellin Cartel employa group decision-making process at the top level as opposed to ahierarchical decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At thelower levels, Medellin-related trafficking groups are not asrestricted as those associated with the Cali Cartel regarding the varietyof distributors with whom they transact business. Hispanic trafficking organizations, particularly Colombianand Mexican, continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking anddistribution within the United States. A greater diversity, however, hasbecome involved in these activities at all levels of the domestictraffic since early 1992. During 1992, four cocaine conversion laboratories were seizedwithin the United States, two in New York City, one in California, andone in Florida. To date in 1993, one cocaine base conversionlaboratory was seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. CRACK COCAINE Availability/Price/Purity Crack continues to be readily available in virtually everymajor city and, to a somewhat lesser extent, many small towns and ruralareas in the United States. Crack manufacturing and distribution havereached a saturation point in the larger metropolitan areas. The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from aslow as $2 to as high as $75, but generally sells for $10 to $50,depending upon the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. Gram prices range from$45 to $150. Ounce-quantities can be purchased for $475 to $2,500. Whenavailable in kilogram quantities, crack prices are comparable to those forkilogram quantities of cocaine hydrochloride, ranging from $17,000 to$35,000. Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories during themid-to-late 1980's revealed that retail purity was consistently high,averaging 80- plus percent. Although current retail purity remainsapproximately at that level, sellers in some areas of the country are sellingpoor- quality crack. Adulterants are increasingly being added toincrease the weight or size of the crack dosage unit. Use The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showedthat the number of lifetime, past-year, and past-month users of crackdeclined significantly from 1991 to 1992. Survey data indicate that314,000 Americans used crack during the past month and over 805,000used it during the past year. According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, lifetime use of crack among seniors declined from 1991 to1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack by this groupremained relatively stable during that period. Nevertheless, overallfrequency of crack use among high school seniors has decreasedsubstantially since 1987. Reporting from DAWN indicates that smoking is the predominantroute of cocaine administration used by patients admitted to DAWNemergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. Trafficking The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by manysmall (up to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking organizations consisting of bands of individuals fromdistinct ethnic groups. The main participants involved in wholesale cracktrafficking are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, and Haitian and Dominican groups. Saturated markets, low prices, violent competition, andeffective law enforcement pressure in major urban areas have forced somecrack trafficking organizations to develop new markets. Theseorganizations are moving to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas acrossthe nation, creating many problems for local law enforcement and civicauthorities. The largest and more advanced organizations are crisscrossingthe nation in this effort, with the Jamaican posses moving generallywestward and the Crips and Bloods expanding eastward. HEROIN Availability/Price/Purity Within the United States, heroin is readily available in allthe major metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 andthe first few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity at theretail level, and increased supplies available from Southwest Asia. (Notethat high- purity heroin has been imported from Colombia in increasingquantities in the past year. This heroin from Colombia, which underwentsignature analysis prior to DEA's development of a South Americanheroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed as having a Southwest Asian (SWA)signature. As a result, it may account in part for both the increasedpurity and quantity of SWA heroin available in the United States.) Data from DEA's Domestic Monitor Program indicate the 1992nationwide average heroin purity at the retail (street) level was 37percent, considerably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percentrecorded in 1991. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highestin the northeastern United States, where a large percentage of thenation's user population lives. According to DEA's Heroin Signature Program (HSP), SoutheastAsian (SEA) heroin was the predominant type of heroin available in theUnited States for the fifth year in a row, accounting for 44 percent of theHSP samples analyzed in FA 1992 and 58 percent of the total netweight of these samples. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFKInternational Airport, are primary entry points for heroin destined for theU.S. market, based on seizures analyzed through the HSP. Thenationwide average net weight of airport seizures was almost 800 gramsand the average purity of heroin seized at these airports was 73percent. Use The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992indicated a decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey datashow that the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who haveused heroin at least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to323,000 in 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number ofpast-month heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. (Estimates ofheroin use from the Household Survey are considered very conservativedue to the probable under-coverage of the population of heroin users.) According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, heroin use increased among high school seniors. The surveyrevealed that 1.2 percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 had usedheroin at least once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of1991, yet still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classesof 1989 and 1990. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofnationwide heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had beenfluctuating somewhat during the past several years, increasedsubstantially from the first to the second half of FY 1992. During that period, thenumber of heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, anincrease of 35 percent. Cities showing substantive increases during thelatter half of FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency roomepisodes included Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection ofheroin continues to be the predominant route of administration usedby patients admitted to emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.However, the percentage of patients who indicated that injection was theirprimary route of administration has decreased from 79.1 percent in FY1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same period, there wasan increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin. Those whosnorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8 percent in FY1992. Rates of opiate use (to include heroin) detected throughurinalysis testing of recently booked male and female arrestees, asreported by the Drug Use Forecasting Program, remained relatively low andstable in 1992 when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Trafficking Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under thecontrol of Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smugglingof SEA heroin into the United States, particularly New York City,and are primarily responsible for smuggling the largest bulkshipments, generally in the multihundred-kilogram range. The largestshipments are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial maritimevessels and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are smuggled in theluggage of airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. In addition to Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers, Nigeriansremain deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigeriantraffickers rely primarily on dispatching large numbers of internal bodycouriers traveling aboard commercial airlines bound for the UnitedStates. As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to recruitother ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, andAmerican citizens, as heroin couriers. Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much lesscentralized than that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard totrafficking groups. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the UnitedStates are highly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they arebased on ethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. As a result, SWAheroin trafficking and distribution are generally more prevalent incities having large populations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon,Pakistan, and Turkey, such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York. Mexican heroin is produced almost exclusively for the U.S.heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican heroin toand within the United States is controlled by organizations composed ofMexican nationals and Mexican Americans. Mexican traffickingorganizations are often made up of family members, lifelong friends, and othertrusted associates. The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in theUnited States during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according toseizure analysis and investigative reporting. At present, Colombianheroin traffickers are attempting to establish distribution outletsin the United States, particularly in the metropolitan areas of thenortheast and, as a result, are smuggling a heroin of very high purity,generally 80-plus percent. According to the El Paso IntelligenceCenter, the number of Colombian couriers who were arrested on commercialairlines carrying heroin into the United States increased from 41 in1991 to over 260 in 1992, with most of these arrests occurring at eitherMiami or New York's international airports. CANNABIS Availability/Price/Potency Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-productof the Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly usedillegal drug in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant anddelta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psychoactivechemical, are controlled substances. According to DEA reporting, 34 percent of a non-sinsemillaplant contains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58percent of a sinsemilla plant contains usable material. The yield of acannabis plant is determined by its diameter and the density of thegrow area. The lower the plant density of the grow area, the higher theyield of usable material. The average plant yield for mature,domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately 1.25 pounds per plant. Theaverage plant yield for mature, domestically grown commercial grademarijuana is approximately three-quarters of one pound per plant. Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the pastdecade. Commercial grade marijuana prices rose from $350 to $600 perpound 10 years ago to $300 to $3,000 per pound in 1992. Sinsemillaprices rose from $1,000 to $2,000 per pound 10 years ago to $650 to$9,600 per pound in 1992. Law enforcement efforts have forced some cultivatorsindoors to avoid detection. Indoor growers cultivate higher potencysinsemilla marijuana, which permits them to charge higher prices.Scarcity caused by law enforcement operations also has increased prices. Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent yearsinclude cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana byusing advanced agronomic techniques. As a result, the average THCcontent of marijuana has risen considerably in the last ten years.Furthermore, record-high THC contents were reported in 1992 and 1993.These record- high THC contents are an indicator of the continuing trend byindoor growers to produce higher potency marijuana. According to the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse, approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana atleast once in their lifetime compared to 61.9 million in 1985.Nevertheless, survey data indicate that the frequency of marijuana use hasdeclined substantially from 1985 to 1992. Overall, past-year,past-month, and past-week use of the drug nave diminished by nearly 45percent during that period According to the National High School Survey on Drug Abuse,the long- term decline in the use of marijuana among 12th graderscontinued in 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of12th graders who believed there was "great risk"associated with regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the downwarduse pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,and past- month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to1992. Moreover, 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to viewmarijuana use as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.Also, the proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved ofmarijuana use declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception mayexplain the increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declinedfrom FY 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. Thelarge majority, approximately 80 percent, of patients treated forcannabis- related hospital emergencies use marijuana with othersubstances. Patients use marijuana most frequently with alcohol andcocaine. Marijuana use detected through urinalysis testing of recentlybooked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug UseForecasting Program, increased significantly in many major U.S. cities in1992. Trafficking Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana availablein the United States during 1992. Colombia ranked as a distantsecond as a foreign source of marijuana. Commencing in early 1992,Jamaican traffickers increased marijuana shipments to the UnitedStates. DEA, in conjunction with Federal and State law enforcementagencies, conducted an aggressive cannabis eradication program in 1992.The effort resulted in the eradication of millions of cannabis plants,the arrest of thousands of violators, the forfeiture of millions ofdollars in assets, and the seizure of several thousand weapons.Moreover, the number of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 (3,849)reached an all-time high. The movement toward indoor production isbelieved due primarily to successful law enforcement efforts to curtailoutdoor cultivation. The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992were Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,respectively. These five States accounted for approximately 44 percent of thecultivated cannabis eradicated during 1992. METHAMPHETAMINE Availability/Price/Purity Methamphetamine is the most prevalent clandestinelymanufactured controlled substance in the United States. Availability isconcentrated primarily in the western and southwestern United States wheremost clandestine methamphetamine manufacture occurs. The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) levelhas remained relatively constant during the past four years. Currently, methamphetamine prices range from $5,000 to $22,000 perpound, $300 to $2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gramlevels averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 35 and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound puritylevels are unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) Use The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showedthat an estimated 5.2 million Americans, 12 years of age and older,have used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Survey datafor prior years are unavailable. Survey data for 1992 are not yetavailable.) Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased ata relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 throughthe first half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itselfduring the latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,there was a 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodesinvolving methamphetamine. DAWN emergency room data also indicate that methamphetamineabuse is concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, SanFrancisco, and Los Angeles. In San Diego and Los Angeles,methamphetamine-related hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter halfof 1992. Illicit Manufacture According to DEA reporting, 288 domestic methamphetaminelaboratories were seized during 1992, accounting for 87 percent of allclandestine dangerous drug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figurerepresents a nine- percent decrease from the previous year's total of 315laboratories seized and continues the downward trend in laboratoryseizures, which began in 1990. The main reason for the decrease in laboratory seizures isthe ongoing enforcement of Federal and State chemical-controllegislation. The 1988 Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) becameeffective in 1989, and enables the Federal Government to regulate listedessential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of dangerousdrugs. Over the past three years, most States have passed legislation similarto the CDTA. Approximately 83 percent of the methamphetamine laboratoryseizures during 1992 occurred in the DEA Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles,Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, Field Divisions. Thisclearly indicates that the manufacture of methamphetamine is stillbased primarily in the western and southwestern United States. Manufacturing/Distribution Organizations Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,and organizations-from independent entrepreneurs and outlawmotorcycle gangs to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations-currentlymanufacture and distribute methamphetamine. (Although late arrivals in the methamphetamine arena, Mexican traffickers are capable ofusing their high-volume production methods and large-scale distributionnetworks to substantially increase the drug's availability in the UnitedStates. For this reason, domestic law enforcement considers the Mexicanpoly-drug traffickers involvement in methamphetamine a significantthreat.) Chemical Diversion Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and Statelevel has made it increasingly difficult for laboratory operators toobtain needed chemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations have beenforced to seek new sources and develop ways in which to circumvent thelaw. LSD Availability/Price/Purity Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) availability has increasedin the last two to three years and it is available in at least retailquantities in virtually every State in the United States. The sources ofsupply for most of the LSD available in the United States are located inthe northern California area. LSD is relatively inexpensive with an average street dosageunit or "hit" costing approximately five dollars, and oftenas little as one or two dollars. Retail-level doses are seen primarily in blotterpaper form. Currently, LSD potency or strength, which ranges from 20 to80 micrograms per dosage unit, is considerably below levelsreported during the 1960s and early 1970s when potency ranged from 100 to 200micrograms (or higher) per dosage unit. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991estimated that 11.8 million Americans 12 years of age or older have used LSD atleast once in their lifetime compared to 8.4 million in 1985. (Surveydata for 1992 are not yet available.) According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, current (monthly) use of LSD among 10th and 12th grade studentsremained relatively stable from 1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders,however, current use of LSD increased during that same time frame from 0.6percent to 0.9 percent. Moreover, past-year use of LSD rose in all threegrade levels from 1991 to 1992. In fact, past-year use of LSD amongseniors in the class of 1992 increased to the highest level since at least1985. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofnationwide LSD- related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY1989 to FY 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erraticsince that period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remainabove those reported during FY 1989. Illicit Manufacture An increasing number of individuals are attempting tomanufacture LSD. Many of these individuals are not associated with thetraditional northern California groups that are believed to have producedmost of the LSD available in the United States since the late 1960s. Distribution At the wholesale production and distribution level, LSDremains tightly controlled by California-based organizations, which haveoperated with relative impunity for over two decades. Mid-leveldistribution networks in the United States are generally comprised of young adultswho have known each other through long years of association and commoninterests. Public and private mail systems appear to be the primarymeans used for the transportation and distribution of retail and wholesalequantities of LSD. A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories havebeen seized since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. PCP Availability/Price Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available invarying degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities. During 1992, PCPin liquid form, the most common form available in the United States,sold for $150 to $1,000 per ounce nationally. The lowest liquid ounceprices were reported in Los Angeles, the source for most of the PCPtrafficked in the United States. PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's and againfrom the mid-to- late 1970's. In 1978, PCP was transferred fromSchedule III to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thusclassifying it as a drug with a high potential for abuse. From the period 1981through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly amongpersons under the age of 21. Around 1986, and continuing through thelate 1980's and early 1990's, demand for PCP was displaced in largemeasure by the widespread availability and use of crack cocaine. Morerecently, however, there are indications that PCP abuse is increasingonce again in a number of cities. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed thatlifetime and past-year PCP use among the U.S. household populationdecreased from 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate anend to this downward use pattern. On the other hand, according to the1992 National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse, PCP use among 12thgraders has declined significantly during the past seven years. Thisdiminished use is believed due in large part to a significant increase among12th graders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCPusage. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan-area PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been decliningat a substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353during the first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY1992, a more than 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased PCPabuse rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, andWashington, D.C. Trafficking and Illicit Manufacture Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCPsupply is manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based streetgangs. While buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP fromCalifornia sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be theprimary means for transporting PCP across the country. Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to threein 1991. No PCP laboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. PCPlaboratory seizures since the mid-1980's have ranged from three to 21per year, totals which are considerably less than the high of 79reported in 1978. COCAINE AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated due to successfuldomestic and international law enforcement operations, which caused ashort-term (3-month) impact on cocaine trafficking from South America.Following a period of adjustment, cocaine traffickers once again foundthe means to facilitate the shipment of multiton quantities of cocaine tothe United States. In 1992, cocaine prices ranged from $11,000 to$42,000 per kilogram nationally in comparison to 1991 prices, whichranged from $11,000 to $40,000 per kilogram nationally. During Aprilthrough June 1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resultedin an increase in the kilogram price in many major U.S.metropolitan areas. Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine wasreadily available as kilogram prices in virtually all majormetropolitan areas returned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993indicate that kilogram prices remain at low levels. Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gramlevels averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. Atemporary decline in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during Julythrough September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levelshad increased once again. Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gramlevels averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. Atemporary decline in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during Julythrough September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levelshad increased once again. USE The 1992 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (seeappendix) showed that the number of past-year and past-month users of cocainehas decreased significantly since the peak year of 1985. During1992, five million Americans 12 years of age and older had used cocainein the past year compared to 12.2 million in 1985. In 1992, 1.3 millionhad used cocaine in the past month compared to 5.8 million in 1985.Nevertheless, frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shownstatistically significant change during the past several years. Among thefive million people who used cocaine in the past year, 642,000 used itonce a week or more in 1992 compared to 625,000 in 1991 and 662,00 in 1990. The survey also showed that approximately 80 percent ofpast-month cocaine users were young adults ages 18 to 34 in 1992. As inthe past, the rate of past-month cocaine use in 1992 was highest amongyoung adults 18 to 25 years old (1.8 percent of the U.S.population) and ages 26 to 34 years (1.4 percent of the U.S. population). Thepast-month cocaine prevalence rate for the 12- to 17-year-old age grouphas decreased from 1.1 percent of the U.S. population in 1988 to0.3 percent in 1992. Similarly, the 18- to 25-year-old age group hasexperienced dramatic decreases in prevalence from 4.5 percent of the U.S.population in 1988 to 1.8 percent in 1992. For the 26- to 34-year-oldage group, the rate has declined from 2.6 percent to 1.4 percent. Therate for persons aged 35 and older has shown variability, but remainedvirtually unchanged since 1988 (0.3 percent of the U.S. population and0.2 percent in 1992). Lastly, the prevalence rate of past-month cocaineuse among the total U.S. population was estimated at 0.6 percent in1992 compared to 1.5 percent in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1991. According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse(see appendix for additional survey information),cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniors. Surveyresults showed 6.1 percent of seniors in the class of 1992 said they hadused cocaine at least once in their lifetime, down from 7.8 percent in theclass of 1991 and down from a peak of 17.3 percent in the class of1985. Among 10th graders, lifetime cocaine use decreased from 4.1 percentin 1991 to 3.3 percent in 1992. Among 8th graders, however, lifetime useof cocaine increased from 2.3 percent in 1991 to 2.9 percent in 1992,and past-year use increased from 1.1 percent to 1.5 percent. Other findings from the survey indicate that fewer 8thgraders in 1992 associated great risk of harm with occasional cocaine orcrack cocaine use than did 8th graders in 1991. There was also a decreasein the proportion of 10th graders saying there is great risk of harmwith occasional cocaine use. Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (seeappendix for further information on DAWN) shows that the estimated numberof nationwide cocaine-related emergency room episodes, which hadbeen increasing at a fairly constant rate from the early-to-late1980's, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990. During thelatter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes increased onceagain and appears to have stabilized at high levels since that time. Anumber of drug epidemiologists and treatment specialists believe apossible explanation for this trend reversal is that many hard-corecocaine users are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.As a result, an increasing number of users are seeking publicmedical assistance.

Nationwide, during the fourth quarter of FY 1992,approximately one in four(28.3%) emergency room drug abuse episodes involvedcocaine. Metropolitan areas having a significantly higher proportionof drug emergencies involving cocaine include: Baltimore (63.5%),Atlanta (56.3%), Philadelphia (54.1%), New Orleans (48.2%), Chicago(46.7%), New York (46.3%), Newark (44.2%), Detroit (41.4%), Miami (39.1%), Washington, D.C. (37.5%), St. Louis (36.0%), and Boston(34.8%). Reporting from DAWN also indicates that smoking continues tobe the predominant route of administration used by patients admittedto DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The percentageof patients who indicated that smoking was their primary method ofadministration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to 41.4 percent inFY 1992. During the same time frame, there was a decrease in thepercentage of patients who injected or snorted cocaine. Those who injectedor snorted cocaine decreased from 22.0 percent and 14.0 percent,respectively, during FY 1989, to 20.2 percent and 11.1 percent,respectively, during FY 1992. Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing ofrecently booked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use Forecasting Program (DUF) (see appendix for furtherinformation on DUF), remained high in many major U.S. cities in 1992. In fact,rates of cocaine seducing the past year were substantially higher thanthose for opiate and marijuana use. Among the highest was Philadelphia,where 63 percent of the sampled population tested positive for cocaineuse. In New York City, the figure was 62 percent; in Atlanta, 58percent; in Chicago, 56 percent; in Miami, 56 percent; in Cleveland, 53percent; and in Los Angeles, 52 percent. Cocaine use among recently bookedfemale arrestees was also high in many cities. In New York City, 72percent of the female arrestees sampled tested positive for the use ofcocaine; in Philadelphia, 67 percent; in Cleveland, 66 percent; inWashington, D.C., 64 percent; in Kansas City, 62 percent; in St. Louis, 62percent; and in Detroit, 62 percent. TRAFFICKING General Overview The primary domestic importation points for cocaine destinedfor U.S. consumption remain Arizona, southern California, southFlorida, and Texas. The principal cities utilized by Colombian cartels for distribution of multi-hundred or multi-thousand kilogramquantities of cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.While the Medellin Cartel remains a significant supplier of cocaine tothe major U.S. distribution cities, the Cali Cartel continues tocontrol most of the cocaine brought into New York City, Miami, and LosAngeles. Staging sites in the southwestern United States, where somestockpiling occurs while awaiting transportation, are supplied with cocaine byMexican smugglers using couriers or tractor-trailers, other vehicles,and commercial cargo. Organized groups of Cubans, Dominicans,Jamaicans, Mexicans, and African-American gangs provide retail-leveldistribution of the drug in major U.S. cities. In addition, both theMedellin and Cali Cartels maintain operational headquarters in major U.S.cities to control wholesale distribution networks. During the lastyear, as in the past, traffickers shifted or diversified trafficking routesfollowing major seizures. Traffickers appear to be only temporarilyaffected by the interdiction of pipelines and are taking an average of 10to 14 days to reestablish operations. This suggests continued use ofimaginative concealment methods and the use or maintenance ofmultiple-delivery pipelines and systems to avoid law enforcement. Routes Cocaine traffickers perceiving enhanced law enforcementactivity along the United States-Mexican border and in the western Caribbeanhave subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into theUnited States. DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers areincreasingly using routes employed four to six years ago. Thisdiversification includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the easternBahamas as well as increased importation into the eastern United States.This trend was highlighted by the July 1992 seizure of 5.2 metric tonsof cocaine in Panama which was destined for Baltimore. Moreover, DEAMiami reports that the Medellin Cartel has established a significantpresence in The Bahamas, utilizing the area as a transit point for cocaine enroute to south Florida. Increased cocaine trafficking through the eastern Caribbeanincludes greater use of Puerto Rico, which appears to be a primarytarget of cocaine traffickers who use it as a transshipment point forcocaine destined for the United States, Canada, and Europe. While thesmuggling of cocaine by general aviation aircraft into Puerto Ricocontinues, maritime smuggling is the primary method of transportingcocaine to the island. The appeal of Puerto Rico as a cocaine transit pointis enhanced by two factors: the first is the proximity of Puerto Rico toSouth America, and the second is that once cocaine is successfullysmuggled into Puerto Rico, it can be shipped to the continental UnitedStates with little likelihood of U.S. Customs screening. Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly citedCentral American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-boundcocaine shipments. This was highlighted by the April 1992 seizure of6.7 metric tons of cocaine in Miami transshipped through Guatemala andby the July 1992 seizure in Panama noted previously. During the pastyear, every Central American country was cited as a transshipment pointfor U.S.- boundcocaine. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported fromsource countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments aretransported to the United States by land, sea, and air directly or throughMexico. U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexicanborder continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early1992 indicate that cocaine traffickers are increasinglytransporting smaller (10 to 50 kilograms) cocaine shipments across less traffickedports of entry such as Calexico and Tecate, as opposed to transportinglarge (multihundred kilogram) cocaine shipments across morefrequently used border crossing points such as San Ysidro. Additionally, inresponse to law enforcement in southern California, traffickersincreasingly use U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to smugglecocaine to California. Methods of Transportation and Concealment Maritime Transportation The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulkquantities of cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.Government drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions reportthe use of cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine amonglegitimate goods. Additionally, cocaine is sometimes hidden in the wallsand support beams of cargo containers as well as in, or attachedto, the vessels themselves. DEA reporting indicates an increaseddemand by cocaine traffickers for cargo ships in order to transportbulk quantities of U.S.-bound cocaine. Furthermore, U.S. Customsreports the large volume of cargo arriving at domestic ports, coupledwith the U.S. Customs capability of inspecting only a small portion of thiscargo, continue to be factors operating in favor of smugglingorganizations. The use of low-profile vessels by cocaine traffickers hasmade maritime interdiction extremely difficult off the coast of PuertoRico. DEA reporting indicates these vessels, fabricated of wood and/orfiberglass and measuring up to only 40 feet in length, are difficult tovisually detect since their coloring blends with the ocean. Moreover,their profiles of only one to two feet above the water are notalways detectable by radar. Investigative reporting indicates thesevessels transport up to one metric ton of cocaine and sail directlyfrom Colombia to Puerto Rico without being detected. Cocaine trafficking organizations also rely heavily on theuse of noncommercial maritime vessels. Pleasure craft and fishingvessels are used to smuggle cocaine from source countries into the UnitedStates. Pleasure craft carrying cocaine enter U.S. waters by blendingin with weekend "traffic "along the southeastern coastwhere weekend vessel activity is heavy. Fishing vessels are also used to carrycocaine directly into the United States as well as to transfercocaine to other vessels off the coast. Air Transportation DEA San Diego, Los Angeles, and Miami report cocainetrafficking organizations have increased their use of airdrop operations.Cocaine traffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in theCaribbean and off the coast of, as well as within, Central America and southernMexico. A combination of law enforcement successes, including thoseof the United States-Mexican Northern Border Response Force, andconflicts between trafficking organizations for control of clandestineairstrips have contributed to trafficker avoidance of landing aircraftin northern Mexico. Consequently, a number of smuggling organizations,including traffickers associated with the Cali Cartel, feel it is lessrisky to airdrop cocaine shipments to ground or maritime crews inCentral America or the Caribbean than to land aircraft in northern Mexico. South American cocaine traffickers have recently acquiredseveral large cargo aircraft for the transport of cocaine, therebyincreasing cargo capacity while overcoming the limited flight range of smalleraircraft. Moreover, cocaine traffickers within The Bahamas andelsewhere in the Caribbean continue to use smaller aircraft as decoys todivert law enforcement interdiction assets from actual smugglingoperations being conducted in a different locale. Land Transportation Cocaine couriers employ several methods to counter traffickerprofiles at or near the United States-Mexican border; these methodsinclude traveling in family-type groups with women and children toavoid suspicion at checkpoints, hiring non-Mexicans to transportcocaine from United States-Mexican border areas into Los Angeles, andrecruiting Anglo drivers and females to transport cocaine shipments. Kilogram bricks continue to be the predominant form ofpackaged cocaine smuggled into the United States. During the past year, DEAfield divisions have frequently cited rubber/waterproofed packagingof cocaine. Additionally, seizures of multihundred kilograms ofcocaine concealed in U-Haul cardboard boxes and 55-gallon drumsincreased. Tile- shaped cocaine (2"x 8"x 8"), vacuum-packed inmetallic-type material, has also been reported. DEA and the U.S. Customs Service reported traffickers smuggleliquefied cocaine into the United States concealed in water tanks ofmobile homes and recreational vehicles. Traffickers also have labeled55-gallon drums of liquid cocaine to reflect the climatic conditions of thelocale where the drums are shipped, i.e., a shipment to Chicago in thewinter is labeled "antifreeze." During May 1992, U.S. Customsin Houston made the first seizure of liquid cocaine at Houston IntercontinentalAirport from an Ecuadorian national enroute to New York City. DEA Miamireported small amounts of liquid cocaine are sometimes concealedwithin liquor bottles. Moreover, DEA San Diego and Baltimore reportedtraffickers are smuggling liquid cocaine into their areas of jurisdiction. Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to usecommercial and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postalservice to ship cocaine. The use of concealed compartments within vehicles iscommonly cited by DEA field divisions. During the past year, severalcocaine seizures involved multiple concealment sites within the samevehicle, a smuggling technique associated with marijuana trafficking.Popular vehicles among traffickers for transporting cocaine includeNissan vehicles and mini-vans. Additionally, some transportationorganizations use rental vehicles to circumvent vehicle seizures. Cocaine traffickers who use tractor-trailers employ severalmethods to circumvent law enforcement. There is extensive use ofelaborate hidden compartments to secrete cocaine within tractor-trailers.Additionally, cocaine is often hidden among legitimate produce such asonions and watermelons. On the West Coast, tractor-trailers obtainproduce in the San Joaquin Valley to conceal cocaine destined for theMidwest and East Coast cities. Concealment of cocaine in tractor-trailers alsoincludes the use of compartments in air-conditioning units, radiators,and batteries, containers welded in tire rims, and false walls.In the Southwest, large commercial vehicles and trucks are a primarymethod for transporting cocaine. An increase has been noted in the useof tractor- trailers to transport bulk cocaine shipments into the Chicagoarea. DEA reports truckers transporting cocaine sealed in odor-reducingwax among legitimate cargo to avoid detection at checkpoints andscales. Extensive use of commercial trucks to transport cocaine from the LosAngeles metropolitan area to destinations throughout the UnitedStates has occurred during the past year. In addition, traffickerscontinue to seek opportunities to recruit U.S. port officials to facilitatelarge cocaine shipments into the United States from Mexico bytractor-trailer. Domestic Distribution The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United Statesremains highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases ofoperation are comprised of multiple cells operating within majormetropolitan areas to include Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York,Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receive ordersdirectly from top-level cartel managers in Colombia and operateindependently of other cells within the same metropolitan area. Cell operatorsutilize the latest technology, such as computers, pagers, and facsimilemachines, in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often boughtin bulk quantities and discarded after being used for several monthsor less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept efforts. In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in theUnited States is not as compartmentalized as that of the CaliCartel. The drug trafficking groups, which comprise the Medellin Cartel,employ a group decision-making process at the top level as opposed to thehierarchical decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At thelower levels, trafficking groups can transact business with lessrestrictions on their choice of business associates. Peruvian traffickers reportedly ship cocaine concealed inmaritime vessels and aircraft to the United States and distribute itin the Houston area independent of Colombian organizations. The useof Peru as a source area for multiton shipments of cocaine was evidencedduring January 1992 by the seizure of five metric tons of cocaineaboard a maritime vessel. The vessel originated in Peru and wasreportedly destined for the United States and Canada when it wasinterdicted in the Caribbean. Hispanic organizations, particularly Colombian and Mexican,continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and distributionwithin the United States. However, since early 1992, diverse ethnicgroups, including those of Middle Eastern, East European, CentralAsian, and East Asian descent, have become involved in these activitiesat all levels of the domestic traffic. Cocaine violators in urban areas, such as Boston and Atlanta,have expanded their distribution networks into rural areas, whichhave limited law enforcement resources, thereby reducing the riskof investigation and arrest. MISCELLANEOUS During 1992, the exchange of cocaine for heroin was reportedin Boston, Calexico, New York City, and San Diego. The frequency of suchexchanges appears to be increasing and involves foreign and domesticheroin traffickers seeking cocaine sources in the United States. Inaddition, during the past year, Southwest Asian heroin traffickingorganizations sent heroin and opium via the international mail system toaffiliates in the United States who then purchased cocaine for export toEurope. In 1992, four cocaine base conversion laboratories wereseized within the United States; two in New York City, one in Californiaand one in Florida. One of the laboratories seized in New York City was operational. This represented the first functioning cocainelaboratory seized in that city since 1987. Additionally, the operationalNew York City laboratory used a vapor eliminating device. The device,the first encountered by DEA that employed dry ice, allowed thelaboratory to function in a densely populated area without the strongchemical odors normally associated with clandestine cocaine conversionlaboratories. To date in 1993, only one cocaine base conversion laboratory hasbeen seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. Drug traffickers use high-tech equipment, includingnight-vision goggles and radios with scramblers, as well as military hardwareincluding assault rifles, hand grenades, and bulletproof vests.Trafficking organizations use scouts with radios to monitor lawenforcement activities along the United States-Mexican border. A Texascocaine organization recently attempted to purchase hand-held radiosfor surveillance and body armor for their street-level dealers.Traffickers have become more sophisticated in the use of electronicsincluding scanners with police frequencies. Countermeasures employed by cocaine traffickers against U.S.law enforcement include the use of counter-surveillance and paidinformants. Some traffickers study law enforcement methods of operationby reviewing evidence documents during court proceedings. Reportedly,defense attorneys employed by traffickers obtain investigativedocuments through the "right of the discovery process" and thentransmit by facsimile informational reports to Colombia. CRACK COCAINE AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY The simplicity of the crack conversion process allows anyperson with access to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) to be a potentialsource of crack. Because cocaine HCl is plentiful and cheap and can beobtained in virtually every area of the country, crack is, therefore,widely available. Crack is reported by drug epidemiologists and treatmentprofessionals to be the illegal drug of choice in many U.S. cities. Notableexceptions include cities and towns along the southwest border, wheredrug traffickers are primarily concerned with transshipping thelarge amounts of cocaine HCl, marijuana, and heroin that are smuggled intothe United States, and certain areas within several north-central andnortheastern States that lack large ethnic minority communities,traditional strongholds for crack distribution and abuse. Nonetheless,three Haitian crack sellers were recently arrested in Portland, Maine,indicating that no region is immune to crack trafficking. Crack distribution and use appear to have reached thesaturation point in large urban areas throughout the country. Intensivecompetition in the mid-to-late 1980's inundated the largest consumer poolswith crack. As a result, a number of crack trafficking groups haverelocated or extended their operations to smaller cities, towns, and ruralareas; the primary motivation for this is profit. Simply put, a rock orvial of crack that sells for $5 to $10 in a large, well-populatedarea will command a significantly higher price, usually $25 to $40 in asmaller, less populated area. The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from aslow as $2 to as high as $75 but it generally sells for $10 to $50,depending upon the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. In general, the largercities have the lowest retail prices. Reporting from New York Cityindicates a dosage unit of crack sells for as low as two dollars, while asingle puff on a crack pipe can be obtained for as little as 75cents. Reporting from Philadelphia and Detroit indicates that crackcan be purchased for as low as $2.50 and $3.00 per dosage unit,respectively. Prices for gram quantities of crack generally range from $45to $150 nationally. At the ounce and kilogram level, crack prices arecomparable to cocaine HCl prices and usually range from $475 to $2,500per ounce and from $17,000 to $35,000 per kilogram. In the mid-to-late 1980's, a readily available supply ofinexpensive and high quality crack at the retail level virtually eliminatedany need for users to perform the crack conversion process themselves.Indeed, quality control was a major factor in marketing the drug.Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories revealed that purity wasconsistently high during that period, averaging 80-plus percent. Although retail purity remains high, averaging almost 83percent in 1992, sellers in some areas of the country, such as New York,Los Angeles, and several cities in the Southeast, are sellingpoor-quality crack, cut with adulterants such as lidocaine and procaine.These adulterants increase the weight or the size of the crack and,therefore, the profits. Many retailers will sell recently prepared crackthat has not been dried thoroughly and is still wet from theconversion process. This practice is most profitable when dealing in wholesalequantities where transactions are strictly determined by weight. At thedosage unit or retail level, where the size of the rock is of greaterconcern, procaine serves to increase the dimensions of the rock byadding holes or pockets of air, giving rise to the street term"blow-up." Obviously, the smaller the amount of pure cocaine present in the rock,the less intense euphoric reaction the user will experience. Inaddition, a limited number of retailers are selling bogus or"beat" crack to unfamiliar customers because their regular customers consumevirtually the entire supply. Substitutes include soap, chalk, plaster,peanuts, popcorn, and candle wax, which is known on the street as"perp." Practices such as these are creating an increasing number of dissatisfied and wary customers. An almost inexhaustiblesupply of cheap, high-purity cocaine HCl, combined with a relativelysimple and safe production process, makes home conversion by the crackuser more appealing than the risk of purchasing and smoking low-qualityor sham crack. In fact, sellers in some northeastern cities sell twoqualities of cocaine HCl, a high-purity powder for users who willperform the conversion to crack themselves, and a low-purity powder foringestion through snorting only. It has also been reported that usersin Chicago prefer the freebase method of conversion in the belief thatthis method yields a higher purity product than the crack conversionprocess. USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showedthat the number of lifetime, past-year and past-month users of crackdeclined significantly from 1991 to 1992. The highest percentages ofcrack use were among those who were disproportionately represented in socioeconomic groups that have historically faced increasedhealth risks, including African-Americans, the unemployed, andhigh-school dropouts, as well as young adults aged 18 to 34. According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, lifetime use of crack among high school seniors declined from1991 to 1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crackby this group remained relatively stable during that period.Nevertheless, overall frequency of crack use among high school seniors hasdecreased substantially since 1987. Of particular concern is the slight rise in frequency ofcrack use among 8th graders. From 1991 to 1992, survey data indicate that anincreasing number of 8th grade students had used crack during theirlifetime as well as on a yearly and monthly basis. Also, fewer 8thgraders in 1992 associated great risk of harm with occasional crack use thandid 8th graders in 1991. TRAFFICKING Trafficking/Distribution Levels Crack trafficking is conducted at three broad levels, namely,wholesale trafficking, mid-level distribution, and retail selling. Itmust be emphasized that these classifications are not concrete andthe activities of a specific violator or group may vary. Forexample, as will be explained later, the functions of a Jamaican possemay encompass all three levels within the same organization. Wholesale Trafficking: Crack traffickers purchase cocaine HClin kilogram or multikilogram allotments from traditional cocaineHCl sources, including Colombians and Mexicans. The wholesaletraffickers will either package the cocaine HCl into ounce quantities orconvert it into crack themselves and then divide it into ounces for saleat the next level. Wholesalers usually represent large groups thatare responsible for the majority of the interstate transportationof crack and cocaine HCl intended for crack conversion. The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by manysmall (up to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking organizations consisting of bands of individuals fromdistinct ethnic groups. The main participants involved in wholesale cracktrafficking are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, andHaitian and Dominican groups. Without exception, each of these groupsstarted out as poly-drug traffickers, dealing primarily in marijuana andcocaine HCl, and continue to sell these drugs. Similarly, street-levelsellers often sell retail units of other drugs in addition to crack. Mid-level Distribution: Distributors further divide theounces of crack into dosage units for sale at the retail level. If theypurchase cocaine HCl, they can perform the conversion process easilythemselves. These distributors often operate crack houses or managestreet-corner sales locations and supervise up to 20 individual sellers.Mid-level distributors can be either members of larger groups orindependent operators. Retail-level Sales: Sellers carry dosage units of cracktotaling no more than a few grams at any one time. Workers in crack houseswill sell dosage units from the one or two ounces that are delivered bythe mid- level distributors. Retailers are typically young males whoare unemployed or destitute and many of them are crack addictsthemselves. At the retail level, crack is sold by countless individualsellers, usually in inner-city sections of large metropolitan areas.Upon arrest, these retailers are almost immediately replaced. While cracksellers and users are present in virtually every ethnic community andeconomic group, the majority are from low-income, urbanAfrican-American and Hispanic neighborhoods. Trafficking Networks Over the past few years, crack trafficking has expanded fromthe large urban centers to smaller cities, towns, and rural areasacross the United States. Major crack trafficking groups, such as theCrips, the Bloods, and Jamaicans, are successfully extending theirnetworks from large cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, and NewYork City, to street corners and dwellings in virtually every Stateincluding Alaska and Hawaii. This is occurring primarily for tworeasons. First, these groups are attempting to enlarge their customer poolsand increase their potential profits; second, the threat of disruption bylaw enforcement pressure or aggressive competition has generatedthe search for less hostile environments. Jamaican posses are making advances away from the traditional strongholds of Miami and New York City, targeting new crackmarkets. Areas witnessing increased posse activity include Dallas andKansas City; Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia; and theFlorida Panhandle. Jamaican posses reportedly have been distributingcrack as far westward as south-central Los Angeles. In a similarmanner, the Crips and the Bloods or their affiliates have been movingeastward into cities such as Birmingham, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, andPhoenix, as well as into West Coast cities such as Seattle. Recentreports in the media suggest that these gangs are also moving into New YorkCity. In effect, posses and gangs have crisscrossed the nation withcrack- trafficking networks. When crack first became available in New York City, it wassold by small local bands of independent street sellers. Quite soon,however, these sellers were incorporated into the lowest level of largeorganized networks. The most successful groups increased theirmembership by adopting other gangs through strong-armed persuasion oreliminated their leadership altogether. As the groups grew larger, theyattracted more law enforcement attention. In the late 1980's, New YorkCity's two largest crack distribution organizations, Lido and BasedBalls, were successfully dismantled by Federal, State, and local lawenforcement agencies. Currently, the larger groups in the United States are tryingto insulate themselves from law enforcement detection by scaling down and streamlining their crack production and sales operations. Thetedious and labor-intensive process of shaving off dosage unit sizerocks of crack from larger chunks and packaging them in countless tinyplastic bags or vials in cumbersome factory style operations is illsuited to the clandestine nature of drug distribution. Recentdisruption of a large number of organizations by law enforcement has createda distribution and sales system composed of many small groupsoperating in a limited number of neighborhoods. Trafficking Groups The major crack trafficking organizations consist of streetgangs, such as the Crips and the Bloods, and groups of Jamaicans,Haitians, and Dominicans. They all use similar trafficking and distributiontechniques and are engaged in interstate and intrastate transportationof wholesale amounts of crack and cocaine HCl. They also have theknowledge, experience, drug connections, manpower, and firepower to plytheir trade over long distances. The majority of the information contained in this section wasobtained from the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime LawEnforcement Network Fifth Annual Conferences on International CaribbeanOrganized Crime held June 15-19, 1992, and June 29 through July 2,1993, in Baltimore. Jamaicans: One of the most effective crack trafficking groupsin the United States is the Jamaican posse. Posses consist of gangsof Jamaican immigrants, often illegal aliens, that are involved in manycriminal activities other than drug trafficking, including robbery,fraud, and money laundering. From these activities, posses receive anestimated one billion dollars annually drug proceeds. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) estimatesthat, currently, there are approximately 35 posses operating in theUnited States with total membership numbering at least 11,000. Mostposses maintain some type of link to the larger, more establishedgroups or parent posses in New York City or Miami, such as the Shower,Spangler, Dunkirk, and Jungle posses. New York City is generallyconsidered to be the hub of Jamaican posse activity. Jamaican posses are extremely violent, competitive, andindividualistic. As a result, the structure of Jamaican organized crime willremain fragmented, lacking disciplined organizations and allianceswhich are common characteristics of traditional organized crime. Also,successful prosecution by Federal authorities over the past severalyears has disrupted much of the organization and control of the mostprominent posses that operated nationwide. As a result of thesefactors, a large number of newly named splinter groups have evolved under thedirection of new posse bosses. Jamaican posses are attempting to insulate themselves fromlaw enforcement pressure and violent competition by distancingthemselves from the often dangerous day-to-day operation of crack housesand by distributing larger amounts of cocaine, in effect simplysupplying those same crack houses and street level distribution sites.Jamaicans are also initiating alliances with members of other ethnic drugtrafficking groups. For example, Jamaicans have been attempting toestablish connections with Colombian and Mexican wholesale suppliers ofcocaine in order to eliminate middlemen and related additional costs.Also, Jamaicans have been employing other minorities such asHaitians because they are willing to work for less in the lower levels of the distribution chain. Jamaicans also are distributing other illegal drugs such asheroin and marijuana; a few have been able to realize higher profitsfrom heroin distribution. Moreover, some Jamaicans have returned totrafficking marijuana because the Federal penalties for marijuanatrafficking are less severe than those for crack and cocaine HCl, yet theprofit potential is almost as high. A common method of operation by Jamaican posses is termed"drip" trafficking. In an attempt to escape law enforcement effortsand to protect against seizure, loss, or theft by competitors,Jamaican posses do not stockpile large amounts of drugs and money; rather,they move smaller quantities more often and more quickly. In their efforts to expand crack sales and increase profits,Jamaican posses are branching out to other cities and rural areas toestablish new drug markets where competition from rival gangs and lawenforcement activity is lessened. This migration has been observed inDallas, Denver, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and northern Florida. The Southwest border area has seen a significant influx ofJamaican traffickers during the last five years because cocaine HCland marijuana are much cheaper to purchase in that region of the country.As a result, they have set up storefronts, usually garages, hair salons,or music stores, to mask distribution outlets and to launder proceeds.Since weapons can be purchased for less in Texas than in othersouthern States, Jamaicans often use females to make straw purchasesof guns which are then sent to New York and other cities in theNortheast. Drugs, proceeds, and weapons are all shipped to differentlocations using a variety of means. Commercial airlines have proven tobe an effective method of transportation. When interdiction effortsat particular airports become prohibitive, couriers drive toairports in other cities to elude law enforcement. Buses, trains, andrental vehicles are also popular methods of shipment. Falsecompartments are frequently built into vehicles for transportation of drugs,money, and weapons. Additionally, mail services such as United ParcelService and Federal Express are used to ship drugs and profits for theJamaican posses. Dominicans: While some official estimates of the number ofDominicans living in New York City are as low as 350,000, ATF claims theactual number, including illegal aliens, may be closer to 1,000,000. The hierarchy of Dominican gangs is slightly different thanthat of the Jamaicans in that the Dominican bosses usually run theirnetworks from the Dominican Republic directly, traveling to and from theUnited States as needed. Dominican gangs are always armed and employ modernequipment and techniques in their daily operations, includingwalkie-talkies, "kel" transmitting devices, booby traps (to protectdrugs and money from police action as well as from theft by competitors), and useof counter- surveillance, which they practiced in the Dominican Republicin order to elude the police. Like the Jamaican posses, the Dominican traffickers are veryviolent and competitive and, as a result, do not easily form tightlystructured and disciplined organizations. Although some reports suggest theemergence of a Dominican drug cartel, no evidence has been broughtforth to verify the existence of an organization capable of orchestratinglarge-scale importation and trafficking activities. However, thiseventuality should not be dismissed because, since the early 1980's, theDominican Republic has been used by Colombians as a refueling and transshipmentpoint for drugs destined for the United States and cooperation betweenColombian and Dominican traffickers has flourished. Dominicans have made gains in establishing money-launderingoperations and front companies, most commonly travel agencies and checkcashing businesses. At times, they purchase businesses outright ormake deals with the owners or proprietors to carry out their orders. Itis not known to what extent drug proceeds are sent directly to theDominican Republic. Overall money transfers are estimated to beapproximately $800 million per year. Haitians: Haitian drug traffickers in the United States havebeen able to strengthen their status in the drug trade through twosignificant events. First, an influx of Haitian immigrants since theearly 1970's has provided a large pool of recruits for the drug trade.Second, by the late 1980's, Haiti had become an important way station forcocaine HCl shipped into the United States by the Colombian cartels. At present, Haitian crack traffickers operate in a limitednumber of major cities, primarily Miami and New York, and have notextended their operations as the Jamaicans have. Many Haitian sellers aremoving their way up the distribution hierarchy by working at the lowerlevels of crack operations run by other ethnic groups. Street Gangs: Street gangs, operating under the umbrellanames of the Crips and the Bloods, extended their networks from thestreets of Los Angeles to many major American cities in the last half of the1980's. Sales of crack and cocaine HCl brought them power andinfluence during that time. Gang members learned quickly that the cheapcocaine available in Los Angeles could be sold as cocaine HCl or crack at greatprofit in other parts of the country. Los Angeles street gangs are very loosely organized in smallunits or "sets" falling under the auspices of the twopredominant gangs, the Crips and the Bloods. The general street gang structurebegins with diverse groups of gang members acting as street-level sellersconducting transactions in amounts up to several grams or even ounces onthe street or in rock houses. A few of these sellers rise to becomemid-level distributors, dealing in amounts of up to one kilogram ormore and working between the street-level sellers and the majortraffickers. Capable of brokering multimillion dollar deals, the majortraffickers, often referred to as "high rollers," are notusually visible gang members and often have direct contacts with Colombianwholesale cocaine suppliers. Initially, gangs sold marijuana and PCP prior to enteringinto cocaine HCl and crack trafficking, distribution, and sales.Eventually, they developed a mode of operation that closely resembles theJamaican model. Typically, gang members travel to and establish crackoperations in smaller cities and towns where there is little policepressure and competition from rivals. They often gain entry into acommunity by visiting or living with friends or relatives. In addition tosecuring lodgings, these visits provide access to young people,potential recruits and customers, and help them attain legitimacy andacceptance within the community. Soon, the gang members will seek out inmany instances low-income single mothers and offer them $100 a dayto use their apartment or house as a crack conversion ordistribution site. A common marketing technique known as "double up" isused by these street gangs to attract new customers and involves the sale of twodosage units of crack for the price of one. Sales Locations With few exceptions, crack distribution takes place either inurban or suburban dwellings of all types or at inner-city streetcorner locations. Virtually every large city in America has seen theemergence of both of these retail sales locations. The prevalence ofone site over the other may be directly linked to two factors. First, weather plays a major role in determining the chosenmethod of crack distribution. For example, in cities with cold winters,sellers will set up crack houses to escape the elements themselvesand to offer customers more hospitable accommodations. In summer, theoperation may be moved outdoors where increased pedestrian traffic providesthe necessary cover for street corner sales. Second, the presence of significant law enforcement activitymay force street corner retailers to set up indoor crack facilities toevade detection. Conversely, if gangs are suffering substantiallosses due to police raids on established crack houses, they may dispatchsellers to specific, pre-designated street corner sales locations. The sale of crack at street corner locations is considered tobe ideal because it provides sellers many avenues of escape when facedwith police pressure. If a particular street becomes too"hot" with police activity, the retailers merely move a few blocks away andcontinue selling. Moreover, tactics can be employed to mask streetcorner sales of crack. In New York City, crack distributors have beenknown to dispatch a seller along with up to 10 people dressed exactlyalike to work a street corner in an attempt to disrupt surveillanceefforts. In addition, street corner operations do not requireexpenditures for rent and utilities, as is the case with crack houses. HEROIN AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY Within the United States, heroin is readily available in allmajor metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 andthe first few months of 1993, there was an increase in puritynationwide at the retail level and increased supplies available from SouthwestAsia. (It should be noted that high purity heroin has been importedfrom Colombia in increasing quantities in the past year. This heroin fromColombia, which underwent signature analysis prior to DEA's developmentof a South American heroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed ashaving a Southwest Asian (SWA) signature. As a result, it may accountin part for both the increased purity and quantity of SWA heroin in theUnited States.) At present, street-level purity, the key indicatorof availability, is at high levels, particularly in thenortheastern metropolitan areas. Heroin from every major source area is available in theUnited States, which is the most lucrative wholesale and retail level heroinmarket in the world. The origin of heroin smuggled into the UnitedStates and the proportion from each source area is tracked by DEA's HeroinSignature Program (HSP). Each year an in-depth chemical analysis isperformed on 600 to 800 samples taken from heroin seizures and purchasesmade in the United States. The samples selected for signature analysisinclude all DEA seizures at U.S. points of entry and otherseizures/purchases selected at random from DEA, in addition to Federal Bureau of Investigation, and U.S. Customs Service seizures andpurchases. As a result of signature analysis, DEA chemists are able toassociate the heroin sample with a heroin manufacturing process unique to aparticular geographic source area. The proportion of samples associatedwith each geographic area is measured both in terms of the number ofsamples from each geographic source area and, since 1989, the net weightof the heroin samples from each area. In 1991, Southeast Asia (SEA) was the prevalent source areafor heroin in the United States for the fourth year in a row, accountingfor 58 percent of the heroin samples analyzed through the HSP. SWAheroin and Mexican source heroin accounted for half of the remainingsamples with 21 percent apiece. In 1992, the results of the HSP wereskewed by the introduction of a number of samples of purported Colombianheroin. Because a specific signature for heroin from Colombia was notavailable then, most heroin samples of alleged Colombian origin areanalyzed as having a Southwest Asian signature. With this in mind,preliminary HSP figures for 1992 reflect that 44 percent of the heroinsamples analyzed were from Southeast Asia, 39 percent from Southwest Asia orColombia, and the remaining 17 percent from Mexico. Signature analysis also reveals that SEA heroin accounted for88 percent of the total net weight of the heroin samples analyzed in1991, and 58 percent in 1992. SWA heroin (including heroin from Colombia)accounted for nine and 32 percent of the total net weight of the heroinsamples analyzed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Mexican heroinaccounted for three percent of the total net weight in 1991 and 10 percentin 1992. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK InternationalAirport, are primary entry points for heroin shipments destined for theU.S. market. The HSP shows that 91 percent (454 out of 498) of the heroinseizures that took place at the U.S. border and points of entry during1992 occurred at airports, and that over 75 percent of the airportseizures occurred at New York's JFK International Airport. Thenationwide average net weight airport seizure was almost 800 grams and theaverage purity of the heroin seized at these airports was 73 percent. Nationally, in 1992, a kilogram of SEA heroin sold for$90,000 to $250,000. In the northeastern United States, SEA heroin isalso commonly sold in units (700 grams), which sell for $90,000 to$115,000. The price for SWA heroin ranged from $80,000 to $200,000 per kilogram.Wholesale level prices for Mexican heroin were the lowest of any typeof heroin and ranged from $50,000 to $150,000. The wide range in theprice of a kilogram reflects several variables including buyer/sellerrelationship, quantity purchased, purchase frequency, purity, andtransportation costs. Numerous and diverse foreign sources of supply alsoaccount for the wide variances. At the mid-level of the traffic, where dealers sellquantities ranging from an ounce to multiounces, SEA heroin and SWA heroin soldfor $5,500 to $12,000 per ounce. Mexican black tar heroin sold forbetween $1,800 and $4,000 per ounce, and Mexican brown powder heroin pricesranged from $ 1,000 to $ 1,800 per ounce. Domestic prices for Colombian-source heroin are generallycompatible with the prices for heroin from Southeast and Southwest Asia.Kilogram prices quoted in undercover negotiations range up to $150,000and vary depending on final point of delivery. In actual undercoverpurchases of smaller amounts, one-eighth of a kilogram cost $23,500,one-fourth of a kilogram cost $42,500, and one-half kilogram sold for$62,250. Heroin is sold at the retail level in the United States atprices ranging from $10 to $50 and in quantities ranging from 10 to50 milligrams. The retail price remains relatively constant atthis level because retail-level purity, rather than retail-level price,is adjusted by the distributors to account for availability and tomanipulate profit margins. The HSP provides purity information on heroin shipmentssmuggled into the United States at the importation, or wholesale, level.For all types of heroin at this level, the nationwide average purity in1992 was 64 percent. SWA heroin was the purest form available at thewholesale level, averaging 72 percent. SEA heroin nationwide averagedslightly lower at 68 percent, while Mexican heroin averaged 33percent. At the retail level, purity is tracked by DEA's DomesticMonitor Program (DMP), a heroin purchase program designed to provide price,purity, and geographic source area data on heroin being distributed onthe streets of U.S. cities. The program is conducted quarterly in onecity from each of DEA's 19 field divisions and San Juan, Puerto Rico. According to DMP data for 1992, the nationwide average purityfor retail level heroin was 37 percent. This percentage was much higherthan the average of 6.9 percent recorded a decade ago and alsoconsiderably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent recorded in1991. The increase in average purity corresponded directly to anincrease in availability of high purity SEA and SWA heroin. AlthoughMexican heroin has been traditionally of lower purity than other herointypes in recent years, it too increased in purity at the street level.Street-level purity of SWA heroin analyzed in the DMP during 1992 was thehighest for all sources, averaging 55.8 percent, while Mexican heroin, at25.6 percent, almost doubled between 1991 and 1992. SEA heroinremained widely available in the northeastern United States with anaverage purity of 34.4 percent. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest inthe northeastern United States, where a large percentage of thenation's user population lives. In New York City, one of the majorimportation and distribution centers for SEA and SWA heroin, the averagepurity at the street level for these types of heroin was, respectively,54.3 percent and 69.7 percent. Boston recorded the highest averagepurity of retail level heroin in all of the DMP cities with an averageof 73.7 percent during 1992. USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992indicated a decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey datashow that the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who haveused heroin at least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to323,000 in 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number ofpast-month heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. The increasein the number of lifetime heroin users to 2,653,000 in 1991 appearsto have been an anomaly, as the 1992 estimate has declined to1,840,000. (Estimates of heroin use from the Household Survey areconsidered very conservative due to the probable under coverage of thepopulation of heroin users.) According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, heroin use increased among high school seniors. Although 1.2percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 reported they had usedheroin at least once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of1991, it was still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classesof 1989 and 1990. Moreover, for the first time in recent years, there wasa statistically significant decline among seniors in theperceived risk of harm associated with heroin use. The National High School Survey also shows that lifetimeheroin use among 8th graders increased from 1.2 percent in 1991 to 1.4percent in 1992, past year use remained steady, and past-month useincreased from a 0.3 percent in 1991 to 0.4 percent in 1992. Among 10thgraders, both lifetime and past-month use remained stable from 1991 to1992, while past-year heroin use increased form 0.5 percent to 0.6percent. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofnationwide heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had beenfluctuating somewhat during the past several years, increasedsubstantially from the first to second half of FY 1992. During that time frame, thenumber of heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, anincrease of 35 percent. Cities showing substantive increases during thelatter half of FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency roomepisodes included Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. Possible explanations for the rising levels of heroin-relatedemergency room episodes have been provided by a number of drugepidemiologists and treatment specialists. Reports indicate that segments of thecrack cocaine user population are using or switching to heroin as ameans to mitigate the depressive effects associated with withdrawalfrom crack. There are additional reports of the appearance, in a limitednumber of areas, of new distributors attempting to establish markets aswell as the growing involvement of youth gangs in the heroin traffic.Moreover, heroin is now being sold in white as well as African-Americanand Hispanic neighborhoods in a limited number of cities. In NewYork City, anecdotal information indicates that more teenagers andfemales are selling heroin than in the past. Lastly, there is aperception among some users that heroin is a safer drug than cocaine, whilecertain others consider heroin use to be "cool." The latterrepresents a radical departure from previous attitudes toward heroin use. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection ofheroin continues to be the predominant route of administration usedby patients admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.However, the percentage of patients who indicated that injection wastheir primary route of administration has decreased from 79.1percent in FY 1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same time frame,there was an increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin.Those who snorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8percent in FY 1992. Increases in snorting are attributed, in part, to afear of contracting AIDS through needle sharing and the availabilityof high- purity heroin on the street. Opiate use (to include heroin) among recently bookedarrestees as reported by the DUF Program remained relatively low andstable in 1992 when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Citieshaving the highest percentage of positive urinalysis tests for heroinamong booked male arrestees in the first half of 1992 were Chicago at 19percent; New York City at 18 percent; San Antonio at 15 percent; San Diegoat 16 percent; Washington, D.C., at 11 percent; Los Angeles at 11percent; and Philadelphia at 12 percent. Female arrestees tested positiveat high rates in New York City (24%), Portland (22%), Washington,D.C., (19%), San Diego (17%), Detroit (15%), Phoenix (15%), San Antonio(14%), and Los Angeles (13%). TRAFFICKING SEA Heroin Trafficking Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under thecontrol of Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smugglingof SEA heroin into the United States. Chinese traffickers in theUnited States with links to these international criminal groups are themost prolific importers and distributors of heroin from Southeast Asia.Chinese or Thai nationals are often used to transport the heroin and aregenerally responsible for the largest bulk shipments, in themultihundred kilogram range, of SEA heroin smuggled into the United States. Around 1986, these Chinese smuggling groups took over themultibillion dollar wholesale heroin trade that had been controlled forover two decades by Traditional Organized Crime groups in the UnitedStates. Over the next few years, ethnic Chinese traffickers flooded thenortheastern United States, the largest heroin market in the country, withbulk shipments of high-purity SEA heroin. In recent years, thesehighly structured clandestine Chinese organizations have increasedthe size and number of heroin shipments to the United States. In the wakeof increased availability, the layers of mid-level distributorsin the New York City area were eliminated and Chinese wholesalers solddirectly to Dominican street-level dealers, a development that resultedin enhanced heroin purity at the street level. SEA heroin traffickers use a variety of transportation routesto smuggle heroin into the United States from the Far East. One of themajor routes originates in Bangkok and terminates in New York City, thelargest heroin importation and distribution center in the UnitedStates. (Each year since 1986, roughly half of DEA's nationwide seizuresoccur in the New York City metropolitan area.) Maritime cargo shipmentsare the primary transport method for smugglers using this route andthe shipments may transit a variety of countries including HongKong, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. Many shipmentsfrom the Far East are also transshipped through Canada and then intothe northeastern United States. Traffickers smuggle heroinshipments aboard commercial airlines originating in Bangkok and then transitalmost any Asian city, as well as a number of cities in Europe andCanada. In addition to New York City, other U.S. cities in theNortheast, including Boston and Philadelphia, are also used as entry points.Traffickers also use West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, andSeattle as entry points for heroin shipments destined for the Northeast. Chinese traffickers employ a variety of smuggling methods.Generally, the size of the heroin shipment determines the smugglingmethod. The largest shipments, ranging from 50- to multihundred-kilogramquantities, are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercialmarine vessels and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are concealed in theluggage of airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. SEAheroin smugglers also use the mails and delivery services totransport multigram to kilogram quantities into the country. Traffickers using commercial cargo originating in sourcecountries frequently attempt to disguise the origin of the cargoshipment by first transshipping containers through several other countries orby falsifying the container documentation. In 1992, 35 kilogramsof heroin, which were shipped from Singapore concealed in ceramic tiles,were seized in Newark, New Jersey. In May 1991, the largest heroinseizure in U.S. history occurred near Oakland, California, when 494kilograms of SEA heroin were seized from a commercial cargo of plasticbags aboard a merchant vessel. The shipment originated in Thailand and was transshipped through Taiwan prior to importation into theUnited States. In addition to the Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers,Nigerians remain deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigeriantraffickers dispatch large numbers of internal body couriers travelingaboard commercial airlines bound for the United States. These"swallowers," including Nigerians as well as other nationalities recruitedas couriers, can smuggle up to two-kilogram amounts of SEAheroin per trip. Moreover, recent reporting suggests that a number of Nigerian trafficking groups are experimenting with smuggling larger (multikilogram) shipments of heroin concealed in commercialmaritime cargo. Most Nigerian organizations are based in Lagos, Nigeria.Since they are formed along tribal lines at the senior levels, theorganizations are close-knit. Drug barons who control the Nigerianorganizations remain well-insulated by directing lower-level traffickers torecruit the numerous couriers, often non-Nigerians, and to organizetravel to the United States. In 1992, Nigerians returned almost all profitsgenerated in the United States to Lagos, Nigeria, or to Europe forlaundering. As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue torecruit other ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, andAmerican citizens, as heroin couriers. New York's JFK InternationalAirport was the entry point used most frequently by Nigerian trafficking organizations in 1992. However, during the past year,Nigerian traffickers diversified both the smuggling routes used toreach the United States and their points of entry into the country. Forexample, West Africans, in all likelihood controlled by Nigerians,made a limited number of attempts to smuggle heroin through entry pointsalong the United States Southwest border and the Canadian border during1992. Nigerians have established heroin distribution networks inU.S. cities with well-established Nigerian populations such as Atlanta,Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Newark, New York, and Washington,D.C. These networks are capable of supplying heroin ranging from100-gram to multikilogram quantities on a regular basis. During 1992,reporting from a DEA investigation in Dallas indicated that Nigerian herointraffickers collaborated with members of Jamaican posses in distributingheroin from Jamaican-controlled crack houses in Dallas and hired possemembers as enforcers to protect Nigerian operations. SWA Heroin Trafficking SWA heroin in the United States increased in availability andpurity during 1992 and the first few months of 1993. While some ofthe rise in purity levels for SWA heroin is in all likelihoodattributable to the influx of high-purity heroin from Colombia, investigativereporting and laboratory analysis show that traditional SWA herointraffickers are also smuggling a purer form of heroin into the United States. Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much lesscentralized than that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard totrafficking groups. A number of ethnic groups from Southwest Asia, theMiddle East, and Europe are active in smuggling SWA heroin into the UnitedStates, and its distribution; these ethnic groups include Afghans,Greeks, Iranians, Israelis, Lebanese, Pakistanis, and Turks. SWAheroin is transported to the United States directly from producingcountries, as well as transshipped through Europe and Africa. Significantquantities of SWA heroin bound for the United States are alsotransshipped through the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.Although New York City is a major SWA heroin importation and distributioncenter, heroin is also smuggled into and distributed throughout theNortheast; in Mid-Atlantic cities such as Baltimore and Washington,D.C.; in some cities on the West Coast such as Los Angeles, San Diego, andSan Francisco; in some Midwestern cities including Chicago andDetroit; and in Puerto Rico. Other points of entry for SWA heroin includeHouston and Miami. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United States arehighly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are based onethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. SWA heroin importers andwholesale level distributors generally are very cautious and rarelytransact with outsiders. As a result, SWA heroin trafficking anddistribution are generally more prevalent in cities that have largepopulations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey, such asChicago, Detroit, and New York City. SWA heroin traffickers rely less on commercial cargo as asmuggling method than their counterparts from Southeast Asia.Generally, SWA heroin traffickers, unlike Chinese traffickers, do notsmuggle heroin on a large scale, such as multiple bulk shipments. However, theyare able to regularly smuggle shipments ranging from one to 20kilograms and, on occasion, larger amounts. Many SWA heroin traffickingorganizations use commercial cargo and couriers aboard commercial airlines tosmuggle one to five kilograms on a steady basis. However, severalorganizations are capable of smuggling from five- to 10 kilogram shipmentsaboard maritime vessels on a fairly regular basis. Pakistani traffickers, who smuggle SWA heroin, controlimportation routes into the United States and distribution networks inNew York City and other cities in the East and Midwest. This heroin isoccasionally transshipped through California as well. Pakistanitraffickers are adept at developing new smuggling techniques and unique concealmentmethods, such as specially designed vests with pockets to concealheroin, which are worn underneath the clothes of couriers on airlines. Pakistanis regularly transact business with Afghan and Indian traffickers, and other ethnic groups from Southwest and SouthAsia. Some Nigerians still smuggle and distribute SWA heroin but mostare now more active in trafficking SEA heroin. Lebanese trafficking groups appear to be increasing theirlevel of smuggling into and distribution in the United States,particularly in Boston, Detroit, and New York, cities with large Lebanesecommunities. Moreover, some SWA heroin originally destined for theEuropean market is now smuggled into the United States because Lebanesetraffickers, in an effort to maximize profit margins, are exchanging SWA heroinfor cocaine with Colombian cocaine organizations. (At the wholesalelevel, heroin prices in the United States are higher than in Europe, whilecocaine prices in Europe are higher than in the United States.) Mexican Heroin Trafficking Mexican heroin, in brown powder form as well as the morewidely available black tar form, is produced almost exclusively forthe U.S. heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexicanheroin to and within the United States is controlled by organizationscomposed of Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans. Mexican trafficking organizations are often made up of family members, lifelongfriends, and other trusted associates. While some Mexican organizations control the entire processfrom opium production and heroin processing in Mexico to the managementof transportation and distribution networks in the UnitedStates, other trafficking organizations operate independently on a smallerscale. Mexico's extensive land border with the United Statesprovides smugglers numerous entry points into the country. Heroin is smuggledacross the U.S. Southwest border in relatively small amounts, most oftenranging from gram- to multiounce quantities, by large numbers ofillegal immigrants and migrant workers. Occasionally, there are largeseizures, such as the April 1993 seizure of approximately 10 kilogramsof black tar heroin at Blythe, California, but such amounts are theexception. Generally, Mexican heroin seizures do not exceed one or twokilograms. The use of numerous couriers to smuggle relatively smallquantities of Mexican heroin is characteristic of the smuggling methodsemployed by Mexican heroin traffickers. These traffickers take advantageof their close proximity to the United States by stockpiling thelarger quantities of heroin in Mexico and then smuggling smalleramounts as transactions in the United States are arranged. Mosttraffickers believe their heroin stockpiles are less susceptible to lawenforcement in Mexico, and by storing heroin there they minimize the dangerof U.S. authorities seizing significant amounts of heroin. Accordingto investigative reporting, even large poly-drug Mexicanorganizations, which are capable of smuggling multiton quantities of cocaineand marijuana, limit smuggling of Mexican heroin into the UnitedStates to kilogram and smaller amounts. Traffickers who distribute Mexican heroin within the UnitedStates are generally Mexican immigrants, primarily from the States ofDurango, Michoacan, Nuevo Leon, and Sinaloa. Mexican organizationscontrol distribution at the wholesale level but are not generallyinvolved in street sales which are often managed by local gangs. Smuggling methods include concealment in motor vehicles,public transportation vehicles, internal and external body carry,and commercial package express services. Females are used muchmore frequently than males as couriers for transporting heroin andmoney across the border. Once the heroin is smuggled into the United States,transportation is arranged to metropolitan areas in the western andsouthwestern States where there are sizable populations of Mexican immigrants.Heroin is also transported to the Chicago, Denver, and St. Louismetropolitan areas, primary markets for Mexican heroin. In the UnitedStates, Mexican black tar heroin is usually sold by the "piece" orMexican ounce, which weighs 25 grams. Colombian Heroin Trafficking The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in theUnited States during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according toseizure analysis and investigative reporting. While most evidencesuggests that Colombian traffickers are still operating at a fairly lowlevel, the potential of the Colombian heroin threat is serious,primarily because of the smuggling resources controlled by the Colombiancocaine cartels. At present, Colombian heroin traffickers are attempting toestablish distribution outlets in the United States, particularly inthe metropolitan areas of the Northeast, and, as a result, aresmuggling a heroin of very high purity, generally 80-plus percent. Thehigh purity is essential in order for the Colombian traffickers to breakinto the fiercely competitive retail heroin markets in Boston, Newark,New York City, and Philadelphia, where street level purity averagesover 50 percent. Colombian heroin is also available in southern NewEngland cities, such as Hartford and Bridgeport, Connecticut, andProvidence, Rhode Island, where, according to reporting from the BostonField Division, Cali Cartel cocaine networks are operating.Currently, significant investigations of Colombian heroin traffickingorganizations are underway in Miami, Newark, New York City, San Diego, andSan Juan, Puerto Rico. Since 1991, most of the Colombian heroin smuggled into theUnited States has been transported by couriers aboard commercial airlines,a method requiring numerous couriers carrying amounts ranging up to akilogram per trip. Colombian couriers commonly transport the heroin infalse- sided briefcases and luggage, inside hollowed-out shoe soles,or by internal body carry methods. Much of this activity appears tobe the work of smaller, independent Colombian traffickers, accordingto investigative reporting from the DEA Bogota Country Office. According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the number ofColombian couriers who were arrested on commercial airlines carryingheroin into the United States increased from 41 in 1991 to over 260 in1992; most of these seizures occurred at either Miami or New York'sinternational airports. The majority of Colombian couriers arrested inMiami confessed to being en route to New York City or possessed follow-ontickets for that destination. Individuals with an end destination ofMiami were often instructed to check into a local hotel and awaitfurther instructions. The primary method of smuggling (ingestion) employed byColombian traffickers and the seizure amounts (usually less than 500grams) indicate that Colombian traffickers presently are not able tosupply heroin on the same scale as Chinese, Nigerian, or SouthwestAsian traffickers. To date, the largest shipment seized involved aJune 1992 airdrop of just under 15 kilograms of heroin on a PuertoRican beach; this shipment may have been tied to the Colombian cocainecartels. However, as the cocaine cartels become more involved inheroin smuggling and distribution, the seriousness of the threat will increase significantly, given their vast resources, control overtrafficking routes, and access to a stable cocaine (crack) clientele inthe United States. CANNABIS AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-productof the Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly usedillegal drug in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant anddelta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psycho-activechemical, are controlled substances. The flowering tops, also known ascolas or buds, are valued because of their higher THC content. Theflowering tops and leaves are collected, dried, and then smoked in a pipe oras a cigarette. Hashish, which is processed from cannabis, is alsovalued to a limited extent by some individuals in the United States. Typically, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla (pollinated) plantcontains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58 percentof a sinsemilla (unpollinated female) plant contains usablematerial. The higher the plant density of the grow area, the lower theyield of usable material. In addition, the diameter of the plant is moreimportant than the height for yield predictions. Indoor plants are generallysmaller than outdoor plants due to space limitations. The averageplant yield for mature, domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately1.25 pounds per plant. The average plant yield for mature, domesticallygrown commercial grade marijuana is approximately three-quarters ofone pound per plant. Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the pastdecade. Prices for a pound of commercial grade marijuana during theearly 1980's ranged from $350 to $600, while in 1992 the cost ranged from$300 to $3,000. Sinsemilla with its inherently higher THC content,ranged from $1,000 to $2,000 ten years ago. In 1992, the price rangedfrom $650 to $9,600 per pound. Successful law enforcement efforts haveforced some cultivators to move indoors. Cultivators have increasinglymoved indoors to avoid detection and to exploit the profit potential ofpotent sinsemilla marijuana. Indoor growers cultivate sinsemillabecause the higher THC content of sinsemilla permits growers to chargehigher prices. Scarcity created by law enforcement operations hasalso increased prices in some areas. Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent yearsinclude cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana bymaking use of advanced agronomic practices such as hydroponics and cloning.Such techniques also involve the use of special fertilizers, planthormones, steroids, and carbon monoxide. During the late 1970's andearly 1980's, the THC content of commercial grade marijuana averaged undertwo percent. By comparison, the average in 1992 was 3.68 percent.The average THC content of sinsemilla in 1992 was 8.34 percentwhich compares to an average of approximately six percent in thelate 1970's and early 1980's. Moreover, in February 1993, a new U.S.record was recorded for the highest concentration of THC analyzed in amarijuana sample. The sample had a THC content of 29.86 percent whichis nearly 32 percent higher than the previous record of 22.67 percentreported during 1992. The record high THC content of this sample is anindicator of the continuing trend by indoor growers to produce higher potencymarijuana over recent years. USE According to the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse, approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana atleast once in their lifetime. Of these, approximately 2.2 million werefrom 12 to 17 years of age, nearly 13.5 million were from 18 to 25 yearsof age, and almost 52 million were 26 years of age and older. Of the17.4 million people who used marijuana at least once in the pastyear, nine million used the drug once a month during 1992, and 5.2million used it once a week or more. Survey data also indicate that thefrequency of marijuana use has declined substantially from 1985 to 1992.Overall, past-year, past-month and past-week use of the drug havediminished by nearly 45 percent during that time frame. According to the National High School Senior Survey on DrugAbuse, the long-term decline in the use of marijuana among seniorscontinued in 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion ofthat population who believed there was a "great risk" ofharm associated with regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of thedownward use pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,and past- month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to1992. Moreover, 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to viewmarijuana use as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.Also, the proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved ofmarijuana use declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception mayexplain the increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declinedfrom FY 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. Infact, the number of marijuana-related emergency room episodes rose from9,231 in FY 1991 to 12,108 in FY 1992, an increase of more than 30percent. DAWN reporting also shows that nearly one-half of the patientstreated for cannabis-related hospital emergency room episodes during thefirst six months of 1992 were under 26 years of age; approximately 70percent of these patients were male. The large majority, approximately80 percent, used marijuana in combination with other substances. Patientsmost frequently used marijuana in combination with alcohol. Thenext most common combination involved the use of marijuana withcocaine. Marijuana use among recently booked male arrestees asreported by the DUF Program increased in many major U.S. cities in 1992. Thehighest levels of marijuana use were reported in Omaha, where 38percent of the sampled population tested positive through urinalysis. InIndianapolis, the figure was 35 percent; in San Diego, 35 percent; inDenver, 34 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 32 percent; and in Miami, 30percent. Marijuana use among recently booked female arrestees alsoincreased in many cities. In Indianapolis, 26 percent of the femalearrestees sampled tested positive for the use of marijuana; in San Diego, 25percent; in Dallas, 24 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 21 percent; in Denver,19 percent; and in Kansas City, 18 percent. TRAFFICKING Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana availablein the United States during 1992. Mexican marijuana is smuggled intothe southwestern United States by vehicles, private aircraft,armed backpackers, and horse or mule caravans. Colombia ranks as adistant second behind Mexico as a foreign source of marijuana.Colombian marijuana is smuggled into the United States by noncommercialvessels using traditional maritime routes. Jamaican traffickers haveincreased marijuana shipments since January 1992. Jamaican marijuana issmuggled into the United States by private and commercial aircraft,and maritime vessels. DOMESTIC CULTIVATION/ERADICATION An estimated 6,000 to 6,500 metric tons of cannabis werecultivated in the United States during 1992. During that year,approximately 3,405 metric tons, representing 7.49 million cultivated plants,were eradicated. Reporting indicates that 31 percent of thecannabis plants eradicated during 1992 was sinsemilla. The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992were Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,respectively. These States accounted for approximately 44 percent of thecultivated cannabis eradicated during 1992. Reports from Indiana and Nebraskaover the last two years could signal a possible new trend in marijuanaproduction. The two States report an increase in tended/enhanced ditchweed, aform of marijuana, which grows in the wild. Although ditchweed haslow potency, it is mixed with cultivated marijuana to increase quantity. There has been an increase in the cultivation of cannabisindoors year- round in elaborately supported operations that have rangedfrom several plants grown in closets to thousands of plants grown inspecially constructed underground sites capable of producing marijuanaworth millions of dollars. Growers also continued to plant cannabisin remote outdoor areas, often concealed or camouflaged by surroundingvegetation. During 1992, the 13th annual DEA-sponsored Domestic CannabisEradication and Suppression Program (DCE/SP) was conducted in conjunctionwith other Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in 50States. The National Guard and Civil Air Patrol also participated. TheDCE/SP resulted in the eradication of 7.49 million cultivatedcannabis plants, 264 million low-potency ditchweed plants, the arrest of12,369 violators, and the seizure of 5,541 weapons. Moreover, thenumber of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 reached an all-timehigh of 3,849, up from 2,848 seized in 1991. Indoor cultivationoperations were confiscated in all 50 States during 1992, with the greatestnumber, 561, seized in the State of Washington. The movement toward indoorproduction is believed due primarily to successful law enforcementefforts to curtail outdoor cultivation. The average indoor cultivationoperation has approximately 100 plants. In addition, an average of oneweapon was seized from each indoor operation. In recent years, the DCE/SP has placed increasing emphasis onthe investigation and prosecution of major domestic cannabiscultivators and trafficking organizations. The net result during 1992 was theseizure of assets valued at over $69.3 million, over twice the amountseized in 1989 ($29.5 million). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,National Park Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs also have long-termprograms to combat cannabis cultivation on public lands. One of the major accomplishments of the DCE/SP continues tobe Hawaii's Operation WIPEOUT. During 1991, it was estimated that theprogram eradicated approximately 85 percent of Hawaii's summercannabis crop. During 1992, Operation WIPEOUT's continued success wasevidenced by reports that mainland smugglers were attempting to smugglemarijuana into Hawaii in order to fill the vacuum. Operation WIPEOUT isnow conducted as a maintenance program. Every 90 days, theWIPEOUT teams conduct aerial surveillance and eradicate what few cannabisplants they find before the plants reach maturity. More emphasis is alsobeing placed on arresting cultivators. Another major accomplishment of the DCE/SP was the successfullobbying efforts to convince the California State Government toconsider herbicidal spraying as a means of eradication. To date, theCalifornia State Government continues to study the proposal. Previousrequests to use herbicidal spraying in California were met with strongresistance based on environmental, as well as political, concerns.Spraying will be conducted in limited areas on a trial basis. Kansas, SouthDakota, and Texas are also considering herbicidal spray programs. DEA continues to conduct a special enforcement programentitled Operation GREEN MERCHANT that targets major indoor growingoperations. To date, DEA, together with State and local authorities hasseized nearly 4,000 growing operations, arrested over 1,500violators, and frozen millions of dollars in illicitly acquired profits andassets. METHAMPHETAMINE AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY Methamphetamine is available in varying quantities in mostareas of the United States, except for the northeastern and Mid-Atlanticregions where, for the most part, it is encountered infrequently.Availability is primarily concentrated in the western and southwesternUnited States where most clandestine laboratory activity occurs.Methamphetamine is also available in limited retail amounts in the Southeast andsomewhat larger quantities in the Midwest. The production of methamphetamine, as evidenced by the numberof reported clandestine laboratory seizures to DEA, hasdecreased each year since 1989. During 1992, 288 methamphetamine laboratorieswere seized. This is in comparison to 652 laboratories seized in 1989, 429in 1990, and 315 in 1991. The decrease in laboratory seizures is attributed to theongoing enforcement of Federal and State chemical controllegislation. The 1988 Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) becameeffective in 1989, and enables the Federal Government to regulate listedprecursor and essential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis ofdangerous drugs. Over the last three years, most States have passedlegislation similar to the CDTA. The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) levelhas remained relatively constant during the past four years. In 1992,methamphetamine prices ranged from $5,000 to $22,000 per pound, $300 to$2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gramlevels averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 35 and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound-puritylevels are unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showedthat an estimated 5.2 million Americans 12 years of age and olderhave used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Lifetimeprevalence rates for 1985, 1988, and 1990 are not available. Thelifetime prevalence rate for 1992 is not yet available. Dataconcerning past- year, past-month, weekly, and daily prevalence rates formethamphetamine are also unavailable.) Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased ata relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 throughthe first half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itselfduring the latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,there was a 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodesinvolving methamphetamine. Despite this, second-half FY 1992 emergencyroom episodes remained below those reported in FY 1989. DAWN emergency room data indicate that methamphetamine abuseis concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, SanFrancisco, and Los Angeles In San Diego and Los Angeles,methamphetamine-related hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter halfof 1992. Nationally, approximately 75 percent of the patients treatedfor drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine were white; nearly65 percent were male; approximately 25 percent were between 18 and 25years of age, and 40 percent were between the ages of 26 and 34. Approximately 45 percent of patients treated in emergencyrooms as a result of methamphetamine abuse indicated that their use of methamphetamine was due to dependence. Approximately 20percent had come to the emergency room because of an overdose, approximately30 percent as a result of an unexpected reaction to the drug, and morethan 20 percent came due to the chronic effects associated withmethamphetamine abuse. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection ofmethamphetamine continues to be the predominant route of administration usedby patients admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for methamphetamine-relatedproblems. Despite this, the percentage of patients who indicated thatinjection was their primary method of administration decreased slightlyduring the past year from 38.4 percent in FY 1991 to 34.9 percent in FY1992. Moreover, there has been an increase in the percentage ofpatients who smoked methamphetamine during the past several years. Thosewho smoked methamphetamine increased from 3.9 percent during FY 1989 to6.8 percent during FY 1992. ILLICIT MANUFACTURE Laboratory Seizures Although clandestine methamphetamine laboratory seizuresdeclined during 1992, methamphetamine remained the most prevalent,clandestinely manufactured controlled substance in the United States.According to DEA reporting, 288 methamphetamine laboratories were seizedduring 1992, which accounted for 87 percent of all clandestine dangerousdrug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure represents a ninepercent decrease from the previous year's total of 315 laboratories seized andcontinues the downward trend in laboratory seizures that began in 1990. DEA field divisions in Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix,San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, seized approximately 83 percentof all methamphetamine laboratories during 1992. This clearlyindicates that the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine is stillprimarily based in the western and southwestern United States. Methamphetamine laboratory seizures declined from 1991 to1992 in 14 DEA field divisions including the San Francisco Division whichcontinued to report the highest number of seizures. Sixty-sevenclandestine methamphetamine laboratories were seized during 1992 by theSan Francisco Division compared to 81 in 1991. However, DEA's LosAngeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, and St. Louis offices reported anincrease in the number of laboratories seized within their respectiveareas. Clandestine laboratories have been seized from everyimaginable location from suburban homes, garages, apartments, mobile trailers,urban dwellings, and industrial areas to specially-designedunderground vaults. The laboratories have been camouflaged,booby-trapped, buried underground, conveyed, and abandoned. Laboratory Operations Laboratories are usually constructed in very rural areasacross the United States; however, an increasing number of smalllaboratories are being located in urban and suburban neighborhoods where theypose a significant threat to health and safety. Not only aremethamphetamine laboratories used to produce an illegal, often deadly drug,but they have caused explosions, fires, and toxic fumes. Chemicalsassociated with clandestine laboratories have proven to be environmentalpollutants and health hazards. Clandestine laboratories are usually operated on an irregularbasis rather than on a regular schedule. Operators often produce abatch of methamphetamine then disassemble the laboratory and store itor move it to another location while they acquire additional chemicals.Storage facilities are often utilized to house (safeguard) chemicals,glassware, and the finished product. An operator will often utilizedifferent locations to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, it isnot uncommon for an organization to have multiple laboratory sites.Relocating the laboratory affords some protection against detection by lawenforcement authorities. Clandestine laboratory operators are often well-armed, andtheir laboratories are occasionally booby-trapped as a securityprecaution. Numerous weapons, including explosives, are routinelyconfiscated in conjunction with clandestine laboratory seizures. Publicsafety, and environmental concerns are of little importance to illicitdrug laboratory operators. Every year, a number of clandestinelaboratories experience fires or explosions which lead to their discovery.Laboratory operators often waste essential chemicals as they attempt tosynthesize a high-quality batch of finished product. They usuallydispose of these and other hazardous chemical wastes by unsafe and illegalmethods, often dumping these wastes on the ground or in nearby streams andlakes, pouring them into local sewage systems, or burying themunderground. Individuals who synthesize methamphetamine are commonlyreferred to as "chemists" or "cooks." This level ofeducation and knowledge of chemistry can vary from high school dropouts with no realchemical knowledge to professional chemists with graduate degrees inchemistry. These "cooks" most typically have very littleformal training; rather, they frequently follow a handwritten recipe or have learnedto synthesize methamphetamine from underground publications, apprenticeships, or during incarceration. There are, however,a number of "chemists" that are fairly adept orknowledgeable with regard to synthesizing methamphetamine. These individuals utilizechemicals more efficiently, thus increasing the yield ratio of chemicals tofinished product. In addition, the "chemist" has theproficiency to solve problems which may occur during the manufacturing process.This is in contrast to operators who simply follow a recipe and who aregenerally unqualified to perform corrective measures. MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES Although the manufacture of methamphetamine can beaccomplished by a variety of chemical synthesis methods, it is most commonlyproduced using the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) or ephedrine reductionroutes of synthesis. The ephedrine reduction method was once most oftenused in clandestine laboratories located in California, and has sincebecome widespread throughout much of the United States. It ispreferred over the P2P method of methamphetamine production for threereasons. First, it is a simpler route of synthesis; second, the effects ofthe resulting product are more pronounced; and, third, ephedrine is morereadily available to clandestine laboratories in California and inthe Southwest. A relatively new and simple procedure to synthesizemethamphetamine has been noted using a variation of the ephedrine reductionmethod. The process is being called a "cold cook" method on thestreets because an external heat source is not required for the synthesis toproceed. The method uses commonly available material and chemicals tomanufacture between one to two ounces of methamphetamine per batch. Theprocess is commonly performed in such readily available containers astwo 32-ounce sports drinking bottles, insulated coffee cups, mugs, or inmodified laboratory glassware. CHEMICAL DIVERSION Integral to the manufacture of illicit methamphetamine arethe chemicals and equipment necessary to operate a clandestine laboratory.Whether the phenyl-2-propanone, ephedrine reduction, or other method ofsynthesis is used, various combinations of chemicals, glassware, andequipment are required. The acquisition of chemicals is, therefore, a vitaland readily identifiable component of the illicit traffickingcycle. Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and Statelevel has made it increasingly difficult for operators to obtain neededchemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations are constantlyseeking new sources and developing ways in which to circumvent the law.They manufacture some of their own chemicals, utilize"runners" to purchase necessary chemicals under threshold amounts, and experimentwith alternate, non-regulated chemicals. Laboratory operatorsobtain regulated chemicals, such as ephedrine, by purchasingover-the-counter products which are exempt from the provisions of the CDTA.Chemicals are also acquired from "rogue" chemical companies or inStates which have less restrictive chemical laws or in such countries as Mexicoand Canada. MANUFACTURlNG/DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS Methamphetamine manufacturing/distribution operations varygreatly in size, structure, and degree of sophistication. Somelaboratory operators act as their own chemists; others hire chemists to run thelaboratories for them. Many manufacturers are independent producers whocook for various organized groups. This is particularly true of larger organizations which may hire or contract chemists tomanufacture methamphetamine in return for cash, finished product, or acombination of the two. Other cooks manufacture for themselves ratherthan for a particular organization. Leasing storage facilities,procuring chemicals, securing the laboratory site, and setting upglassware and equipment may be the responsibility of one person or manydifferent individuals. Several individuals may simply work together tocombine their expertise, chemicals, etc., on an ad hoc basis. Thenumber of individuals which comprise an operation and the function eachperforms differs from one organization to the next. Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,and organizations from independent entrepreneurs and outlawmotorcycle gangs to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations currentlymanufacture and distribute methamphetamine. Nationally, independententrepreneurs represent the largest identifiable group involved inmethamphetamine- related investigations. To a lesser degree, outlaw motorcyclegangs continue to play a role in the distribution aspect andinfluence production in certain areas. They most typically insulatethemselves by financing manufacturing operations rather than becomingdirectly involved themselves. The most noteworthy trend in recent years is currently takingplace in California where Mexican traffickers dominate the large-scaleproduction and distribution of methamphetamine in the San Diego,Riverside, San Bernadino, and Fresno areas. In fact, the high volume ofmethamphetamine manufactured and distributed is the distinguishingcharacteristic of Mexican traffickers involved in dangerous drug production. Numerous 22-liter setups are frequently utilized inlaboratories operated by Mexican traffickers to produce an average of 20to 80 pounds during each manufacturing process. Traffickers set uplaboratories or "cooks" in very remote areas throughout southernand parts of northern California Organizations may purchase property or pay for theshort-term use of a site in order to acquire a secure manufacturinglocation. An organization may utilize one location multiple times. Mexican illegal aliens are most frequently encountered atthese laboratory sites. In some cases, they are hired as helpers orto maintain the reaction process, while the actual chemistvisits periodically to ensure the operation is functioning properly.In other cases, Mexican illegal aliens are responsible for all facetsof the manufacturing process. Chemicals are generally stored instash houses and brought to the laboratory site on a limited basis. Theamount of chemicals present at the laboratory is usually restricted towhat is required to complete a particular cook. Chemicals are procured for these laboratories from sources inthe United States and Mexico. Chemical brokers recruit runners to makepurchases at rogue chemical companies. Additionally, ephedrine, aprecursor for methamphetamine, is easily accessible to Mexican traffickers;the chemical is currently shipped, without restriction, fromGermany to Mexico and subsequently smuggled across the UnitedStates-Mexican border in privately owned vehicles. Moreover, brokers supplychemicals to numerous manufacturing organizations. Organizations assisteach other in obtaining chemicals and glassware. A certain amount ofcooperation exists among many of these organizations; links between thesegroups were already established through their long-standing cocaine,heroin, and marijuana connections. There are indications that groups which previouslymanufactured methamphetamine are now finding it more cost effective topurchase it from Mexican sources. In addition, there is limited evidenceto suggest that Mexican traffickers may be attempting to expand theiroperations to other areas of the country. There are also indications that methamphetamine is currently being manufactured in Mexico and subsequently smuggled into the United States. SOURCE AREAS California is a primary source for methamphetamine in manyareas throughout the United States. However, the manner in whichmanufacturing operations are carried out often makes it difficult todetermine the origin of the source of supply. Operators manufacturing in aparticular area may distribute the finished product to associatesresiding locally, in neighboring States, or in other geographic areas.Privately owned vehicles are the modes of transportation used most frequentlyin the nationwide distribution of methamphetamine. LSD AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY DEA reporting indicates that LSD (Iysergic acid diethylamide)is available in at least retail quantities in virtually everyState in the United States and that availability is increasing in a numberof States. Reporting also indicates that an increasing number ofindividuals or groups are manufacturing and distributing or attempting tomanufacture and distribute LSD in the United States. In the last twoyears, DEA seized or purchased LSD in 33 States and Washington, D.C. LSD availability has been reported by either DEA offices or Stateand local police authorities in many of the remaining 17 States.Northern California appears to be the source of supply for most of theLSD available in the United States. LSD is available in several forms, including blotter paper,tablets, gelatin, sugar cubes, and liquid. Tablets can be purchased inseveral areas, however, most of the retail doses are in theblotter-paper form. Microdots are available in California, Illinois, Indiana,Michigan, New Jersey, and Vermont. Gelatin in the "windowpane"variety has been reported in Michigan and sugar cubes are available inColorado and the Washington, D.C., area. Personal-use doses of liquid LSD invials have also been reported in Colorado, Illinois, New York, and WestVirginia. LSD is relatively inexpensive. The average price isapproximately five dollars per retail dosage unit and costs less than one dollarper dosage unit in wholesale lots of 1,000 dosage units or more. Whencompared with marijuana, which sells for $40 to $450 per ounce, LSD isperceived by many drug users as a bargain, especially if one considers theduration of its effects which can persist for up to 12 hours in higherdoses. Although there has been some fluctuation in the price of LSDnationally during the past several years, overall prices remainrelatively low. LSD potency or strength is measured in micrograms. In the1960's and early 1970's, LSD potency generally ranged from 100 to 200micrograms per dosage unit or higher. Analysis of exhibits during thelate 1970's indicated an average potency in the 30- to 50-microgramrange. From the mid-1980's to the present, LSD potency has remainedconsiderably below levels reported during the 1960's and early 1970's and hasgenerally been in the range of 20 to 80 micrograms per dosage unit. Asa result of this comparatively low dosage level, many users perceive LSDas "safe," thus enhancing the drug's attractiveness. USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse data for LSD arelimited to estimates of lifetime use, defined as the use of LSD at leastonce in a person's lifetime. During 1991, 11.8 million Americans, 12years of age and older, reported having used LSD at least once compared to8.4 million in 1985, an increase of 40 percent. The data revealtwo significant expansions in the number of lifetime users ofLSD; one expansion occurred from 1985 to 1988 and the other from 1990to 1991. According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, past year use of LSD among seniors in the class of 1992 increasedto the highest level since at least 1985. Current (monthly) use ofLSD among 10th and 12th grade students remained relatively stable from1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders, however, current use of LSDincreased during that same time frame from 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.Moreover, past- year use of LSD rose in all three grade levels from 1991 to1992. DAWN reports indicate that the estimated number of nationwideLSD- related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY1989 to FY 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erraticsince that period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remainabove those reported during FY 1989. ILLICIT MANUFACTURE AND TRAFFICKING A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories havebeen seized since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. LSD producers fall into two groups. The first is composed ofchemists, manufacturers, and distributors, located in northernCalifornia, who work together in close association; they are normally major manufacturers capable of distributing LSD nationwide. Thesecond group of producers work independently. The independent producersare encountered in almost any part of the country, however, theirproduct is intended for local consumption only. Wholesale LSD trafficking patterns are not well understood;however, three theoretical models have been developed, which outline organizational structures, production methods, andtrafficking patterns. These theoretical models may help to explain how clandestineLSD activity occurs. Law enforcement officials call theseorganizational patterns: the Independent Entrepreneurial Model, theInner/Outer Circle Group Model, and the Association Model. The Independent Entrepreneurial Model: A number of lawenforcement officials believe some LSD manufacturers and distributors,who are not part of the northern California group, entered the market dueto increased demand and the opportunity for high returns on asmall investment. Examples of this type of loosely-structuredorganization have been noted in cases in Austin, Texas; New Orleans,Louisiana; Hartford, Connecticut; and Denver and Boulder, Colorado. Thecommon feature in each of these cases was an individual or a smallgroup of individuals who manufactured LSD independently from anyCalifornia source of supply. Some entrepreneurs who have manufactured orhave attempted to manufacture LSD have been known to lawenforcement officials for years; however, the number of independenttraffickers appears to have increased recently. The Inner Circle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model: Thismodel is thought to be organized under one close-knit group, the innercircle, which controls the vast majority of LSD manufacturing anddistribution in the United States. The inner circle is probably composedof five to 10 principal individuals who possess specialized functions.These specialists would include chemists, bulk storage custodians, financial/transportation specialists, and executives whomanage overall operations. The inner circle controls the means ofmanufacture; they assemble, operate, disassemble, and store laboratoryequipment; and keep a reserve amount of LSD on hand for distribution. They sellfrom 10- to 200-gram lots to a limited number of multigram distributors.This inner circle presumably accrues multimillion-dollar profits andonly conducts business with the next level of distribution referred to asthe "outer circle." The outer circle consists of multigram distributors whosupply a number of teams, groups, or individuals. They sell LSD at $1,000 to$3,000 per gram and accrue an estimated $300,000 to $600,000 per year. Close Association Model (An alternative theory to the InnerCircle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model): In this model, a small groupof people located in northern California, who have known each other forover two decades, control the manufacture and distribution of LSD.However, in contrast with the Inner Circle/Outer Circle theory, thesepeople do not work in one structured organization. They come together, asnecessary, to acquire chemists, chemicals, working capital, etc. Theywork as consultants or advisors to each other in order to meet theircommon goal of producing and distributing LSD. They may work together asa unit to prepare and distribute one batch of LSD, but after that isaccomplished, they leave the association until another opportunity arises.They have strong loyalty to each other and are living comfortably, butthey are not thought to be motivated primarily by profit. DISTRIBUTION Lower-level distribution of LSD usually occurs in three ways.First, an individual attends a rock concert, meets a source of supply,and exchanges telephone numbers with the source of supply.Normally, these purchases are for retail quantities of up to 100 doses.Second, if this individual decides to continue distributing, he/she wouldthen call the source for additional amounts. Usually the source has eithercontinued on the concert tour or has returned home, which is frequentlynorthern California. If the source intends to stay on the tour-makingsubsequent communication difficult-the source provides the telephonenumber of an associate for future orders. After the initial purchase,almost all transactions are made via the public and private mailsystems. Payments to a source of supply are usually made through legitimatemoney wiring services. Third, some dealers travel directly to Californiato meet their sources of supply. Reporting indicates that shipment methods used to transportboth large and small quantities of LSD are often similar. LSD isfrequently concealed in greeting cards, in cassette tapes, or inarticles of clothing that are mailed to a post office box established bythe recipient. This post office box is usually listed under afictitious name or business. Normally, no return address is provided onthe package or envelope. Moreover, it is suspected that some multigramdistributors will travel to their source in order to obtain supplies. Retail or user level quantities range from one- to 10-dosageunits. Low- level distributors sell 50- to 100-dosage-unit quantities.Mid-level distributors sell 1,000-dosage-unit quantities as well asmultiples of 1,000 units. These distributors normally have more than onesource of supply and sell to several lower-level dealers. The sourcesof supply for gram-distributors are in all likelihood located innorthern California. These sources normally convert LSD from powder orliquid form to blotter form. Multigram distributors travel toCalifornia to obtain LSD personally and are in association with numerouslower-level dealers. PCP AVAILABILITY/PRICE Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available invarying degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities, primarilyBaltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, SanFrancisco, and Washington, D.C. During 1992, PCP in liquid form, the mostcommon form available in the United States, sold for $150 to $1,000 perounce nationally. The lowest liquid-ounce prices were reported inLos Angeles, the source for most of the PCP trafficked in the UnitedStates, where such quantities sold for $150 to $300. Nationwide, the pricefor PCP in powdered form ranged from $400 to $2,000 per ounce. During1992, the price for a gallon of PCP ranged from $3,000 to $10,000 inLos Angeles and up to $13,000 in New York City. Individual cigarettessaturated with PCP sold for between $5 dollars and $70 nationwide. USE PCP is sold on the street under numerous names including:Angel Dust, Crystal, Supergrass, Killer Joints, Ozone, Wack, EmbalmingFluid, and Rocket Fuel. These names reflect the range of its bizarre andvolatile effects. The liquid form of PCP is the most commonlyencountered, but it is also sold in tablets, capsules, and as a powder. PCP istypically applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano,or marijuana, and then smoked. PCP has been used to adulterate commercially-manufactured cigarettes, usually by dipping themin liquid PCP, which is PCP dissolved in ether. The most popularcommercial cigarettes are dark paper-wrapped brands such as Shermans orTijuana Smalls. PCP can also be injected hypodermically intocigarettes. In 1957, PCP was developed as a human anesthetic and laterused in veterinary medicine as a powerful tranquilizer. In 1965,medical use for humans was discontinued because of adverse side effects suchas confusion and delirium. In 1978, its commercial manufacturewas discontinued and PCP was transferred from Schedule III toSchedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thus classifying it as a drugwith a high potential for abuse. PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's when it wastrafficked as a "Magic Peace Pill." Abuse of the drugresurfaced from the mid-to- late 1970's because of low price and powerful effects. Fromthe period 1981 through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly among persons under the age of 21. Cities whichexperienced significant PCP availability and abuse levels in theearly-to-mid-1980's included Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, NewOrleans, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington,D.C. Around 1986, and continuing through the early 1990's, demandfor PCP was displaced in large measure by the widespread availability anduse of crack cocaine. More recently, however, there are indicationsthat PCP abuse is increasing once again in a number of cities. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed thatlifetime and past-year PCP use among the U.S. household populationdecreased from 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate anend to this downward use pattern. From 1990 to 1992, the number ofAmericans aged 12 years and older, who used PCP at least once, increased fromsix million to 8.2 million, while the number who had used PCP in the pastyear increased from 307,000 to 467,000. Nevertheless, the numberof past-year users in 1992 remained significantly below the numberreported in 1985 when approximately 1.2 million Americans reported using PCPat least once yearly. According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, PCP use among 12th graders has declined significantly duringthe past seven years. From 1985 to 1992, the percentage of seniors whoused PCP at least once in their lifetime decreased from 4.9 percent to2.4 percent. Comparable declines were also reported during thatsame period in the percentage of seniors who used PCP during the pastyear and past month as well as on a daily basis. This diminished use isbelieved to be due in large part to a significant increase among 12thgraders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCP usage. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan-area PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been decliningat a substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353during the first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY1992, more than a 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increasedPCP abuse rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, andWashington, D.C. TRAFFICKING AND ILLICIT MANUFACTURE Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCPsupply is manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based streetgangs. While buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP fromCalifornia sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be theprimary means for transporting PCP across the country. Femalecouriers are used very frequently and the amounts transported generally rangefrom one to two quarts. PCP traffickers also use the U.S. mail system andexpress delivery services to transport PCP. Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to threein 1991. Two of the 1992 seizures were in northern California and one eachnear Chicago and Philadelphia. PCP laboratory seizures since themid-1980's have ranged from three to 21 per year, totals which areconsiderably less than the high of 79 reported in 1978. No PCPlaboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. APPENDIX The NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, sponsored by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), isa series of national surveys to measure the prevalence and frequency ofdrug use among the U.S. household population aged 12 and over. Thesurvey samples the civilian non-institutionalized population living inhouseholds, college dormitories, and military installations and,therefore, does not include some segments of the U.S. population which maycontain a substantial proportion of drug users, such as transients andthose who are incarcerated. The SAMHSA publishes survey results on anannual basis. The NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SURVEY is a series ofnationwide studies of drug use frequency and related attitudes among high schoolseniors in the United States. The survey is conducted annually by theUniversity of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded byresearch grants from the SAMHSA. In addition to high school seniors, thestudy includes the recently-added national surveys of 8th and 10th gradestudents. For the 1992 survey, approximately 50,000 8th-, 10th-, and12th-grade students across the country were questioned. The DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK (DAWN) is a large-scale datacollection system implemented in 1972 and designed to be an indicator ofthe severity, scope, and nature of the nation's substance abuseproblem. The purpose of DAWN is to provide data on the incidence of drugabuse related episodes from participating hospital emergency roomslocated in 21 U.S. metropolitan areas. DAWN is managed by the SAMHSA. The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (NIJ) established the DrugUse Forecasting Program (DUF) in 1987 to identify and monitortrends in drug use among arrestees in the United States. Each quarter, atcentral booking facilities in 24 participating jurisdictions,arrestees are asked to participate in a voluntary, anonymous interview andto provide a urine specimen. Urine samples are analyzed to detect theuse of cocaine, opiates, marijuana, PCP, methadone, benzodiazines(such as Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (such as Darvon),barbiturates, and amphetamines. The results of the urinalysis testing arepublished by the NIJ on a quarterly and annual basis.

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Alcohol 1. What is the size of the problem Mortality Morbidity and social dysfunction Road accidents Trends in drug use and drug problems MORTALITY Drug-related deathsaccount for almost one in five deaths among all age groups. .(1) In the 15-34 year age group, the rate of drug-caused deathsincreases to one in three deaths. Age group differences are also important to note: Tobacco is responsible for the majority of drug-caused deaths in older persons aged 35 years and over (75% of drug deaths in this age group) Alcohol is responsible for the majority of drug deaths in younger persons aged 15-34 years (60%) Opiates are responsible for 23% of drug-related deaths in the 15-34 age group compared to less than 1% in the 35 and over age group. In 1990, of the estimated 25 524 deaths attributed to drug use, 71% were due to tobacco, 26% to alcohol, 2% to opiates and 1% to other drugs, including pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter medications. Appendix 1 shows the number of drug-caused deaths by cause of death and age grouping for 1990. MORBIDITYAND SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION Druguse, particularly tobacco and alcohol, is a major factor in over20% of general hospital admissions in Australia, and in over 20%of general practitioner consultations. Alcoholuse is a major factor in marital disharmony, violent crime,chronic invalidity and road accidents. It is the principal drugproblem for a majority of clients of drug and alcohol treatmentagencies throughout Australia (refer Appendix 2). Illegaldrug use is associated with poor social functioning and crime. Indirectdrug problems are often experienced by the parents, spouse andchildren of the drug user. Thefollowing list represents the major pathology developing fromdrug use. Tobacco Carcinoma of larynx, oropharynx and lungs Hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebro-vascular accidents, peripheral artery disease Chronic obstructive airways disease. Alcohol Carcinoma of oropharynx and oesophagus Oesophageal varices, gastric bleeding Hypertension Alcohol-related brain damage, eg Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Peripheral neuritis, cerebellar impairment Alcoholic liver disease, hepatic carcinoma Pancreatitis, diabetes Gout Psychoses: depression, paranoia Suicide Acute withdrawal effects: anxiety, delirium tremens, 'rum fits' Trauma: accidents, injuries purposely inflicted, falls, head injury, drowning Acute toxic effects: death from overdose, paranoia. Otherdrugs Withdrawal syndromes, eg benzodiazepines, barbiturates Acute toxic effects: toxic psychoses (paranoid with amphetamines/cocaine), death Chronic toxic effects: confusion, ataxia (with benzodiazepines and barbiturates) Septic conditions following intravenous drug use, eg septicemia, endocarditis, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and hepatitis C Chronic obstructive airways disease, lung cancer (with long-term heavy smoking of cannabis). ROAD ACCIDENTS Alcohol use is amajor cause of road accidents leading to serious injury or death. It has been estimatedthat in 34% of road deaths alcohol is a contributing factor(before 1979 the figure was over 50%) and the total number ofroad deaths is falling (3730 in 1979; 1971 in 1992). Although there is nofirm epidemiological evidence linking the use of other drugs as acausative factor in road accidents there is much anecdotalevidence. The risk of harm is high when some drugs, eitherillicit or prescribed, eg cannabis or diazepam, are combined withalcohol. TRENDSIN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS Tobacco Recentfigures from the 1991 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse(NCADA) Household Survey indicate that tobacco was used in thepast year by 31% of males and 25% of females aged 14 and over.Similar proportions of high school students also report usingtobacco. Although levels of smoking among teenagers have fallenin recent years, the number of female teenagers who smoke stillexceeds that of males. In 1991, 21% of boys and 35% of girlsbetween 14-19 years reported smoking in the past year. (Appendix3 provides information on use of various drugs by persons aged14-19 years.) Therehas been a greater decline of smoking among males than females inthe past 15 years. The proportion of female smoking increasedfrom 26% in 1945 to 31% in 1976-80 but has since fallen to 27% in1989. The proportion of males smoking has fallen since 1945 (whenit was 72%) to 30% in 1989. This represents no statisticaldifference between male and female smoking rates for the firsttime. In1989 the highest smoking rate of Australian adult smokers wasfound among 20-24 year olds for both males (41%) and females(38%). Mortalityrates due to smoking have decreased by 5% between 1987 and 1990(from 111.7 to 106 deaths per 100 000 population). Alcohol Thetrend since the mid-1970s has been towards a decrease in theamount of alcohol consumed in Australia (per capita consumptionof alcohol fell from 13.2 litres in 1978 to 7.9 litres in1990-91). Between1985-86 and 1990-91 consumption of beer has decreased by 6%, wineconsumption has decreased by 19%, while overall, total alcoholconsumption (expressed as pure alcohol) decreased by 7%. In1991, over 18% of all beer consumed was low alcohol beer. (Lowalcohol beer was not consumed before 1985.) A1989 survey highlighted increasing concern about heavy drinkingamong young people – 38% of 16 year olds and 40% of 17 yearolds consumed five or more drinks on their last drinkingoccasion. It was also reported that in the 12-16 year age group,22% of boys and 18% of girls reported weekly use of alcohol. Alcoholcontinues to play a major role in domestic violence. Surveysby the National Heart Foundation have shown that despite drinkingless often than older groups, young people (aged 20-24 years)tend to drink more heavily on the occasions when they do drink. Deathrates due to alcohol have fallen by 20% since 1979 (from 48.7deaths per 100 000 population in 1979 to 39.0 in 1990). Peopleare now spending less of their total budget on alcohol thanpreviously (5.6% in 1981-82, 4.1% in 1991). Pharmaceuticalproducts Thereis no reliable evidence to demonstrate authoritatively patternsor trends in the use of pharmaceutical products such assedatives, minor tranquillisers and analgesics. Restrictions onthe prescription of barbiturates over the past decade haveproduced a fall in their use, and deaths from overdosage havedecreased by 75%. Themost commonly used prescribed drugs are cardiovascular systemdrugs (19%) followed by psychotropic drugs (10%). There is someconcern about the use of psychotropic drugs because of theirability to alter a person's mood, behaviour or perception. Minortranquillisers, particularly benzodiazepines, are the mostcommonly used psychotropic drugs in the Australian community. Theoveruse of this drug, particularly by women and the elderly, hasbeen an area of concern for some time. Theuse of benzodiazepines for long or continuous therapy, inparticular for night time sedation, is an undesirable practice. Benzodiazepinesare commonly taken in overdosage both by accident and withsuicidal intent. Approximately 1% of drug-related deaths are dueto the misuse of prescribed and unprescribed pharmaceuticals. Minoranalgesics are easily available and, although analgesicnephropathy has decreased, the level of this disorder among womenin Australia remains high by international standards. Coughmixtures and antihistamines are commonly used for theirpsychotropic effects, occasionally leading to dependence. Illegaldrugs The1991 NCADA Household Survey reported that 32% of persons over theage of 14 years had tried cannabis and 8% had used amphetamines(excluding ecstasy). Apartfrom the use of cannabis, it seems that the level of use ofillegal drugs in Australia remains very low. This use hasremained at approximately the same level for the past ten years.Appendix 4 provides a breakdown of persons using illicit drugs inthe past year. Theuse of hallucinogens (eg LSD) seems to have remained at a minimumlevel despite media reports about 'designer drugs' (ecstasy,etc.). Heroinuse may be gradually diminishing in line with trends in othercountries. Theuse of amphetamines and cocaine in general remains low in theAustralian population. (Appendix 5 provides information on theproportion of the population who have ever tried various illicitdrugs.) However, recent evidence suggests that the number ofpersons trying amphetamines is increasing, particularly amongmales aged 25-39 (from 12% in 1988 to 19% in 1991) and amongfemales aged 14-24 (4% in 1988 to 11% in 1991). Illegaldrug use, however, remains a major social problem. Deathscaused by opiates seem to be still increasing although thenumbers remain relatively small (117 in 1979 to 457 in 1991). Mostdeaths involving illegal drugs are caused by overdosage or animpure drug. Some of these deaths are suicides. Many injectingdrug users are infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C and anincreasing number are infected with HIV/AIDS. Intravenous use ofamphetamines and cocaine is still causing little morbidity, butan increasing number are presenting for treatment centres.Needle-sharing and unsafe sexual practices continue to be asignificant problem. Cannabisis the most widely used illicit drug in the Australianpopulation, with approximately one in three persons aged 14 andover having tried this drug. This represents a slight increase inuse since 1988. Itis possible that cannabis use may precipitate psychotic episodesin those who are predisposed or have a history of psychosis.Cannabis impairs psychomotor function but epidemiologicalevidence to link cannabis with road accidents is still lacking.

Concepts and definitions Drug Drug use Drug dependence Addiction, addict, addictive behaviour Drug-related disabilities Intoxication Overdose Drug abuse Harm reduction Detoxification Alcohol National health and medical research council recommendations Developing guidelines Concepts and definitions are particularly important to thesubject of drug use and drug problems.(2)This subject often evokes emotional responses because of our ownambivalence towards drug use. The literature on this subject alsoleads to much confusion. Many myths have been created and perpetuated about drug useand drug problems over the last 30 years. A consensus is nowbeing reached concerning the most valuable concepts, and the waythat different words should be used. If drug users are to be helped to avoid problems and tominimise their disabilities, it is important that simple termsshould be understood and used uniformly. DRUG This term refers to anychemical that changes the mental state and that may be usedrepeatedly for that effect by a person. Some are likely toadversely affect the health of the individual and the socialsurroundings. 'Drug' now includes alcohol,tobacco, psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs andsubstances such as petrol, some fluorocarbons and anabolicsteroids. DRUG USE (3) Experimental use: trying out the drug to experience its effectand to decide whether or not to adopt an ongoing pattern of use. Social and recreational use: using the drug as a means ofenhancing social interaction or the enjoyment of some leisureactivity. Symptomatic use: using the drug as a means of reducingunpleasant sensations or experiences or to avoid challengingsituations or responsibilities. Dependent use: using the drug with a sense of compulsion, sothat other responsibilities are neglected and harm may result. Such dependent use becomes habitual, stereotyped in pattern,and responsive to external cues and pressures. This pattern isquickly reinstituted after a period of abstinence. Abstinence maybe associated with the onset of withdrawal symptoms and thediscomfort of withdrawal will become a motivator for renewed druguse. DRUG DEPENDENCE Drug dependencesyndrome describes the pattern of behaviour shown by, and thephysical changes experienced by, drug-dependent users. Psychologicaldependence describes the behavioural aspects of drug dependence. Physical dependenceexists in a tissue or intact organism when the presence of thedrug is necessary for normal functioning. It refers to thetolerance which develops to the effects of drug use and to thewithdrawal effects experienced when drug use is stopped. Neuroadaptationdescribes the altered sensitivity of cells, as well as thepatterns of behavioural and auto-physiological responses whichdevelop with repeated drug use ADDICTION,ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR Addiction,a term which has been in use for thousands of years, means togive oneself to either a person or a behaviour pattern. Addictionis a universal term and applies to those who give themselves to awide variety of behaviours often to the extent that their livesbecome unmanageable. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is only anexample of this pattern of behaviour. However, once an addictionis established that behaviour tends to be relied uponincreasingly. Thereare a number of characteristics evident with an addiction: A strong desire or sense of compulsion to engage in the particular behaviour (especially when the opportunity to engage in such behaviour is not available); Impaired capacity to control the behaviour (notably in terms of controlling its onset, staying off, or controlling the level at which the behaviour occurs); Discomfort and distress when the behaviour is prevented or stops; and Persisting with the behaviour despite clear evidence that it is leading to problems Whilenot all of these characteristics are present in every instance ofaddictive behaviour, a sense of compulsion tends to be anessential element. Together these four features provide a goodpicture of addictive behaviour with its sense of compulsion, thedifficulty of maintaining control over the behaviour, thedistress associated with withdrawal, and the persistence thatsuch behaviours show once they have become established (Gossop,1989). Peoplewith an addiction need to face the reality of the situation andto have some positive experiences in order to regain self-esteemand hope. They must attempt to acquire a new set of values orpersonal orientation in order to achieve successful control andcure. DRUG-RELATEDDISABILITIES This termrefers to all the harm a person may experience as a result of theuse of drugs. Suchdisabilities include a whole range of adverse health and socialconsequences which may be experienced as either direct orindirect consequence of drug use. Directconsequences Theseinclude: harm suffered through changed behaviour due to the intoxicating effects of the drug harm suffered from the acute or chronic toxic effects of the drug harm suffered because of the change in priorities associated with dependent use of the drug. Indirectconsequences Theseinclude: harm associated with poor nutrition and poor hygiene harm resulting from efforts made by the individual or others to curtail drug use harm associated with the impurities or contaminants in the drug used or the method of administration. Drug-relateddisabilities may occur in all types of drug users but are morelikely to occur as the frequency and quantity of drug useincreases. Accordingly it is possible to categorise drug users interms of the risk of their experiencing harm. In practice thishas been done only with alcohol, eg 'Low risk drinking'. INTOXICATION Intoxication may bedefined as the intake of a quantity of a substance which exceedsthe individual's tolerance and produces behavioural or physicalabnormalities. OVERDOSE Overdose may be defined asthe state that occurs when a person has ingested a drug quantityhigher than the recommended therapeutic dose and that alsoexceeds his or her tolerance. DRUG ABUSE This term is now notrecommended for use because it can have many meanings and is usedas a pejorative term implying a deliberate misuse of drugsregardless of consequences. Alternative phrases may be used whichare less explicit and pejorative in nature. HARM REDUCTION This term describesthe new approach being taken to all drug-related problems. Theaim of any intervention is not so much stopping drug use butfocusing on the reduction of specific drug-related harm. DETOXIFICATION Detoxification can bedefined as the means by which the drug-dependent person maywithdraw from the effects of that drug in a supervised way inorder that withdrawal symptoms and the risks relating towithdrawal are minimised. .i.detoxification; ALCOHOL Safe drinking orresponsible drinking Low riskdrinking Hazardousdrinking Clinical signs andsymptoms of possible hazardous alcohol use Harmful drinking Dysfunctionaldrinking Binge drinking Alcoholism, alcoholic,problem drinker Standard drinks– grams of alcohol A harmful dose ofalcohol Alcohol content Indices of harm Blood alcoholconcentration Harm and bloodalcohol concentration Safe drinking orresponsible drinking (4) No specific level or pattern of drinking alcohol should beconsidered safe. It has been agreed on the basis of available evidence that arange of drinking which most people would consider low risk anddrinking which is considered hazardous, dangerous ordysfunctional, can be defined. Low riskdrinking         Female                                  Male        Never more than                         Never more than        two standard drinks                     four standard drinks        in a day)                               in a day        (except for pregnancy)(1 standard drink = 10 grams of alcohol) Figure: one standard drink Hazardousdrinking Hazardousdrinking refers to: drinking which significantly increases the risk of harm drinking which raises the blood alcohol level (BAL) above 50 mg alcohol/100 mL blood (0.05%) drinking which exceeds the limits of low risk drinking: female – drinking 3-4 standard drinks per day on average male – drinking 5-6 standard drinks per day on average. Clinical signsand symptoms of possible hazardous alcohol use These include: morning nausea and vomiting dyspepsia recurrent diarrhoea hypertension palpitations depression blackouts loss of appetite anxiety trauma scars unrelated to surgery hand tremor alcohol foetor by day pancreatitis hepatomegaly other signs of liver disease polyuria impotence sleep disturbance paranoid ideation morbid jealousy night sweating financial difficulties depression in spouse or family member. (Note: not inorder of priority.) Harmfuldrinking Harmfuldrinking is defined as: drinking which will almost invariably lead to harm within the near future drinking which raises the BAL above 10 mg alcohol/100 mL blood (0.10): female – drinking more than four standard drinks per day male – drinking more than six standard drinks per day drinking for relief of boredom, conflict, depression, etc. drinking which has caused physical damage or psychotic illness. Dysfunctionaldrinking Dysfunctionaldrinking is defined as: drinking which has already led to psychological damage or to impairment of social functioning, including disturbance of marital or family relationships, drink-driving or other convictions, impaired job efficiency dependent drinking in which alcohol consumption takes precedence over important responsibilities which previously held a high priority in the person's life, eg family, financial, employment-related, personal health, etc. Binge drinking Binge drinkinghas been described as the consumption of alcohol to intoxicationin a very short period of time. Generally there are two forms ofbinge drinking: Drinking heavily on a single occasion, ie the consumption of five or more drinks in one drinking session. Heavy and continuous drinking over a number of days or weeks. This form of drinking may be characteristic of people who have high levels of tolerance for alcohol or are susceptible to alcohol dependence. Binge drinking isparticularly evident among young people, usually in the form of anumber of bouts of drinking in the course of a week. This form ofdrinking may affect an individual's cognition, distractability,information-processing ability, and increase the risk ofalcohol-related accidents (Pols and Hawks, 1992). Alcoholism,alcoholic, problem drinker (5) These terms should be used with great caution in order toavoid misunderstanding. Alcoholism can be used to cover the whole range ofalcohol-related disabilities. However, alcoholism has acquired ahost of meanings by association with the disease concept ofalcoholism. This implies that it is a progressive andirreversible condition that can be arrested but never cured, andinvolving a special sensitivity in the sufferer who experiencescraving for alcohol and loss of control of its use. This disease concept of alcoholism can be useful but it alsohas many disadvantages. It certainly can lead to unreasonableexpectations and to the adoption of a passive role by thedrinker. It can promote a false sense of confidence in drinkerswho believe that alcoholics are a race apart. The idea ofalcoholism as a disease can distract drinkers and helpers fromthe fact that the central issue relates to the priorities andmotivation of the drinker and the drinker's capacity to controlhis habits or behaviour. Alcoholic can be used as an adjective, ie alcoholic liverdisease, which indicates the problem is related to the use ofalcohol. It may also be used as a noun ('he is an alcoholic').However, such usage is poor communication, with many emotionalovertones. It implies a simplicity of understanding which doesnot reflect the complexity of human behaviour. Because of this,it is advised that the term not be used as a noun. Problem drinker and drinking problem are loose terms that arebetter replaced by other more specific terms, namely hazardous,harmful and dysfunctional drinking. Standard drinks– grams of alcohol It is essentialin taking a history of alcohol consumption to determine theamount of absolute alcohol (100% ethanol) consumed by thepatient. To simplify this process it is customary to estimate thenumber of standard drinks consumed per day and during a typicalweek. A standard drinkis defined as the amount of any particular alcoholic beveragethat contains approximately 10 grams (12.5 mL of ethanol) whichis generally equivalent to the usual drink served at a hotel orrestaurant (see figure showingrange of standard drinks). We need also to list the patient's intake as a number ofstandard drinks per day or per week. Then by multiplying thisnumber by ten we can calculate the number of grams of alcoholconsumed. This will allow us to determine whether the drinking isresponsible, hazardous or harmful. Recent research indicates thatpeople have difficulty estimating consumption of standard drinksusing the information that is currently available on alcoholicbeverage containers. A harmful doseof alcohol Harmful dose isan amount of alcohol likely to cause a harmful effect. In olderterminology, it would cause an alcohol-related problem. Dose: alcoholconsumption should be expressed in grams – so many grams perdrink consumed, so many grams on a single drinking occasion, somany grams on an average daily basis over an extended period ofyears. Alcohol content The alcoholcontent of various beverages is expressed in two ways: millilitres absolute alcohol per 100 mL of beverage (volume/volume); or grams of alcohol per 100 mL of beverage (weight/volume). One hundred millilitres of absolute alcohol weighs 80 grams. Indices of harm Harm due toalcohol consumption is manifested in a variety of ways: impairment of skills disturbed behaviour physical disease or disability the foetal alcohol syndrome loss of control/dependence problems in relationships or work. Some problemsare indirect effects. There may be physical, social,psychological or behavioural problems which occur because ofhazardous or harmful alcohol use. For example: domestic violence or incest killing someone else through drink driving depression in a spouse or family member enuresis or school refusal in a child. Blood alcoholconcentration This can beexpressed as mg alcohol/100 mL of blood eg 50 mg/100 mL = 0.05%or more commonly mg alcohol/100 mL of blood as grams per cent eg0.05 g% The blood alcoholconcentration (BAC) is determined by two main factors: the amount consumed in a given time; and the rate of elimination. Other factors do contribute: the sex of the person their body composition drinking with meals the nature of the beverage. Many drinkers,especially chronic drinkers, do not start on a drinking sessionwith a zero BAC. One can onlygeneralise in predicting the likely BAC. In a male weighing 70kilograms, 10 grams of alcohol usually raises the BAC by 0.02grams per 100 mL of blood. The rate of elimination is about 8grams per hour, resulting in a fall in the BAC of about 0.015grams per 100 mL per hour. Harm and bloodalcohol concentration Driving skillsbegin to deteriorate at 0.03-0.04 grams per 100 mL. Certain cognitiveand other cerebral functions are impaired: judgment, processinginformation, consciousness, vision. Significant deteriorationoccurs at 0.05-0.08. A rapid decline in skills then occurs withsmall increments in the BAC. The same impairedcerebral functions affect all forms of skilled performance atwork, during leisure activities, etc. Disinhibition isrelated to the BAC. Disturbed behaviour often resulting inantisocial acts may become manifest between 0.06 and 0.10 g%. Loss of controlseems to be in part related to the BAC, occurring at about0.04-0.06 g%. These effects canresult from a single drinking episode in any type of drinker. NATIONAL HEALTH ANDMEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS In 1992 the NationalHealth and Medical Research Council published a series ofrecommendations regarding responsible drinking behaviour. That the concept of a standard drink, or unit, containing approximately 8-10 grams of absolute alcohol be adopted for clinical and educational purposes. That the following guidelines be promoted as consistent with responsible drinking: that the consumption of alcohol by men should not exceed 4 units or 40 grams of absolute alcohol per day on a regular basis, or 28 units per week; that 4-6 units per day or 28-42 units per week be considered as hazardous and that more than 6 units per day or 42 units per week be regarded as harmful that the consumption of alcohol by women should not exceed 2 units per day or 14 units per week on a regular basis; that 2-4 units per day or 14-28 units per week be considered hazardous and that more than 4 units per day or 28 per week be considered harmful that 'binge' drinking is potentially hazardous that all people should have at least two alcohol-free days each week that abstinence be promoted as desirable in pregnancy that people who intend to drive, operate machinery or undertake activities in hazardous or potentially hazardous situations should not drink; and that specific information be given to drinkers regarding practical ways of reducing alcohol consumption in social situations. (Please refer to the charton page 11 for further details of the alcohol content of theusual Australian standard drinks.) DEVELOPINGGUIDELINES Guidelines forthe safe consumption of alcohol must be devised acknowledgingthat alcohol does much to enrich our social life. At the sametime the serious consequences of alcohol consumption forindividuals and societies cannot be overlooked. Guidelinesmust be devised which recognise the complexity of the effects ofalcohol on different organs of the body, the range of patterns ofalcohol consumption, and the influence of other compoundingfactors such as gender and nutrition. The guidelinesmay need to be modified according to the circumstances of theindividual case including general health, presence or absence ofpersonal or family history of drug or alcohol dependence,occupation and especially the context in which alcohol is to beconsumed.

Alcohol Natural history of alcohol dependence Physical complications Psychological complications Social complications Early recognition of alcohol-related problems Blood tests when alcohol dependence is suspected NATURAL HISTORY OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE Progression At-risk groups and social factors Recovery Pregnancy Alcohol and physical disease Fundamentally, 'alcohol dependence' is a longitudinal development, a series of events (problems) correlated with the consumption of alcohol and associated with the phenomena of tolerance, loss of control and dependency. The natural history of alcohol dependence is therefore a continuum, evolving from hazardous to harmful patterns of drinking, causing a series of alcohol-related disorders or problems, and the development of a dependency on the use of alcohol. Progression Bouts of heavy alcohol consumption - a variety of patterns may evolve. Early problems are mainly psychosocial: drink driving offences, loss of jobs, marital disharmony, civil or criminal offences. Dependence can begin to develop relatively early. Physical complications tend to occur later: earliest are trauma, hypertension and gout, later ones are cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy and brain damage. Alcohol-related physical disease begins to constitute a threat to life and there is a significant annual mortality rate once severe dependence has developed. Loss of control of drinking habits emerges about midway. With further progression, problems multiply and dependence becomes consolidated. Social and psychological disintegration becomes manifest. Progression is not inevitable. Many factors may accelerate progression or alter its direction. Many heavy drinkers change course, modify their drinking or become abstinent without any professional help. There are at-risk groups and contributing social factors. At-risk groups and social factors Family history of alcohol dependence, especially in close relatives and males peer group heavy drinking - distortion of perception of drinking norms antisocial personalities anxious or depressed persons significant life events causing psychological stress cultural norms of heavy drinking, eg particular occupations tolerated patterns of heavy drinking and of intoxication. The presence of positive outcome indicators need to be considered when planning treatment programs. Examples may include: when a person begins to notice the harmful effects of his/her drinking behaviour if the person seeks help or joins support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous if rewarding and sustaining relationships exist if a growth of positive personal values occur if satisfying new interests and relationships are developed if social supports remain intact, such as family structure and employment. Recovery Often minimal intervention is all that is required. Abstinence is not the sole criterion of recovery. Many people adopt low risk drinking patterns, especially those in controlled environments or who have not progressed far along the road of dependence. Goals of management should be realistic, individually tailored, frequently reassessed and often staged. Staging is often determined by the development of social supports and of emotional stability. Pregnancy Any drinking is potentially deleterious to the foetus but major abnormalities are the sequel of heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a day). Women should be advised not to consume alcohol during pregnancy. Very early pregnancy (less than 6-8 weeks) and late pregnancy (third trimester) appear to be times of greatest foetal risk. Alcohol and physical disease Physical disease due to alcohol does not occur in a simple dose-response relationship. Some diseases, eg Wernicke's encephalopathy, are due to nutritional deficiency states, secondary to heavy alcohol consumption. The best researched physical complication is liver disease. Studies have established the concept of the aggregate dose, the product of the average daily dose and the number of years. The higher the aggregate dose, the more likely is the development of serious liver disease. The lower levels of risk for liver disease appear with sustained average daily intakes of 40 grams for women and 60 grams for men. It is unknown whether the same values apply to other physical diseases, eg pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy. Cerebral dysfunction seems to occur at lower levels of alcohol intake than liver disease. Cerebral dysfunction is a clinical syndrome in which abnormalities of cerebral function can be demonstrated by psychometric testing. Function may recover in whole or in part once drinking has ceased. Maximal recovery may be delayed by weeks or months. Damage and recovery may be demonstrated by serial computerised tomography. Foetal alcohol syndrome may occur in children born of drinking mothers. Changes short of foetal alcohol syndrome also occur. Measurable defects have been found in infants of mothers drinking as little as 20 g per day. The risk of full blown foetal alcohol syndrome has been shown to be very marked if the mother consumes 50 g or more per day. It is not known whether a single episode of heavy drinking can damage the foetus but animal studies have shown this to be so. PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS Certain diseases and conditions may be present which are not specific or consistently diagnostic of heavy alcohol consumption. However, suspicion should be raised particularly when more than one is present. Note: They usually appear later than the social and psychological complications. * = common; E = early (may also be late); L = late Cardiovascular Respiratory Gastrointestinal Haematological Neurological Chronic disorders Nutritional Metabolic Endocrine Skin Facial Musculoskeletal Traumatic and accidental Cardiovascular Hypertension (*E) usual improvement with abstinence non-compliance treatment problems in established hypertension.

PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS General The alcoholic personality as such does not exist. There is no difference between the mental health and pre-morbid personality of the alcohol-dependent person and the non-dependent person. Most, but not all, psychological problems in alcohol-dependent people are secondary to the effects of drinking. In some a psychiatric disorder (eg affective disorder, antisocial personality disorder) is primary and precedes the abnormal drinking behaviour. There are almost no psychological symptoms or syndromes which cannot be caused or exacerbated by alcohol and other drug misuse. These must be considered in every psychological presentation. The diagnostic possibilities cover the whole field of psychiatry and only the most common can be listed here. Common psychological presentations Suicide attempts and suicide Depression Loss of memory or blackout Anxiety Phobic states Fugue states Hyperexcitability and rage states Morbid jealousy Paranoid reactions Atypical psychosis Schizophrenia Insomnia Antisocial behaviour. Cognitive and memory defects It is important to consider alcohol use every time a tranquilliser, antidepressant or hypnotic is prescribed. Sexual problems Loss of libido Hypogonadism Impotence and premature ejaculation, ejaculatory incompetence Forcing sexual relations on partner Sexual deviancy, eg incest, sexual molestation of children, rape. SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS Social disorders are usually the earliest and most frequent complications of alcohol misuse. A complete range of these can be produced by, or associated with, alcohol misuse. General Isolation from family and community activities Life revolving around drinking activities Increased frequency of driving accidents Increase in acts of violence and crime Financial problems Legal problems. At work Frequent absenteeism, especially Monday and Friday and after pay day Frequent and varied medical reasons for absence from work Promotion failure, impaired job performance A history of gaps in work, frequent changes of employment and the threat of job loss Industrial accidents Early retirement. Common effects of excessive alcohol consumption within the family The alcohol-dependent person: denies the alcohol problem, blames others, forgets and tells stories for self defence and protection against humiliation; receives criticism from others in the family spends money needed by the family on alcohol ignores bills, debts pile up is unpredictable and impulsive resorts to verbal and physical abuse in place of honest, open talk loses the trust of family, relatives and friends experiences increased sexual arousal but reduced function has unpredictable mood swings � Jekyll and Hyde personality uses devious and manipulative behaviour to divert attention from drinking problem suffers depression, guilt, shame. The spouse or partner: often tries to hide and deny the problem of the partner takes on the other person's responsibilities, carrying the load of two and perpetuating the spouse/partner dependence takes a job to get away from the problem and/or to maintain financial security finds it difficult to be open and honest because of resentment, anger, hurt and shame avoids sexual contact and may seek separation or divorce may overprotect the children, neglect and/or use them for emotional support shows gradual social withdrawal and isolation may lose feelings of self-respect and self-worth may use alcohol or prescription drugs in an effort to cope may present to the doctor with anxiety, depression, psychosomatic symptoms or evidence of domestic violence. The children The children have an increased risk of developing alcohol dependency themselves. They may: be victims of birth defects (from maternal alcohol use) be torn between two parents be deprived of emotional and physical support and lack trust in anyone avoid peer group activities, especially in the home, out of fear and shame learn destructive and negative ways of dealing with problems and getting attention lose sight of values, standards and goals because of a lack of consistent, strong parenting be a failure in school and indulge in petty crime suffer a diminishing sense of self-worth as a significant member of the family present with learning difficulties, school refusal, enuresis or sleep disorders. EARLY RECOGNITION OF ALCOHOL-RELATED PROBLEMS Early indicators Psychosocial factors Heavy drinking (more than six drinks per day, ie greater than 60 grams per day of ethanol for men, and more than four drinks per day for women, ie greater than 40 grams of ethanol) Concern about drinking by self or family or both Intellectual impairment, especially in the abstracting, planning, organising and adaptive skills Eating lightly or skipping meals Drinking rapidly Increased tolerance to alcohol Accidents related to drinking Absence from work related to drinking Majority of friends and acquaintances are heavy drinkers; most leisure activities and sports relate to drinking Attempts to cut down on drinking have had limited success Frequent use of alcohol to deal with stressful situations Frequent drinking during the working day, especially at lunch break Heavy smoking. Investigation factors Macrocytosis (MCV of red cells more than 100) in the absence of anaemia An elevated GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) Elevated serum uric acid level Elevated high density lipoprotein Random blood alcohol level greater than BAC 0.05 g %.

(Refer to page 11, standard drinks and the concept of listing the patient's intake as a number of drinks per day or per week.) The NHMRC has developed the following guidelines for classifying low risk, hazardous and harmful use of alcohol (Pols and Hawks, 1992). Standard drinks per day Low risk Hazardous Harmful Male <<=4 5-6 >6 Female <<=2 3-4 >4 Standard drinks per week Low risk Hazardous Harmful Male <<=28 28-42 >42 Female <<=14 14-28 >28 STEP 2 HELP your patient weigh up the costs and benefits of continued drinking. STEP 3 HELP the patient identify the benefits of their current level of drinking. HELP identify the current risks and/or benefits. STEP 4 STRESS the benefits of reduced alcohol intake, for example: save money be less depressed have more energy sleep better stay younger longer live longer better relationships improved sex life reduced weight problems reduced risk of heart disease, cancer and accidents reduced legal problems reduced employment problems. STEP 5 ENCOURAGE your patient to cut down his or her drinking (or stop altogether if appropriate). STEP 6 NEGOTIATE appropriate goals with the patient. Small achievable goals will enhance the patient's self efficacy. Try to nominate: a daily average and weekly total a maximum number of drinks per person a number of alcohol-free days. STEP 7 IDENTIFY the situations in which the patient normally drinks heavily and the factors which will make it difficult to change this pattern (eg at parties, at dinner, after work, in particular social situations, when bored, when tired and/or stressed, etc.) STEP 8 UTILISE ways of coping without heavy drinking. In the immediate situation: substitute low or non-alcoholic drinks do something physical instead go for a drive go to the movies or watch television visit or telephone friends take a long hot bath resolve conflicts. In the longer term: start new hobbies, crafts or sport become involved in community activities find new interests, eg learn a language or musical instrument increase involvement with family and friends and develop more social contact. STEP 9 GOAL SETTING and progress monitoring are important parts of your role. Provide clear and non-judgemental information about reducing alcohol consumption. After agreeing on an appropriate goal with the patient, make your expectations clear and set a follow-up appointment. STEP 10 HELP and encouragement are vital. Change is possible but it requires direction and support. The involvement of another significant individual may provide further positive reinforcement, and necessary social support. STEP 11 REFER where necessary to an appropriate self-help organisation and/or treatment agency (refer Chapter 18, Community Support Services). Provide booklets and pamphlets to reinforce the information and advice you give. STEP 12 EXPECT a number of your patients to resume their previous level of use. Encourage them to try again. Identify any gains they made in their previous attempt to cut down their drinking and discuss strategies to deal with cognitive, social or environmental factors which may have facilitated their relapse.

Tobacco Introduction Progression At Risk Groups For Tobacco Use Chemical composition of tobacco smoke Known physical complications Psychological complications Social complications The advantages of stopping smoking Physical and social benefits of smoking cessation Withdrawal symptoms Passive smoking INTRODUCTION Since it was first suggested in 1898 that smoking may result in lung cancer, many studies have examined the effect of tobacco smoke on active and passive smokers. As the social and economic costs of tobacco-related problems are enormous, medical practitioners and health workers play an important role in educating smokers of the risks and promoting the health benefit of quitting. PROGRESSION Although initial inhalation of cigarette smoke can produce palpitations, dizziness, sweating, nausea, and vomiting, tolerance to these symptoms develops rapidly but can take up to 3 years. Physical dependence on nicotine, and even more important, psychological dependence to cigarettes, soon develops. 'Smokers cough' (a manifestation of bronchitis) typically occurs early in the smoker's career. Physical problems occurring later are numerous � lung cancer, respiratory diseases and problems, cardiovascular diseases including stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Fertility difficulties may occur in both males and females. AT RISK GROUPS FOR TOBACCO USE Family history of smoking � especially young children of smokers, and other first degree relatives. People (usually younger persons) susceptible to peer group pressure. Influences may include: friends who smoke spouse/partner smokes image and social acceptability co-workers who smoke. People with extroverted personalities: impulsive, arousal-seeking, risk-taking. People prone to the effects of stress and tension. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF TOBACCO SMOKE Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 compounds, many of which have been linked to human disease. Nicotine � a highly toxic chemical which primarily acts on the nervous system and causes : increases in heart rate increases in blood pressure constriction of blood vessels increased blood fatty acids and platelet stickiness. Carbon monoxide � as it avidly displaces oxygen from haemoglobin it produces a relative hypoxia that is particularly dangerous to those with precarious tissue oxygenation: eg in IHD (ischaemic heart disease) and PVD (peripheral vascular disease), especially in diabetics. It also has psychomotor performance effects. Tar � a carcinogenic substance containing more than a dozen cancer producing chemicals. Glycoprotein � acts as an allergen. Nitrosamines � carcinogenic in animals and suspected to be so in humans. Benzo(a)pyrene and phenols � known human carcinogens. Oxides of nitrogen � may induce and worsen emphysema. Hydrogen cyanide � a particularly toxic agent in cigarette smoke which can impair cardiac function. KNOWN PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS Cardiovascular Malignancies Respiratory Complications related to pregnancy and reproduction Gastrointestinal Degenerative disease Traumatic and accidental Cardiovascular Hypertension Ischaemic heart disease Myocardial infarction Heart failure Cerebral vascular events Cardiac arrythmias and conduction disorders Pulmonary circulation disorders Aortic and aneurysms, peripheral vascular disease Malignancies Trachea, bronchus and lung Oral cavity: tongue, gums, floor of mouth Pharyngeal cancers Oesophagus Larynx Stomach Pancreas Bladder Renal pelvis and parenchyma Salivary glands Nasal cavities, middle ear and sinuses Breast cancer Uterine cervix Ovary and adnexae Prepuce and penile cancer Respiratory Malignancies Chronic obstructive airways disease Asthma; especially in children (passive smoking effect) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Neonatal respiratory disorders Pneumonia, influenza Tuberculosis Pneumoconioses Complications related to pregnancy and reproduction Low birth weight Miscarriage Placental abruption and premature labour Amenorrhoea, ovulation, fertilisation and implantation defects Impotence, decreased sperm count Gastrointestinal Peptic ulceration Ulcerative colitis Degenerative disease Parkinson's disease Osteoporosis Premature aging of the skin Traumatic and accidental Each year, more than 30 fire-related casualties are caused by smoking and matches. 53% of domestic fires are related to smoking. Toddlers and children are particularly susceptible to burns from cigarettes and ash, especially ocular burns. Toxic ingestion � butts are particularly toxic. PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS Most psychological and behavioural difficulties occur with the cessation of smoking and in the ambivalent phase leading up to the decision to quit. However, most withdrawal phenomena are short lived, and with continual abstinence, ex-smokers enjoy many positive psychological effects. Common psychological presentations of nicotine withdrawal: anxiety and tension irritability frustration anger difficulties with concentration and restlessness depression fatigue increased appetite. SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS Legal liability associated with passive smoking. Financial strain � 1 packet per day ($4.80) = $33.60 per week = $1752 per year. With increasing community disapproval of smoking, many workers report being ostracised at social events, restaurants, relatives and even at home especially where there are children. At work � impaired job performance secondary to illness, increased absenteeism and sick leave, psychological consequences of restlessness and impaired concentration as nicotine levels fall before cigarette breaks. THE ADVANTAGES OF STOPPING SMOKING Ex-smokers live longer than those who continue to smoke. The extent to which life span improves depends on the length of time since quitting, number of cigarettes smoked over how many years and the health status of the ex-smoker. However, quitting is beneficial even in the presence of disease, eg patients with chronic obstructive airways disease will have improved lung function and symptomatology. Even lung cancer patients can help avoid second cancers and terminal respiratory infections. Of course, early cessation, with the support of education from health professionals and stop smoking programmes, will have greater health benefit by preventing the development of disease rather than its progression. Although health issues are often given as the main reason for stopping smoking, for those who have yet to develop disease these events may be far less relevant than social or financial issues, or the health of their family. Medical practitioners and other health care workers can help by emphasising the positive benefits of quitting. Discussion of withdrawal symptoms with the patient can also help them prepare for the process of quitting. It may be worthwhile for health professionals to think about their own behaviour and attitudes to smoking and how this affects their advice to patients. PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF SMOKING CESSATION Increased life expectancy Improved health of family Improved physical fitness and appearance Improved sense of well being Positive psychological changes; enhanced self esteem and sense of self control Improved social standing and finances Restoration of sense of taste and smell Better work performance. WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS It should be emphasised that most of these are short lived when discussing them with the patient (eg symptoms usually peak about 3 days after cessation and the withdrawal, usually mild, is over within 7-10 days for most people). Discussion of withdrawal symptoms is not to discourage the uncommitted from the attempt, but rather to help the patient be better prepared for quitting, especially if it is his or her first attempt. Psychological symptoms Physical symptoms How medical practitioners and other health care workers can help Individual approaches General and community approaches Psychological symptoms Intense cravings for cigarettes � they are usually brief (10-15 minutes) and tend to recede with time Irritability and restlessness Impatience Dejection and sorrow � it is not uncommon to report a sense of grief and mourning for a 'lost companion' Depression Difficulty in concentrating Anxiety and tension Frustration Anger Fatigue. Physical symptoms Sore throat Dizziness Headache Coughing � often productive, as the respiratory cilia are no longer paralysed and can clear the lungs of accumulated debris Tremor, perspiration Floating feeling � distance judgement may be affected Increased effect of caffeine Sleep disturbance Increased appetite � 'looking for the cigarette in the fridge'. Weight gain should be brought up specifically as it is often an unspoken fear in women. Only half of smokers will gain weight of which the average is 2.3 kg. It is said that a weight gain of 30 kg is needed to offset the health benefits of quitting. Positive changes in lipid profile and body fat distribution also occur. The patient can be encouraged to avoid weight gain with an exercise programme and have low kilojoule prepared snacks at hand. HOW MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS CAN HELP Individual approaches A good start is to document each patient's smoking history as part of general history-taking on initial presentation. When time allows, the patient can be encouraged to talk about their smoking using a non-judgemental question such as, 'How do you feel about your smoking?' A helpful model to use when assessing the smoker's readiness to quit identifies three stages: Not ready � They are likely to become defensive and resistant to simple advice to stop. Gentle encouragement of the patient to think about their habit and making it clear that you are available for further support is the most effective approach. Unsure � The advantages of continuing to smoke are still as important as the advantages of quitting. Discussion can focus on weighing up the pros and cons and any other specific concerns. Ready � They will respond positively to advice to stop and can be given more specific help on how to deal with withdrawal symptoms. Provide follow-up to encourage their efforts and deal with continuing difficulties (Mendelssohn and Richmond, 1992). It is therefore useful to identify how ready the patient is to change in order to provide the most appropriate individual assistance. An approach that helps the patient to take control and responsibility for the problem is more likely to be successful than systematically giving advice to stop or telling the patient what to do. Relapses Many ex-smokers relapse, especially in the setting of social events, peer pressure and alcohol. Patients should be encouraged to view these as learning experiences, and to learn from there how to avoid future relapses when they try again. Subsequent attempts are often easier for this reason. Additional approaches Nicotine chewing gum � useful for the very physically dependent. The chewing tablets can prevent withdrawal symptoms. The patient should follow the enclosed instructions carefully to avoid unpleasant side effects. Nicotine patches � useful for very physically dependent but motivated patients. Manufacturers emphasise the need for concomitant support from the medical practitioner. Acupuncture Hypnosis Specialist clinics Self-help and GP assistance kits.

General and community approaches Assist in educational programmes, especially in schools. Young people and women are particularly likely to take up smoking. If you smoke yourself, try to give up smoking or at least not smoke publicly. Have a non-smoking policy in your workplace and other workplaces that you may visit. Be aware of the consequences of smoking, and know of the referral agencies available to help smokers. Congratulate people when they finally break the habit. Sympathise and offer encouragement to those people who require additional support and time to give up smoking. PASSIVE SMOKING Recent evidence has come to light showing the harmful effects of tobacco smoke on the health of non-smokers. Cigarette smoke can be separated into two components, mainstream smoke which is inhaled by the active smoker, and sidestream smoke, the unfiltered smoke released from the end of a lit cigarette, which results in passive smoking in non-smokers. The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted by the knowledge that 85% of cigarette smoke is released as sidestream smoke. Since the sidestream smoke is unfiltered it contains higher concentrations of dangerous chemicals. The effects of this harmful smoke in non-smokers can lead to increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, and other chest illness in children, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, lung cancer and lung disease. In addition, the irritants in tobacco smoke are a major concern to people with asthma and people with allergies, especially of the eyes, nose and throat. Recent estimates suggest that annually approximately 150 deaths from lung cancer and 1000 deaths from heart disease in Australia are due to passive smoking (Holman, Armstrong, Arias et al., 1988). Health risks of passive smoking Higher concentrations of cancer-causing agents in sidestream smoke. Aggravation of asthma. Aggravation of allergic conditions � cigarette smoke results in irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, and also headaches and coughs in non-smokers. Cancer, particularly lung cancer. Respiratory illness is increased � noticeable in children of active smokers who suffer from more acute respiratory illness, wheezing, middle ear infections, sore throats and problems of lung infection. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Growth � may be a combination of the mother smoking during pregnancy, and passive smoking by the child after birth. Increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, and chest illness in adults and children. Meningitis � recent studies indicate a possible association between meningococcal disease and passive smoking during childhood. Heart disease � increases the risk of coronary heart disease. At work The legal ramifications of smoking in the workplace are now becoming apparent. In Australia there have been at least 10 cases since 1980 where workers have received compensation for injuries incurred as a result of passive smoking in the workplace. As a result increasing numbers of employers are making their workplaces smoke-free.

Cannabis Introduction Cannabinoids Pharmacology Effects of cannabis At risk groups and social factors Physical complications Tolerance and dependence INTRODUCTION The universal term cannabis is used to identify the psychotropic product from the plant Cannabis sativa. Cannabis sativa is one of man's oldest cultivated plants, being used for its fibrous qualities (hemp) as well as its perceived medicinal properties. CANNABINOIDS The pharmacologically active compounds in cannabis are termed cannabinoids. The major active isolate in cannabis has been identified as D9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). As it is lipid soluble, it may remain in the body tissues for many days after a single dose. Recent studies have documented a number of health, social and psychological problems related to the regular use of cannabis. Major health concerns revolve around the knowledge that the cannabis of today is markedly (10-15 times) stronger than the cannabis used in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Consequently, previous studies examining the health and psychological risks associated with cannabis use, may not be valid today. Pharmacologic effects also differ according to the method of consumption. If cannabis is smoked a 'high' is attained much more quickly. In contrast, the effects of cannabis taken orally are much less potent, although more long-lasting. Additive effects are observed with alcohol and other CNS depressants, but no clear interaction has been noted with stimulants. PHARMACOLOGY The major component of cannabis (THC) is fat soluble, which means it can remain for long periods in the fatty tissues of the body. Such lipid soluble drugs tend to leave the blood stream quickly and distribute themselves to fatty tissues, such as the brain and cell membranes Since THC becomes stored in body tissues and is only released into the blood stream over a period of days or weeks, accumulation of THC may occur. As a result of this accumulation, regular cannabis users may be under the influence of cannabis at any time, and be unaware of the dangers of this. Another concern is the possible accumulation of THC in the brain, which may in time result in brain damage. EFFECTS OF CANNABIS Feelings of self confidence, euphoria, well being and relaxation Altered perception of time and space, and heightened perceptions of taste, smell, touch, and hearing Dissociation of ideas Difficulties with concentration and memory Other cognitive impairment Psychomotor impairment Delusions and hallucinations. AT RISK GROUPS AND SOCIAL FACTORS Young adolescents - particularly males a documented concern is the harmful effects of cannabis use on the maturing process of adolescents Persons with a predisposition to schizophrenia and mental illness Those of lower socioeconomic status and fewer years of formal schooling Young people with friends who are illicit drug users. PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS Reproductive effects Respiratory effects Cardiovascular effects Immunity Neuropsychiatric complications Social problems Reproductive effects Decrease in libido Impaired fertility in males, cannabis use diminishes testosterone production and decreases sperm count; also results in abnormal shape and chemical composition of the sperm cells in females, cannabis can affect fertility by disrupting the reproductive cycle through changes to ovulation and menstrual cycles Another concern is the possibility of foetal damage during pregnancy (see Chapter 12, Drugs in Pregnancy) Suppression of the sex hormones Interference with growth, sexual maturation and menstruation In the long term may result in impotence, loss of normal sex drive and infertility Heavy cannabis use produces a change in personality and in behaviour that is more dramatically demonstrated by children and adolescents than it is by adults. Respiratory effects Cannabis is known to be both mutagenic and carcinogenic as well as destructive to lung parenchyma and epithelial cells Lung cancer risk comparable to smoking tobacco since cannabis smoke is inhaled deeply, held for much longer and contains more tar than tobacco, the adverse effects are greater. As a result, smoking 2-3 cannabis cigarettes may carry the same risk of lung damage as smoking a whole packet of tobacco cigarettes. Cancer of the upper respiratory and digestive tracts Head and neck cancer Emphysema Increased susceptibility to respiratory infections (eg chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma and rhinopharyngitis) Mild airway obstruction. Cardiovascular effects Cannabis inhalation results in an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and conjunctival injection. Persons with hypertension, cerebral vascular disease and ischaemic heart disease may be at increased susceptibility to these effects. Immunity Mild impairment of immunity and immune reactions: clinical significance unclear. Neuropsychiatric complications Impairs motor coordination, short-term memory, tracking ability, sensory functions and learning ability Headaches and dizziness Adverse reactions (occur more frequently in individuals who are under stress, anxious, depressed, or who are predisposed to functional psychoses) mild anxiety panic and paranoia, confusion and delusional thinking acute psychosis, detachment from reality, hallucinations or illusions paranoid schizophrenia (it is not yet known whether cannabis precipitates schizophrenia, or if those with schizophrenia are more likely to be attracted to using cannabis as a form of self medication) dissociation of ideas, distortions of time and space, compulsiveness sleeplessness depression amotivational syndrome cannabis use has been associated with apathy and antisocial behaviours observed inability of users to incorporate and use new skills, which may delay the maturation process some adolescents who use cannabis have been observed to be devoid of the drive and energy normally seen in adolescents impaired ability to memorise and concentrate diminished scholastic and/or job performance introversion It is not yet understood whether cannabis use causes the above problems, or whether they occur as a symptom of an underlying disorder such as mental illness, or social problems revolving around the family, friends or school. Social problems Truancy can cause problems at school which may eventuate in dropping out of school at an early age and possible delinquent behaviour Deterioration of academic or job performance Legal problems Ability to operate machinery, or drive a car etc. is impaired Loss of job or problems at work resulting from cannabis use. TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE Tolerance Dependence Withdrawal Tolerance Signs and symptoms of tolerance, and also dependence, may persist for months in very heavy users. THC accumulates in adipose tissue and can take weeks or months to be totally excreted. Dependence Frequent use of cannabis can produce mild physical dependence and, as a consequence, withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal The withdrawal usually starts several hours after cessation of use, is usually mild and is over within a matter of days for most users. Some of the symptoms experienced may include: anxiety depression sleep and appetite disturbances irritability tremors perspiration nausea muscle twitching restlessness weight loss gastrointestinal upsets.

COCAINE Introduction Production and administration Current patterns of use At risk groups Physical and neuropsychiatric effects Overdose and toxic reactions Physical problems pertaining to the method of administration Social problems Tolerance and dependence Withdrawal Treatment of cocaine use Methods of treatment INTRODUCTION Cocaine is an alkaloid of the coca shrub and exhibits anaesthetic, vasoconstrictor and central stimulant properties. It has effects on a number of neurotransmitter systems in the brain and is active at many anatomical sites within the central nervous system. PRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATION Cocaine is prepared from the coca plant and initially is in the form of a salt (cocaine hydrochloride). This salt can be inhaled into the nostril and absorbed into the bloodstream across the nasal mucosa. The cocaine salt can also be converted to the free base of cocaine with volatile solvents which must then be carefully removed. The free base cocaine is then burnt with inhalation of the smoke resulting in very rapid and efficient absorption across the alveolar membranes of the lungs. The third method of cocaine administration is intravenous injection of the cocaine salt. It is generally considered that most cocaine users begin with intra-nasal administration and later progress to injecting use or inhalation of smoke. CURRENT PATTERNS OF USE Cocaine was only discovered in Western Europe in the 19th century but had been used for centuries by South American Indians. In the past two decades consumption of cocaine has increased in America, Western Europe and more recently in Australia. In the mid-1980s ready made free base cocaine was marketed in the streets of American cities and became known as 'crack'. Crack, a much cheaper and more accessible version of cocaine, is widespread among lower socioeconomic groups particularly in the inner-city areas dominated by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States of America. In contrast, the users of the crystalline form of cocaine, which is inhaled, have generally been identified as those who are better educated and of a higher socioeconomic status. These socioeconomic differences, together with the different preparations of cocaine, pose problems when attempting to propose general treatment guidelines. Fox and Mathews (1992) report that in the United States, 25 000 000 people have used cocaine at least once with 6 000 000 Americans admitting use within the previous month and 3 000 000 using the drug continuously. Furthermore, 10% of pregnant women admitted to cocaine use at least once in the antenatal period. In Australia levels of use are much lower, with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority 1988-1989 reporting figures of 84 500 users in the past 12 months and 6640 regular users. Contrary to popular perception, patterns of cocaine use in Australia have remained relatively stable between the years of 1985 and 1991. This is probably a consequence of the relative lack of availability and expense of cocaine. The only group in Australia to show an increase in use, were women in their early twenties and early thirties (Fox and Mathews, 1992). Cocaine is a highly addictive drug, although there is disagreement in the research as to whether cocaine produces physical withdrawal symptoms. In general, the research suggests that cocaine does not produce physical dependence and a withdrawal syndrome. AT RISK GROUPS Generally, regular users of cocaine are a very small group in Australia and are largely confined to the more affluent groups in the cities. Those most at risk could include: those educated, most probably to university level higher socioeconomic status single young people women in their late twenties and thirties. PHYSICAL AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC EFFECTS The intensity, and sometimes the nature, of cocaine's effects are governed by: the form of the drug the route of administration the dose of the drug the timing, as well as the chronicity of dosage. Low dose effects High dose effects Long-term effects Low dose effects Improved performance Increased confidence Increased energy Exhilaration Enhances physical and mental well-being Increased rate of respiration resulting in rapid shallow breathing Increased temperature Spasm of local blood vessels Enlarged pupils Cardiac arrhythmias Suppressed appetite Insomnia. High dose effects Loss of coordination Tremors Dizziness Muscle twitches Severe agitation Confusion Paranoid symptoms Headaches Cold sweat Pallor Nausea and vomiting Weak, rapid pulse Anxiety reaction. Long-term effects Heightened reflexes Muscle twitching Increased pulse rate Loss of appetite Insomnia Cardiac arrhythmias including malignant arrhythmias Angina Myocardial infarction Cocaine psychosis � paranoid delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations Tactile hallucinations Violent or aggressive behaviour Decreased libido/impotence. OVERDOSE AND TOXIC REACTIONS Deaths from cocaine usually result from high sensitivity to the drug or massive overdose. Deaths from overdose may occur regardless of route of administration. In most cases the reported lethal dose of pure cocaine is approximately 1.2 grams to 1.4 grams. Most common causes of death are: respiratory paralysis cardiac arrhythmia repeated convulsions suffocation allergic reactions stroke, caused by sudden increases in blood pressure pregnancy. PHYSICAL PROBLEMS PERTAINING TO THE METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Intra-nasal (generally 60% of use) runny, stuffy nose sinusitis epistaxis nasal ulcers perforation of the nasal septum Injecting (generally 10% of use) systemic and local infections which may be viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic local inflammatory and infective complications are more common than with injected heroin due to intense vasoconstriction from cocaine abscesses at injection sites bacterial endocarditis hepatitis B and hepatitis C HIV / AIDS Pulmonary inhalation (eg free base smoking � generally about 30% of use) sore throat melanoptysis or bloody sputum may impair gaseous diffusion across alveolar membranes SOCIAL PROBLEMS Interpersonal problems marital or family separations heightened discord in relationships Financial problems tolerance to cocaine develops rapidly and as a result costs escalate readily limited or exhausted income with mounting debts Vocational problems job loss, or impaired productivity absenteeism loss of professional licence or certification Legal problems arrest probation parole TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE Cocaine dependence occurs without the specific physiological withdrawal symptoms observed with the abstinence of alcohol, benzodiazepines and opiates. Cocaine dependence is likely to develop within a social/occupational context. Initial tolerance to cocaine develops rapidly, but thereafter cocaine users seldom seem to develop tolerance for increased amounts. Tolerance may not be obvious because of the tendency to mix cocaine use with other drugs, in particular heroin (known as a speedball), to enhance effects. WITHDRAWAL Withdrawal from cocaine generally takes place in three phases. The first being 'the crash', which describes withdrawal symptoms experienced immediately after the cessation of use (usually the first 2-4 days of abstinence). Symptoms may include agitation, depression, high craving and fatigue. The second phase is that of withdrawal. This phase may last up to 10 weeks and is characterised by depression, lack of energy and anxiety, high craving and angry outbursts. The last phase, extinction, may last indefinitely and is characterised by episodic cravings for cocaine, usually in response to conditioned cues. Such cravings may surface many months or years after drug use has ceased (Gawin and Kleber, 1984). Other symptoms experienced during withdrawal may include: sleep disorders vivid dreams hyperphagia irritability nausea muscle aches lethargy. TREATMENT OF COCAINE USE Fisher, S., Raskin, A. and Ulenhuth, E.H. (eds). Cocaine: clinical and biobehavioural aspects. Oxford University Press, New York, 1987.(7) There are no specific methods of treatment for users of this drug and management follows the general principles of management of other drugs. Treatment must take into account: amount of use pattern and duration of use degree of psychosocial disruption and impairment of impulse control medical, social and psychiatric characteristics prior treatment responses treatment needs vary based on the severity of dependence and the above factors. METHODS OF TREATMENT Behavioural approach Psychodynamic approach Self-help groups Combined approach Behavioural approach Often known as contingency contracting, this method focuses and magnifies cocaine's aversive effects. It consists of the negotiation of an agreement between the doctor or health worker and patient regarding the consequences following any further administration of cocaine. The agreement usually takes the from of a written contract authorising the doctor or health worker to notify specific individuals � eg employer, spouse � of any confirmed consumption of cocaine. The patient must also agree to participate in a urine-monitoring program. Metabolites of cocaine can be detected in the urine samples for 48-72 hours after use, although cocaine itself is metabolised from the body within 30 minutes of ingestion. A problem with this approach is that few patients are willing to accept a contract which may link them with serious consequences following a relapse to cocaine use. Psychodynamic approach Psychodynamic treatment aims to understand the functions that cocaine has played in the abuser's life and to help him or her serve these functions without drugs. Self-help groups Self-help groups provide structure, limits and a helping network. Self-help groups modelled upon lines of Alcoholics Anonymous have been developed in the United States (called Cocaine Anonymous). At this time there are no specific self-help groups in Australia for cocaine users. However, cocaine users could be helped by groups like Narcotics Anonymous (refer Chapter 18, Community Support Services). Combined approach A combination of all three orientations � behavioural, supportive and psychodynamic � is probably the most common form of treatment for both inpatient and outpatient settings. Present and future hazards of this drug should be outlined to the patient and a treatment plan worked out with them. The use of tricyclic antidepressant drugs to reduce craving from cocaine has shown promise in experimental work in the United States. None of the other pharmacological approaches so far tested, however, appear to offer promise.

The recreational sniffing of gases and solvents has become relatively common, particularly among adolescents in Australia, with the mean age of solvent abusers being 12 to 15 years. Petrol sniffing is a particularly common practice among the youth of Aboriginal settlements in the outback. Volatile substances include petroleum fuels, propellants from aerosol products, chlorinated hydrocarbons, glue, nail polish remover, antifreeze, paint thinners and anaesthetic products. All of these substances are fat soluble and are stored in the fat deposits within the body, particularly in the brain. This leads to a prolonged effect on the level of consciousness even hours after the inhalation has stopped. This is an extremely dangerous practice and sudden death may occur even during the first usage. ADMINISTRATION AND USE Substances are generally placed into a plastic bag, or some other vessel, and placed directly over the nose and mouth and inhaled deeply. The effect of substances inhaled in this manner produces alterations in the level of consciousness including a pleasurable feeling of intoxication and visual hallucinations. PROBLEMS Behavioural indicators of use Physical effects Withdrawal effects The most important problem of volatile solvent use is the occurrence of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias due to intoxication. Respiratory depression can also occur. Pathological changes occurring in solvent abuse include myocardial damage and cerebral oedema. Another major concern with petrol sniffing is lead poisoning (except with the use of unleaded petrol). At this time there is no generally accepted means of treating organic lead poisoning, and the neurological and other manifestations of tetra-ethyl lead poisoning (TEL) absorption must be deemed to be effectively irreversible. There is general agreement that repeated exposure to solvents induces tolerance, though there are doubts about physical addiction; however, psychological dependence is common. Behavioural indicators of use Persistent truancy from school Unruly behaviour Lack of attention (often identifiable in the classroom) Frequent use of handkerchiefs Continual sniffing or sucking of shirt sleeves or jacket sleeves A change in sleep pattern Truculent moody behaviour, difficult communication with parents or teachers. Physical effects The effects of a single use, whilst potentially very dangerous, usually wear off after a few hours and the cardiovascular symptoms predominate. The most common toxic effects are cardiac arrhythmias and asphyxia from enhancement of inhalation of volatile substances via the use of plastic bags etc. Chronic headache, sinusitis, diminished cognitive function, ataxia and peripheral neuropathy all accompany chronic use. The neurological sequelae convey the most long-term morbidity and disability. Other symptoms include: chronic or frequent cough tinnitus chest pain or angina nosebleeds extreme tiredness or weakness increased nasal secretions red, watery eyes a dreamlike state with hallucinations depression and/or anxiety shortness of breath indigestion dizziness stomach ulcers deep inhalation over short periods of time may cause disorientation, unconsciousness or seizures the sniffing of some petrols may cause a particular type of lead poisoning, features of which are: liver damage acute and chronic inflammation of the kidneys and multiple abscesses cerebellar hemisphere degeneration inorganic lead poisoning causing anaemia and other effects on the blood. Withdrawal effects Effects of inhalation are immediate, lasting from 5 to 45 minutes after cessation of sniffing. While initial effects may fade after several minutes, depending on the method of inhalation, effects may be felt for several hours. For most users effects will pass within an hour of ceasing inhalation of the volatile substance. Chronic users may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to those experienced from a general anaesthetic. Hangover effects may persist for several days, and may be characterised by: tremor headache nausea vomiting mild abdominal pain loss of appetite fatigue muscular cramps delirium. THE MANAGEMENT OF ABUSERS OF VOLATILE SUBSTANCES As mentioned previously most users of volatile substances are young adolescents (12-15 years). While most abusers are recreational users and generally cease use of their own volition, in some groups there is predominantly chronic or dependent use, eg among Aboriginal youths. Management of abuse of volatile substances is extremely complex and calls for a multidisciplinary approach. The general practitioner plays a pivotal role through assessment, management and referral of the young user to appropriate counselling services. Community centres which provide drug counsellors in specific treatment areas should be found in the region in which the GP practices. Individual and group counselling can be provided which helps to develop some sharing of the problem with therapists, parents and others in the family. Health education explaining the dangers and the possible complications is important, and should be followed by other forms of therapy such as vocational counselling. The development of social skills is also important. In some cases the use of computer games as a means of stimulating recreational activity has been found useful in those young people who are seeking and achieving abstinence from solvents. A video role-play approach has also been found to be helpful by using the role-play in discussions involving resolution of crisis and difficulties in relationships with parents or other members of the family. These films can be used in the education of other abusers of volatile substances. Hypnotherapy can be helpful, particularly for those who have developed excitability and emotional volatility, and who are difficult to handle because of the continuing abuse. However, hypnotherapy should be used only in conjunction with other techniques in aiming to change the behaviour and the personal and emotional background in which the solvent abuser lives.

Drugs in pregnancy Introduction Health risks associated with non-medical drug use during pregnancy Special effects of individual drugs INTRODUCTION Drug use in pregnancy should be reduced to a minimum. This is because the embryo and foetus are more sensitive to the effects of all drugs. Rapidly developing tissues are particularly vulnerable. The placenta is not a barrier to the passage of most drugs, so it should be assumed that drugs taken during pregnancy will reach the foetus in at least small amounts. Pregnant women who are identified as using drugs should be referred for specialist management. HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NON-MEDICAL DRUG USE DURING PREGNANCY Increased risk of a low birth weight and developmental delay Increased perinatal mortality Increased risk of complications during pregnancy such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malnutrition, anaemia, sexually transmitted diseases and respiratory depression, all of which can affect the unborn child as well as the mother Higher incidence of congenital abnormalities Higher incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (4-5 fold) in infants born to drug-dependent mothers. SPECIAL EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL DRUGS Alcohol Tobacco Cannabis Opiates Barbiturates Cocaine Amphetamines Benzodiazepines LSD Ecstasy Solvents and other volatile hydrocarbons Caffeine Further Information Alcohol It has been known for centuries that alcohol taken in excess during pregnancy may damage the foetus. The risks of prematurity, small for gestational age and miscarriage as well as a wide variety of congenital abnormalities are all trebled in drinkers, and these should be regarded as non-specific risks of alcohol consumption. The effects of alcohol on the foetal brain, however, are fairly specific and the following clinical points are important: The time of greatest sensitivity of the foetal brain is the third trimester, so that if the patient can achieve abstinence by then, the baby's brain may escape damage. The foetal brain is exquisitely sensitive to alcohol during the third trimester and the first twelve months after birth. Epidemiological studies have failed to demonstrate a threshold dose for risk. Therefore total abstinence is the only responsible advice to give. Foetal Alcohol Syndrome should only be diagnosed if the criteria are met (see below). Other foetal effects seen in association with alcohol should be called Foetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). Risk factors for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Alcohol intake � the foetal effects of alcohol are related to quantity, frequency and timing of use. A single dose of more than 5 drinks very early in pregnancy or an average of 2 drinks per day in later pregnancy (second or third trimester) has been associated with subsequent learning difficulties in childhood (Streissguth, Barr and Sampson, 1990). Nutritional status of the mother � those who are undernourished can attain higher blood alcohol levels and decrease their capacity to metabolise alcohol Parity � short intervals between births has been found to be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations and severity of FAS Alcohol-related conditions that may complicate pregnancy: cirrhosis other liver problems anaemia gastritis gastrointestinal bleeding delirium tremens diabetes pancreatitis sexually transmitted diseases tuberculosis. Multiple drug use � women who drink heavily are also more likely to smoke heavily and possibly to use other drugs, all of which may have a cumulative harmful effect on the developing foetus Medication � alcohol reduces the effectiveness of anaesthetics and analgesics Increased risk of spontaneous abortion � with heavy and even moderate alcohol consumption Increased risk of complicated birth � higher risk of breech birth (15% as opposed to 3%). Characteristics of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) A diagnosis of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome requires: (9) growth retardation prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation weight and/or height below the 10th percentile when corrected for gestational age. CNS abnormalities eg neurological abnormality, developmental delay, behavioural dysfunction or deficit, intellectual impairment and/or structural abnormalities such as microcephaly or brain malformation. facial abnormalities underdevelopment of the 'middle 1/3' of the face including short palpebral fissures, an elongation mid-face, a long and flattened philtrum, thin upper lip and flattened maxilla. Other abnormalities include: increased neonatal death rate slow physical development in the first few years of life other physical features cardiac defects ear anomalies large haemangiomata small nails altered palmar crease patterns joint and limb abnormalities. Tobacco Smoking during and after pregnancy can have many adverse effects on the child. The most important toxin in tobacco smoke is nicotine which has been shown to impair placental function by: reduced placental vascularisation constriction of placental arterioles thickening of the endothelium of placental blood vessels thus interfering with placental well being and maturity as well as nutrient transfer. Carbon monoxide levels in the mother also reduces oxygen availability for foetal tissues. Health risks of smoking during pregnancy Retardation in foetal growth; on average a reduction in birth weight of 200 g. It should be highlighted to women that smoking cessation is still beneficial to the foetus at any time during the pregnancy. Those women who stop smoking before becoming pregnant have babies of similar birth weight to women who have never smoked. Women who stop smoking in the initial 3-4 months of pregnancy and abstain for the rest of the pregnancy have similar weight babies as non-smoking women. Even women who stop as late as week 30 of their pregnancy have heavier babies than those women who smoke throughout the entire pregnancy. The risk of low birth weight increases by about a third in mothers who continue to regularly smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day after the fourth month of pregnancy. Congenital malformation � an association has been found between smoking and cleft palate, microcephalus and club foot. Spontaneous abortion � higher rates in women who smoke and is also related to the number of cigarettes smoked. Effects on foetal heart rate � nicotine increases the baby's heart rate and carbon monoxide results in impaired oxygen transport. Paternal and passive smoking also has a harmful effect on the unborn child. Maternal undernutrition. The risk of harmful effects to the foetus is greater in older mothers who smoke than in younger mothers who smoke. Perinatal risks Increased risk of perinatal mortality (about 35%) greater incidence of placenta praevia, abruptio placentae, ante partum haemorrhage and premature delivery higher incidence of complications during pregnancy can result in increased likelihood of stillbirths, asphyxia, pneumonia, prematurity and neonatal deaths from respiratory distress syndrome these risks are partly as a consequence of the absorption of harmful chemicals through the placenta, the most important toxin being carbon monoxide. Infant risks Respiratory disorders Sudden Infant Death Syndrome increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, acute otitis media and persistent middle ear effusions, eye, nose and throat disorders and impaired lung development parents and others who smoke can cause as well as aggravate disorders such as asthma, wheezing, and allergies in their children. Long-term body growth � smoking during and after pregnancy may affect the attainment of final height and also retard the growth of head and chest circumference. Increased risk of febrile seizures. School performance may be retarded through repeated absences due to illness, malaise and hearing problems. Increased risk of meningococcal infection. Increased problems for children with cystic fibrosis. Babies can also be at risk from mothers who smoke and breast feed smoking reduces breast milk supply nicotine can pass into the child's bloodstream from the breast milk breast milk is still beneficial to the child, since it protects from infection, but many smoking mothers are unaware of the transmission of harmful chemicals to the child through their breast milk. Foetal Tobacco Syndrome 'Foetal Tobacco Syndrome'Wakefield, M. and Wilson, D. Smoking during pregnancy: a literature review and working paper of the options for intervention. South Australian Health Commission, Adelaide, 1988(10) is a name that has been given to the growth retardation associated with maternal smoking. The term can be used when at least three of the four conditions listed below occur: The mother smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day throughout the pregnancy The mother had no evidence of hypertension during pregnancy specifically: no preeclampsia documentation of normal blood pressure at least once after the first trimester The newborn has symmetrical growth retardation at term (37 weeks), defined as: a birthweight less than 2 500 g a ponderal index [(weight in grams)/(length in centimetres)3 x 100] greater than 2.32 There are no other obvious causes of intrauterine growth retardation (eg congenital infection or anomaly). Other risks to children Poisoning � by cigarettes and cigarette ash Burns and eye injuries from lit cigarettes Matches and lighters � can cause serious accidents Role models � children are more likely to smoke if their parents do. Cannabis A specific concern with cannabis is the cumulative effect of _9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and how this may affect the child before and after birth. THC, the most active component of cannabis accumulates in the fatty tissues of the brain. At this stage of our knowledge it is difficult to ascertain a causal relationship between cannabis and damage to the foetus, often because mothers use combinations of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis. Health risks pertaining to cannabis use during pregnancy should be considered possible and a conservative approach taken. Several abnormalities of foetal development have been reported when pregnant women have used cannabis heavily. It must be emphasised that there is a high prevalence of cigarette and alcohol intake in association with cannabis use. Therefore it is difficult to differentiate the direct effects of cannabis. Suggested health risks of smoking cannabis during pregnancy Lower birth weights, length and head circumference Possible impairment of foetal brain development Relative prematurity Malformations toxic effects of the drug may possibly cause foetal anomalies Higher rate of miscarriage and perinatal death Cannabis use may reduce the foetal blood supply Cannabis may exacerbate other risk factors in pregnancy THC accumulates in breast milk may diminish milk supply. Effects observed in newborns Lethargic and slow to gain weight Increased startle reflex Tremors Poor self-quieting Failure to habituate to light Possible long-term developmental and behavioural effects are yet unknown. Opiates Regular use of illicit opiates endangers the health of the woman and her foetus through continual change in blood heroin levels, exposure to a diverse range of drugs and contaminants, and infections consequent upon injecting drug use. Due to lifestyle factors associated with opiate dependency, pregnant women in this population do not usually have adequate nutrition, necessary rest or sufficient antenatal care. Health risks of taking opiates during pregnancy General medical risks associated with injecting drug use that may affect the health and development of the foetus: HIV hepatitis B and hepatitis C endocarditis malnutrition anaemia sexually transmitted diseases. Obstetric complications Increased risk of miscarriage Increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation Increased risk of other obstetric complications � placental insufficiency, foetal distress, intrauterine death Risk of physical dependence in the foetus and subsequent withdrawal in the neonate (known as Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome) Opiate withdrawal or detoxification during pregnancy may induce abortion, or premature labour/foetal distress particularly before the 14th week or after the 32nd week respectively. If withdrawal is to be attempted it ideally should be undertaken between the 14th and 32nd weeks under close supervision. Opiate management options for pregnant drug-dependent women Opiate-dependent women generally have two management options: reduce opiate intake independently or attempt detoxification. Such a task is enormously difficult and results in many users returning to opiate use. Constantly changing states of intoxication and withdrawal can stress the foetus, particularly in the first and third trimesters enrol in a methadone maintenance program. Advantages of methadone maintenance programs It provides the woman with a daily dose of methadone which eliminates the fluctuating heroin blood levels experienced by mother and foetus during illicit opiate use. Women in methadone maintenance programs tend to have longer pregnancies, fewer obstetrical complications and infants who are larger for their gestational age than similar populations not in treatment (Giles et al., 1989). Methadone maintenance programs dramatically reduce the possibility of foetal exposure to unknown drugs and contaminants. Enrolment in methadone maintenance programs may provide the woman with sufficient antenatal care and parenting education and support. This is important for a population who are often highly stigmatised and unsupported. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) Many infants born to methadone-maintained women will experience some form of withdrawal, usually within 72 hours of birth. Such withdrawal is characterised by agitation, irritability, or by vomiting, diarrhoea or convulsions in extremely severe cases. This abstinence syndrome tends to respond well to morphine or phenobarbitone. Women who are stable on methadone maintenance programs should be encouraged to breastfeed. The amount of methadone in breast milk is minute and unlikely to harm the infant in the first three to six months of life. When breastfeeding is ceasing, the infant must be weaned slowly as there is a risk of withdrawal. Barbiturates Health risks of taking barbiturates during pregnancy Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Increased risk of congenital malformations such as dysmorphic facial features, digital hypoplasia and growth retardation. Cocaine Neurobehavioural abnormalities develop in the children of cocaine-addicted mothers. These children show signs of deficiencies in mood control and abnormal motor development. In addition, such infants may develop a non-specific syndrome of cocaine withdrawal. Health risks of taking cocaine during pregnancy Increased risk of ante partum haemorrhage and abruptio placentae Significantly increases the rate of spontaneous abortions Smaller head circumference and body length Intrauterine growth retardation Restrictions in foetal growth have been observed which may be due to reduced oxygen supply to the baby caused by the blood vessel-constricting properties of such drugs Premature birth. Effects observed in newborn Excessive tremulousness Irritability Hypertonia Labile skin circulation with colour changes Persistent pulmonary hypertension Increased incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome depressed interactive behaviour excessive sleep poor feeding. A number of adverse effects upon the offspring of crack cocaine users have been reported overseas. These include transient neurological symptoms, which occur as a result of crack inhalation during pregnancy or passively after birth. Amphetamines The extent of harm associated with amphetamine use is unclear. Research is made difficult by the confounding effects of other drug use, poor nutritional status and lack of information on the frequency and dose of drug used (Wickes, 1992). Health risks of taking amphetamines during pregnancy There is a possible link between amphetamine use and congenital abnormalities Increased risk of spontaneous abortion Placental abruption Premature labour Foetal distress Small-for-date babies and growth-retarded babies Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome excessive sleep decreased interactive behaviour poor feeding. Benzodiazepines Health risks of taking benzodiazepines during pregnancy Some benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, poor feeding and impaired thermogenesis in the neonate � floppy baby syndrome Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, particularly if used in conjunction with other drugs. LSD Health risks of taking LSD during pregnancy The evidence is confusing and conflicting due to the difficulties with research as mentioned before. Ecstasy Little is known about the effects of the use of ecstasy on foetal development. The majority of evidence is based on animal studies. Health risks of taking ecstasy during pregnancy As yet, no study has been reported citing risks of ecstasy use during pregnancy. Since ecstasy is derived from amphetamine, the risks associated with amphetamine use during pregnancy would probably apply here also. Solvents and other volatile hydrocarbons Volatile organic solvents have been shown to have teratogenic effects on the growing foetus, such as physical malformations or functional impairment. Health risks of inhaling solvents during pregnancy Inhaled solvents reduce oxygen levels in body tissue thus reducing oxygen supply to the foetal brain Solvent inhalation may cause neonatal renal problems Exposure to some inhalants may decrease body weight and size Some solvents are embryotoxic Damage reproductive cells and thus impair future conception and pregnancy At high doses can cause the death of the foetus or even the mother Cleft palate Prenatal exposure may affect learning in early childhood. Caffeine Health risks of taking caffeine during pregnancy There may be an association between lower birth-weight and drinking in excess of five cups of coffee or tea, or six cans of cola drinks a day. Irregular foetal heart rate may be associated with excessive amounts of caffeine intake late in pregnancy. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome has been observed in babies whose mothers used excessive amounts of caffeine.

Should detoxification occur at home or in the hosptipal? Detoxification from alcohol Detoxification from benzodiazepines Detoxification from other sedatives/hypnotic drugs Detoxification from opiates Detoxification from polydrug use Detoxification from cannabis Detoxification from tobacco Detoxification from psychostimulants Should detoxification occur at home or in the hosptipal? In many instances effective detoxification can be performed in the home supported by the local doctor and other health workers. This should be considered when: there is no evidence of severe withdrawal, eg tremor, hallucinations, disorientation where there is no past history of delirium tremens or of fits in the presence of supportive relatives who elect to stay with the patient during the period of detoxification where there is no evidence of a medical illness such as pneumonia or pancreatitis when no previous history or evidence of suicide is contemplated where the patient does not have any access to the drug from which they are being withdrawn. These criteria mainly relate to detoxification from alcohol. DETOXIFICATION FROM ALCOHOL Should detoxification be medicated? That is, assisted by the use of controlled sedatives, or non-medicated in which no sedation is required. Non-medicated detoxification is quite appropriate for patients who have no coexisting medical disorders and when only a mild withdrawal can be anticipated. Non-medicated detoxification This process should be carried out in a safe environment, ideally in a quiet and comfortable home environment. The therapist involved must take a very low key and empathetic approach to the patient, and all guidelines should be explained very clearly both to the patient and his or her family. It is important to avoid confrontation and arguments during this management process. The therapist should regularly assess the orientation of the patient and his or her relationship with their environment. It is necessary to explain the illusions or hallucinations and when they occur to assist in controlling the anxiety produced by them. A balanced diet with daily use of oral thiamine is advised in all cases. Medicated detoxification from alcohol In the more severe cases medication is important and sedative treatment should be titrated against the severity of the patients withdrawal symptoms and signs. At no time should drug therapy be given to those patients who are still intoxicated. There are two main approaches: Tapering withdrawal regimen During mild withdrawal: sedate the patient for the first 24 hours administer 5-10 mg of diazepam every 6-8 hours as required reduce this dosage over 5-7 days. In more severe cases: 10-20 mg of diazepam, 6 hourly, reduced over a 5-7 day period. Loading dose The principle of this form of management is to use a loading dose in the first 48 hours and follow that with a reduction over the next 5-10 days. In mild withdrawal 5-10 mg of diazepam should be given every 6-8 hours as required by the patient's symptoms. In more severe cases a loading dose of 20 mg of diazepam may be given every two hours until sedation is achieved. No further medication is then given and the patient's signs reviewed on a four-hourly basis. No more than 120 mg should be given in the first 12 hours. On subsequent days 5-10 mg every six hours may be required but in most cases this is unnecessary. Diazepam is the drug of choice because both it and its metabolites have a long half-life: diazepam has a half-life of 18-40 hours active metabolites have a half-life of 2 to 5 days. Because of this a sufficient loading dose will usually be enough to cover the whole withdrawal period. Barbiturates and major tranquillisers should not be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal. There is also little value in the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs such as propranolol. Although these do produce some sedation there is a definite risk of inducing hyperglycemia and hypertension. Other aspects of management Vitamin therapy All patients treated for withdrawal from alcohol should receive thiamin to prevent the onset of Wernicke's Encephalopathy. An intravenous or intramuscular dose of 100 mg of thiamin immediately should be given and then orally 100 mg two to three times a day for two weeks. Electrolyte and fluid balance The fluid state of patients should be carefully assessed and a watchful eye kept for fluid depletion or fluid overload. DETOXIFICATION FROM BENZODIAZEPINES Withdrawal of benzodiazepines can be performed on an outpatient basis. This would need to occur over six weeks but in some cases this may be increased to 10-15 weeks. Withdrawal is managed by using a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam in a dose relevant to that of the drug in question. The following guidelines should be followed: a detailed history of total daily benzodiazepine use should be accurately determined the equivalent dose of diazepam should be calculated substitute diazepam (which has a long half-life) for other benzodiazepines maintain this dose for one week (ie stabilise the patient on this dosage) after stabilisation gradually withdraw the patient by 2.5-5 mg per week regular review and advice must be given to the patient at this difficult time cessation of the last few milligrams of diazepam can be very difficult for the patient. They may require support and encouragement particularly at this time refer to the NHMRC booklet on benzodiazepine dependence for more information (Brayley, Bradshaw and Pols, 1991). DETOXIFICATION FROM OTHER SEDATIVES/HYPNOTIC DRUGS The doctor's role in the community is firstly to prevent dependence by judicious and limited prescribing of sedatives and hypnotics for specific clinical situations on a short-term basis, and to manage the detoxification of those who have established dependence on these drugs. The withdrawal syndrome from the effect of barbiturates and other sedative hypnotics ranges in severity from mild anxiety, weakness, sweating and insomnia to an acute syndrome resembling delirium tremens. The latter may include convulsions, hallucinations and gross tremor and sweating. Such a withdrawal state may occur in those who are taking short-acting barbiturates, but often may be delayed several days in those who are taking longer-acting preparations such as phenobarbitone. Other symptoms and signs that may occur are hypertension, abdominal cramps, and anorexia. It is necessary to withdraw such patients on long-term sedation. At the outset a decision should be made whether formal detoxification is required. Formal detoxification from high dose barbiturates is potentially dangerous and should be carried out in a hospital setting. Phenobarbitone equivalents should be calculated, and withdrawal proceeded with a reduction in dose of 10-15% daily. Anticonvulsant cover may be indicated. In patients taking therapeutic doses of hypnotics at night it is usually safe to stop the drug and for a few days replace it with an equivalent dose of a long acting benzodiazepine, similar to that used for withdrawal from benzodiazepine dependence. The principle is to then wean the patient on a gradual basis. In the base of barbiturates, help should be sought from a drug and alcohol specialist before attempting detoxification. Such detoxification can be achieved in the home, but in patients with more severe dependence hospitalisation in a detoxification unit is advised. DETOXIFICATION FROM OPIATES The most common opiate in use today is heroin. Withdrawal from heroin occurs within 4-6 hours of the last administered dose. Symptoms include nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhoea, sweating and lacrimation. Anxiety, restlessness and irritability follow, and over the next 36 hours chills and muscle cramps, particularly intestinal cramps, may occur. Vomiting and diarrhoea are also common at this stage. The 'cold turkey' withdrawal without any medication will usually run a course of between 5-10 days depending upon the size of the patient's habit. In general the withdrawal syndrome from opiates is much less severe than withdrawal from sedative drugs or alcohol. Outpatient management of detoxification can be successfully used but should take place over 10-14 days. Patients need to be seen each day and be given only a 24 hour supply of their medication; this should be reviewed on a daily basis. A combination of clonidine and diazepam is recommended. Clonidine (Catapres) 150-130 micrograms 6 hourly up to 8 days. Diazepam (eg Valium) six hourly for 4 days should be given. Hourly review is required to check on withdrawal symptoms and blood pressure (daily review for outpatients). On day 4 the patient should be reassessed and the dose of each drug may be able to be gradually reduced over the following 10-14 days. When the withdrawal is more severe inpatient management is required. DETOXIFICATION FROM POLYDRUG USE Because of the complexities of the pharmacology involved in polydrug use and abuse it is unwise to contemplate withdrawal except in an inpatient environment. DETOXIFICATION FROM CANNABIS There is not a lot of evidence to support the idea that there is a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. This does not mean that it is easy for some people to stop using cannabis. Cessation of use may be situationally determined to a large degree. The presence of particular cues may lead to cannabis use. Cues may be internal or external. External cues may include mixing with a cannabis using group, a joint being shared or cannabis smoke at a party. Feeling bored, despondent or unhappy are all examples of internal cues which may lead to cannabis use. Management Management should follow the general principles of detoxification: help to assess patient motivation weigh up the costs and benefits of stopping identify the cues which lead to cannabis use devise a management plan for change. DETOXIFICATION FROM TOBACCO Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known (see Chapter 5, Tobacco). Any person smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day will experience nicotine withdrawal. This physical withdrawal is one aspect of relapse in smoking cessation. Withdrawal The recommendations of Richmond and Webster (1988) present a very useful approach to assisting patients to quit. There are a number of important principles: people have different levels of readiness for change people should be offered the opportunity to take each step which progresses to quitting and staying stopped people need to weigh up the costs and benefits of smoking and quitting people should be assisted to develop a specific action plan including written advice and information people should be offered support to quit: at home, at work and by health workers people are assisted by systematic follow up people may need specific help to stay stopped, eg nicotine gum, lifestyle counselling. Various approaches The 'happy user' These people should be informed about the risks to which they expose themselves and others. Provide written material to reinforce the information you have told them. Those thinking about quitting These people can be assisted by encouraging them to: review their tobacco use. estimating their nicotine dependence weigh up costs and benefits of smoking and quitting provide them with verbal and written information about stopping. Those who have decided to quit These people can be helped to do so by: helping them assess their specific risk factors habit patterns nicotine dependence high risk situations their confidence in stopping helping them to develop a specific plan set a quit day anticipate craving and withdrawal identify situations when there may be a temptation to smoke (eg with coffee, alcohol, when stressed) devise tactics to assist in coping with withdrawal symptoms: Delay: a tactic to reduce feelings of panic or anxiety, by continually delaying having a cigarette. After a few days craving will lessen and a sense of achievement and confidence will emerge. Distract: make a conscious effort to do something when a craving emerges. This may include counting, exercise, working, eating, drinking etc. Avoid: for the first two weeks try to avoid those high risk situations, triggers or cues which may produce craving for a cigarette. These may include coffee, alcohol, the pub/club, smoking friends etc. Over time these situations will be able to be faced with confidence. Escape: from situations that produce cravings when the tactics above fail. Leave the room, go outside or make a phone call. Such action will lower the urge to smoke and previous activities can be continued. providing them with verbal and written information on how to stop smoking planning with your patient ways to cope with a relapse. Explain that relapse is common and encourage them to try again or refer them to a specialist stop smoking clinic some patients may prefer to use a nicotine gum. Carefully explain the most effective way to gain results through this form of management. In particular, stress the need to chew the gum slowly and persist with the treatment for three months. Many people who have not found this form of treatment successful have not used the gum as instructed. Staying stopped These people can be assisted by: providing support and encouragement helping them identify the most difficult situations habitual smoking situational smoking pessimistic thinking feeling discouraged or low stress helping them develop contingency plans for slip-ups risk situations possible weight gain. DETOXIFICATION FROM PSYCHOSTIMULANTS (11) Detoxification from psychostimulants is generally effective using non-pharmacological management techniques. While abstinence is the preferred treatment goal, there is no evidence to suggest that tapered withdrawal is any less effective in the cessation of psychostimulant use. All patients undertaking detoxification should be encouraged to abstain from the use of other mind-altering drugs, such as alcohol or marijuana, which may act as triggers or conditioned cues for the use of psychostimulant drugs or reduce the ability of the individual to cope with cravings experienced during withdrawal. While most patients can undertake detoxification in an outpatient program, inpatient treatment may be more appropriate in the following circumstances: evidence of polydrug dependence where severe withdrawal is anticipated medical complications requiring close observation or treatment psychiatric complications (eg psychotic, suicidal) absence of social supports failed outpatient treatment specific therapies eg introducing cue exposure. Where inpatient treatment is necessary, programs should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient. While the goals of individuals will differ, all patients should remain in inpatient care until withdrawal symptoms subside. Non-pharmacological treatments There are a number of options available, all of which will not be appropriate for all patients. Motivational interviewing Behavioural approaches relaxation techniques undertake activities to delay cravings develop cognitive techniques which encourage the individual, and discourage the use of drugs encourage relapse prevention techniques (eg identifying, avoiding and dealing with high risk situations; learning to say no) contingency contracting techniques have been effective in reducing ambivalence toward ceasing cocaine use. The use of positive contingencies to reward non-use has shown increased participation and improved outcomes. Supportive therapy � the aim of this treatment is to educate the user about the realities of their drug use and its consequences. A number of lifestyle changes may be recommended: dissociation from other drug users the disposal of drug-using equipment encourage identification, avoidance and coping techniques to deal with high risk situations Psychotherapy/counselling � found to be effective among a minority of users. This technique encourages individuals to identify the role of the drug in their lives in order to give them an increased sense of control Family therapy � the family is often included in treatment programs because they have the potential to perpetuate changes in patterns of behaviour which may model an individual's drug use. Self-help groups � groups such as AA, NA and CA are effective support sources for some individuals Pharmacological interventions in psychostimulant use Pharmacologic interventions are used to achieve and sustain abstinence through the reduction of withdrawal symptoms. While most cases do not require drug treatment, where necessary, pharmacological interventions should be tailored to the needs of the individual and used in addition to a comprehensive treatment program. Note: The treatments outlined below have been extrapolated from cocaine management data and therefore it is not known how effective they will be in the management of amphetamine detoxification. Desipramine is the drug of choice. When used in conjunction with bromocriptine or amantadine (both dopamine agonists), reduced craving and dysphoria are reported during cocaine withdrawal. Desipramine � starting at 25-30 mg nocte and increasing to 50-150 mg per week as clinically tolerated until reaching a maximum dose of 150-300 mg nocte. Bromocriptine � starting at 0.625 mg three times daily, gradually increasing to 7.5-12.5 mg divided three times a day, as clinically tolerated, for 14 days. Amantadine � has been found to be as effective as bromocriptine in reducing cocaine craving Pharmacological treatment can continue if cravings recur. Methylphenidate, which has amphetamine-like properties, has been shown to be an effective treatment in individuals with pre-existing adult attention deficit. Likewise, lithium has been an effective treatment among individuals with bipolar or cyclothymic disorders.

A multicultural approach to drug and alcohol-related issues and problems The cultural diversity of the Australian population has received little emphasis in the establishment of drug and alcohol services in this country. Relatively little consideration has been given to the values and heritage that predominate among different cultural communities, with the majority of drug and alcohol services available reflecting broader Australian community values. Therefore, when consulting with people of non-English-speaking background or Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples regarding drug- and alcohol-related problems, a number of issues need to be considered. Language, knowledge and information Overcoming language and cultural differences particular groups at risk A number of issues need to be remembered LANGUAGE, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION The greatest barrier for people of non-English speaking backgrounds is language. The information available is often insensitive to language, levels of education and cultural differences, and therefore may be an ineffective education tool. Often the printed information given is distributed to people according to their country of birth rather than by preferred language, and therefore may be irrelevant or inadequate. As a result, many people from non-English speaking backgrounds are largely uninformed about drugs and their effects, the problems that can be experienced, or the drug and alcohol support services available, and thus are oblivious to telltale signs of problems arising from intoxication and dependency. Language barriers, and the insensitivity of mainstream drug and alcohol services to cultural differences, may discourage people from non-English speaking backgrounds from accessing available services. OVERCOMING LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES While many people from non-English speaking backgrounds would prefer to consult a professional or knowledgable member in their own community about a drug- or alcohol-related problem, in many cases this may not be an option. These people are therefore faced with the prospect of accessing the mainstream agencies, often with little understanding of the services, where they exist, or the concepts upon which they are modelled. As a general practitioner or health worker, there are a number of issues you may like to consider when consulting people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Where a language barrier exists seek assistance with interpretation. This may include: Telephone Translating and Interpreting Service assistance from a bilingual family or community member a health worker of the same language background. Bilingual interpretation is essential. It will assist in: identification of needs a description of the current situation the perceived role of drugs or alcohol in the user's life establishing the extent of drug use the treatment options available accurate information regarding administration of any prescribed medications information about existing resources and supports important to the patient. Be aware that what constitutes a 'drug' differs between cultures (eg many European and Indo-Chinese cultures may not regard caffeine, alcohol or prescribed pharmaceuticals as drugs). Similarly the use of some substances may be acceptable in one culture but unacceptable in others. Recognise that drug use or non-use can be a gender and cultural issue. When determining the extent of drug use take into consideration the cultural patterns of drug choice and use, and where possible compare pre-immigration and post-immigration levels of use. Acquaint yourself with differing aspects of the cultural groups you may have contact with. Learn to recognise particular cultural features, including: language, dialect and parochial dialogue socialisation patterns beliefs regarding health, illness and the significance of folk medicine in preventing and treating illnesses values, ideals and roles of members in the community the perceived role of drugs and alcohol in the community the role of the family unit in the community (including matriarchy and patriarchy) the cultural and interpersonal conflicts which may exacerbate drug or alcohol use among people of non-English speaking backgrounds the generational differences regarding drug use, drug choice and broader issues which may exacerbate or influence the behaviour. Where appropriate, contact a significant member of the cultural community and discuss the most appropriate ways to increase information in that community and the most effective and accepted modes of communication and intervention. A respect of people's choice is essential. What is an acceptable form of treatment for one person may not be culturally or personally acceptable for another. The development of culturally sensitive approaches and interventions will result in more effective services and greater adherence to prescribed regimens. The most effective interventions will be those based upon the values of the community being dealt with. Familiarise yourself with the ethno-specific workers and agencies available in your area, and the services they offer. Networking with these agencies may enhance the distribution of information to members of particular communities who may be uninformed about drug-related issues and the relevant services available. PARTICULAR GROUPS AT RISK There is evidence to suggest that people from some cultural backgrounds may be at greater risk of developing a drug- or alcohol-related problem: those with little or no family support unemployed migrants individuals who have suffered severe trauma during wars, dispossession or displacement recent migrants or refugees victims of torture and rape those facing cultural and interpersonal conflicts those living alone the aged those who are grieving some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. A NUMBER OF ISSUES NEED TO BE REMEMBERED Intoxication and associated risks need proper management. It is an opportunity for early and brief intervention. Alcohol dependence is a symptom not a cause in itself. It seriously disrupts health, family and social functioning. Frequent contact and liaison is required. Concurrent medical conditions are often overlooked by health workers when they are dealing with intoxicated and dependent drinkers. The incidence of risk taking is increased with intoxication and therefore the medical practitioner or health worker can play an important role in providing culturally sensitive drug and sexual health education. In many remote areas there is also a high incidence of solvent abuse. This form of drug abuse is particularly evident among adolescents in the Aboriginal community (see Chapter 9, Volatile Substances). Kava Since the 1980s, use of kava, a traditional intoxicating drink used by South Pacific Islanders made from the root of the plant Piper methysticum, has been seen as an adjunct to or substitute for alcohol use in some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Clinical effects Kava possesses psychotropic qualities, producing a mild narcotic-like effect associated with muscle relaxation. The use of kava may lead to: reversible anaesthesia of the mouth and skin euphoria sedation muscle weakness ataxia intoxication nausea. Kava is an introduced drug to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The high quantities sometimes consumed are a cause for concern. Many serious toxic physical effects can result from renal and hepatic damage. Heavy kava users may present with the following symptoms: chest pains shortness of breath episodic puffiness of the face redness of the eyes scaly rash on the arms, legs and trunk brisk patellar reflexes decrease in body mass index and skinfold thickness over triceps, biceps, subocapular and suprailiac sites. Long term kava use has also been directly or indirectly associated with: malnutrition weight loss liver and renal dysfunction abnormalities in red cells, lymphocytes and platelets pulmonary hypertension. Management Kava use, like alcohol use and petrol sniffing in other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, has many complex social factors associated with its use. While there is concern regarding its use, consideration must also be given to the role of kava in these particular communities, particularly where kava is used as an alternative to alcohol. Heavy kava users should be monitored and advised to stop using. In order to reduce the harmful effects of kava, health care workers should encourage users to reduce kava consumption, provide dietary information to reduce effects of malnutrition and work with indigenous communities to encourage their own reforms which address the physical and social effects of kava.

The health professional or health care worker as a patient How do we find them and help them? (or how do you help yourself?) Which organisations help? A lot of health care workers drink too much and many harm themselves by doing so. Some of them take days off when they are intoxicated, while others are covered by their colleagues. A few become involved in covert illegal activities and provide drugs to those close to them. An educated guess at the number of medical practitioners addicted to illicit or prescribed drugs in the western medical community is in the order of 1%. This same level of addiction in Australian medical practitioners is suggested by the data available from monitoring sources. A significant number of health care workers are also dependent on a wide range of other drugs, thereby impairing their clinical skills. HOW DO WE FIND THEM AND HELP THEM? (OR HOW DO YOU HELP YOURSELF?) There are simple things to do first. Spread the word that health care workers, like anyone else, have to be patients sometimes and there is nothing wrong with that. This may seem self-evident to most of us, but it remains an anxious prospect for some. Look for indicators that the issue is being evaded, eg a colleague may seek an informal consultation such as asking about a chest pain. It is necessary to ensure that any complaint indicated in this manner is treated with professional concern in a professional location. The consultation If a health care worker rings for a consultation there is a reasonable chance that he or she has acted out of desperation � he or she has reached the stage where the problem can no longer be ignored. That call is an urgent cry for help. Occasionally the cry for help has a Russian roulette quality about it: if the prospective rescuer is out or away, the caller may procrastinate once more until it is too late. Therefore, when a health care worker calls it is vital to ask directly about how ur-gent he or she perceives the problem to be and not to accept an equivocal answer. When health care workers arrive it is important for the staff encountered and doctor consulted to act in a routine manner. Make it clear that he or she is now a patient and explain everything as if he or she were an intelligent layman with no medical or health background. Give him or her the handouts other patients receive and write his or her prescriptions. Health care workers and their families should be given firm and definite follow-up appointments written on cards, and not expected to use their own judgment in making further contacts. If offers of help and warnings are not heeded then one must consider notifying the appropriate licensing authority so that enquiries can be made. This can be handled firmly and sensitively and can lead to a better outcome than if no action had been taken. WHICH ORGANISATIONS HELP? Doctors' Health Advisory Services Over the past few years in a number of Australian States, a Doctors' Health Advisory Service has been developed as an independent, confidential and fraternal service to help impaired doctors and medical students. These organisations commenced in Victoria with the development of an organisation bearing this name and linked to the Victorian Academy of General Practice. In 1982 a steering committee was established in New South Wales representing the learned colleges and professional associations, and together with the Australian Medical Association developed the New South Wales Doctors' Health Advisory Service. These organisations are independent of the Australian Medical Association, the medical boards and other professional bodies. However, the organisations are all involved in the development and organisation of these services. A dedicated teleservice is available 24 hours a day in most States and calls for help come from many sources. These include the doctors themselves, their families, staff, patients and professional colleagues. In reviewing the calls received to date, it is interesting to note that a percentage of referrals do not come from the doctors themselves, but from friends or relatives concerned about the doctor's health. All incoming calls are referred to a panel of senior general practitioners experienced with a doctor's health problems. The 'patients' may be managed by the general practitioners themselves or referred to the Doctors' Health Advisory Service Specialist Panel. In all cases, extreme care is taken to maintain confidentiality. When calls for assistance are received from persons other than the doctor, strict procedures are followed before that medical practitioner is approached. The Doctors' Health Advisory Service is independent of the Medical Board. The service will not report doctors to the board nor will it threaten to do so. The 24-hour numbers for the Doctors' Health Advisory Services are: New South Wales (02) 437 6552 Victoria and Tasmania (03) 241 9316 Queensland (07) 356 0628 South Australia (08) 273 4111 Note: All of these numbers are available 24 hours, 7 days a week with the use of answering machines and other call services.

Important issues HIV/AIDS THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS and injecting drug use HIV infection and its complications The AIDS manual HIV/AIDS and injecting drug use Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may result in a wide range of complications including Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted by exchange of bodily fluids eg during sexual contact, injecting drug use, pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. HIV transmission among drug users occurs through each of these mechanisms, but the most common is through sharing injection equipment. In most western countries during the early years of the epidemic, homosexual/bisexual males were the highest risk group, whereas in recent years cases involving injecting drug users have become more common in North America and Western Europe. Subsequently, the incidence of AIDS has increased among children and non-drug using heterosexuals. In January 1993 in Australia, 7.7% of all people diagnosed with HIV and 3.9% of people living with AIDS were identified as injecting drug users. While these figures appear relatively low compared with some western countries, eg Italy or Spain, where injecting drug users constitute the majority of HIV/AIDS cases, HIV has the potential to spread rapidly among the population of injecting drug users in Australia unless precautions are taken. HIV infection can spread rapidly among drug users. The development of AIDS takes on average 10-11 years from the time of infection. In countries where substantial proportions of drug users have become infected with HIV, the majority of children with AIDS have been found to have drug-using parents. Injecting drug users are regarded as the most likely conduit for HIV infection to reach the general community. Alcohol intoxication and other disinhibiting drugs may also contribute to the risk of HIV infection as the disinhibition resulting from the use of these drugs may increase the likelihood of unsafe sexual practices. Medical practitioners have an important role to play in the community's response to HIV infection. As infection with HIV and the resulting complications become more common in Australia, treatment will increasingly require involvement of general practitioners. Medical practitioners also have an important role in reinforcing educational efforts to reduce behavioural patterns associated with HIV transmission. HIV infection and its complications In most cases of HIV infection there are no symptoms or signs within the first few months or years. However, about half of the individuals develop non-specific symptoms from 2-6 weeks following infection. The illness resembles an attack of infectious mononucleosis. Symptoms include high temperature, muscle aches and pains, rashes, headaches and lassitude. These symptoms usually last for several days and resolve spontaneously. This cluster of symptoms is referred to as the Group I stage of HIV infection. The development of antibodies to HIV (Group 2) may take up to 12 weeks; for about 1% of people it can take longer than 12 weeks. People with HIV (Group 2) are, by definition, asymptomatic although non-specific symptoms are not uncommon. Group 3 involves persistent generalised lymphadenopathy in the absence of a concurrent illness or condition other than HIV infection to explain the findings (sometimes known as AIDS-related conditions). Group 4 includes the most advanced stage of HIV infection and is usually known as AIDS. This is constituted by the presence of an opportunistic infection and/or neoplasm in the presence of severe immunodeficiency. Severe diarrhoea, weight loss and other major symptoms are often present. Specific neurological impairment or severe wasting syndromes are also classified as Group 4. The AIDS manual The Albion Street Centre in Sydney is currently revising and updating The AIDS manual, a comprehensive reference on the human immunodeficiency virus. The third edition, published by McLennan and Petty, is perhaps the most authoritative reference text on AIDS produced in this country, and will be available late 1993. The AIDS manual provides up-to-date information on statistical trends in Australia and overseas, the changing nature and treatment of the disease, counselling, education and social, occupational and legal issues. The manual provides current information on the effects of AIDS on particular groups such as injecting drug users and haemophiliacs, children and women of child-bearing age. The manual includes useful diagrams, clinical photographs, supplementary reading material and an index. THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN The management of chronic pain can be one of the most difficult tasks in medical practice. Attention should be directed to the underlying factors which exacerbate the pain or decrease tolerance to it. Many doctors are fearful of creating addicts and provide too little analgesia even for patients with terminal conditions. The irrational prescribing of patient opioid analgesics administered by injection for chronic low grade benign pain is equally difficult to defend. Oral administration is always preferred to parenteral routes for the management of chronic pain. Simple analgesics such as aspirin or paracetamol should be tried first. If this does not provide adequate relief, combinations of either aspirin or paracetamol with codeine should be tried next. If more potent analgesia is required, orally absorbed, long-acting opioids such as oxycodone should be prescribed. Morphine can be given orally with satisfactory results, but the dose required might be 3-6 times the parenteral dose because of variable absorption and hepatic metabolism. The use of adjuvant drugs including NSAIDs and tricyclic antidepressants is very important. Pain in inflammatory conditions should be controlled by NSAIDs without requiring opioids. It is important to appreciate that the very satisfactory analgesia produced by opioids in acute pain is not necessarily achieved by opioids when used for other pharmacological treatments. Increasing the dose merely increases the risk of side effects including drug dependence. The use of a range of behavioural approaches is as important as pharmacological treatment in chronic pain management. Techniques include relaxation therapy, trans-electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) and self-help chronic pain groups. Pain clinics or pain specialists are now available in major centres and these will have available a range of similar psychologically based and other treatments. In cases of prolonged or intractable pain, consideration should be given to referral to such clinics.

Membership is drawn from a wide variety of disciplines including biochemists and nurses, pharmacologists and health education teachers, social workers and psychologists, physicians, general practitioners and psychiatrists, nutritionists and administrators, with a common interest in drug-related problems. Principal activities of the Society include: The Drug and Alcohol Review This high quality journal is published quarterly and contains a variety of original papers and reviews and is used to a substantial extent by Australian researchers as a vehicle for publishing their research findings. All members of APSAD receive the journal as part of their subscription. In addition APSAD produces a newsletter which informs its membership of issues, initiatives and a wide range of activities that relate to alcohol and drugs. Postgraduate medical training APSAD has pioneered the development in Australia of a postgraduate training program for medical practitioners wishing to increase their knowledge or specialise in the area of alcohol and drugs. A Board of Censors has been established which determines and maintains appropriate examination procedures and standards. Already some trainees have completed training and others are in the process of completing their training. A number of these come from general practice. Methadone training APSAD is presently launching a Methadone Prescribers Accreditation Course, in association with the NSW Drug and Alcohol Directorate. The goal of the program is to equip doctors with the competence required to provide methadone maintenance. Development of alcohol and drug policy Many APSAD members individually and collectively have been involved in advising Government on a variety of alcohol and drug policy issues. Conferences An annual conference is held in a different State each year and regional conferences are held in response to demand. APSAD arranges its workshops focusing on areas of special interest such as the management of alcohol-related brain damage, the development of hospital-based units, cocaine and cannabis use.

If we stressed moderationover abstinence, we'd have fewer problem drinkers, young or old. By STANTON PEELE After years of debate, the U.S. government has finallydecided that alcohol can be beneficial. Federal dietaryrecommendations, revised every five years, now indicate thatmoderate drinking lowers the risk of heart disease. The dietaryguidelines note that such "beverages have been used toenhance the enjoyment of meals throughout human history. There is both old and new information in this statement. Weall know that many Americans drink only occasionally or lightlyat meals and social occasions. They know when to quit, don'tmisbehave when they drink and enjoy the taste and sensations ofalcohol without going overboard. Most of us are also aware that people in different cultureshandle alcohol differently. In Mediterranean societies -- Italy,Spain, Portugal -- alcohol is consumed in the form of wine,usually at meals, by family members of all ages. Even smallchildren are served wine on special occasion& Many Europeancountries permit adolescents to drink with their families atrestaurants. To many Americans, the idea of offering children alcohol isreprehensible. Yet, this approach to drinking seems to inoculatechildren against alcohol abuse later in life. A study conductedby Harvard psychiatrist George Vaillant followed a group of menin Boston for more than four decades. The Italian, Greek andJewish men were only one-seventh as likely as Irish Americans inthe study to become alcoholic. In contemporary America, we are taught that alcoholics areborn, not made. Yet no gene determines that any individual willbecome an alcoholic. Rather, development of adult alcoholism is along-term, interactive process. Despite our claim to advancedmedical knowledge about alcoholism, America produces many moreproblem drinkers than do many traditional cultures. The groups in the Vaillant study that had few alcoholicsactually teach children responsible drinking at home. The problemwith a blanket disapproval of drinking is that many childrendevelop drinking habits on their own that are very different fromsipping wine at a religious feast or family meal. Nationalsurveys show that up to half of college students and high schoolseniors have drunk five or more drinks at one sitting in theprior two weeks. Among fraternity and sorority members, thisfigure is 80%. Ironically, in the United States today, we follow the methodof alcohol education found least successful in the Vaillantstudy. That is, alcohol is grouped with illicit drugs, andchildren are taught that abstinence is the only answer. Yetchildren are aware that most adults drink, and many drink alcoholthemselves on the sly. Moreover, drinking will be legal andwidely available to them within a few short years. Clearly, manyyoung people find the abstinence message confusing andhypocritical. Studies that examine health outcomes among groups of adultswho have been tracked for years find that moderate drinkers livelonger than abstainers. What is moderate drinking? The governmentdefined this as no more than two drinks daily for men and one forwomen. Britain has defined higher sensible drinking limits-two tothree drinks for women and three to four for men. These standards apply to adult men and post-menopausal women,or to any adult with one or more coronary risk factors (such ashaving a parent with premature heart disease, being overweight,having high cholesterol or blood pressure). Three-quarters of allAmericans have such risk factors. These adults show significantreduction in mortality when they drink moderately. The lower death rate among moderate drinkers is due to thereduction in heart disease, specifically atherosclerosis orclogging of the arteries. Alcohol enhances high density-orgood-cholesterol production. However, when people average morethan two drinks daily, they are more likely to suffer from suchdiseases as cancer and cirrhosis. At five to six drinks daily formen and four drinks for women, these risks distinctly outweighthe benefits of drinking. What are people to make of these complications in the messageabout alcohol? Like most things in life, sound judgment andmoderation are the bywords. After all, there are many thingspeople consume occasionally -- such as meat, desserts or cigars-- that if done to excess become health problems. Evenadolescents can define the difference between healthy andunhealthy drinking. I recommend holding such open discussionsamong teenagers in place of the standard temperance lecture thatpasses for alcohol education. After all, even the governmentconfirms that all drinking is not bad.

Until recently olderproblem drinkers tended to be ignored by both healthprofessionals and the general public. The neglect occurred forseveral reasons: our elderly population was small and few wereidentified as alcoholics, chronic problem drinkers (those whoabused alcohol off and on for most of their lives) often diedbefore old age; and, because they are often retired or have fewersocial contacts, older people have often been able to hidedrinking problems. Some families may unknowingly "encourage" drinkingin older family members if they have the attitude that drinkingshould be tolerated because older people have only a limited timeleft and therefore should be allowed to "enjoy"themselves. As more people learn that alcohol problems can be successfullytreated at any age, more are willing to seek help to stopdrinking. Physical Effects of Alcohol Alcohol slows down brain activity. It impairs mentalalertness, judgment, physical coordination, and reaction time --increasing the risk of falls and accidents. Over time, heavy drinking can cause permanent damage to thebrain and central nervous system, as well as to the liver, heartkidneys, and stomach. Alcohol can affect the body in unusual ways, making certainmedical problems difficult to diagnose. For example, the effectsof alcohol on the cardiovascular system (the heart and bloodvessels) can mask pain, which may otherwise serve as a warningsign of heart attack. Alcoholism can also produce symptoms similar to those ofdementia -- forgetfulness, reduced attention, confusion. Ifincorrectly identified, such symptoms may lead to unnecessaryinstitutionalization. Alcohol, itself a drug, mixes unfavorably with many otherdrugs, including those sold by prescription and those boughtover-the-counter. In addition, use of prescription drugs mayintensify the older person's reaction to alcohol, leading to morerapid intoxication. Alcohol can dangerously slow down performanceskills (driving, walking, etc.), impair judgment, and reducealertness when taken with drugs such as: * "Minor" tranquilizers: Valium (diazepam), Librium(chlordiazepoxide), Miltown (meprobamate), and others. * "Major" tranquilizers: Thorazine (chlorpromazine),Mellaril (thioridazine), and others. * Barbiturates: Luminal (phenobarbital) and others. * Pain killers: Darvon (propoxyphene), Demerol (meperidine),and others. * Antihistamines: both prescription and over-the-counter formsfound in cold remedies. Use of alcohol can cause other drugs to be metabolized morerapidly, producing exaggerated responses. Such drugs include:anticonvulsants (Dilantin), anticoagulants (Coumadin), andantidiabetes drugs (Orinase). In some people, aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach andintestines. Alcohol also irritates the stomach and can aggravatethis bleeding. The combination of alcohol and diuretics canreduce blood pressure in some individuals, producing dizziness. Anyone who drinks -- even moderately -- should check with adoctor or pharmacist about possible drug interactions. Who Becomes a Problem Drinker? In old age, problem drinkers seem to be one of two types. The first are chronic abusers, those who have used alcoholheavily throughout life. Although most chronic abusers die bymiddle age, some survive into old age. Approximately two-thirdsof older alcoholics are in this group. The second type begins excessive drinking late in life, oftenin response to "situational" factors -- retirement,lowered income, declining health, and the deaths of friends andloved ones. In these cases, alcohol is first used for temporaryrelief but later becomes a problem. Detecting Drinking Problems Not everyone who drinks regularly or heavily is an alcoholabuser, but the following symptoms frequently indicate a problem: * Drinking to calm nerves, forget worries, or reducedepression. * Loss of interest in food. * Gulping drinks and drinking too fast. * Lying about drinking habits. * Drinking alone with increasing frequency. * Injuring oneself, or someone else, while intoxicated. * Getting drunk often (more than three or four times in thepast year). * Needing to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to get thedesired effect. * Frequently acting irritable, resentful, or unreasonableduring nondrinking periods. * Experiencing medical, social, or financial problems that arecaused by drinking. Getting Help Older problem drinkers and alcoholics have an unusually goodchance for recovery because they tend to stay with treatmentprograms for the duration. Getting help can begin with a family doctor or member of theclergy; through a local health department or social servicesagency; or with one of the following organizations: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a voluntary fellowship ofalcoholics whose purpose is to help themselves and each other get-- and stay -- sober.

LaGuardia was aprominent New York city politician who served several terms inthe House of Representatives. An outspoken critic of prohibition,he testified to the policy's failure. The National ProhibitionLaw, Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.Senate, 69th Congress, 1st Session (1926): 649-52 It is impossible to tell whetherprohibition is a good thing or a bad thing. It has never beenenforced in this country. There may not be as much liquor inquantity consumed to-day as there was before prohibition, butthere is just as much alcohol. At least 1,000,000 quarts of liquor isconsumed each day in the United States. In my opinion such anenormous traffic in liquor could not be carried on without theknowledge, if not the connivance of the officials entrusted withthe enforcement of the law. ... I believe that the percentage of whiskydrinkers in the United States now is greater than in any othercountry of the world. Prohibition is responsible for that. ... At least $1,000,000,000 a year is lostto the National Government and the several States and counties inexcise taxes. The liquor traffic is going on just the same. Thisamount goes into the pockets of bootleggers and in the pockets ofthe public officials in the shape of graft.... I will concede that the saloon was odiusbut now we have delicatessen stores, pool rooms, drug stores,millinery shops, private parlors, and 57 other varieties ofspeak-easies selling liquor and flourishing. I have heard of $2,000 a yearprohibition agents who run their own cars with liveriedchauffeurs. It is common talk in my part of thecountry that from $7.50 to $12 a case is paid in graft from thetime the liquor leaves the 12-mile limit until it reaches theultimate consumer. There seems to be a varying market price forthis service created by the degree of vigilance or the degree ofgreed of the public officials in charge. It is my calculation that at least amillion dollars a day is paid in graft and corruption to Federal,State, and local officers. Such a condition is not onlyintolerable, but it is demoralizing and dangerous to organizedgovernment. ... The Government even goes to the troubleto facilitate the financing end of the bootlegging industry. In1925, $286,950,000 more of $10,000 bills were issued than in 1920and $25,000,000 more of $5,000 bills were issued. What honestbusiness man deals in $10,000 bills? Surely these bills were notused to pay the salaries of ministers. The bootlegging industryhas created a demand for bills of large denominations, and theTreasury Department accommodates them. The drys seemingly are afraid of thetruth. Why not take inventory and ascertain the true conditions.Let us not leave it to the charge of an antiprohibitionorganization, or to any other private association, let us have anofficial survey and let the American people know what is goingon. A complete and honest and impartial survey would revealincredible conditions, corruption, crime, and an organized systemof illicit traffic such as the world has never seen. ...

Hobson argues for prohibition Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Alcohol Richmond P. Hobson Argues for Prohibition Richmond P. Hobson, a Representative from Alabama, voiced hissupport for a prohibition amendment on the floor of the House ofRepresentatives on December 22, 1914. The proposed amendmentreceived a majority of votes, but not the necessary two-thirdsmajority to proceed with the process. The following is scannedfrom K. Austin Kerr, The Politics of Moral Behavior:Prohibition and Drug Abuse (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley,1973): 97-102 [long out of print]. Hobson: What is the object of this resolution? It is to destroy theagency that debauches the youth of the land and therebyperpetuates its hold upon the Nation. How does the resolutionpropose to destroy this agent? In the simplest manner.... It doesnot coerce any drinker. It simply says that barter and sale,matters that have been a public function from the semicivilizeddays of society, shall not continue the debauching of the youth.Now, the Liquor Trust are wise enough to know that they can notperpetuate their sway by depending on debauching grown people, sothey go to an organic method of teaching the young to drink. Nowwe apply exactly the same method to destroy them. We do not tryto force old drinkers to stop drinking, but we do effectively putan end to the systematic, organized debauching of our youththrough thousands and tens of thousands of agencies throughoutthe land. Men here may try to escape the simplicity of thisproblem. They can not. Some are trying to defend alcohol bysaying that its abuse only is bad and that its temperate use isall right. Science absolutely denies it, and proclaims thatdrunkenness does not produce one-tenth part of the harm tosociety that the widespread, temperate, moderate drinking does.Some say it is adulteration that harms. Some are trying to saythat it is only distilled liquors that do harm. Science comes innow and says that all alcohol does harm; that the malt andfermented liquors produce vastly more harm than distilledliquors, and that it is the general public use of such drinksthat has entailed the gradual decline and degeneracy of thenations of the past. [The wets] have no foundation in scientific truth to standupon, and so they resort to all kinds of devious methods. Their favorite contention is that we can not reach the evilbecause of our institutions. This assumes that here is somethingvery harmful and injurious to the public health and morals, thatimperils our very institutions themselves and the perpetuity ofthe Nation, but the Nation has not within itself, because of itspeculiar organization, the power to bring about the public goodand end a great public wrong. They invoke the principle of Staterights. As a matter of fact, we are fighting more consistentlyfor State rights than they ever dreamed of. We know the Stateshave the right to settle this question, and furthermore ourconfidence in three-quarters of all the States to act wisely doesnot lead us to fear that if we submit the proposition to themthey might establish an imperialistic empire. We believe thatthree-quarters of all the States have the wisdom as well as theright to settle the national prohibition question for thiscountry. Neither can they take refuge about any assumed question ofindividual liberty. We do not say that a man shall not drink. Weask for no sumptuary action. We do not say that a man shall nothave or make liquor in his own home for his own use. Nothing ofthat sort is involved in this resolution. We only touch the sale.A man may feel he has a right to drink, but he certainly has noinherent right to sell liquor. A man's liberties are absolutelysecure in this resolution. The liberties and sanctity of the homeare protected. The liberties of the community are secure, theliberties of the county are secure, and the liberties of theState are secure. Let no one imagine that a State to-day has the real power andright to be wet of its own volition. Under the taxing power ofthe Federal Government by act of Congress, Congress could makeevery State in the country dry. They need not think it is aninherent right for a State to be wet; it is not; but there is aninherent right in every State and every county and every townshipto be dry, and these rights are now trampled upon, and thismonster prides himself in trampling upon them. Why, here to-day Member after Member has proclaimed thatprohibition does not prohibit, and I have heard them actuallytell us that prohibition could not prohibit. They tell us thatthis interstate liquor power is greater than the NationalGovernment.... I say now, as I said before, I will meet this foe on a hundredbattlefields. If the Sixty-third Congress does not grant thisplain right of the people for this referendum to change theirorganic law, to meet this mighty evil, the Sixty-fourth Congresswill be likewise invoked. I do not say that we are going to get atwo-thirds majority here tonight ... because we have not yet hada chance to appeal to Caesar: but I do say that the day is comingwhen we shall have that referendum sent to the States, nor isthat day as far distant as some may imagine. Unless this questionhas been made a State matter, as we are asking now for it to beso made by being removed from national politics, and referred tothe States-if this is not done by the intervening Congresses, Ihere announce to you the determination of the great moral, thegreat spiritual, the great temperance and prohibition forces ofthis whole Nation to make this question the paramount issue in1916, not only to gain a two-thirds majority in the Houses ofCongress, but to have an administration that neither in the opennor under cover will fight this reform, so that in the spring of1917 with an extraordinary session of the Sixty-fifth Congress wewill have a command from the * masters of men and of Congress togrant this right to the people. My appeal is to each one of younow, be a man when the vote is taken and do your duty.[Applause.] A Habit-Forming Drug Alcohol has the property of chloroform and ether ofpenetrating actually into the nerve fibers themselves, puttingthe tissues under an anesthetic which prevents pain at first, butwhen the anesthetic effect is over discomfort follows throughoutthe tissues of the whole body, particularly the nervous system,which causes a craving for relief by recourse to the verysubstance that produced the disturbance. This craving growsdirectly with the amount and regularity of the drinking. Undermines the Will Power The poisoning attack of alcohol is specially severe in thecortex cerebrum-the top part of the brain-where resides thecenter of inhibition, or of will power, causing partialparalysis, which liberates lower activities otherwise held incontrol, causing a man to be more of a brute, but to imagine thathe has been stimulated, when he is really partially paralyzed.This center of inhibition is the seat of the will power, which ofnecessity declines a little in strength every time partialparalysis takes place. Little Less of a Man After Each Drink Thus a man is little less of a man after each drink he takes.In this way continued drinking causes a progressive weakening ofthe will and a progressive growing of the craving, so that aftera time, if persisted in, there must come a point where the willpower can not control the craving and the victim is in the gripof the habit. Slaves in Shackles When the drinking begins young the power of the habit becomesoverwhelming, and the victim might as well have shackles. It isestimated that there are 5,000,000 heavy drinkers and drunkardsin America, and these men might as well have a ball and chain ontheir ankles, for they are more abject slaves than those blackmen who were driven by slave drivers. Present-day Slave Owners These victims are driven imperatively to procure their liquor,no matter at what cost. A few thousand brewers and distillers,making up the organizations composing the great Liquor Trust,have a monopoly of the supply, and they therefore own these5,000,000 slaves and through them they are able to collect twoand one-half billions of dollars cash from the American peopleevery year. Liquor Degenerates the Character The first finding of science that alcohol is a protoplasmicpoison and the second finding that it is an insidious,habit-forming drug, though of great importance, are asunimportant when compared with the third finding, that alcoholdegenerates the character of men and tears down their spiritualnature. Like the other members of the group of oxide derivativesof hydrocarbons, alcohol is not only a general poison, but it hasa chemical affinity or deadly appetite for certain particulartissues. Strychnine tears down the spinal cord. Alcohol tearsdown the top part of the brain in a man, attacks certain tissuesin an animal, certain cells in a flower. It has been establishedthat whatever the line of a creature's evolution alcohol willattack that line. Every type and every species is evolving inbuilding from generation to generation along some particularline. Man is evolving in the top part of the brain, the seat ofthe will power, the seat of the moral senses, and of thespiritual nature, the recognition of right and wrong, theconsciousness of God and of duty and of brotherly love and ofself-sacrifice. Reverses the Life Principle of the Universe All life in the universe is founded upon the principle ofevolution. Alcohol directly reverses that principle. Man hasrisen from the savage up through successive steps to the level ofthe semisavage, the semicivilized, and the highly civilized. Liquor and the Red Man Liquor promptly degenerates the red man, throws him back intosavagery. It will promptly put a tribe on the war path. Liquor and the Black Man Liquor will actually make a brute out of a negro, causing himto commit unnatural crimes. Liquor and the White Man The effect is the same on the white man, though the white manbeing further evolved it takes longer time to reduce him to thesame level. Starting young, however, it does not take a very longtime to speedily cause a man in the forefront of civilization topass through the successive stages and become semicivilized,semisavage, savage, and, at last, below the brute. The Great Tragedy The spiritual nature of man gives dignity to his life abovethe life of the brute. It is this spiritual nature of man thatmakes him in the image of his Maker, so that the Bible referredto man as being a little lower than the angels. It is a tragedyto blight the physical life. No measure can be made of blightingthe spiritual life. The Blight Degeneracy Nature does not tolerate reversing its evolutionary principle,and proceeds automatically to exterminate any creature, anyanimal, any race, any species that degenerates. Nature adopts twomethods of extermination-one to shorten the life, the other toblight the offspring. The Verdict Science has thus demonstrated that alcohol is a protoplasmicpoison, poisoning all living things; that alcohol is ahabit-forming drug that shackles millions of our citizens andmaintains slavery in our midst; that it lowers in a fearful waythe standard of efficiency of the Nation, reducing enormously thenational wealth, entailing startling burdens of taxation,encumbering the public with the care of crime, pauperism, andinsanity; that it corrupts politics and public servants, corruptsthe Government, corrupts the public morals, lowers terrificallythe average standard of character of the citizenship, andundermines the liberties and institutions of the Nation; that itundermines and blights the home and the family, checks education,attacks the young when they are entitled to protection,undermines the public health, slaughtering, killing, and woundingour citizens many fold times more than war, pestilence, andfamine combined; that it blights the progeny of the Nation,flooding the land with a horde of degenerates; that it strikesdeadly blows at the life of the Nation itself and at the verylife of the race, reversing the great evolutionary principles ofnature and the purposes of the Almighty. There can be but one verdict, and that is this great destroyermust be destroyed. The time is ripe for fulfillment. The presentgeneration, the generation to which we belong, must cut thismillstone of degeneracy from the neck of humanity.... The Final Conclusion To cure this organic disease we must have recourse to theorganic law. The people themselves must act upon this question. Ageneration must be prevailed upon to place prohibition in theirown constitutional law, and such a generation could be countedupon to keep it in the Constitution during its lifetime. TheLiquor Trust of necessity would disintegrate. The youth wouldgrow up sober. The final, scientific conclusion is that we musthave constitutional prohibition, prohibiting only the sale, themanufacture for sale, and everything that pertains to the sale,and invoke the power of both Federal and State Governments forenforcement. The resolution is drawn to fill these requirements.

The leading branch of it ... isthe sale of alcoholic liquor.... The liquor interests are vastlymore extended in Chicago that any other. There are 7,300 licensedliquor sellers in Chicago, and in addition about a thousandplaces where liquor is sold illegally. The only business whichapproaches it in number of establishments ... is the grocerytrade, which has about 5,200. The city spends at least half asmuch for what it drinks as for what it eats.... The great central powerin the liquor business in America is the brewery. ...Thebreweries own or control the great majority of the saloons ofAmerican cities. They have a distinct policy:--if there are notas many saloons as there can be, supply them. This is what hasbeen done in Chicago. Fully ninety per cent of the Chicagosaloons are under some obligation to the brewery; with at leasteighty per cent, this obligation is a serious one. The business of thebrewery is to sell beer.... The brewery, under present conditionsin Chicago, must sell beer at all cost, or promptly die. This isbecause the brewery business has become over-capitalized andoverbuilt there for at least ten years. There has been furiouscompetition....

Under these circumstances, the breweries of Chicagocan have but one aim--to fill Chicago with beer to the point ofsaturation. Each brewer disposes ofhis product by contracting with special saloon-keepers to sellhis beer and no other. The more saloons he has, the better....The brewers employ special agents to watch continually every nookand cranny in Chicago where it may be possible to pour in alittle more beer. If a rival brewery's saloon keeper is doingwell, his best bartender is ravished from him and set up inbusiness alongside. If a new colony of foreigners appears, somecompatriot is set at once to selling them liquor. Italians,Greeks, Lithuanians, Poles,--all the rough and hairy tribes whichhave been drawn into Chicago,--have their trade exploited to theutmost. ...No man with two hundred dollars, who was not subjectto arrest on sight, need go without a saloon in Chicago.... Withthat two hundred dollars as a margin, the brewery sorts him out aset of its stock of saloon fixtures, pays his rent, pays hislicense, and supplies him with beer. He pays for everything in anextra price on each barrel of beer.... Under this system ...Chicago has four times as many saloons as it should have, fromany standpoint whatever, except, of course, the brewers' and thewholesalers'. A new license law ... now limits the number to one[saloon] in every five hundred people; but it will be yearsbefore that law will have any appreciable effect. There is nowone retail liquor dealer to every two hundred and eighty fivepeople, disregarding, of course, the one thousand unlicenseddealers. In the laboring wards the licensed saloons run as manyas one to every one hundred and fifty. Take the stock-yards.Around that long and dismal stockade, at every hole from which ahuman being can emerge, a shop or group of shops sits waiting. Atthe main entrance they lie massed in batteries.... The Chicago market isthoroughly saturated with beer, and incidentally with otherliquor. Reckoning it out by population, every man, woman, andchild in Chicago drank, in 1906, two and one-quarter barrels ofbeer,--that is, seventy gallons,--three and one-half times theaverage consumption in the United States.... Now, if the competitionis red-handed among the breweries, it is simply ravenous amongthe saloon-keepers. There is a popular fallacy that there is agreat profit in the retail saloon business. The saloon-keepersthemselves believe this when they go into it.... All this means onething--a premium on the irregular and criminal saloon-keeper. Thepatronage of the saloon is a very fickle and elusive thing. Aplace is popular, or it is nothing. ... There are two generalbusiness methods of attracting [a good trade]: By givingunusually large measures or big bonuses of free lunch; or bycarrying illegitimate and illegal side lines. The first ... doesnot leave large margins of profit; the second does. A year agothe license fee was raised in Chicago from five hundred to onethousand dollars. It was hoped this would wipe out the criminalsaloon. It did, of course, nothing of the sort. The poor,miserable little dives in the working-man's ward, each snatchinga starvation living from the lips of the dwellers of the dozensmoke-befouled frame tenements about it, staggered down--a fewhundred of them--and died. The man with the side-line ofprostitution and gambling naturally survived and had the benefitof the others' failure.

The crusade sought to persuadesaloon-keepers to destroy their beverages, close their doors, andenter some other line of business. Eliza Daniel Stewart sometimes referedto herself as "Mother Stewart" and this is the namethat appears on the title page of the book [ Mother [ElizaDaniel] Stewart, Memories of the Crusade, a Thrilling Accountof the Great Uprising of the Women of Ohio in 1873, Against theLiquor Crime (Columbus: Wm.

Stewart was among an important groupof American women who gained leadership experience by working inthe Sanitary Commission (from which the Red Cross later emerged)during the American civil war. During the woman's crusade of1873-74 she was active, and she enjoyed a notable career as atemperance speaker thereafter. Her 1876 speaking tour in Britainled to the formation of the British Woman's TemperanceAssociation. Stewart was also later a supporter of theProhibition party, which offered candidates for office, includingPresident of the United States.

Burnhama set of campaign broadsides from the Ohio prohibition referendumcampaign of 1918. Austin Kerr made Xerox copies of thesematerials, and, with the help of Liyan Liu, they are now scannedand ready for use in teaching and other multi-media applications.So far as we know, these items were never copyrighted; in anycase, their age indicates that they are in the public domain. Wewill appreciate persons using these materials to note that theyare "Courtesy of The Ohio State University Department ofHistory." Ohio was a very closely contested state in the nationalcampaign to eradicate the liquor traffic by declaring illegal thebusinesses of manufacturing, distributing, and selling alcoholicbeverages. Ohio was the birthplace of both the Woman's ChristianTemperance Union (1874) and the Anti-Saloon League (1893). TheWCTU brought a special zeal to the prohibition effort in the1880s, failing to achieve state-wide dry legislation butdisturbing Ohio political life nevertheless. The Anti-SaloonLeague later (and with the help of the WCTU) promoted the issuein a non-partisan manner, pressuring politicians to enact drylegislation. The League and its allies were successful inachieving various local option measures (laws that allowed votersof a ward or a township to declare themselves free of the liquortraffic) and, in 1908, in achieving a law that granted countiesthe authority to outlaw the liquor traffic. Although prohibition was a popular reform in the state, theissue deeply divided Ohioans. In 1909, witnessing the success ofthe League in achieving county option legislation, and fearingthat it might achieve state-wide prohibition, the brewersorganized a counter-attack. Beer had become the largest singlesource of beverage alcohol in the United States during the 1880s,and the brewing industry was the most profitable of the liquortrades. Persons of German ancestry dominated the American brewingindustry, and they worked closely with the German-AmericanAlliance, an organization popular in German-American communities.The brewers had always supplied lobbyists and campaign funds tothwart the prohibitionists. In 1909 the Ohio brewersdecided to try to reform their industry, to reduce the number ofsaloons in the state dramatically, and to have legislationenacted that would ensure that saloon keepers were citizens of"good character." Led by Percy Andreae, the Ohiobrewers used their ample financial resources and political skillsto conduct a propaganda campaign to countervail that of the drys,and to mobilize wets in support of measures that would weaken thedry hold in the state's politics. The result was that after 1910 the Anti-Saloon Leagueencountered stiff opposition in the state's legislature. The dryscould, however, try to achieve state-wide prohibition through thereferendum. The Ohio Constitution permitted citizens to petitionto have amendments placed on the ballot for decision directly bythe voters. In campaigning for state-wide prohibition through thereferendum, League leaders knew they could count on only about400,000 voters (of a total well over 1,000,000) to supportprohibition. Nevertheless, the League leaders believed they hadlittle choice but to push referendum campaigns if they were goingto achieve state-wide prohibition in Ohio. Although the brewersand their wet allies could outspend the drys, the drys hoped tomake up the deficit through the righteousness of their cause andthe resulting reform zeal. After about 1910 public opinion acrossthe nation seemed to be turning in favor of prohibition. TheLeague believed that conducting referendum campaigns in Ohiowould educate the public futher to the virtues of prohibition. The League engineered referendums in 1915 and 1917, which itlost. The League was finally victorious in 1918, narrowly winninga state-wide victory. In 1917 and 1918, James A. White, theSuperintendent of the Ohio Anti-Saloon League, organized an"Ohio Dry Federation" to mobilize all of the state'stemperance and prohibition groups, including the Woman'sChristian Temperance Union. In 1917 the Federation budgeted$450,000 for the campaign, and in 1918, $500,000, enormous sumsfor the day. The advertisements that you will see were part ofthat expenditure. The broadsides that we are providing were apparently intendedfor publication in the state's newspapers. Many of them containpatriotic references to the mobilization for the First World War.Although nationally political sentiment had clearly developed insupport of a prohibition amendment to the federal constitutionbefore the United States declared war in 1917, the Ohio DryFederation propagandists were looking for every advantage to winover a majority of the state's voters.

I used to think the remedysomewhat radical. But to-day, being imbued with the wisdom of theprohibitionist, I have to acknowledge that, if the Bible ingeneral, and that passage in it in particular, has a fault, itlies in its ultra-conservativeness. What? Merely cut off my ownright hand if it offend me? What business have my neighbors tokeep their right hands if I am not able to make mine behaveitself ? Off with the lot of them! Let there be no right hands;then I am certain that mine won't land me in trouble. I have met many active prohibitionists, both in this and inother countries, all of them thoroughly in earnest. In someinstances I have found that their allegiance to the cause ofprohibition took its origin in the fact that some near relativeor friend had succumbed to over-indulgence in liquor. In one ortwo cases the man himself had been a victim of this weakness, andhad come to the conclusion, firstly that every one else wasconstituted as he was, and, therefore, liable to the same danger;and secondly, that unless every one were prevented from drinking,he would not be secure from the temptation to do so himself. This is one class of prohibitionists. The other, and by farthe larger class, is made up of religious zealots, to whomprohibition is a word having at bottom a far wider applicationthan that which is generally attributed to it. The liquorquestion, if there really is such a question per se, is merelyput forth by them as a means to an end, an incidental factor in afight which has for its object the supremacy of a certain form ofreligious faith. The belief of many of these people is that theCreator frowns upon enjoyment of any and every kind, and that hehas merely endowed us with certain desires and capacities forpleasure in order to give us an opportunity to please Him byresisting them. They are, of course, perfectly entitled to thisbelief, though some of us may consider it eccentric and somewhatin the nature of a libel on the Almighty. But are they privilegedto force that belief on all their fellow beings? That, insubstance, is the question that is involved in the present-dayprohibition movement. For it is all nonsense to suppose that because, perhaps, onein a hundred or so of human beings is too weak to resist thetemptation of over-indulging in drink-or of over-indulging inanything else, for the matter of that-=therefore all mankind isgoing to forego the right to indulge in that enjoyment inmoderation. the leaders of the so-called prohibition movementknow as well as you and I do that you can no more prevent anindividual from taking a drink if he be so inclined than your canprevent him from scratching himself if he itches. They object tothe existence of the saloon, not, bear in mind, to that of thebadly conducted saloon, but to that of the well-regulated, decentsaloon, and wherever they succeed in destroying the latter, theirobject, which is the manifestation of their political power, isattained. That for every decent, well-ordered saloon theydestroy, there springs up a dive, or speak-easy, or blind tiger,or whatever other name it may be known by, and the dispensing ofdrink continues as merrily as before, doesn't disturb them atall. They make the sale of liquor a crime, but steadily refuse tomake its purchase and consumption an offense. Time and again theindustries affected by this apparently senseless crusade haveendeavored to have laws passed making dry territories really dryby providing for the punishment of the man who buys drink as wellas the man who sells it. But every such attempt has been fiercelyopposed by the prohibition leaders. And why? Because they knowonly too well that the first attempt to really prohibit drinkingwould put an end to their power forever. They know that 80 percent of those who, partly by coercion, partly from sentiment,vote dry, are perfectly willing to restrict the right of theremaining 20 per cent to obtain drink, but that they are notwilling to sacrifice that right for themselves. And so the farce called prohibition goes on, and will continueto go on as long as it brings grist to the mill of the managerswho are producing it. But the farce conceals something far moreserious than that which is apparent to the public on the face ofit. Prohibition is merely the title of the movement. Its realpurpose is of a religious, sectarian character, and this appliesnot only to the movement in America, but to the same movement inEngland, a fact which, strangely enough, has rarely, if at all,been recognized by those who have dealt with the question in thepublic press. If there is any one who doubts the truth of this statement,let me put this to him: How many Roman Catholics areprohibitionists? How many Jews, the most temperate race on earth,are to be found in the ranks of prohibition? Or Lutherans? OrGerman Protestants generally? What is the proportion ofEpiscopalians to that of Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians,and the like, in the active prohibition army? The answer to thesequestions will, I venture to say, prove conclusively theassertion that the fight for prohibition is synonymous with thefight of a certain religious sect, or group of religious sects,for the supremacy of its ideas. In England it is theNonconformists, which is in that country the generic name for thesame sects, who are fighting the fight, and the suppression ofliquor there is no more the ultimate end they have in view thanit is here in America. It is the fads and restrictions that arepart and parcel of their lugubrious notion of Godworship whichthey eventually hope to impose upon the rest of humanity; aSunday without a smile, no games, no recreation, no pleasures, nomusic, card-playing tabooed, dancing anathematized, the beautiesof art decried as impure-in short, this world reduced to abarren, forbidding wilderness in which we, its inhabitants, areto pass our time contemplating the joys of the next. Ratherproblematical joys, by the way, if we are to suppose we shallworship God in the next world in the same somber way as we arecalled upon by these worthies to do in this. To my mind, and that of many others, the hearty, happy laughof a human being on a sunny Sunday is music sweeter to the earsof that being's Creator than all the groaning and moanings, and misericordiasthat rise to heaven from the lips of those who would depriveus altogether of the faculty and the privilege of mirth. Thatsome overdo hilarity and become coarse and offensive, goeswithout saying. There are people without the sense of proportionor propriety in all matters. Yet none of us think of abolishingpleasures because a few do not know how to enjoy them inmoderation and with decency, and become an offense to theirneighbors. The drink evil has existed from time immemorial, just assexual excess has, and all other vices to which mankind is andalways will be more or less prone, though less in proportion aseducation progresses and the benefits of civilization increasedSexual excess, curiously enough, has never interested our hyper-religious friends, the prohibitionists, in anything like thedegree that the vice of excessive drinking does. Perhaps this isbecause the best of us have our pet aversions and our petweaknesses. Yet this particular vice has produced more evilresults to the human race than all other vices combined, and, inspite of it, mankind, thanks not to prohibitive laws andrestrictive legislation, but to the forward strides of knowledgeand to patient and intelligent education, is to-day ten timessounder in body and healthier in mind than it ever was in theworld's history. Now, if the habit of drinking to excess were a growing one, asour prohibitionist friends claim that it is, we should to-day,instead of discussing this question with more or lessintelligence, not be here at all to argue it; for the evil, suchas it is, has existed for so many ages that, if it were asgeneral and as contagious as is claimed, and its results asfar-reaching as they are painted, the human race would have beendestroyed by it long ago. Of course, the contrary is the case.The world has progressed in this as in all other respects.Compare, for instance, the drinking to-day with the drinking of athousand years ago, nay, of only a hundred odd years ago, when aman, if he wanted to ape his so-called betters, did so bycontriving to be carried to bed every night "drunk as alord." Has that condition of affairs been altered bylegislative measures restricting the right of the individual tocontrol himself ? No. It has been altered by that far greaterpower, the moral force of education and the good example whichteaches mankind the very thing that prohibition would take fromit: the virtue of selfcontrol and moderation in all things. And here we come to the vital distinction between the advocacyof temperance and the advocacy of prohibition. Temperance andself-control are convertible terms. Prohibition, or that which itimplies, is the direct negation of the term self-control. Inorder to save the small percentage of men who are too weak toresist their animal desires, it aims to put chains on every man,the weak and the strong alike. And if this is proper in onerespect, why not in all respects? Yet, what would one think of aproposition to keep all men locked up because a certain numberhave a propensity to steal? Theoretically, perhaps, all crime orvice could be stopped by chaining us all up as we chain up a wildanimal, and only allowing us to take exercise under propersupervision and control. But while such a measure would checkcrime, it would not eliminate the criminal. It is true, somepeople are only kept from vice and crime by the fear ofpunishment. Is not, indeed, the basis of some men's religiousnessnothing else but the fear of Divine punishment? The doctrines ofcertain religious denominations not entirely unknown in theprohibition camp make self respect, which is the foundation ofself-control and of all morality, a sin. They decry rather thanadvocate it. They love to call themselves miserable, helplesssinners, cringing before the flaming sword, and it is the flamingsword, not the exercise of their own enlightened will, that keepsthem within decent bounds. Yet has this fear of eternalpunishment contributed one iota toward the intrinsic bettermentof the human being? If it had, would so many of our Christiancreeds have discarded it, admitting that it is the precepts ofreligion, not its dark and dire threats, that make men trulybetter and stronger within themselves to resist that which ourself-respect teaches us is bad and harmful? The growth ofself-respect in man, with its outward manifestation,self-control, is the growth of civilization. If we are to beallowed to exercise it no longer, it must die in us from want ofnutrition, and men must become savages once more, fretting now attheir chains, which they will break as inevitably as the sun willrise to-morrow and herald a new day. I consider the danger which threatens civilized society fromthe growing power of a sect whose views on prohibition are merelyan exemplification of their general low estimate of man's abilityto rise to higher things -by his own volition to be of infinitelygreater consequence than the danger that, in putting their narrowtheories to the test, a few billions of invested property will bedestroyed, a number of great wealth-producing industries wipedout, the rate of individual taxation largely increased, and amillion or so of struggling wage earners doomed to facestarvation. These latter considerations, of course, must appealto every thinking mans but what are they compared with thegreater questions involved? Already the government of our State,and indeed of a good many other States, has passed practicallyinto the hands of a few preacher-politicians of a certain creed.With the machine they have built up, by appealing to theemotional weaknesses of the more or less unintelligent masses,they have lifted themselves on to a pedestal of power that hasenabled them to dictate legislation or defeat it at their will,to usurp the functions of the governing head of the State andactually induce him to delegate to them the appointive powersvested in him by the Constitution. When a Governor elected by thepopular vote admits, as was recently the case, that he can notappoint a man to one of the most important offices of the Statewithout the indorsement of the irresponsible leader of a certainsemi-religious movement, and when he submits to this samepersonage for correction and amendment his recommendation to thelegislative body, there can scarcely be any doubt left in anyreasonable mind as to the extent of the power wielded by thisleader, or as to the uses he and those behind him intend puttingit to. And what does it all mean? It means that government by emotionis to be substituted for government by reason, and government byemotion, of which history affords many examples, is, according tothe testimony of all ages, the most dangerous and pernicious ofail forms of government. It has already crept into thelegislative assemblies of most of the States of the Union, and isbeing craftily fostered by those who know how easily it can bemade available for their purposes-purposes to the furtherance ofwhich cool reason would never lend itself. Prohibition is but oneof its fruits, and the hand that is plucking this fruit is thesame hand of intolerance that drove forth certain of ourforefathers from the land of their birth to seek the shelteringfreedom of these shores. What a strange reversal of conditions! The intolerants of afew hundred years ago are the upholders of liberty to-day, whilethose they once persecuted, having multiplied by grace of thevery liberty that has so long sheltered them here, are nowplanning to impose the tyranny of their narrow creed upon thedescendants of their persecutors of yore. Let the greater public, which is, after all, the arbiter ofthe country's destinies, pause and ponder these things beforethey are allowed to progress too far. Prohibition, though it mustcallse, and is already causing, incalculable damage, may neversucceed in this country; but that which is behind it, as thecatapults and the cannon were behind the battering rams in thebattles of olden days, is certain to succeed unless timelymeasures of prevention are resorted to; and if it does succeed,we shall witness the enthronement of a monarch in this land ofliberty compared with whose autocracy the autocracy of theRussian Czar is a mere trifle. The name of this monarch is Religious Intolerance.

In 1926 two of itsofficers reaffirmed that support in testimony before theCommittee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate. Thefollowing is scanned from K. Austin Kerr, ed., The Politics ofMoral Behavior: Prohibition and Drug Abuse (Reading: AddisonWesley, 1973) The support of national prohibition bythe Federal Council of the Churches rests upon four fundamentalconsiderations. First. The belief that in dealing withgigantic social evils like disease or crime, individual libertymust be controlled in the interest of the public welfare. Second.The belief that the liquor traffic is beyond question such anevil. Third. The conviction that no plan less thoroughgoing thanprohibition is sufficient to eradicate the evils of the liquortraffic. Fourth. The evidence of history that other methods ofattempting to control the traffic have failed and thatprohibition, despite inadequacies of enforcement, is succeedingbetter than any other program. Limitation upon individual freedom inmatters affecting society is the price that any people must payfor the progress of its civilization. Personal liberty can notrightly be claimed for practices which militate against thewelfare of others or the interests of the community as a whole. It is especially contrary to democraticideals and to enlightened public policy to permit any citizen tomake profit from a business which is detrimental to his neighbor.This is readily recognized by all as sound policy in regard tothe trade in narcotics. It is equally true of the liquor traffic.To insure social protection against a trade whose avowed purposewas to get people to consume the maximum possible amount ofalcoholic liquor is the foundation on which our national policyof prohibition rests. The policy of prohibition was notadopted hastily nor was it foisted upon the country by apuritanical minority. It was first voted in most of the Statesseparately and then nationally, because the people had becomeconvinced that the liquor traffic was a social evil of suchmagnitude that it had to be destroyed. The eighteenth amendmentwas made a part of the Constitution by the regular methods whichthe founders of the Republic devised with a view to making theamendment to the Constitution difficult rather than easy. Yetthis amendment was adopted more promptly than any other change inthe Constitution ever proposed. The reasons which led to prohibition notonly remain to-day but have been reinforced by the experience ofother nations. The social peril of alcoholism is becoming agrowing concern to statesmen throughout the world. If seriousevils have sprung up since prohibition, they are far less thanthe evils which arose from the liquor traffic prior to theamendment. The liquor traffic with the accompanying saloon wasallied with political corruption, crime, gambling, andprostitution. It meant the wreckage of men and the degradation offamilies, which social workers and ministers saw constantly intheir daily work. It produced needless inefficiency in industry.Moreover, the tendency in the United States, as has been the casein Europe, was toward an increasing consumption of the strongerliquors with consequent intensifying of social hazards. Methodsof control short of prohibition, such as taxation, regulations,and the governmentally controlled systems of some of the CanadianProvinces, Norway, and Sweden, have all proved inadequate to copewith the evil. The proposal to modify the Volstead Actso as to permit the sale of wines and beer presents insuperableobjections. It would make enforcement more difficult. It wouldinevitably mean the return either of the saloon or somethingequally undesirable. Bootlegging in stronger liquors would becomemore menacing because it would tend to operate through the placeswhere the milder intoxicants were sold. Moreover, there is noevidence to justify the contention that to permit wine and beerwould reduce the consumption of ardent spirits. The teaching ofexperience is to the contrary. The one path of advance is for all goodcitizens personally to observe the law and to support the greatenterprise, born of the idealism of the people, of completelyridding the Nation of as demoralizing a business as the liquortraffic has always proved itself to be. Least of all should ourprohibition law be changed in response to the cry of those who bytheir own disrespect for the law are preventing it from receivinga fair trial or who, because of their special interest in thereturn of the liquor traffic, are artificially stimulating anagitation for changing our present law. The call of the hour isfor such a thoroughgoing work of moral persuasion and legalenforcement as will give the policy of prohibition an adequateopportunity to demonstrate its full value to the Nation and tothe world.

The group sought better law enforcement for the betterrealization of the reform, as its president, Mrs. Henry W.Peabody, informed a Senate committee. The NationalProhibition Law, Hearings before the Committee onthe Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 69th Congress, 1st Session (1926):666-67 We represent here to-day not onlyorganizations of women, but, as a whole, we represent the home,the school, the church, and we stand firmly for no amendment tothe eighteenth amendment. We hold the Constitution of the UnitedStates inviolate. We stand for no modification of the VolsteadAct, but rather a strengthening. We stand for strict lawenforcement, with the removal of all men who do not strictlyenforce the law. We believe that in the greater part ofthe territory of this country the law is observed as well as anylaw. Having traveled in various parts of this country we did notobserve more drinking than ever. We find conditions vastlyimproved. Health, as testified to by the insurance companies;morals, as shown by the statements which will be produced later;and certainly the economic condition, on the word of ourSecretary of Commerce, seem to have justified prohibition. The conditions in States like New Yorkand Maryland, where there is no State enforcement law, which isrequired by the eighteenth amendment, framed to secure concurrentaction, are bad. The only remedy, it seems to us, as women, isnot a change of law which is satisfactory to the majority of theStates, but to do what the Constitution requires to make the lawenforceable. That would remove very many of the offenses whichare piled up to prove that the Nation is not appearing to enforceits laws. As women, we know the old saloon andthe wreckage in homes and lives of boys, men, and women. Whilethe vote for the eighteenth amendment was the vote of the men--itwas also the vote of the women who had prayed and worked forprotection from this ancient evil. We had thought it settled, andperhaps for that reason and believing in the Constitution, wehave not done as much as we should have done to see to theenforcement of the law. Perhaps we as women, not being in theposition to select men who should administer these laws, trustedtoo much and needed the awakening which has come. We areconvinced that we have a good law--a righteous law--written intothe Constitution of the United States--that it does not in anyway affect the personal liberty of well-doers--those loyal to thehighest interests of the country and the great majority of thepeople. We are not satisfied that the law isbeing enforced in all places. We are sure it will be when theNation has had time to adjust itself. In a well-regulated home itis the policy of a mother to work faithfully and patiently,knowing that perfect obedience requires law and discipline. It isnever the policy of a good mother or teacher to say the childrenare disobedient--therefore let us give in to them and let them doas they like.

The leading branch of it ... isthe sale of alcoholic liquor.... The liquor interests are vastlymore extended in Chicago that any other. There are 7,300 licensedliquor sellers in Chicago, and in addition about a thousandplaces where liquor is sold illegally. The only business whichapproaches it in number of establishments ... is the grocerytrade, which has about 5,200. The city spends at least half asmuch for what it drinks as for what it eats.... The great central powerin the liquor business in America is the brewery. ...Thebreweries own or control the great majority of the saloons ofAmerican cities. They have a distinct policy:--if there are notas many saloons as there can be, supply them. This is what hasbeen done in Chicago. Fully ninety per cent of the Chicagosaloons are under some obligation to the brewery; with at leasteighty per cent, this obligation is a serious one. The business of thebrewery is to sell beer.... The brewery, under present conditionsin Chicago, must sell beer at all cost, or promptly die. This isbecause the brewery business has become over-capitalized andoverbuilt there for at least ten years. There has been furiouscompetition.... At the present time a full third of the capitalinvested in the forty companies and fifty plants is not earningdividends. Under these circumstances, the breweries of Chicagocan have but one aim--to fill Chicago with beer to the point ofsaturation. Each brewer disposes ofhis product by contracting with special saloon-keepers to sellhis beer and no other. The more saloons he has, the better....The brewers employ special agents to watch continually every nookand cranny in Chicago where it may be possible to pour in alittle more beer. If a rival brewery's saloon keeper is doingwell, his best bartender is ravished from him and set up inbusiness alongside. If a new colony of foreigners appears, somecompatriot is set at once to selling them liquor. Italians,Greeks, Lithuanians, Poles,--all the rough and hairy tribes whichhave been drawn into Chicago,--have their trade exploited to theutmost. ...No man with two hundred dollars, who was not subjectto arrest on sight, need go without a saloon in Chicago.... Withthat two hundred dollars as a margin, the brewery sorts him out aset of its stock of saloon fixtures, pays his rent, pays hislicense, and supplies him with beer. He pays for everything in anextra price on each barrel of beer.... Under this system ...Chicago has four times as many saloons as it should have, fromany standpoint whatever, except, of course, the brewers' and thewholesalers'. A new license law ... now limits the number to one[saloon] in every five hundred people; but it will be yearsbefore that law will have any appreciable effect. There is nowone retail liquor dealer to every two hundred and eighty fivepeople, disregarding, of course, the one thousand unlicenseddealers. In the laboring wards the licensed saloons run as manyas one to every one hundred and fifty. Take the stock-yards.Around that long and dismal stockade, at every hole from which ahuman being can emerge, a shop or group of shops sits waiting. Atthe main entrance they lie massed in batteries.... The Chicago market isthoroughly saturated with beer, and incidentally with otherliquor. Reckoning it out by population, every man, woman, andchild in Chicago drank, in 1906, two and one-quarter barrels ofbeer,--that is, seventy gallons,--three and one-half times theaverage consumption in the United States.... Now, if the competitionis red-handed among the breweries, it is simply ravenous amongthe saloon-keepers. There is a popular fallacy that there is agreat profit in the retail saloon business. The saloon-keepersthemselves believe this when they go into it.... All this means onething--a premium on the irregular and criminal saloon-keeper. Thepatronage of the saloon is a very fickle and elusive thing. Aplace is popular, or it is nothing. ... There are two generalbusiness methods of attracting [a good trade]: By givingunusually large measures or big bonuses of free lunch; or bycarrying illegitimate and illegal side lines. The first ... doesnot leave large margins of profit; the second does. A year agothe license fee was raised in Chicago from five hundred to onethousand dollars. It was hoped this would wipe out the criminalsaloon. It did, of course, nothing of the sort. The poor,miserable little dives in the working-man's ward, each snatchinga starvation living from the lips of the dwellers of the dozensmoke-befouled frame tenements about it, staggered down--a fewhundred of them--and died. The man with the side-line ofprostitution and gambling naturally survived and had the benefitof the others' failure.

The Drug Abuse Resistance Education logo -- "D.A.R.E. ToKeep Kids Off Drugs" -- is on bumper stickers, T-shirts,even Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes. Police, taxpayers and businessgive $700 million a year. It's also a favorite of dozens ofmembers of Congress. But a raft of scientific studies says D.A.R.E., the 17-weekcourse taught by uniformed police, doesn't achieve its mainlong-term goal: stopping kids from smoking pot, drinking booze orusing other drugs. "I've got nothing against D.A.R.E., but we need to getsome white light on this issue so we can wisely decide how tospend our money and on what programs," says Tom Colthurst,who recently organized a national conference on drug education atthe University of California-San Diego. But D.A.R.E. executivedirector Glenn Levant calls the studies flawed and notcomprehensive: "Scientists, will tell you bumble bees can'tfly, but we know they can." Levant says a proper national study would cost $3 million-$5million and take seven years to finish. Studies have focused mostly on specific cities, and costseveral hundred thousand dollars each. Experts agree recent research on D.A.R.E. is not perfect: Itis difficult and expensive to measure the behavior of largenumbers of children over several years. But they say the researchis better than studies on other drug programs. "Almost everyresearcher would agree there's enough information to judgeD.A.R.E.," says Rand Corp. researcher Phyllis Ellickson. "It's well-established that D.A.R.E. doesn't work,"says Gilbert Botvin of the Institute for Prevention at CornellUniversity Medical Center. Created in 1983 under the direction of former Los AngelesPolice chief Daryl Gates, D.A.R.E. exploded after the Bushadministration gave it heavy federal subsidies. The program uses lectures, role playing and other techniquesto teach children to avoid drugs. And by all accounts, the kidswho take the course and the police who teach it think it'sterrific. D.A.R.E. "does no harm and by far, nothing butgood," says Scott Mandel, a Los Angeles-area teacher."D.A.R.E. really works," says Mike Miller, Round Rock,Texas, police officer and D.A.R.E. teacher. "Surveys fromacross the nation show kids who take the D.A.R.E. course are muchless likely to use drugs later in life." That's not what most studies show. To investigate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness, researchers lookedat two similar groups of children: One group takes D.A.R.E.; theother does not. Then, researchers followed the children'sbehavior for several years. Since 1987, studies -- most funded bylaw enforcement agencies involved in the program -- have beenconducted at 20 North Carolina schools; 31 Kentucky schools; 11South Carolina schools; 36 Illinois schools; and 11 Canadianschools. The results were similar. The 1991 Kentucky study, the National Institute on Drug Abusereported, found "no statistically significant differencesbetween experimental groups and control groups in the percentageof new users of ... cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol,marijuana." A 1990 study funded by the Canadian government found"D.A.R.E. had no significant effect on the students' use ofany of the substances measured.... They included: tobacco, beer,pop, marijuana, acid, Valium, wine, aspirin, uppers, downers,heroin, crack (cocaine), liquor, candy, glue and PCP." To make sense of the various studies, the Justice Departmenthired the Research Triangle Institute of Durham, N.C., to conducta statistical analysis of all D.A.R.E. research. A preliminary report from the RTI -- analyzing eight studiesinvolving 9,500 children -- says D.A.R.E. has "a limited toessentially non-existent effect" on drug use. D.A.R.E. did have a positive effect on children's knowledgeand attitudes about drugs, the report says. It also added thesocial skills needed to say no to drugs. But even on these measures, D.A.R.E. didn't do as well asother drug programs, including local classes taught by teachersand students. D.A.R.E. America has launched a behind-the-scenes lobbyingcampaign against the final RTI report, due in November. "We're working with D.A.R.E. to ... voice theirconcerns," says Winnie Reed, the National Institute ofJustice official overseeing the study. The pressure has angered some academic researchers."It's repugnant, out of line and very unusual," saysDennis Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Research in Law andJustice at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Rosenbaum -- a D.A.R.E. supporter -- says the group is itsown worst enemy because it has spent so much effort attacking theevaluations, rather than learning from research. Even some state and local D.A.R.E. programs are backing awayfrom D.A.R.E. America's fight. "If we aren't getting the jobdone, we ought to be man enough to try something else," saysTim DeRosa of the Illinois state police and long-time D.A.R.E.activist. Some government officials are aware of D.A.R.E.'sshortcomings. "Research shows that, no, D.A.R.E. hasn't been effectivein reducing drug use," says William Modzeleski, the top drugofficial at the Department of Education. The department has considered asking Congress to repeal a lawrequiring states to give D.A.R.E. a total of $10 million or morea year from federal Drug Free Schools money. But D.A.R.E. continues to have high-level government support. On Sept. 9 -- National D.A.R.E. Day by congressional decree-- D.A.R.E. officials and students lunched with dozens of Congressmembers and met Attorney General Janet Reno. Later, they visitedfirst lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Drug czar Lee Brown, who started the program in Houston whenhe was police chief, remains a booster. "My experience hasbeen positive," Brown says. "The research has pointedin many different directions, but my conclusion is it's better tohave it than not have it. I know first-hand that young people areimpressed by it and look up to the D.A.R.E. officer as a rolemodel." Yet many drug education experts fear that D.A.R.E.'spolitical clout is siphoning drug education money from betterprograms. "D.A.R.E. has a following and sales force that isextremely powerful in fighting for scarce resources," saysUniversity of Michigan researcher Lloyd Johnston, who conductsthe government's survey of teen drug use. "But its growth istotally out of scale to its effectiveness." Johnston and others aren't sure why D.A.R.E. isn't workingbetter. Some think it targets children too young; some think teachersand older students get better results than uniformed police;others say the program relies on psychological theories thatdon't work. Levant thinks critics are just jealous of D.A.R.E.'s success."We're like apple pie," he says. "But I guess youcan always find someone who doesn't like apple pie." -- CliffSchaffer's Home Page WT01-B38-56IA031-000655-B033-179http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/GENERAL/remus.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122110807 text/html 6619HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 11:07:57 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 06:29:25 GMTContent-length: 6402 George Remus - a Prohibition Saga Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | General and Entertainment George Remus - a Prohibition Saga Summarized by Bob Ramsey The story of George Remus is fascinating in its own right,emcompassing love, jealousy, crime, enormous wealth, retribution,murder, and courtroom drama. It also shows very clearly howprohibition warps society with irresistible incentives. This version of the story is excerpted from THE LONG THIRST-PROHIBITION IN AMERICA: 1920-1933 by Thomas M. Coffey WW Norton& Co, New York City 1975 SYNOPSIS: George Remus was born in Germany in 1876 and migrated toChicago at the age of 5. His father was incapacitated when he was 14 and Georgesupported the family by working at a pharmacy, which he bought atage 19. Within 5 more years, he bought another drugstore,married, and had a daughter. He became a lawyer in 1900, at age24. He specialized in criminal defense, especially murder, andbecame rather famous. By 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year (whengold was $20 per ounce). He divorced after developing an ongoingaffair with his beautiful and ambitious secretary (Imogene), whohad a 13 year-old daughter (Ruth). Alcohol Prohibition started inJanuary 1920, and within a few months Remus saw that his clients,a generally crude and ignorant lot, were becoming very wealthyvery quickly. He was sure he could do better than them with hisintelligence and knowledge of the law. He memorized the Volstead Act (that enforced prohibition) andfound loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmaciesso as to sell liquor to himself under government licenses for medicinalpurposes. Most of the liquor would disappear on the way tomarket. He moved to Cincinnati because 80 percent of America'sbonded whiskey was within 300 miles, and bought up most ofAmerica's best-known whiskey manufacturers. In less than three years he made $40 million ($760M in 1995dollars). He bribed hundreds of police, judges, and governmentofficials including $500,000 to the U.S. Attorney General. George and Imogene held a lavish party at their new mansion onNew Year's Eve of 1922-23. The guests included 100 couples whowere as well-connected as one could imagine. At dawn the Remus'spresented all their male guests with diamond jewelry, and gaveeach guest's wife a brand new automobile for the drive home. Thiswas the high point. Prohibition enforcement stepped up shortly and Remus foundhimself sentenced to two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary,which was (for rich inmates) much like a luxury hotel. While Remus was in prison, his wife Imogene took up with anextremely handsome prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge. Dodgesoon resigned from the Bureau of Prohibition. Together, he andImogene liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money aspossible. They did various unkind things to him such as: Imogene gave George $100 as his share of the proceeds when she sold the Fleischman Company. At one point she tried to have him deported, claiming his father had never become a citizen. Dodge and Mrs. Remus reportedly offered a gang $15,000 to murder George. Imogene proceeded to divorce him in late 1927. On the day thedivorce was to be finalized, on the way to court Remus had hischauffeur chase the cab carrying Imogene and her daughter throughCincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped outscreaming and shot her dead while her daughter tried to stop him. Remus the expert criminal defender was now on trial for hislife. The trial made national headlines for a month, sharingfront pages with Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Remus pleadedtemporary insanity, a novel approach at the time. Having long been the most generous man in town, he was verypopular in Cincinnati, and he so successfully vilified Imogeneand her boyfriend Dodge that the jury deliberated only 19 minutesbefore acquitting him by reason of insanity. The courtroomerupted in shamefully exuberant jubilation. The state of Ohio then tried to commit him to an insane asylumsince the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted bytheir previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's threewell-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murderbecause was not insane. Remus tried to get back into bootlegging, but soon retiredwhen he found that the market had been taken over by vicious,well-armed gangsters. He moved across the Ohio river to a(relatively) modest home in Covington, Kentucky, and lived outhis life for another 20-odd years in relative obscurity.

Schaffer Some of us are destined for greatness. And theothers . . . There are a certain number of people in the world who believe,for whatever reason, that they have the one true answer to somemajor problem of their time. For a few of them, the belief isstrong enough that they charge off like Don Quixote, arrogantlydetermined to make the whole rest of the world conform to theirview of reality. For a tiny, rare percentage of them it is anactual historical truth that they have the one true answer to amajor problem. By far the majority, however, are just plain,garden-variety nuts destined to go to their deathbed thinkingthey almost had it. If you happen to be a person so afflicted,how can you tell whether you really are one of these uniquepeople in history, or just a plain, old nut? Consider, for example, the true story of Emperor JoshuaNorton. Joshua Norton was a businessman in San Francisco in the1800's. In the 1840's, just before the Gold Rush, he tried tocorner the market on rice and failed. He went from being verywealthy to being destitute overnight and the experiencecompletely shattered his reason. A couple of months after thisevent, he put on a formal admiral's uniform, complete with goldbraid and epaulets and strode in to the office of the newspaper.He handed the editor a large, official looking proclamation whichstated in quite formal language that, due to popular demand, hehereby declared himself Emperor Norton I of San Francisco,California, and Mexico. He bade all his subjects show him loyaltyand the other courtesies due a person of such eminent stature. From the pictures of Emperor Norton, it is immediatelyapparent that this guy has gone around the bend and ain't comingback. His eyes pointed in different directions, and neither onequite caught straight ahead. His uniform was formal to the pointof almost gaudy and, at the same time, it was quite apparent thathe and soap were not of regular acquaintance. The editor, with a rich sense of humor, decided to publish theproclamation on the front page of the newspaper, in allseriousness. The citizens of San Francisco, being what they are,immediately decided that this sounded like a good idea and, byunanimous acclamation, accepted Norton as their Emperor. It isundoubtedly the only time in history they ever had an unanimousvote on anything. He reigned for about forty years. During that time he ate inall of the finest restaurants and slept in the finest hotels forfree -- because he was the Emperor. He had three seatspermanently reserved in the front row of the San Francisco operahouse -- one for him, and one each for his two dogs. Twice a yearhe would review the police and fire departments as they paradedby, and then he would make a grand speech to the assembledcrowds. He printed his own money, which was accepted in businessestablishments around San Francisco as legal tender. Whenbicycles first came out, they got him a bicycle, too, and helooked all the more daft because of it. When one of his dogsdied, 10,000 people turned out for the funeral to console theirgrief-stricken emperor. When the Civil War rolled around, hegraciously offered his alliance and military support to AbrahamLincoln, who politely declined. Make no mistake about it, the Emperor Norton was as good aloony as you have ever run across and I can't help feeling that aman who was that intelligent must have had some idea of just howcompletely nuts he really was. Now here's the problem. During his reign as Emperor, Nortoncame up with three major ideas: 1) He called upon the other leaders of the world to join himin forming a League of Nations where disputes between nationscould be resolved peacefully. 2) He suggested that parts of San Francisco Bay be filled into make more room to build. 3) He proposed that a suspension-span bridge be built acrossthe spot where the Golden Gate stands now. He even laid out acomplete design that looks remarkably close to the bridge thatwas built sixty years after he died. He correctly predicted thatonly a suspension span bridge would have the strength to spansuch a large stretch, and the flexibility to stand up under theextreme stress which would be placed on such a structure. He didthis at a time when the only suspension bridges ever built wererope bridges in remote parts of Africa. Of course, when he proposed these ideas, the response was longand uproarious laughter -- the Emperor was up to his old tricksagain. In time, all of his ideas became reality. At the time, noone believed him. It has occurred to me that Jesus must have had the sameproblem. Think of what must have happened when he showed up forhis high school reunion. "Hey fellas," He says. "You'll never believewhat happened. It turns out I really AM the Messiah." "Yeah, right," his school chums say. "If you'rethe Messiah, where's your Porsche?" That's probably why he spent all his time doing miracles liketurning water into wine -- nobody took him seriously until heshowed up with the booze. So put yourself in Emperor Norton's position and consider whatyou might do. Suppose you are strolling down the street one day,perhaps toking your favorite blend, and a big bolt of lightningcomes out of the sky and blasts you right out of your shoes. Whenyou come to, you are thoroughly convinced that you have the onetrue insight which, unique among men, has given you the answer toone or more of society's most troubling problems. What are you todo? If you keep quiet about it, the world could be missing one ofthe best emperors ever to come along. Everyone loses, includingyou. If you act on it, tell everyone about it, and attempt toinstall yourself as emperor then you could do some real good forboth you and posterity. Certainly, if you can really save theworld then it seems almost a moral obligation to try. Of course,if you try, you have to face the fact that, statisticallyspeaking, it is far more likely that you are a nut than anemperor, and far more likely that you will be laughed at thantaken seriously. There have been lots and lots of nuts, and onlya handful of emperors. So what should you do? I think the only thing you can do isact on the belief, keep an enormous sense of humor, and becontent with the fact that you might wind up in the encyclopedianext to Emperor Norton. But that's just my take on the situation.

Schaffer This is a true story. The facts have not been embellished. Infact, I left a lot of stuff out. When I first met Art in the late 1960's, he had just gottenout of prison the first time and was in college, desperatelytrying to make a go of his life. He was a bit scroungy in hisappearance, but everybody was a little scroungy in those days andthe truth was that Art never did have the money for fine clothes.He did the best he could. Art was one the nicest, friendliest,and most agreeable people I ever met. As a friend, I enjoyed hiscompany on every occasion and found that Art was not a completeangel (neither was I, for that matter), but there was no reasonto ever believe that he might be any real threat to society. But Art was the unluckiest soul I have ever run across. Forexample, the first time Art went to prison, it was for stealinghis own motorcycle. He was later arrested and/or went to prisonfor burglarizing his own apartment, stealing a mattress from aSalvation Army box, and for selling marijuana that even thepolice knew wasn't his. Those are only a few of the misfortuneswhich befell him and I haven't even gotten to the part about hislawyer. I will explain. Stealing His Own Motorcycle When Art became old enough to get a driver's license, heworked hard and saved his money until he was able to buy thevehicle of his dreams, a three-wheeled motorcycle. When hethought he had enough money, about $1,000 as I recall, hesearched around and found a three-wheeled motorcycle for sale ata local wrecking yard. The owner of the wrecking yard was notwell-renowned for his honest business dealings, and Art probablyshould have been more cautious but Art was so dazzled with theprospect of fulfilling his dream that he bought it anyway. As Arttells it, the owner of the wrecking yard made certain promisesabout the mechanical fitness of the vehicle and Art quickly foundout that the vehicle was in no shape to be driven. Art called the owner of the junkyard, raised the riot act, anddemanded that repairs be made immediately. The owner of thejunkyard told him to bring the bike on over and he would fix itup. Art did so. About a week later Art showed up to pick up his bike. It wasall repaired and ready for the road, complete with a bill fromthe junkyard owner for several hundred dollars worth of repairs.Art went ballistic, screaming and shouting that he had beenrobbed and that the junkyard owner had warranted that the vehiclewas in good shape when he bought it. It was an old story, theused car dealer with a mechanic's lien against the injured buyer- who are you going to believe? Art left in a rage and his common sense, which never was ingreat supply, left him completely. The next weekend, he went tothe wrecking yard when it was closed, cut the lock on the gate,went in, got his bike, and took it home. On Monday morning, it was perfectly obvious to the junkyardowner what had happened. The lock was cut and only one thing wasmissing. This didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out. He hadlong experience in turning such situations to his advantage. Hequickly called the police, reported the theft and, in addition,claimed that several thousand dollars of other goods had beentaken. Who can tell what is missing from a junkyard? The police simply stopped by Art's house, found the bike inthe driveway, and hauled him off to jail. The DA then trumpetedthe news that a major theft ring had been broken and shipped Artoff to prison. The proof that Art was part of a major burglaryring was supplied by the fact that there really wasn't muchevidence. They expected, from the junkyard owner's description ofthe incident, that there would be tons of stuff in Art's garage.As it was, there was nothing but the bike which indicated onlyone possible conclusion - he must have stolen tons of the stuffand been able to fence all of it in less than 48 hours -obviously a major theft ring. The DA and cops got a lot of goodpublicity for saving the community from this awful scourge. Finepolice work saved the day, they said. The junkyard owner got Art's money, the bike, and payment fromthe insurance company for the items "stolen" but notrecovered. Art's lawyer got a mortgage on Art's parents' house.The situation worked out great for everybody, except Art. Acouple of years later, when I met him, Art was still dealing withinsurance company people who were pursuing him and his parentsfor reimbursement of the stuff he never stole. For that he got a sentence of about five years, which netteddown to about 18 months in prison. He might have deserved a dayin jail and a short lecture about mechanics liens. When I walked down the street with Art, or appeared in anypublic place, it was immediately apparent that the SacramentoCounty Sheriffs had it in for him. I am not sure whether theyreally believed that Art ran a major theft ring as had beenalleged or whether they just didn't like his looks, or justdidn't like Art. I suspect it was the latter. He was an easytarget to pick on, and my personal impression was that they didit just because a number of them were plainly sadistic and theyliked easy targets. From that point forward, Art was likely to be stoppedanywhere, any time, by any Sheriff who happened to see him,without any real cause that I could determine. They just made ita point to hound him wherever they saw him. The Mattress Incident Art got out of prison and enrolled in the local juniorcollege. Art had no money and his parents had been effectivelybankrupted by the legal experience so Art was in a daily strugglejust to keep food in his belly and clothes on his back. But therewas no question that he was trying to get an education and pointhimself in the right direction. Because of the financial strains at home, Art moved out of hisparents' house and got a small two-room cottage."Small" is the operative word. The "bedroom"was literally not big enough to put a double bed in, and thekitchen was smaller. Mice and roaches? Of course. It was simplythe best Art could do. Life was extremely tough for Art. There wasn't much employmentavailable for anyone, let alone ex-cons, and he lived aday-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence. Beset by financialpressures, he turned to dealing marijuana on a small time basis,using some of the contacts he had met in prison. That income was"iffy" at best and Art had to use nearly all of it justto eat, pay the rent, and support his dilapidated pickup truck,which meant he didn't have any furniture. That is, the only thinghe had to sleep on was the linoleum floor. He went out driving with his friend John one night and noticeda mattress that someone had dumped at a Salvation Army donationbox. It seemed pretty clear to both of them that Art was just thekind of person for whom such a donation was intended, so theyproceeded to load it in to the back of Art's pickup truck. Asthey were doing so, the Sheriff pulled up. John, a talllong-legged guy, had an ounce of weed in his pants so he quicklyhurdled two or three six-foot fences and was gone into the night.Art was stuck. The deputies started their standard routine of harassing Artfor everything they could think of. They first hit him with everykind of mechanical citation they could on the truck, but thatwasn't much. Then they told Art they had found a joint on therunning board. Art, by this time, had learned the drill andpointed out that, realistically, such a charge would never stickand would just be a waste of time for both of them. Frustrated,the cops decided to charge him with stealing the mattress. Art,of course, clammed up and said nothing. They stuffed Art and the mattress into the back of theirpatrol car and drove down to the main jail in downtownSacramento, about fifteen miles away from where Art was arrested.When they got downtown, they talked it over with their superiorsand decided that - despite all the danger that mattress-stealingrepresented to the community - there was no way they could makethe charges stick in court. The reason was that they had caughtArt with the mattress half in, and half out, of his pickup truckand they couldn't tell for sure whether Art was stealing themattress, or dropping it off. I am sure it disappointed them. So they went to Art, gave him the news and showed him the exitdoor. He asked for a ride back to his truck which was greetedwith great hilarity all around. Art just turned slowly and walkedto the door. As he reached the door they called out "Wait!Don't forget your mattress!" They explained that he certainly couldn't leave his mattressthere and would have to take it with him. Art considered tellingthem that the mattress wasn't really his, but quickly realizedthat, if he did so, and refused to take the mattress, they wouldbust him again for stealing it. He asked for a ride again which,he later told me, provoked absolutely panic-stricken laughter."They were in tears!" he said. Art left the building dragging his mattress behind him, andwent out on the street to try to hitchhike home. He was tired,looked a little scroungy anyway, and was carrying a mattress, allof which is a real hindrance to efficient hitchhiking. Heconsidered just dumping the mattress and walking home, but therewere regular police patrols going by to watch his progress andmake sure that he didn't litter. Then it began to rain. Holding the mattress over his head allowed him to keep therain off of himself, but it meant that the mattress gotprogressively heavier with each step - and he still had more thanten miles to go. Late that night, after several hours of strugglewith the wet mattress, an undercover narc picked Art up, allowedArt to stuff the wet mattress in the back seat of his car, andgave him a ride home, pumping him all the time for information onwhere one might find a little weed. Art didn't tell him anything. Art finally got home, propped the soaked mattress up againstthe wall in the bedroom, and went to sleep, exhausted, on thelinoleum floor again. An hour after he fell asleep, the mattressfell over on him and, because the room was so narrow and themattress was so wet and heavy, it wedged him in so tight hecouldn't get out until his friend John came looking for him thenext day. Burglarizing His Own Apartment Times were undeniably tough for Art, and the exhaustion ofhaving to deal with the cops on an almost daily basis didn't helpmatters. A couple of times he did manage to get jobs, only to belet go when it became obvious to his employers that Art was acenter of attention for the police. But he managed to get by for quite a while doing odd jobs hereand there, eating next to nothing, and wearing the same oldthreadbare clothes. Then one day the rent was due and hislandlord came to the door. Art explained that he was about to goa job interview and then would pick up the rent money from hisparents and, if the landlord would kindly wait a little bit, Artwould surely have the money for him. It was a partial story - hisparents didn't have the money, either, but he did have a jobinterview - but Art was just trying to buy a little time to keephis life together. The landlord seemed to accept the story andArt thought everything was fine. Art started to get cleaned up for his job interview and, aftertaking a shower, put on his pants and went down to the mailbox tocheck the mail. By the time he got back, there was a padlock onthe door. He pleaded with the landlord but the landlord also knewby now that Art was of special interest to the cops, so thelandlord had no incentive to give Art even the tiniest break. Artwent out and sat in the middle of a field, with nothing on buthis pants, to think. By and by it got dark and Art figured he would sneak back into get the rest of his possessions which amounted to a belt, acouple of shirts, an old pair of shoes, three or four pieces ofraggedy underwear, and the mattress, which he decided not to tryto deal with again, because it had become extremely moldy fromthe earlier soaking in the rain. Getting in to his place waseasy. He just popped in through a side window. He was inside nomore than two or three minutes. When he popped his head out the window a deputy sheriff'sflashlight shone squarely in his face. The landlord had alertedthem hours before and they were waiting for him. Due to hisprevious criminal record, he wound up doing about another sixmonths on that one. The Marijuana That Wasn't His. When Art got out of jail he went back to college and tried tomake a go of it again. The only regular income he could find wasfrom selling small amounts of marijuana and other drugs. He hadsome fairly good drug connections from his various times in jail,but we was more honest and friendly than he was shrewd so henever did much more than a few small sales to eke out anexistence. As luck would have it Art ran into a bright young businessexecutive who was just starting out with a new wife and baby and,having put a little money aside, decided to dabble in themarijuana trading market. Somehow, he managed to get his hands onthirty pounds of weed and then started looking around to sell it.He didn't know anyone himself who was interested in thirty poundsof weed but eventually he ran into Art and mentioned that hewould pay Art a commission of one hundred dollars and a small bagof personal stash if Art could introduce him to someone who wouldbuy it. Art knew lots of people and one hundred dollars was a lotof money to Art, so he looked around until he found someone. Art introduced the two parties to the transaction and waitedpatiently for them to conclude their business so he could get hiscommission and leave. In the middle of the transaction, carlights went on and car motors started in the neighborhood aroundthem. In a matter of a few moments, they were surrounded bySacramento sheriff's deputies. The buyer he found turned out tobe a snitch. To summarize the legal proceedings which followed, the guy whoactually owned the weed pleaded that he was really a good citizenwho made a mistake, he had a wife and baby, etc., etc., He walkedout with probation, with an agreement to testify against Art. The snitch, who had previously been busted, got his previouscharges dropped with an agreement to testify against Art. Art was charged with possession for sale of the entire thirtypounds. That brings us to the lawyer. And Now, The Lawyer Art's lawyer advised him that, in view of all the previousconvictions, and a long string of nuisance violations (whichshould have been self-evident police harassment), this time Artwas destined to do some serious time in prison unless some sortof miracle happened. Art's lawyer suggested that the only way outwas for Art to turn someone else in - turn snitch. "Snitches get killed." Art said. "What else canI do?" "Maybe they would let you off if you had a job and couldshow that you were trying to be an honest citizen," hislawyer suggested. Art promptly went out and got an absolutely grinding jobseveral miles from home. It was a massive struggle just to keepup with the job, but he did it. Then he went back to his lawyer. "No dice," his lawyer told him. "You are goingto have to do something else." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" "Hmmm," his lawyer said, "maybe you should getmarried to show them that you are trying to settle down." Art looked up an old high school girlfriend, explained thesituation to her and she agreed to get married. She had a fairlydecent job and they were able to move into a good apartment onher income. After the wedding, he went back to his lawyer. "Still not cutting it," his lawyer told him."You are going to have to do something else." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" His lawyer thought it over again. "Maybe if you had ababy on the way. Babies always get sympathy." Art promptly went out and got his bride pregnant. When she wasbeginning to show, he went back to his lawyer. "Closer. I had them going for a while with the babystory, but it is still not enough," his lawyer clucked."You're going to have to do something more." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" His lawyer thought and thought again and finally said,"They might cut you some slack if you were a heroin addictand claimed that what you were out of control because of youraddiction and what you really need is rehabilitation. If you didthat, I might be able to get you out with a year or so in ahospital." Art had never taken heroin in his life, but it was hard toturn down that kind of opportunity to avoid a long stretch inprison. He developed a good-sized heroin habit, went through acouple of really good withdrawal episodes in front of doctors whocould testify that he really was addicted, and then went back tohis lawyer. "We almost had them there," his lawyer said,"but it still wasn't quite enough. You are going to have todo something else." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" By that time, both Art and his lawyer had run out of ideas.Art was now working, married with a baby on the way, and a prettygood heroin habit, all on the advice of his lawyer. Art becameresigned to the fact that, in order to avoid spending the rest ofhis life in jail, he was going to have to snitch someone off. The sheriffs really enjoyed Art's company as a snitch. Theyrounded up several people before the word got out about Art andit wasn't long before there were rumors floating the streets thatArt would not be long for this world if he hung aroundSacramento. But, it seemed to work. For the first time since he had beenbusted for the thirty pounds of pot which wasn't his, it began tolook like they were going to let him off the hook - until thenext time, at least. Then, a week before his case was due to come its finalresolution, his lawyer was busted for income tax evasion and hadto drop out of the case. Art got a public defender who knewnothing about the case and believed the sheriff's deputies whenthey gleefully told him that there had been no deal with Art atall. Art went to prison, full sentence for the full thirtypounds, a multiple felony offender besides, and remains theretoday. He spends most of his time alone in protective custodybecause of the death threats against him.

On the lastevening I was walking past the propaganda table at the mainballroom and passed this guy ambling the other way. He waswearing a leather jacket that was unzipped revealing his blackT-shirt with white letters in a nifty graphic saying "LowerEast Side Needle Exchange". We passed without greeting andafter about 5 steps I thought "I want one of thoseT-shirts". After 5 more steps I thought "maybe he knowswhere I could get one"... 5 more and "I'll never findout if I don't ask him now". I turned and scurried aroundthe corner where he had just disappeared. There were just the two of us in the 50 yard walkway alongsidethe ballrooms... "Excuse me, sir... excuse me... hey,where'd you get that T-shirt? Can I get one?" He stopped and turned methodically. "Well yeah, man,we're selling them for 10 bucks". "Do you have any in extra large?" "No. All we got left is large. Do you think you could getby with... No, I guess you need an extra large. I could send youone when we get back to New York." "How much would it be with shipping and handling?" "Well gee, I dunno... I guess it would be less than$20". "I suppose it would! How about 15?" "I guess that'd prob'ly do it. But hey, maybe my boss hasan extra large left. We could walk around and check." We exchanged pleasantries as we walked back around past theconference entrance where I had first seen him. He found that Iwas from outside of Dallas and asked if they have a needleexchange there, but I didn't know. When we came to the smallmeeting room on the other side he went in. The meeting was justbreaking up and people started filing out, some leaving, someforming small groups in the hallway. He came out with four or sixpeople kind of dressed like him who assembled by the windows ashe came back over to me. "I'm sorry, man, we're out of extralarge, but if you give me $15, I'll mail you one right when I gethome." I didn't have correct change, but after some fumbling anddiscussions with passers-by, I ended up giving him a twenty and afive, and he gave me a ten. "I don't have any cards left", I said, "do youhave some place I can write down my address?" He rifled through his stack of leaflets and handed me a lightblue half-sheet that was blank on the back. I sat on the benchalong the wall to write my address, but found that my pencildidn't show up well on the blue paper. "Do you have a pen?" I asked. "Sure!" he said, and he handed me a syringe. Thepart you push on with your thumb was in the "out"position, and the glass tube was filled with a reddishtranslucent liquid that I suppose was intended to represent amixture of blood and heroin. At the end where the needle would bewas a ball-point pen. "Well!" I said. "I've never seen anything quitelike this! Do you have any more of these?" "No, man, that's from a needle exchange across town. Wejust have the T-shirts." Sitting there on the bench, I wrote down "X-Large"and my address and handed it up to the disheveled gentleman inblack. As he leaned over to retrieve his pen, his dark wavy hairfell alongside his face and I was hit with a strong gust ofmysterious aromas punctuated by tobacco. "Thanks, man. We appreciate it. I'll send you someliterature, too." As he hurried off to join his comrades, he turned and waved."Thanks again, it's for a good cause." When I got back to the office on Monday, I was a big hit withmy tales about the drug law conference and the literature Ibrought back. Everyone gathered around to read "PrisonLife" monthly, with its advice column "Ask Bubba".Bubba dished up sage advice on such topics as "My cellysnores", and "I've got this thing for Hillary Clinton,what should I do?" And you can imagine the mirth and merriment when I told themabout the Lower East Side Needle Exchange T-Shirt: "You meanto tell me you gave fifteen dollars CASH to a guy in a T-shirtsaying "Lower East Side Needle Exchange?!!!", and"Just what was that 'good cause'?" I had to agree itwas a good joke, even if it was at my expense. But I decided itwas an excellent value. For the humble sum of $15, I had bought aticket to the Greatest Show on Earth, a show that would lastseveral days at least: Would I get my T-shirt, and if so, when? I thought aboutstarting an office pool, but nobody wanted to bet me. After all,they felt sorry that I was already out 15 bucks. And what kind ofodds could I get? And how long is too long? The T-shirt became a test of stereotypes about drug users.Everyone assumed this guy must be into heroin and the money wouldnecessarily disappear. So the question becomes: Is it possible for a heroin user to behave responsibly? Can ajunkie carry $15 in cash from Washington to New York and renderperceived value to a faraway stranger known only by a scawledaddress on a scrap of paper? Or would he need the money forsomething more important? That night I slept well, but awoke an hour or two early,thinking about my interest in changing our drug laws. Injuringpeople to protect them from themselves... The problem seems toget bigger the more resources we throw at it... Wouldcivilization grind to a halt if we let consumers consume whatthey want? Would a foreign enemy conquer us? Is the right toremain silent the only right we have left? Do we have the rightto? Do we have the right not to? What is right? About here Godkicks in. I have had some prayers answered in my day. I'm notvery good at praying, but I've heard God only cares aboutsincerity, so I went ahead, and it went something like this: Dear Lord, If it be thy will, hear my prayer. I'm just awhite-bread white-boy, what don't know nothing about the evils ofheroin. I believe our laws are causing these problems, but nowI'm not so sure. I've been working on this social issue with thegoal of letting half a million people out of jail... a course ofaction that would stifle the growth of America's prison industrythat has such high hopes of taking up the slack where themilitary is laying off... that would make tens of thousands ofgovernment employees rethink their career plans... Give me a sign, Lord. Is prohibition a vain attempt to plugsome safety valves you installed in our souls? Can a junkie wrapup a T-shirt and lick a stamp? I need to know if what I'm doingis right. Either way it comes out, I promise to submit the factsto a candid world like it says in the Declaration ofIndependence. And if you really want to make it a sign, thenbless the postman's fingers and grant him Godspeed. In Jesus'name I pr.... No, that would be cheating. If it be THY will, Lord. Let'sleave Jesus out of this... Well... Jesus, if you WANT to getinvolved in this, feel free. Thy will is pretty important too.And God, if you REALLY want to make it a sign, you can putcrosses on the package or something really over-the-top that Iwouldn't even think of and..... As my prayer further deteriorated into meandering brain cellsfiring in the night, I closed it out and went back to sleep. In the following days, I thought about the test I hadproposed. The U.S. Postal Service, or U.P.S. or whoever, didn'tbreak any delivery speed records, and the T-shirt didn't show upas we were saying Grace before Thanksgiving dinner. But Time-Lifewants 4-6 weeks to send out a CD. Andwhether it shows up or not,what is proved by a statistical sample of one? I can't even send a letter to my mother- why should I expect anameless junkie on the Lower East Side to send me something thatcosts money? A woman at work predicted I would get the T-shirt"about March. He'll lose the address and find it later.He'll think that's soon. Those people don't think about time likewe do." At the office the joking has died down, but now and again wefind someone who hasn't heard about the Lower East Side NeedleExchange T-Shirt and it's good for another laugh. Whether I getthe shirt or not, that fifteen dollars is still providing value,so I suppose it's way up there on the list of the best money Iever spent. Still, there are a couple of reasons I'm hoping thatguy can get his act together. One is a positive answer to thismomentous question. The other is- I want one of those T-shirts.

This retaliation should only beresorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances. If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, whileone of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly Chinaone, you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless.And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with herunless your conscience would justify you in it, and you know youare able to do it. You ought never to take your little brother's"chewing-gum" away from him by main force; it is betterto rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and ahalf you find floating down the river on a grindstone. In theartless simplicity natural to his time of life, he will regard itas a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the world thiseminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant tofinancial ruin and disaster. If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother,do not correct him with mud - never, on any account, throw mud athim, because it will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald hima little, for then you obtain desirable results. You secure hisimmediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating, and atthe same time your hot water will have a tendency to moveimpurities from his person, and possibly the skin, in spots. If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to replythat you won't. It is better and more becoming to intimate thatyou will do as she bids you, and then afterward act quietly inthe manner according to the dictates of your best judgment. You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parentsthat you are indebted for your food, and your nice bed, and foryour beautiful clothes, and for the privilege of staying homefrom school when you let on that you are sick. Therefore youought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their littlewhims, and put up with their little foibles until they get tocrowding you too much. Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged.You ought never to "sass" old people unless they"sass" you first.

It was strange,but still it was true that this one was called Jim. He didn't have any sick mother either - a sick mother who waspious and had the consumption, and would be glad to lie down inthe grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore herboy, and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh andcold towards him when she was gone. Most bad boys in theSunday-books are named James, and have sick mothers, who teachthem to say, "Now, I lay me down," etc. and sing themto sleep with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss themgood-night, and kneel down by the bedside and weep. But it wasdifferent with this fellow. He was named Jim, and there wasn'tanything the matter with his mother - no consumption, noranything of that kind. She was rather stout than otherwise, andshe was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim'saccount. She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn't bemuch loss. She always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissedhim good-night; on the contrary, she boxed his ears when she wasready to leave him. Once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, andslipped in there and helped himself to some jam, and filled upthe vessel with tar, so that his mother would never know thedifference; but all at once a terrible feeling didn't come overhim, and something didn't seem to whisper to him, "Is itright to disobey my mother? Isn't it sinful to do this? Where dobad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother'sjam?" and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promisenever to be wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happyheart, and go and tell his mother all about it, and beg herforgiveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride andthankfulness in her eyes. No; that is the way with all other badboys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this Jim,strangely enough. He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in hissinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that wasbully also, and laughed, and observed "that the old womanwould get up and snort" when she found it out; and when shedid find it out, he denied knowing anything about it, and shewhipped him severely, and he did the crying himself. Everythingabout this boy was curious - everything turned out differentlywith him from the way it does to the bad James in the books. Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple-tree to stealapples, and the limb didn't break, and he didn't fall and breakhis arm, and get torn by the farmer's great dog, and thenlanguish on a sick bed for weeks, and repent and become good. Oh!no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right;and he was all ready for the dog too, and knocked him endwayswith a brick when he came to tear him. It was very strange -nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books withmarbled backs, and with pictures in them of men withswallow-tailed coats and bell-crowned hats, and pantaloons thatare short in the legs, and women with the waists of their dressesunder their arms, and no hoops on. Nothing like it in any of theSunday-school books. Once he stole the teacher's pen-knife, and, when he was afraidit would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped itinto George Wilson's cap - poor Widow Wilson's son, the moralboy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed hismother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons,and infatuated with Sunday-school. And when the knife droppedfrom the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if inconscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft uponhim, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch downupon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired improbable justiceof the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strikean attitude and say, "Spare this noble boy - there standsthe cowering culprit! I was passing the school-door at recess,and unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!" And then Jimdidn't get whaled, and the venerable justice didn't read thetearful school a homily and take George by the hand and say sucha boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him to come and makehis home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, andrun errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife todo household labors, and have all the balance of the time toplay, and get forty cents a month, and be happy. No; it wouldhave happened that way in the books, but it didn't happen thatway to Jim. No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to maketrouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim wasglad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said hewas "down on them milk-sops." Such was the coarselanguage of this bad, neglected boy. But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the timehe went boating on Sunday, and didn't get drowned, and that othertime that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing onSunday, and didn't get struck by lighting. Why, you might look,and look, all through the Sunday-school books from now till nextChristmas, and you would never come across anything like this. Ohno; you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on Sundayinvariably get drowned; and all the bad boys who get caught outin storms when they are fishing on Sunday infallibly get struckby lightning. Boats with bad boys in them always upset on Sunday,and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the Sabbath. Howthis Jim ever escaped is a mystery to me. This Jim bore a charmed life - that must have been the way ofit. Nothing could hurt him. He even gave the elephant in themenagerie a plug of tobacco, and the elephant didn't knock thetop of his head off with his trunk. He browsed around thecupboard after essence of peppermint, and didn't make a mistakeand drink aqua fortis. He stole his father's gun and went huntingon the Sabbath, and didn't shoot three or four of his fingersoff. He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist whenhe was angry, and she didn't linger in pain through long summerdays, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips thatredoubled the anguish of his breaking heart. No; she got over it.He ran off and went to sea at last, and didn't come back and findhimself sad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping inthe quiet churchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhoodtumbled down and gone to decay. Ah! no; he came home as drunk asa piper, and got into the station-house the first thing. And he grew up and married, and raised a large family, andbrained them all with an axe one night, and got wealthy by allmanner of cheating and rascality; and now he is the infernalistwickedest scoundrel in his native village, and is universallyrespected, and belongs to the Legislature. So you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-schoolbooks that had such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with thecharmed life.

He would not play hookey,even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitablething he could do. None of the other boys could ever make thatboy out, he acted so strangely. He wouldn't lie, no matter howconvenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and that wassufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simplyridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassedeverything. He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't robbirds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders'monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind ofrational amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason itout and come to an understanding of him, but they couldn't arriveat any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, they could onlyfigure out a sort of vague idea that he was"afflicted," and so they took him under theirprotection, and never allowed any harm to come to him. This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; theywere his greatest delight. This was the whole secret of it. Hebelieved in the good little boys they put in the Sunday-schoolbooks; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come acrossone of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died beforehis time, maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good onehe turned over quickly to the end to see what became of him,because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and gaze on him;but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in thelast chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with allhis relatives and the Sunday-school children standing around thegrave in pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that weretoo large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had asmuch as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headedoff in this way. He never could see one of those good little boyson account of his always dying in the last chapter. Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book.He wanted to be put in, with pictures representing him gloriouslydeclining to lie to his mother, and her weeping for joy about it;and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep giving apenny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling herto spend it freely, but not to be extravagant, becauseextravagance is a sin; and pictures of him magnanimously refusingto tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around thecorner as he came from school, and welted him over the head witha lath, and then chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" ashe proceeded. This was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens. Hewished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel alittle uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the goodlittle boys always died. He loved to live, you know, and this wasthe most unpleasant feature about being a Sunday-school-book boy.He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was more fatalthan consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in thebooks were; he knew that none of them had been able to stand itlong, and it pained him to think that if they put him in a bookhe wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the book outbefore he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of hisfuneral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of aSunday-school book that couldn't tell about the advice he gave tothe community when he was dying. So at last, of course, he had tomake up his mind to do the best he could under the circumstances- to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have hisdying speech all ready when his time came. But somehow nothing ever went right with this good little boy;nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with thegood little boys in the books. They always had a good time, andthe bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was ascrew loose somewhere; and it all happened just the other way.When he found Jim Blake stealing apples, and went under the treeto read to him about the bad little boy who fell out of aneighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the treetoo, but he fell on him, and broke his arm, and Jim wasn't hurtat all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything inthe books like it. And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in themud, and Jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, theblind man did not give him any blessing at all, but whacked himover the head with his stick and said he would like to catch himshoving him again, and then pretending to help him up. This wasnot in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them allover to see. One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog thathadn't any place to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, andbring him home and pet him and have that dog's imperishablegratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he broughthim home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dogflew at him and tore all the clothes off him except those thatwere in front, and made a spectacle of him that was astonishing.He examined authorities, but he could not understand the matter.It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but itacted very differently. Whatever this boy did he got intotrouble. The very things the boys in the books got rewarded forturned out to be about the most unprofitable things he couldinvest in. Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some badboys starting off pleasuring in a sailboat. He was filled withconsternation, because he knew from his reading that boys whowent sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on araft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him intothe river. A man got him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumpedthe water out of him, and gave him a fresh start with hisbellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. Butthe most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys inthe boat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive andwell in the most surprising manner. Jacob Blivens said there wasnothing like these things in the books. He was perfectlydumb-founded. When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolvedto keep on trying anyhow. He knew that so far his experiencewouldn't do to go in a book, but he hadn't yet reached theallotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to beable to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time wasfully up. If everything else failed he had his dying speech tofall back on. He examined his authorities, and found that it was now timefor him to go to sea as a cabin-boy. He called on a ship captainand made his application, and when the captain asked for hisrecommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to thewords. "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionateteacher." But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and hesaid, "Oh, that be blowed! that wasn't any proof that heknow how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessedhe didn't want him." This was altogether the mostextraordinary thing that ever happened to Jacob in all his life.A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had never failed to movethe tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to alloffices of honor and profit in their gift - it never had in anybook that ever he had read. He could hardly believe his senses. This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing over came outaccording to the authorities with him. At last, one day, when hewas around hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lotof them in the old iron foundry fixing up a little joke onfourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in longprocession, and were going to ornament with empty nitro-glycerinecans made fast to their tails. Jacob's heart was touched. He satdown on one of those cans (for he never minded grease when dutywas before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by thecollar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. Butjust at that moment Alderman McWelter full of wrath, stepped in.All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in consciousinnocence and began one of those stately littleSunday-school-book speeches which always commence with "Oh,sir!" in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good orbad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir." But thealderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens bythe ear and turned him around, and hit him a whack in the rearwith the flat of his hand; and in an instant that good little boyshot out through the roof and soared away towards the sun, withthe fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like thetail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that alderman or thatold iron foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for youngJacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dyingspeech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it tothe birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all rightin a tree-top in an adjoining county, the rest of him wasapportioned around among four townships, and so they had to holdfive inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, andhow it occurred.

"No," I said, after studying the matter over alittle. "No, I believe not; I am going to be travelling byrail all day to-day. However, to-morrow I don't travel. Give meone for to-morrow." The man looked puzzled. He said: "But it is for accident insurance, and if you are goingto travel by rail - " "If I am going to travel by rail I sha'n't need it. Lyingat home in bed is the thing I am afraid of." I had been looking into this matter. Last year I traveledtwenty thousand miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before,I traveled over twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and halfby rail; and the year before that I traveled in the neighborhoodof ten thousand miles, exclusively by rail. I suppose if I put inall the little odd journeys here and there, I may say I havetraveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I havementioned. And never an accident. For a good while I said to myself every morning: "Now Ihave escaped thus far, and so the chances are just that muchincreased that I shall catch it this time. I will be shrewd, andbuy an accident ticket." And to a dead moral certainty Idrew a blank, and went to bed that night without a joint startedor a bone splintered. I got tired of that sort of daily bother,and fell to buying accident tickets that were good for a month. Isaid to myself, "A man can't buy thirty blanks in onebundle." But I was mistaken. There was never a prize in the lot. Icould read of railway accidents every day - the newspaperatmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came myway. I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accidentbusiness, and had nothing to show for it. My suspicions werearoused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won inthis lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested, but notan individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. Istopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The resultwas astounding. The peril lay not in traveling, but in staying athome. I hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after allthe glaring newspaper headings concerning railroad disasters,less than three hundred people had really lost their lives bythose disasters in the preceding twelve months. The Erie road wasset down as the most murderous in the list. It had killedforty-six - or twenty-six, I do not exactly remember which, but Iknow the number was double that of any other road. But the factstraightway suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely longroad, and did more business than any other line in the country;so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for surprise. By further figuring, it appeared that between New York andRochester the Erie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day- 16 altogether; and carried a daily average of 6,000 persons.That is about a million in six months - the population of NewYork City. Well, the Erie kills from 13 to 23 persons out of itsmillion in six months; and in the same time 13,000 of New York'smillion die in their beds! My flesh crept, my hair stood on end."This is appalling!" I said. "The danger isn't intraveling by rail, but in trusting to those deadly beds. I willnever sleep in a bed again." I had figured on considerably less than one-half the length ofthe Erie road. It was plain that the entire road must transportat least eleven or twelve thousand people every day. There aremany short roads running out of Boston that do fully half asmuch; a great many such roads. There are many roads scatteredabout the Union that do a prodigious passenger business.Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500passengers a day for each road in the country would be aboutcorrect. There are 846 railway lines in our country, and 846times 2,500 are 2,115,000. So the railways of America move morethan two millions of people every day; six hundred and fiftymillions of people a year, without counting the Sundays. They dothat, too - there is no question about it; though where they getthe raw material is clear beyond the jurisdiction of myarithmetic; for I have hunted the census through and through, andI find that there are not that many people in the United States,by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least.They must use some of the same people over again, likely. San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; there are60 deaths a week in the former and 500 a week in the latter - ifthey have luck. That is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco, andeight times as many in New York - say about 25,000 or 26,000. Thehealth of the two places is the same. So we will let it stand asa fair presumption that this will hold good all over the country,and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people wehave must die every year. That amounts to one-fortieth of ourtotal population. One million of us, then, die annually. Out ofthis million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot, drowned,hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some otherpopular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirtconflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling offhouse-tops, breaking through church or lecture-room floors,taking patent medicines, or committing suicide in other forms.The Erie railroad kills from 23 to 46; the other 845 railroadskill an average of one-third of a man each; and the rest of thatmillion, amounting in the aggregate to the appalling figure of987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds! You will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds.The railroads are good enough for me. And my advice to all people is, Don't stay at home any morethan you can help; but when you have got to stay at home a while,buy a package of those insurance tickets and sit up nights. Youcannot be too cautious. [One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in themanner recorded at the top of this sketch.] The moral of this composition is, that thoughtless peoplegrumble more than is fair about railroad management in the UnitedStates. When we consider that every day and night of the yearfull fourteen thousand railway-trains of various kinds, freightedwith life and armed with death, go thundering over the land, themarvel is, not that they kill three hundred human beings in atwelvemonth, but that they do not kill three hundred times threehundred!

By Mark Twain Delivered In Hartford, At A Dinner To Cornelius Walford,Of London, 1875 Gentlemen, - I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming thedistinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as aninsurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the nameof being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand inhand - the Colt's arms company making the destruction of our raceeasy and convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for thevictims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating theirmemory with his stately monuments, and our fire-insurancecomrades taking care of their hereafter. I am glad to assist inwelcoming our guest - first, because he is an Englishman, and Iowe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of hisfellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy withinsurance, and has been the means of making many other men casttheir sympathies in the same direction. Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than theinsurance line of business - especially accident insurance. Eversince I have been a director in an accident-insurance company Ihave felt that I am a better man. Life has seemed more precious.Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distressing specialprovidences have lost half their horror. I look upon a cripplenow with affectionate interest - as an advertisement. I do notseem to care for poetry any more. I do not care for politics evenagriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a charmabout a railway collision that is unspeakable. There is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. Ihave seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and intoaffluence by the simple boon of a broken leg. I have had peoplecome to me on crutches, with tears in their eyes, to bless thisbeneficent institution. In all my experience of life, I have seennothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshlymutilated man's face when he feels in his vest pocket with hisremaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right. And Ihave seen nothing so sad as the look that came into anothersplintered customer's face when he found he couldn't collect on awooden leg. I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noblecharity which we have named the Hartford Accident InsuranceCompany is an institution which is peculiarly to be dependedupon. A man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom. No mancan take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the yearis out. Now there was one indigent man who had been disappointedso often with other companies that he had grown disheartened, hisappetite left him, he ceased to smile - said life was but aweariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and nowhe is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land - has a goodsteady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, andtravels around on a shutter. I will say, in conclusion, that my share of the welcome toour guest is none the less hearty because I talk so muchnonsense, and I know that I can say the same for the rest of thespeakers.

I heard from quite afew known and suspected members of the family, and picked upquite a few addresses of people who probably did not want to befound. Thanks to all of those who did reply, but it is stillapparent that we haven't tracked down all of the nefarious familymembers so let's keep up the effort to track down, and thoroughlyembarrass all those family members who are trying to hide. Bud called me one day to say that Laurence had called him tosuggest that we include with the Reunion News a brief update onwhere everybody is and what they are doing. He staunchlymaintains that both he and Laurence were sober at the time. He suggested that everyone should send in a short note ontheir current doings and significant events and a dollar or so todefray the expenses of producing and mailing the newsletter.Monetary contributions to support this effort would be nice (allblank checks eagerly accepted) but no one will be denied thebenefit(?) of this newsletter just because they failed to anteup. If you will drop me a line (as many have already) and let meknow of significant events in your life in the last year or so, Iwill include them with the periodic reunion information soeveryone can know how your life is going to Hell in a handbasket. I have attached a form at the end of this letter which you canfill out and return, if you wish, to help me keep all of theinformation accurate. All information on the forms is voluntary and I will not printor give out anyone's address or any other information withouttheir permission. Anyone who fails to report will, of course, have only the mostslanderous rumors printed about them. Sincerely, Clifford A. Schaffer REUNION DETAILS DATE: June 23 and 24, 1990 PLACE: Howarth Park - Summerfield Rd., Santa Rosa, CA. The park is located on the east side of town, and a map isenclosed. There is hiking, fishing, swimming, a small park, andan amusement park close by. There are also paddle boats at bothlakes. On the back of one of the sheets she sent me, in an almostillegible scrawl, Ruthie wrote, "It is also close to a lotof wineries." I'll bet it is. FOOD There will be snacks, dips, lots of other food, and plenty ofraw meat, roots, and berries for the Morrises. Dinner will beearly, at 3:30 or 4:00 on Saturday because of the previous badexperiences when we tried to feed the Leards and Morrises afterdark. Whatever food is left after the first attack of the Leardsand Morrises will be placed on the edge of the camp all daySunday to draw them away from the rest of us. People who live in the area should bring salad, beans, andother such items. People who live farther away should bringchips, dips, and dessert. Dinnerware will be provided, but bringdrinks and charcoal for your family. CAMPGROUNDS There are campgrounds in Spring Lake Park. A copy of acampsite reservation form is enclosed.

FAMILY DOINGS WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? INTRODUCTION I am pleased to report that the vast majority of people in thefamily are apparently healthy, active, and doing well. We do notyet have any relatives who are rich enough that we can all gomooch off of them, but nobody seems to be starving either. PASSINGS For all of those who were not aware, Mary Taylor died lastyear. She and my grandmother, Laura Richardson, are the reasonsthat we gather every year. She will be missed by all of us, butwe should all feel very lucky that we have had these women in ourlives. THE FAMILY ALLSMAN, DOROTHY (nee Richardson) - Currently selling real estate in Phoenix,Arizona. The last time I spoke with her she made a point ofmentioning how much she enjoys meeting all of the nice people inthis family every year at the reunion. Her doctor tells me thatradical personality changes are common in persons of extreme age.Ed has had some health problems which may limit their ability totravel. ALLSMAN, PAT Pat is living in Phoenix, doing well, and he has developedinto a good judge of appropriate Christmas gifts. ATKINSON, CHRISTINE (nee Sweet), eldest of Margaret and Vic, is in Chicago,working for First Boston Corp. doing something with computers.She didn't mention anything specific about the opportunities forembezzlement at her current position, but we know she will bealert. She tells a fairly wild, and almost believable, storyabout how her husband Scott travels a lot because of hishighfalutin position with something called Terra Museum. Sheswears that it is not a front for drug smuggling. BECK, META Bud says she is doing well but he did not provide a lot ofdetails. He is probably covering up. BERZ, RONNI Meta's second. Currently living in Bakersfield and prosperingnicely with her husband, George, who works with computers. HARTER, BARRI No information. May be the same Barri Harter rumored to beinvolved with Donald Trump. JOHNSON, GLENDA No current address. No information. May have been lost inBorneo while filming the headhunters. KRAMER, JOANNE (nee Morris) - Joanne is living in Fresno and sends obscenehoroscopes to all those who write to her. She still labors underthe delusion that I am really Satan. KRAMER, LARRY son of Joanne, no relationship to the Japanese monster film"Son of Joanne." According to Joanne, he is livingwith, and mooching off his mother in the finest Morris tradition. KRAMER, LESLIE MAUREEN Daughter of Joanne, living in Cleveland and working as anexotic dancer. (Yes, that's right.) She is the proud mother ofCrystal Ladd who, according to the sworn testimony of Joanne, isan extraordinarily beautiful and talented child. LEARD, DAVID His years in the Navy permanently damaged his ability to tellwhen it is too wet outside. He is currently living in the rainforests of Seattle and doing something with computer systems. Itdidn't surprise anyone that one of the Leards would eventuallyreturn to the Bigfoot territory from whence they came. His wifeis pretty, intelligent, and very nice. He must have liedtremendously to get her. LEARD, DOUGLAS Somehow the Richardson-Taylor arson gene went wrong inDouglas. He puts out fires for a living, instead of startingthem, and apparently enjoys it. He and Barbara, and kids, live inRancho and, last time I checked, they were all doing well andenjoying life. LEARD, LOUISE Louise is still living in the same old place in Sacramentothat she bought when houses were still $1.49. She is in goodhealth, reasonably good humor, and still unreasonablyconservative. She still says "Well, now Michael . . .",all the time, even when Michael is not around. LEARD, MICHAEL Michael just keeps on trucking. He is an air conditioningexpert at McClellan in Sacramento. He recently visited us in LosAngeles and found that he actually could cope with the freewaysdown here (but he still split as soon as he could anyway). He isin good health but needs more practice with his .22 pistol. LINK, BARBARA (nee Sweet) - Barbara is married to Dan Link, a pastor with adevotion to hopeless causes such as truth and morality. Theymoved to Ruidoso, New Mexico, presumably to escape the shame andguilt which follows excessively moral people in this family. Thename Ruidoso is Spanish for "noisy" which, Barbaraclaims, has only a coincidental relationship to Dan's sermons. MORRIS, ELEANOR and Don - No current word from them, although I thought Irecognized Don playing Digit in "Gorillas in the Mist."Way to go with that second career, Fellah. MORRIS, RICHARD No current word on his activities. What can you say about aMorris that hasn't already been grunted by someone else? I heardthat he was running a dress shop for transvestites and all I cansay is that Richard never denied it. MORRIS, STEVEN He is single (relatively speaking), working at DMV, and stilltrying to impregnate every female in the city of Sacramento nowthat the State has given up its effort to restrict his breeding.Remember the family motto, Steve - Never give your right name. NEWCOMB, RUTH (nee Taylor) - She is doing well and sends her love toeveryone. She mentioned that she is getting married very soon(says she doesn't have to) and recommends bear traps and doescent as the perfect combination for nailing a man. She didn'tgive his name but sent a nice picture of him bound and gagged inthe trunk of her car. Congrats, Ruthie. PEREIRA, CARRIE She recently had a baby, prompting Bud to lie far more than heusually does. PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW (Andy) son of Joanne Kramer - Currently living in Fullerton,CA and doing well in sales. PRUITT, BOB No information. Could be the same Bob Pruitt responsible forthe Exxon Valdez disaster. QUIGLEY, DONNA (nee Morris) - Donna reportedly lives next door to Margie andthey are known as the Unholy Two in their neighborhood. A recenteffort by the City Council to evict them failed when theauthorities were unable to prove a connection to the rest of theMorris family. RICHARDSON, BILL Bill and Dawn currently live in Ohio for no apparent reason,and Bill is now working as a cost analyst after many, many yearswith the U.S. Air Force. (You know - the people who brought usthe Stealth Bomber.) He gets Air Force retirement money andprobably makes a pretty good bundle at his current job, so he isprobably a good person to borrow money from. Dawn has, by allaccounts, consistently sullied the family reputation with a longstring of church work, good deeds, and other socially acceptabledo-gooder behavior which is totally alien to this family'scharacter. Mark, their eldest, is either on the high schoolfootball team, or he is the high school football team, - itwasn't clear from their letter. I saw a picture of Craig. He hasto be healthy. RICHARDSON, BUD He is in better health than he has a right to be, and claimshe is going to live forever. He called me just days after thebirth of his latest great grandkid and he had already concoctedthe most astonishing stories about this child. RICHARDSON, BECKY Eldest of James and Edna. No information. She may be livingwith a motorcycle gang responsible for several holdups in theCentral Valley. RICHARDSON, JAMIE Youngest of James and Edna. No information. Carried away byGypsies many years ago to the remotest reaches of Fresno County. RICHARDSON, JAMES Currently retired and residing in Fresno with Edna who, forsome strange reason, is a perfect match for James. His "OldFart" hat wore out so he is getting one that says"Older Fart." Unlike fine wines, the aroma of farts isnot greatly improved by aging. RICHARDSON, JERRY No information direct from Jerry but Bud tells me that he isdoing well. RICHARDSON, LARRY Bud tells the same story about Larry, further straining hiscredibility. RICHARDSON, PETE Pete has not yet learned that exercise is bad for the healthso he continues to run every day. Despite all this running, tothe best of my knowledge, he has never caught anything moresignificant than the common cold. He continues to compete and winraces in the Old and Decrepit category. SCHAFFER, CLIFFORD I am currently working as a computer systems consultant, writea few articles now and then and, lately, am doing some publicspeaking for the ACLU. Bonnie is a computer systems manager withPinkerton Detectives. Serena and Alyssa are 15 and in high school. Serena is inFlags with the marching band and Alyssa earned a letter last yearon the swim team. Melissa, 12, and Courtney, 10 are both doingwell. SCHULKINS, JOYCE No information. Rumored to be on an expedition to finddinosaurs in Africa. SCHULKINS, LARRY No information. May be the same Larry Schulkins who iscurrently a hostage in Beirut. SWEET, JULIE Julie is currently working at the Los Angeles Zoo, as ananimal keeper and trainer and thus would probably be the bestskilled person to manage the reunion. SWEET, MARGARET (nee Richardson) - Margaret sent out a letter with someoutrageous tale about how she and Vic are supposedly not oldenough to qualify for Social Security or something like that soshe is continuing to work. Margaret's letter starts out"Dear Friends and Relatives", which shows that shedraws a clear distinction between the two. Vic is working in afuneral parlor so he should have a lot of creepy stories to tellaround the campfire. TAYLOR, DAVID No information or parole date. TAYLOR, EDITH No information. Probably on the run from the law. TAYLOR, LAURENCE and WILMA Laurence was caught telling the truth last year and had tospend several weeks in therapy before he was well again. When youtalk to him you will see that he is much better now. TAYLOR, LOUISE No information. Possible KGB double agent.

She says they were unable to get the park for Saturday(something about too much police surveillance) so Saturday willbe at Spring Lake. She is going to try to get "the spot on your left just asyou come off the hill into the park area." Ruthie said thatif anyone has trouble finding the group she would leave a trailof bread crumbs but, of course, that only works until the firstMorris shows up. If in doubt, look for the clouds of tear gas andflashing police lights - the family will be in the middle. Hot dogs and hamburgers will be served around noon, with thebig meal around 4:00 PM. Remember that, if you are approached byany family member you do not immediately recognize, throw somefood away from your car. Do not attempt to feed them by hand. Sunday will be at Howarth Park as previously stated. She says to be sure to remember to bring all of the followingitems: bathing suits (to avoid the perennial lewd conduct charges) lots of ice (to take the swelling down) extra ice chests (storage space is always a problem) snacks (in sealed packets so the Leards can't smell them) charcoal (fire helps to keep the Morrises at bay) drinks Doug and Barbara should bring their game. Ruthie said thateveryone really enjoyed it as long as they were sober. Ruthie says there are paddle boats, hiking trails (remember tobring shoes), and a nice area for volleyball. Ruthie also asked me to remind everyone that it is time tosend your contributions. The contribution is $8.00 per household(cheaper than the average parking ticket) and should be sent to: Ruth Newcomb I still have not heard from all of the nefarious familymembers with their most current family information. I would liketo publish a fairly complete update of the family information todistribute at or near the reunion, so it would be nice if youwould all send it in. If you do not, I will do the most dastardlything possible - I will tell the truth about you. I am sure noone wants that.

It was a pretty good turnout with perhapsa hundred people (anybody want to count?). As usual, everybodygot older but me. We all owe thanks to Ruthie and Laurence for organizingeverything the way they did. The maps they sent me weren't thegreatest so, for all of you who thought Spring Lake park wasreally in East Africa, I apologize for that. However, the parksand all the fun and trimmings when we finally got there were verygood so I have to say that I thought they organized a prettysuccessful reunion. You can always tell a successful reunion -you can't recognize anyone. I hear that Margaret and Vic spentmost of Saturday morning with a nice family of Mexicans beforethey realized it wasn't us. I want to thank all of you who stepped forward to express yourappreciation for the work I did on the newsletter. I especiallywant to thank all those who pulled Joanne off of me while she wasexpressing her appreciation. My doctor says it was lucky I movedwhen I did and there probably won't be any permanent scarring. I understand that Margaret and Vic have volunteered toorganize next year's reunion, perhaps around the Carpenteriaarea. I think they like that area primarily because it makespeople say "Where?". It is around Santa Barbara - northof L.A. It is a lovely oil-rich area with beautiful beaches whichhave natural tar balls in the sand for your kids to track back toyour car. I am sure everyone will like it - just bring a few jarsof petroleum solvents. Assuming that Margaret still admits thatwe are blood-related, I will keep you posted. People who are easily offended should probably skip the FamilyDoings section on Don Morris. I have made a considerable effortto clean it up but it's hard to write anything about him and keepit decent. Sincerely, Clifford A. Schaffer Copyright 1990, C. A. Schaffer FAMILY DOINGS WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? INTRODUCTION This is the post-reunion dirt on everyone (that I am aware of)who either showed up or sent back their forms. It is not thecomplete family listing, if there ever could be one. I will doanother relatively complete update next year before the reunion. PASSINGS Mary Taylor Bob Taylor - son of Mary, one of the original old-time Taylors Jan Richardson - wife of Bud. She gave him a lot of love. Our loss can only be measured by the blessings they have givenus. THE FAMILY ALLSMAN, DOROTHY (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Clifford Male Patrick Male She mentioned again how much she enjoys the reunion but saidher pain medication wasn't as strong as it should be. LikeMargaret and Bud, she claims to have a copy of the family historythat Mary produced. They all said they would send me a copy but,apparently, they are afraid of what I might do with it. BARBER, PATRICIA "Teisha" (nee Taylor) CHILDREN Billy Male Eric Male The last time I saw Teisha she was about four years old. Shemust be at least eleven or twelve by now. Teisha and husband Mikeand a friend have purchased a gold claim in the Siskiyou NationalForest. If they will agree to send me ten percent of whateverthey find I will promise not to send their address to everyone inthe family. Mike is a Park Manager at Ft. Stevens Park in Oregon andTeisha is an advertising clerk for Payless. Like all Taylors,they spend most of their time in the woods, eating whatever theymanage to catch. Both of the boys are groundskeepers for a military cemetery sowe should all make it a point not to ask them if they collectanything. Billy is reportedly working for the county litterpatrol (if you don't have any they deliver) and will be hackingtrails through the wilderness for most of the summer. BECK, META (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Ronni Female Carrie Female Meta showed up at the reunion in a jocular mood and spent mostof her time fighting with Bud over which one of them was going toshow off her grandson. It was a tough battle, but I think Metawon - best two falls out of three. She must be doing well becauseshe is considerably better fed than the last time I saw her. BERZ, RONNI She was there with her husband, George, who seems to be a niceenough guy, so there is no real explanation how he got mixed upwith this family. Like all macho computer guys he spent a lot oftime talking about his big hard disk, and showing off his son. Ofcourse, Bud is so proud you would think he had the kid himself. BRYER, BRENT Currently managing cousin Gary's RV sales and service companyin Redding, and apparently making a bundle doing it. HARTER, BERRI She works in the electronics industry and is doing well. Nolonger involved with Donald Trump. HEDRICK, MARGARET (nee Morris) CHILDREN Scott Male Nancy Female This is the woman we all once knew as Margie Morris. She saysthat her husband calls her "Margaret" which often leadsher to believe that she is really Margaret Sweet. It's easy toget the two confused, especially if you are one. She dragged Michael and me off into the woods and went into amonster family-old-times-hugging fit. She has been married someincredibly long time to a guy who is a combat veteran but isscared to show up at the reunion, and is currently living withDonna. They tell me that Nancy (current last name unknown) isliving in the same town. Most legal authorities agree that threeMorrises in the same town is prima facie evidence of a criminalconspiracy. KRAMER, JOANNE (nee Morris) CHILDREN Michael Andrew Porter Male Laurence Kramer Male Leslie Kramer Female She says she is working as a supervisory"registered" nurse (Fresno County still requiresMorrises to be registered) in a hospital in Fresno. Can youimagine waking up from a coma to find Joanne standing over you?I'd probably get religion. Would you trust this woman with yourbedpan? Joanne listed no Significant Other and complained that thedestruction of the rain forests is making it hard for her to findgood dates. She pines for the good old days when she could justhide down by the railroad tracks and catch them unawares. Shesays that if anyone knows any good men she will pay all costs ofcapture, crating, and shipping. As achievements, Joanne says she finally got her student loanpaid off, probably making her the only Morris to ever pay a bill. KRAMER, LAURENCE Joanne says he is working at Vendo drilling holes in vendingmachines which has always been sort of a family tradition amongthe Morrises. I remember that most of the vending machines atFort Miller had the Morris family trademarks on them. Did youever wonder why the Morrises always paid for everything with abag of dimes? KRAMER, LESLIE CHILDREN Crystal Female She called me (fairly frantically but I won't say why) andsaid she had fond memories from her youngest years of how herGrandpa, Don Morris, would bounce her on his knee and sing herhis happy children's songs which are far too obscene to print.Even though she was very young at the time, she still rememberedthe words quite clearly and she sang one to me over the phone. Icould have had her arrested. Joanne says that Leslie has fallen in love with a "niceItalian boy" (as if there really was one), with an adorablegrandmother from the old country who speaks broken English, muchlike the Morrises themselves. Leslie brought the "nice Italian boy" to the reunion(he was the one with the shoulder holster) and introduced himaround. Joanne tried to convince me that he is a Mafia hit man,but that's only wishful thinking on her part because she wantsLeslie to date a man with a profession. LEARD, DOUGLAS CHILDREN Douglas Jr. Male Timothy Male Gummo Male Maurice Male Zeppo Male Douglas was there with wife Barbara. His list of children mayhave some omissions because they didn't send back their forms. Ididn't get a chance to talk much with them but they seem to behealthy and in good humor. LEARD, LOUISE (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Douglas Male David Male Michael Male She shamelessly claims that she spent twenty-six and a halfyears "working for the State of California" (an obviouscontradiction in terms) before she retired. She says she now hasmore time for the typical little old lady activities such astraveling (your tax dollars are paying for that), gardening,shopping (your tax dollars again), walking and just being lazy.(How is this so different than government work?) In an astonishing lapse of judgment she admits to havingproduced three children, now variously known as Douglas, David,and Michael. She has not yet seen fit to apologize to anyone forthat. Louise said these letters were OK "as long as you don'tpick on the Leards too much." Get real, lady. We ought tohave a Best Leard Joke contest. (No one gets to submit DavidLeard.) LEARD, MICHAEL CHILDREN None admitted. He bought a home in North Highlands and claims to be gettingcooperation from his neighbors, probably because they think he isa member of a motorcycle gang. He recently bought a .357 magnum, after trying mine out on thecrowds in downtown L.A., and is now laying for the neighbor'scat. Fire the first shot in the air, Michael. It gets themrunning and makes it a whole lot more fun. LINK, BARBARA (nee Sweet) She and Dan didn't show up but Magaret brought some pictureswhich may explain why. They live so far out in the boonies thatthey have to drive in to town just to use the outhouse. MORRIS, ELINOR (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Gary Male Donna Female Joanne Female Harpo Male Robert Male Richard Male Margie Female Chico Male Nancy Female Steven Male Jeff Male Several people wrote to say they were surprised to learn thatwas Don in "Gorillas in the Mist". Amazing realism,they said, but he looks a lot different with his hair combed. Iunderstand that he is currently working on his autobiography, KnuckleTracks in the Sand. Don was there this year, but Elinor was not. Seems she gets abackache just thinking about coming to the reunion. Don waslooking fairly fit (he can still carry his gut around) and he wasexceptionally well-behaved until someone coaxed him out of thetree. He is wearing suspenders now, which should help to cure thebreakaway pants problem which earned him the trophy for MostEmbarrassing Relative. After his belt got to a certain point onhis waistline there was nothing else to stop it, and away hispants would go, far too fast for his reflexes to catch them. Hislack of underwear was the really special touch which put away thecompetition year after year. I understand he even accidentallymooned Nancy's fiance the first time they met. His timing wasalways impeccable. Actually the trophy for Most Embarrassing Relative was retiredin 1975 when he successfully completed his 10,000th career LPF(Loud Public Fart). Younger family members will recognize it asthe Don Morris Memorial Award For Embarrassing Conduct, betterknown as the "Fellah". He has had many, many memorable LPFs including some realstunners in places such as churches, fine restaurants, andcrowded elevators. One window-rattler occurred when someone invited him to attendchurch (never a good idea) in the mistaken belief that it wouldhave some beneficial effect on his moral fiber. He stopped theminister's sermon dead in its tracks and had half thecongregation looking out the windows for storm clouds. "Ijust couldn't resist," Don grinned. "It echoes sonice." "The maitre' d thought I crapped my pants!" Don saysproudly about another incident. "Sir, would you like some assistance?" the maitre' dasked discreetly. "No thanks," said Don, "I can fart pretty goodall by myself." In crowded elevators, his sighs of relief are perhaps evenmore disturbing than the actual event itself. If you really want to know some of the history of why thetrophy was retired, you should ask him to tell you about the timehe got hold of some bad water while driving across the desertwith his boss and his boss's wife. He says he is too old to be a threat to women anymore but thatis probably just a ruse to lure them closer. It is still betterto be safe than sorry. When some men get to his age they tend tolose their inhibitions. NEWCOMB, DOUGLAS CHILDREN Joey Male Pam Female Josh Male Recently moved from North Carolina to Oregon with wife Joannand their multiple children. Currently working in Forklift sales. NEWCOMB, PAUL CHILDREN Kristi Female Ruthie says Paul is a "20-year man" but she didn'tindicate whether that was the Marines or San Quentin. NEWCOMB, RUTH (nee Taylor) CHILDREN Numerous, I am not clear how many, and I don't think she iseither. She proudly confirmed the name of her fiance, Tom Springer -she showed me the driver's license she found in his wallet. Hewas there and he seemed to be a nice enough guy, but probably alittle dazed by it all, and more than a little concerned aboutwhat Ruthie considers to be humorous. Ruthie says she is getting married in August and her grandsonEd will give her away. His is a joy I am sure we wish we allcould share. Ruthie said that she thought that she would have five of hers(so we know she has at least five children) there at the reunionfor the first time in 17 years (apparently a few of them werejust let out). She didn't tell me whether she actually achievedthat but how could I tell anyway? NEWCOMB, STEVE CHILDREN Bridget Female Steve is married to wife Colleen, and working as a carpenterin Santa Rosa. PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW I got no word from Andy but instead received a note from somewoman who identified herself as Christie Clayton (an obviousalias) and said that Andy had been snared by "a nice younggirl" (where have we heard that before?). She also said thatshe was going to marry him next year and presumably attempt tobreed him in captivity. From what Joanne says, she is apparently fairly well-educated(a high school diploma and actual college classes and stuff) andher interest in Andy has nothing at all to do with her primateresearch project. Christie seems to be a devious type of personso she will probably fit in well. Joanne says Christie works inthe Disaster Coordination Office for Orange County which is whyshe insisted that Christie attend the reunion. This same woman, or someone purporting to be her, showed up atthe reunion with Andy in tow. He used to be a scrawny littlesucker but he ain't no more - the Morris blood lines arebeginning to show as he ages. He is working as a customer servicerep - probably for a loan shark. He laughed about the tricks weused to play on him when he was a kid. He said he got over mostof his anger soon after the casts came off. Joanne says that Andy has surprised everyone and turned into a"responsible human being". One must keep Joanne'sperspective in mind. QUIGLEY, DONNA (nee Morris) CHILDREN Rick Male Amy Female Manfred Male Felix Male Julius Male Donna showed up with her boyfriend Lyle and no clearexplanation of where she got that last name. She and Margie spentmost of the time telling a lot of lies about me as a child. Thetruth is that I never did any of those things. Neither she norMargie has provided a list of their children they can stillremember. RICHARDSON, BECKY CHILDREN Refuses to say. She showed up at the reunion with some apparently namelessguy. I have seen him before but he still looks suspicious. Shesaid his name is "Sadistic Sid" Smith, but he doesn'tlook quite that civilized. She did not say what his position wasin the motorcycle gang. On the subject of her occupation she wisely pleads the FifthAmendment but says that she is making a major contribution to thefinancial health of the California wine industry. She admits tono children or, more correctly, says the government will notrelease the records. RICHARDSON, BUD CHILDREN Meta Female Larry Male Jerry Male By Acquisition from Jan Brent Bryer Male Berri Harter Female How many people knew his real name was Austin? Yeah, you'relying too. Bud clearly holds the record for the best-preservedalias - not even his own family knew his real name. Bud, the elder statesman of the family, looks to be in greatshape. He said he was going to videotape everyone at the reunionand have them actually identify themselves, but I guess some ofthe family had legal objections or something so I don't know ifhe got around to it. As achievements, Bud lists ten grandchildren, and one greatgrandson (it is undetermined whether the word "great"refers to actual family lineage or is just Bud's opinion). He also suggested that we should produce a family tree. He maybe so old that he is simply beyond shame. I have ordered somecomputer software which will allow me to produce one. It shouldembarrass everybody. RICHARDSON, JAMES CHILDREN Becky Female Jamie Female I have to correct the impression I left when I said that"old farts" were not greatly improved by aging. Intruth, he smells about as good as he ever did. He and Edna were there and the years seem to be treating themfairly well. Edna says she is still working while James hasalready retired. James is no fool. My kids tell me that James sagely counseled them to drink beerand smoke pot. Thanks, James, you're a real help. Ednaspecifically requested that Bonnie and I and kids attend thereunion because (to paraphrase her) "misery lovescompany." On Sunday James engaged Laurence and Don in a livelydiscussion of which type of truck and tractor seats produce thebiggest hemorrhoids. I think they finally agreed on unpaddedmetal tractor seats. Never let it be said that we don't haveintellectuals in this family. RICHARDSON, JAMIE CHILDREN None admitted. Jamie says she is currently working as a "respiratorycare practitioner" which she did not explain, but says it isnot the same as selling pot. She said that she is currently at aCatholic hospital but she didn't make it clear if that is whereshe works, or just where they keep her at night. Jamie says she previously spent fifteen years with the Countyof Fresno. She must be referring to employment because they don'tusually hold people in county jails that long unless it is a longseries of offenses. She admits to no children and says she hasbeen spayed, which allows her to engage in a much greater varietyof disgusting behavior. As achievements she says she has a cat and pays her own bills,both of which are apparently new for her. As hobbies she says sheskis cross-country (it helps to be in practice when you aretaking it on the lam), and hikes in the woods, where she meetsmore relatives than she cares to mention. Like Becky, she ismaking a major contribution to the California wine industry, witha marginal preference for corked, rather than screw-capped, wine. RICHARDSON, JERRY CHILDREN Jerry Jr. Male Terri Lynn Female He and wife Karen did not show up. Bud says he is working forSanta Clara County and is doing well. RICHARDSON, LARRY He showed up with his hair and beard dyed mostly gray as partof his Moses imitation. Like Meta, he seems to be pretty wellfed. I didn't get to talk to him much but Bud says he works forBaltimore Cooling Towers in Madera and has just moved into a newhome. RICHARDSON, PETE Pete showed up and related the story of how he told the truthon a few occasions some years back. It's an old story, but hetells it well, and we all enjoyed hearing it again. He says he is going to run in the Nationals in Indianapolis inAugust. If he will keep me posted, I will let you know how hedoes. SHEETS, KATHY (nee Newcomb) CHILDREN Ed Male Drew Male Ed is a lucky kid. Ruthie says that with feet like his henever has to buy swim fins. Kathy works as a wine-maker and makesextra money by renting out Ed's old shoes as duplexes. Terry, herhusband, drives a truck. Ruthie did not say whether he is aTeamster so I don't know anything about his possible criminalbackground. Ed and Drew are reportedly "two of the very bestbaseball players anywhere." (Ruthie's words, apply theTaylor Veracity Factor.) SWEET, MARGARET (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Christine Female Barbara Female Julie Female This year she became the first woman in the family to openlyadmit having four-footed grandchildren. (Laura Richardson wasactually the first, with the birth of the Morrises, but everyonewas too polite to mention it.) She did a heavy-duty grandmotherroutine and bored us all half to death with about a hundredpictures of mountain lions, cheetahs, and the other beasts Julieworks with at the L.A. Zoo. They were cute. Margaret says thatJulie is well-behaved and does not fight with them over the fooddish. TAYLOR, DON Bob & Edith's eldest is a winemaker in Oakville, CA(notice how many Taylors are involved in making wine) andrecently married wife Rosemary on April Fool's Day. Fools rush in. . . TAYLOR, EDITH She was at the reunion, looking good, and apparently no longeron the run from the law. TAYLOR, LAURENCE Laurence was there with his famous hat. It really makes youwonder, doesn't it? At first I thought he wore it to hold hisbrains in, but then I realized that couldn't be true. Somerelatives said that what I reported about Laurence was notcorrect at all. Contrary to what I said, they asserted thatLaurence had not been caught telling the truth, and stated theyfound it difficult to believe that he ever would be caughttelling the truth. My apologies, Laurence. Laurence spent a good deal of time telling about his work withthe FAA. He says that he is not an Air Traffic Controller butdoes something to maintain the equipment all of the Air TrafficControllers use. I am sure that we will all feel better aboutflying just knowing Laurence is on the job. TAYLOR, LOUISE She was there at the reunion looking good and doing well. Noword on whether she is still connected to the KGB. TAYLOR, ROBERT Bob & Edith's youngest is a history teacher and basketballcoach, presumably at some sort of school, in Woodland Hills,California. He recently took it on the lam to Egypt, Greece, andTurkey. No word yet on whether he managed to make it throughCustoms coming back.

If youhave not made arrangements to attend the reunion you should do itnow. Margaret sent me a couple of maps to help you out in locatingthe more important sites in the area of the reunion. You may notethat she has indicated the location of her home on one of themaps. I am not sure, but I believe she mentioned that if anyonecould not find any other camping space or an available motel,they could camp on her front lawn. No need to call - just pitchyour tent and be there when she wakes up in the morning. Sheshould enjoy it. Margaret says she has a new grandchild, and Bud a newgreat-grandchild, so you can expect both of them to beparticularly boastful this year. Dorothy says that Margaret is anunusually aggressive grandmother so it may be best to avoid heraltogether. Only a few of you have sent back your family informationforms. Of course, there is no compulsion to send in your form (orcontributions) - it is entirely voluntary. You will note,however, that Don and Elinor did not send theirs in last year.This year, Elinor was quite prompt. As you all may have expected, there has been no word from the low-down,no-good Richardson individual living in Ohio who has neverattended even a single family reunion. (Due to my extremerespect for Bill Henry, I will not mention the name ofthis thoroughly disreputable individual.) Because the low-down, no-good Richardson individual livingin Ohio who has never attended even a single family reunionhas not returned his family information form, and has no apparentintention of attending even a single family reunion, I shall haveto fill in his family's information the best I can. Therefore, Iam asking all of you to think hard and come up with all thestories from this individual's past which most clearly delineatehis complete lack of character. There are a number of episodesfrom his past which I am quite certain he would not want repeatedunder any circumstances (I can think of several that are sodisgusting they would gag a maggot and make a hooker blush) solet's collect all of these tales and make sure they are publishedwhere all the world can read them. Because he has neverattended even a single family reunion we all know that he isbeyond shame, but perhaps we can induce some shame in some othermember of his immediate family. I have completed the editing and formatting of Mary Taylor'sfamily history and I had intended to include it in this mailing,but my laser printer is having serious problems so it will haveto wait. Besides, I am not sure if I want to send something soworthwhile to that low-down, no-good Richardson individualliving in Ohio who has never attended even a single familyreunion. With any luck I should be able to have it printedand ready to distribute to anyone who attends the reunion, whichwill naturally exclude that low-down, no-good Richardsonindividual living in Ohio who has never attended even a singlefamily reunion. We will see you all at the reunion (with the exception of acertain nameless and shameless Richardson individual). CallMargaret if you have any questions.

Margaret and Vic were our hosts last year. They left townimmediately after the reunion, claiming that the timing of theirmove was just a coincidence. The last I heard they were holed upin a cave in the badlands of New Mexico. As usual, we were supremely graced by the absence of severaldisreputable Richardson individuals living in Ohio who have neverattended a single reunion. (As I have stated before, I do notwish to embarrass Bill Henry by mentioning any names, orby pointing out that he is the only original Richardson whohas never shown his face at any reunion.) I asked severalpeople if they had heard from these no-good people, seeing as howthey had not replied to any of the notices, or even returnedtheir family information sheets. (The truth must be far tooshameful for even them to admit.) The Hell's Angels have a ratherunique reproach for people who fall asleep at their parties and Ifelt it was only fair that we also have a similar reproach forpeople who consistently fail to attend reunions for a soliddecade. I put out the word that I am interested in collecting, andpublishing, stories from this individual's past which would showhis most disgusting habits and complete lack of character. Hemoved his family away from the rest of us just about the time hiskids were learning to talk so, no doubt, they have not heard thebest part of this low-down, no-good individual's criminal career. As soon as I put out the word for stories of this type, LouiseLeard and Margaret Sweet immediately leapt to his defense sayingthat he is a very busy and important person (they don't haveenough practice lying to make it sound believable) and they weresure there was some good reason why this low-down, no-goodindividual had missed every single reunion in the last ten years.Of course, this just illustrates my point about this individual'scharacter. How low must one sink before Margaret and Louise come to yourdefense? (They have never defended my good character, or come tothe defense of any Morris that I can recall.) They bothproclaimed with the loudness of an incompetent liar that thisindividual had always been of sterling character and that therewere no terrible tales to tell from his childhood. They were soloud, in fact, that I could not catch most of the details of thestories Don and Laurence were telling about him. I believe thatDon may have gotten this individual mixed up with Herman Klomp insome of the stories but that's not important It is a sad case indeed when Margaret and Louise are left tostick up for you. In any case, you should all know that I will becollecting the most embarrassing stories about this low-down,no-good individual and publishing them soon, so his family mayknow the complete truth about why he consistently fails to attendeven a single family reunion. Those of you who attended know that I passed around copies ofMary Taylor's Family History which I transcribed and printed outon the computer. I am not entirely sure who got copies so I haveincluded some copies in this newsletter for the people whoweren't there. (This, of course, includes the low-down,no-good Richardson individual from Ohio who has never attended asingle family reunion.) If you did not receive a copy at thereunion, and I did not include one for you here, just drop me aline and I will send you a copy. It is a pretty interesting viewof the family's history going back a couple of centuries,although some people have commented that Mary was rather"optimistic" in recounting the facts. There was an unusually aggressive pack of grandparents at thereunion, all of them armed with a deadly arsenal of babypictures. Margaret and Vic, having waited so long for their firsttwo-footed grandchild, were perhaps the most vicious of thebunch. Margaret showed me some pictures of her and I had to admitthat she is an incredibly beautiful child, with a sparklingpersonality, and possessed of talents that ordinary human beingscan scarcely imagine. As soon as I did admit it, Margaret tookher foot off my throat, Vic picked me up, dusted me off, and theyboth allowed as how they had always known that I was a gentlemanof intelligence and good taste. Margaret and Vic were apparently unable to persuade Julie toattend the reunion. Julie explained to me that, although sheworks at the LA Zoo, she has no direct experience with largeprimates. Julie puts on little shows at the LA Zoo where, amongother things, she sings a duet with a coyote. (Really!) It'spretty interesting, but it must be said that the coyote has thedistinctly better voice. Julie also raised a mountain lion in herhome (how'd you like have this chick for a neighbor?). She saidthere was no problem at all as long as she had dinner ready ontime and didn't make any sudden movements. Dorothy showed up with that old tale about how she went to thehospital and the nurse wrote on her chart that she "looks atleast ten years younger than her stated age." If you haven'theard that story yet, just get within fifty yards of her, and Iam sure the subject of medical charts will come up soon enough.We will probably have to listen to that until she is at least tenyears older than her stated age. James pontificated quite a while about the problems of theseUnited States and how he would solve them if he was king. Cut offsome bodily part, he said, every time someone commits a crime.Lop off a hand, or an arm, or a foot, or something more valuable,he said. It's an interesting idea but, if that was really thelaw, his nickname would have been "Stubby" for manyyears now. In the interests of justice and fair play, he said hewould not impose any penalties for anyone who chose toprevaricate. In fact, he said, that is one of the few areas wherehe thinks government subsidies would be justified. James allows that some Richardsons, and perhaps a few Taylors,might have committed some minor variations from the absolutefacts on rare occasions, but swears that he has never been knownto tamper with the truth. I thought about that quite a while andthen I had to admit that he was probably right. I could notrecall any time that he had been close enough to the truth thathe could have been accused of tampering with it. Edna admits that her once-famous morals are gone. She says shesaves her copies of the Reunion News. Doug and Barbara were there with their delightfully comatosechildren. They recently made a trip with a motorcycle gang downto the tip of Baja where they frolicked with the mating whales,burned and pillaged a few mountain villages, participated in afew large drug shipments, and had many other exciting adventures.They came to visit us on the way back and took us out for a niceMexican food dinner -- which is not always a good idea when aLeard is around. (I am sure we have all had an unfortunateadventure in that regard.) "We didn't get the turistas near as bad as wethought we would!" Doug shouted through the bathroom door. Iwas glad. Pete has had a busy year. He says that he is still winningfoot races even at his advanced age, although he still hasn'texplained why someone would want to deliberately run around in acircle just so they could get back to where they started beforesomebody else did. He says he went to some track meet back inIndianapolis where (he claims) he won the 400 and 800 meter racesand placed second in the 1500, or some such nonsense. When thisstatement was greeted with some modest skepticism, he swore thatit was true (his standard first reply) and said the low-down,no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has neverattended even a single family reunion would verify everythinghe said. If two Richardsons swear to it, it's got to be true,Pete said. Alternatively, he offered to swear on a stack offamily birth certificates. As most of you already know (with the exception perhaps ofcertain low-down, no-good Richardson individuals living inOhio who have never attended a single family reunion), Petehas taken a wife, Sandy. Sandy said she thinks his name is Pauland that what attracted her to Pete was his refined, gentlemanlymanners. As you might expect, that caused a good deal ofhilarity. She is a Bohemian kind of person who wears funny clothes andcalls herself an "artist" and a "designer",although she was a little fuzzy on just what it is she"designs". I was in her company for most of two daysand she never did pass around any good drugs so there is somequestion about her artistic credentials. She does, however, likebeer, and seems to be friendly even when she has had a few. Sheclaimed to be a lady of refinement and good taste before I gotthe pictures of her with her head stuck in a watermelon. Most ofus hadn't seen such a sight since James sold his livestock. Shefits in pretty well. David Leard did not attend this year. He sent me a Christmascard with a rather snide remark about how I must have learned mywriting skills in jail -- a crack which was totally uncalled forconsidering all the nice things I have said about the Leards.David said that he was making huge sums of money in real estatebut he sent no cash. In a prepared statement, Louise Leard said that David's recentventures in real estate had nothing at all to do with the failureof several savings and loans in the Seattle area and she wasconfident that the criminal investigations would exonerate himcompletely. She explained that David did not attend the reunionbecause one of his escrows did not close when it should have sohe was not legally allowed to leave town. We all nodded like webelieved everything she said. Jerry was there promoting beer as the answer to a balanceddiet. He swears that he cannot be recognized without a beer canin his hand. I recognized him immediately, but then the pile ofbeer cans had shifted and his head was sticking out. Last year I received an invitation to Laurence and Wilma'swedding, of all things. Laurence and Wilma said they wereinviting me to attend because I am "an important part"of their lives. I wondered a long time what they meant by that.Then I realized Laurence had to be talking about the time we allgot drunk and trashed his apartment. When we left, Laurence wasstanding out on the balcony in his underwear, yelling somethingat us. If he had been sober enough to remember who we were, I amsure he would have made sense. It's times like those that make afamily. From what I could gather from the invitation, it seems thatLaurence actually asked Wilma to marry him some twenty-five yearsago or so, and it has taken this long to convince her that it isa good idea. He lies pretty good, but apparently not good enoughto put that one across right away. Ruthie and Tom were there. She wanted me to correct a minormisstatement that I made in a previous issue of the Reunion News.She said she wanted to make it clear that she did not sendme a picture of Tom bound and gagged in the trunk of her car.Apparently it was some other guy. Tom, who was pretty frisky the year before, looked a littletired at times, like someone who had just spent the last year asthe only rooster in a ten acre hen house. Ruthie, on the otherhand, says she loves married life. She explains that Tom is stillin shock from the last reunion, which is certainlyunderstandable. Maybe it was just more than he expected. Joanne was there, and managed to wrestle a few of the othergrandmothers to the ground to show them pictures of her accusedgrandchildren. She called me after the reunion with somegrandiose scheme to lure unsuspecting men into joining a computerdating service. I don't know why she wanted it on a computer, itwas pretty obvious which chick was going to get the date. The last I heard, Joanne said her son, Laurence Kramer, wasworking as a taste-tester on an alfalfa farm in Nevada. I asked Becky why Jamie has missed the last few reunions. Shesaid that the reunions are usually scheduled the same week as theGay Pride parade in San Francisco and Jamie goes to the paradeinstead of the reunion. That way, she says, she doesn't run intoquite so many oddballs. Don Morris says that Elinor does not write letters, but I gotone from her last year thanking me for all the nice things I saidabout Don in the last Family Doings. She was, however, a littlemiffed that I failed to mention two of her children, Bonzo andCheetah Morris. Don was there. It would purely amaze you, but he is just asgood-looking and charming as he ever was. He may have slowed downa step or two but any sudden body movements can still clear out acrowd just as quick as ever. Margaret and Vic thought ahead andchose a windswept beach for the reunion. Like all the Morrises,Don complained a lot about how hard it is to find comfortableshoes for feet with an opposing thumb. He says that Elinor"understood" all those little jokes I wrote in the lastReunion News but confessed that some of it was just toointellectual for him. I helped him count his bananas and told himI understood how confusing these letters can be. "You can't insult a Morris," Don said. It ain't forlack of trying. Some people disputed my previous statements about Don. Theythought I flattered him unnecessarily and said they did notbelieve he had ever been in church. I assert that he has,although (by mutual agreement with the minister) it never was aregular thing. "We love our Brother Don," the ministersaid, "but even Jesus has limits." "If they don't want you to fart, why do they call it apew?" Don asked indignantly. He does not understand muchabout religion. Did you ever wonder what happened to Baby Huey when he retiredfrom comic books? I met Jeff Morris when he was wandering arounddown on the beach, still wearing the radio tracking collar thegame wardens gave him. He was roaming around pretty freely so Iassumed he was out of range of their receivers. His fur is not aslong as Don's but the consensus of opinion is that they are thesame sub-species. "Cliffy," he said. "Long time, no see." "Most of the time, not long enough," I said. "Didn't you used to have long hair and a beard?"Jeff asked. "Nope, I always had a crew cut and I was clean-shaven.You must be thinking of your sisters. You remember." I toldhim. "Oh, yeah, now I remember," he said. "You looka lot different with a beard." "Say, Jeff, what are you doing these days?" "Being a bum, mooching off my Dad, getting intotrouble." I was surprised. He seems safe, though it's hard to tell withanything that big. "Say, Jeff," I asked, "how many tranquilizerdarts does it take to bring you down?" He said he didn't know for sure and then told me someoutlandish story about how some woman wanted him to come livewith her and just be a bum over at her place. It's the Morrisdream but he didn't have all the details consistent. I got some real nice pictures of Don and Jeff and I showedthem to the clerk in the drug store when I got them developed. "A friend of mine shot one of those things in NorthernWashington," he said. "His wife wouldn't let him bringit in the house." That confused me. "David Leard lives up that way, but no Morrises that Iknow of." I told him. He looked at the pictures again. "Coulda been a Leard Iguess." There was some discussion of the fact that the familygenealogy is, shall we say, subject to interpretation.Some went so far as to state that Don Morris is not, strictlyspeaking, a blood relative and, therefore, it is not necessary toclaim him, despite his obvious achievements. I feel that he mustbe included, if only because he has infested an unusually largeportion of the family and he seems to show up at the slightestmention of free food. There are, however, larger issues involved. Over the years, the Richardson-Taylor clan has acquiredmembers by a number of different methods, including adoption,acquisition by marriage, friends who just kept hanging around,(on a few occasions) actual "legitimate" births, andfrom other causes far too complicated to explain in ten or twelvepages. This can sometimes be confusing to children and others whoare not fully acquainted with the difference between admitted andactual history. I remember when I was growing up I used to ask my motherquestions like, "What relation is David Leard to me?" "He's your first cousin," she said. "Are you sure?" "Sure. Just check the tag on his ear." She handed mea code book from the Department of Fish and Game. "What is Steve Morris to me?" "He's your first cousin, too." "Are all the Morrises my first cousins?" "In general they are. There are a few exceptions, butthose are purely on scientific grounds." "What is Laurence?" "Laurence is best avoided," she said. "That's common knowledge," I said. "But whatrelation?" "Oooooh, he's just some kind of relative or other." "But what kind? Cousin? Uncle? Great-aunt? What?" "I'm sure that he is at least one or more of those,"she said. "Otherwise, it would be easier to get rid ofhim." "Well, then, what about Ruthie? What relation isshe?" I asked. "Do you think it will rain?" Some of you may have noticed that Mary avoided certainquestions with respect to the family history. I am sure theremust be a good, logical explanation. Since I started the newsletter, and will some day publish afamily tree, I have been informed that several members of thefamily were acquired by means which were, shall we say, notexactly standard. Let it suffice to say that a large portion ofthe family might not pass pedigree standards for the AmericanKennel Club. As some of you may know, there is even a branch ofthe family which is no blood relation at all, but was acquiredsolely because they smelled hamburgers on the grill. In any event, it shall be my policy to consider any familymember, however acquired, to be on a par with any other familymember who does not have quite so much to explain about theirbloodlines. How you got here (marriage, adoption, or factuallyrecorded birth) is basically irrelevant so, unless someoneinsists, I will not list details of how someone got to be at anyparticular branch on the family tree. Nor will I attempt to judgethe relative merits of anyone's lineage. Just take my word forit, that is who they are represented to be. See you at the reunion, (with the exception of the low-down,no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has neverattended a single family reunion). Sincerely, Clifford A. Schaffer 1992 Reunion Details When: June 20 & 21, 1992 Where: Mooney Grove, Visalia, California Arbor number 11 That's really good thinking, Becky -- inviting Don Morris to aplace called "Mooney Grove." Contribution: The standard contribution is again $8.00per household, giving the greatest benefit to those of you who breed likerabbits. Those of you who wish to send more may do so. The money goesinto a reunion fund which is used to pay for others who can'tmanage it, or it is carried forward to the following year. Beckysays that if you contribute enough money, she will investigatepossible campsites in Rio De Janeiro for our benefit. Send yourcash, check, or small items of jewelry to: Becky says that it would be helpful to know how manybottomless pits you will be bringing with you so she can havesome idea how many sides of beef she will need. Please reply by June 1 to let her know. Bring: Salads, beans (it's OK, it's outdoors - juststay upwind of the Leards), desserts, and munchies. Bring your own beverages and a healthy load of charcoal. Becky said to bring special dishes, gourmet cuisine, andsomething which will "suprise us all." Please don't. Idon't think she realizes what she is saying. Especially, pleasedon't bring anything you found in the park. How to Get There and Other Notes Becky has chosen Visalia for this year's reunion. As you cansee from the enclosed sheet, it is the "Jewel of theValley". Some of you may recognize it by other names. Shesays she chose it because it is the only place in the area with alow to moderate amount of gunfire in the city parks. Here is Becky's description of how to get to Mooney Grove: To get to Mooney Grove in Visalia, take the Hwy 198exit off Hwy 99. You will be turning east and the exit signs willindicate Visalia/Sequoia National Park. You will drive right pastthe majority of the motels as you head into town. Five milesafter you exit Hwy. 99 and are now heading east on Hwy. 198, takethe Mooney Blvd. exit and turn right (south). Aftercrawling about five miles through all the traffic, there will bea little open space and on the left (east) side will be MooneyGrove. There is an alternate route to get to Mooney Grove withoutusing the heavily trafficked Mooney Blvd. Take theTagus/Ave. 264 exit east off Hwy 99 (this will be south of theHwy 198 exit by 6 miles), continue east on Ave. 264 until MooneyBlvd. where you will turn left (North). Mooney Grovewill be on your right (east) real soon. What do you think the Morrises will be thinking about by thetime they get there? Let's just hope they don't get out of hand. Becky says this place is a county park (not unlike the placewhere some of you may be residing) with lots of tall trees,grass, kiddie play areas, and a duck pond where the Leards cangrab an occasional snack without bothering the rest of us. Aboutforty miles east of Visalia is the entrance to Sequoia NationalPark. You may want to plan to visit Sequoia during your trip. We have a large covered arbor -- number 11, on the leftafter you enter the park -- reserved for both days. There areelectrical outlets on the site so you all can bring you favoriteappliances. Mooney Grove has a $2.00 per vehicle entrance fee.There is NO parking around the outside of the park. Those whowish to save money and/or help relieve the parking gridlockwithin the park will need to leave extra vehicles and form carpools at the shopping center north of the park, or at lodgingsites. Of course, if you just hitchhiked down for the freehamburgers - even better. In keeping with tradition (tradition? When did we ever haveany tradition beyond petty theft?) we will slaughter the fattedcalf around noon and put bowls out for the Morrises and theLeards. We will have an early dinner on Saturday to try to gettheir bellies full before the sun goes down. There are two RV campgrounds nearby and campers need toreserve early as this area gets very busy with folks traveling toand from the National Parks. Motelers have a good variety of choices. Most of the motelsare along Hwy 198 between Hwy 99 and Visalia proper; these arerecommended. (Apparently Becky has some considerable experiencewith them.) There are also motels on Mooney Blvd. Mooney Blvd. isthe main commercial strip complete with six lanes of heavytraffic , all stop and go due to frequent traffic lights . Thisis also where the cruisers cruise. At one time, Visalia wasplanned as the site for the movie American Graffiti, untilthe producers decided to go to the more exciting town of Modesto. The Visalia KOA has a full range of sites offering no services(comparable to home) to full hook-ups and tent areas. It appearsto be clean and well-maintained. Amenities include a pool, gameroom, and a small playground. Becky says she was quoted $16.65for full hook-ups. Reserve early, their busy season starts inApril. See the enclosed sheets for location map and campgroundlayout.

The annual family reunion has come and goneagain. I believe it is caused by a chemical imbalance in thebrain. Well, for all of you who attended the reunion this year, youknow that Becky and Carl put on one of the better feeds of thepast few years. There was some really good steak, and everybodybrought a lot of other fixings which, luckily, we did not have toshare with any of the lower creatures such as Bill Henry. All inall, I would say it was successful. Only a couple of people tookshots at me, and both of those were deflected. Becky, being thegracious hostess that she is, offered to help them reload, butcooler heads prevailed. When we got to the reunion, Meta came running out to meet us.I am a good bit faster than she is, so I kept a good distancebetween us until I was sure she was in a good mood. I am sure youwill understand when I tell you that the sight of a smilingrelative fills me with mixed emotions. I never know whether theyare genuinely glad to see me, or just anticipating the pleasureof killing me. Meta is an especially dangerous relative becauseshe works at the Internal Revenue Service where she is themanager of Torture Chamber Number 3. She says that it is againstthe rules for her to look up any particular person's taxes, whichhelps to establish her alibi when you are suddenly picked for anaudit. Beware of anyone who claims innocence before your badluck. As usual, Bill Henry did not show up for the umpteenth year ina row. As you all know, I have no interest in trashing hisreputation, even if such a thing was possible. Therefore I shalltry to report only the most favorable things I heard about him. There were signs that Bill Henry would show up, but it turnedout to be a false alarm -- somebody ran over a skunk. Bud was notfooled, he knew right away it wasn't Bill Henry. "Ain't nearly as pungent as Bill Henry," he said."You'd have to have whole carload of skunks before I'd thinkBill Henry was coming." "Now Bud," Louise said, "I think you're goingto offend some skunks with that kind of talk." As it turned out, nobody had anything nice to say about thislow-down individual. Even Louise Leard, who normally comes to hisdefense, had to admit that Bill Henry and soapy water had neverbeen close companions. "You have to remember that it is notreally his fault that he has never attended a singlereunion," she said. "it is just that he is so obese nowthat he takes up two first-class seats on the airplane. He has tosteal an awful lot to get that much money." Ruthie tried to apologize for him. "I heard he tried tocome but his kids couldn't make it through the farm animalquarantine." "Talking about farm animals," Pete said,"Living with Bill Henry was kinda like living with a grandchampion Berkshire hog that eats nothing but chili beans." "Now, be careful there," Louise cautioned him."You might offend some Berkshire hogs that way." Don said the worst things about Bill Henry. "Me and BillHenry are buddies," he said, "like two peas in a pod.Bill Henry always looked up to me as a model of refinement andfine behavior. Of course, he never was quite the gentleman that Iam." Don was right about that. Bill Henry never was a highsociety character like Don, and was not nearly as good-looking,either. I called Bill Henry, just to see if he had any kind ofmiserable excuse for missing every single reunion that has everbeen held. He was his usual weasel self. He told me that the mostrecent lewd conduct charges were all a mistake, because he wasonly holding it for a friend. He told me he was coming to California in December to see somewoman named Nasa. He said Dawn knew nothing about it and tried toget me to believe that he and all his family are doing well. Markis either in college or in jail, and Craig is in his senior yearin high school and will soon be eligible to be tried as an adult.Dawn, he says, was recently arrested for a long string ofunsolicited good deeds. Bill says he has been doing a fair amountof running in 5K races lately and soon hopes to run asub-15-minute mile. He became concerned about his physicalcondition when some old lady ran him down and took her purseback. As usual, he gave me the mealy-mouth pretty bad about comingto the reunion. He said he would try but he could not promiseanything. (His wife hears that a lot.) He said he wanted to makeup for his thoroughly disgusting behavior, so he told me to telleveryone that he would give one hundred dollars to every personwho calls him collect to remind him to come to thereunion. He said to be sure to call between the hours of midnightand 2 AM, California time. If he seems a bit irritable when youcall, just hang up and try again in ten or fifteen minutes. James and Edna were there in fine form, and James spent a gooddeal of time telling me about one occasion when he did not go tojail even though, by his own admission, he thoroughly deservedit. Don Morris was there. More than anything else he reminds me ofa mountain gorilla with a good beer gut, wearing Frisco jeans anda long-sleeved shirt, desperately trying to pass for human. Youhave to give him credit because sometimes he almost makes it.Elinor came along, too, with no unrealistic expectations aboutDon's behavior. Jeff did not come along. Elinor explained that heslipped his collar and ran off to Sacramento. Elinor does notattend all that many reunions but it must be stated that herattendance record is a thousand times better than Bill Henry's. Iheard that Don was sick with a heart problem earlier this yearand, on one occasion, he actually passed on for a short time. TheLord, however, saw Don knocking on the pearly gates, thoughtbetter of His actions, and immediately sent Don back. Don says I"appreciate" him. I suppose that is one way of puttingit. I guess the Lord does too. Joanne was there with her new granddaughter. It looks as ifChristy's attempts to breed Andy have been successful. Theirdaughter is an absolutely stunning child, a fact which can beconfirmed by anyone who had the misfortune to wander too close toJoanne's new cub. I would send you all a picture of her but theonly picture I got shows Joanne proudly displaying her in theMorris Moon position, and you have all seen that before. HerGrandpa Don is justifiably proud. Pete and Sandy were there. Pete says I should go talk to Garyin Oregon. Ruthie says that she has the highest possible opinionof Sandy and explained that Sandy is Grade-A Certifiable. I thinkwe can believe Ruthie on this one. Ruthie was there but Tom was not. Ruthie explained that, inless than two years of marriage, Tom had come down with doublepneumonia so she thought it best to leave town while herecovered. Louise Leard wrote me a letter in which she told me that sheliked all the parts of these letters that I thought were thedullest. There is no accounting for taste, particularly inLouise's case. She says that she enjoys reading them aloud withthe other members of her family. Now that is something I nevereven contemplated -- Louise Leard telling fart jokes to hergrandchildren. Maybe she should ask Don to come over and share afew of his experiences with them. Louise said that she waspleased to see that I was able to talk about the Leards withoutusing swear words, because it is so seldom done. We missed Edith and Louise Taylor at the reunion for the firsttime in years. They are usually there every year, except forthose rare occasions when there are rumors that Bill Henry mightshow up. The last I heard they were both doing well and makinglots of money. Edith is probably organizing a marathon. Bud was the clear winner for bringing the most family membersto this reunion. I never thought he was that prolific, but fromthe looks of the crowd that he had, he must have been having awhole lot more fun than I thought. You could tell they were allrelated to him, too. They showed up and the food vanished. Several of you have complained about (among other things) thatI never say anything about myself and my family. Part of this isdue to the fact that I tend to be considerably more refined thanthe rest of you (especially the Ohio branch of the family) but,in deference to the unending stream of complaints about one thingor another, I shall try. What can I tell you about my family? You can't really hatesomebody until you marry them. There is no happiness in life thathaving children cannot cure. Serena and Alyssa (the twins) have both graduated from highschool, more or less on time. The Pope has declared it a miracleand will be erecting a small shrine in front of our house. Alyssais now going to the local junior college studying nothing inparticular, and works as a secretary for a real estate appraiser.Serena has been working full time for the last two years atPinkerton Detectives in the Employee Benefits Department, andwill begin college in January. They have matching worthlessboyfriends. Melissa is in high school, has not been arrested recently(last thirty days) and had a job over the summer doing telephonecanvassing for a real estate company. Her boss said she was goodat talking on the phone -- a real surprise for all of us. Courtney is now in junior high school and is wearing thebraces that could have been my new car. Anyone who thinks theyhave ever seen stubborn should meet Courtney. For years she hasinsisted that one of the Four Tops biggest hits was "I'll BeDarned". Bonnie works at Pinkerton as some kind of manager in thecomputer systems department, when she is not home complaining. Asa hobby, they all spend money. Now, I am sure that all of you with children feel that yourchildren are a very special brand of idiot. In the majority ofcases, I am sure you are right. That is, you spend a good deal oftime just staring in amazement and shaking your head at the dumbthings they do. Well, so do I, but yours probably don't make itinto the local newspaper. I have enclosed a copy of a newsarticle which appeared in our local newspaper. It seems that Courtney (our youngest) was accused of gamblingat school. One of her friends dropped a quarter, so Courtneypicked it up and handed it to her. One of the teachers (awell-known local nut) saw Courtney do it and assumed thatCourtney and her friend were gambling. Consequently, the teacherconfiscated the money, which was the friend's lunch money, andsaid Courtney must come in for Saturday school (their usualpunishment for schoolyard felonies). It was clearly a bum rapbecause neither one of them could even accurately describe theusual technique of gambling, because neither one of them had muchinterest in it until they got busted. We, as parents, took exception to a stupid situation andprotested the matter but, as long as Courtney didn't have to goto the Saturday school, we were ready to drop it. However, I amsure the school authorities had no idea they were messing withAlyssa. Alyssa is the kind of person who will tell people off justbecause they need to be told off. She sort of considers it as apublic service on her part. In fact, she goes out of her way tofind people who need this service. Since we have lived here shehas told off the neighbors, their kids, their pets, thehomeowners association, the gardeners, the security guards, themail man, the street sweeper, the sheriff, and the peoplebuilding the housing tract next door -- to name a few. Somehow,an issue always seems to come up which requires her input. She isoften the kind of person who makes you wonder if you can knockthem out with one punch. Alyssa could piss off the Pope. MotherTheresa would strangle her. I have disclaimed any knowledge ofher on many public occasions. Alyssa never seems to run short of things that she objects toand she likes nothing better than a good crusade, so when thishappened to her younger sister she was outraged and vowed to dosomething about it. I am not entirely sure why she felt she hadto do something because, on any other occasion, she wouldgleefully torment Courtney in any way she could, and I have hadto break up more than a few good fist fights between these two.If she could have personally arranged for Courtney to attendextra Saturday schools on any other occasion, I am sure she wouldhave done it in a heartbeat. I guess the injustice of thesituation was just too much for Alyssa to tolerate. Alyssa called the local newspaper and reported it to them,providing them with our correspondence with the school, the nameof the other girl, a few other pertinent facts, and a suitableamount of righteous indignation. They investigated and publishedthe enclosed article on page one of the Sunday paper. As result, the school authorities now eye Courtney with greatsuspicion, like Richard Nixon views reporters. No doubt they willtread lightly when they think of messing with Alyssa, or anyonewho might know her. Their policy of arbitrarily seizing moneyfrom kids has, however, stopped. As for me, I am doing itinerant computer consulting, somewriting on various subjects, and a good deal of rabble-rousingfor radical organizations such as the American Civil LibertiesUnion. I am the only member of the Los Angeles Chapter who isalso a member of the National Rifle Association. Even the ACLUthinks I am a radical. It makes me feel special to be a misfiteven among the misfits. My specialty is the legalization of drugs, although I willwillingly engage almost any conservative fool on almost anysubject. As some of you may already know I have spent the lastfew years debating everyone from local prosecutors to the DrugCzars on this issue and, to date, have never lost. The reason Idon't lose is simple enough -- any rational review of theevidence shows that legalization is a far better approach. Mostof the information I have is really surprising. Do you know why drugs were originally outlawed? Cocaine wasoutlawed because of the fear that superhuman Negro Cocaine Fiendswould drink large amounts of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola and go on aviolent sexual rampage and rape white women. Caffeine was almostoutlawed at the same time because of the same fear. Policenationwide switched from .32 caliber to .38 caliber pistolsbecause, as one police officer put it, "Those cocaineniggers sure are hard to kill." Opiates were outlawedbecause of racial prejudice against the Chinese, and marijuanawas outlawed as a legal weapon against Mexican laborers duringthe Depression. The laws never had anything to do with publichealth and safety. As some of you may know, this year there were three judgesfrom Orange County who publicly came out and said they supportedlegalization of drugs. I have been coaching these judges on howto debate the subject of drug legalization in media appearancesand there has been more than a little success. In any flat-footeddebate they are just about unbeatable. On one recent radio talkshow one of the judges I am coaching was supposed to debateSherman Block, the LA County Sheriff. The morning of the debate,Sheriff Block announced that he would have to release 20 percentof all of the prisoners in Los Angeles County because there wereno more jails to hold them. Sheriff Block failed to show up forthe debate and the radio station could not find any official inLA or Orange County who was willing to defend the criminal lawsagainst drugs. A recent survey showed that forty percent of allof the judges in Orange County now support legalization. (Can you imagine Louise Leard reading this propaganda aboutdrug legalization to her grandchildren? I'm gonna get scolded forsure. She already blames me for corrupting her youngest child,and still watches me warily when I talk to him.) Attached you will find the latest info on the next reunion.Pete says there will be more information later, presumably afterhe has already collected all the money. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night! Reunion Details Where:                  Merced River Resort, near Turlock                                                                     When:                   June 26 and 27, 1993                                                                                                           In the absence of further information from Pete,                           we should assume that the contribution will be                             the same, $8.00 per household or loosely                                   organized mob.                                     Important:              Pete says he needs to know who is coming by        January 15, 1993 in order to reserve the camp                              sites.  Reserved camp sites, tents, and trailers                           will need to be paid for by April 15, 1933.        The campground has camp sites, tents, trailers which may bereserved on a first-come, first-served basis. The camp sites andtents each rent for $15 per night, and you may have more than onetent per camp site. The trailers rent for $35 per night. The trailers, I am told,have three beds and will sleep up to six people, depending upontheir degree of familiarity. One bed is an actual bed, anotherbed is really a table, and a third is a sofa -- kinda like we allused to sleep when we lived on Fedora. The trailers are supposedto be 24 footers with all of the amenities of home. Those of youwho use linens on your bed will need to bring them with you. Pete says to get your reservations in early because there areonly six trailers and Pete and Laurence have already taken two ofthem. Ruthie will probably take another one, so anyone whodoesn't speak quickly is going to be sleeping in the park again. There is also a clubhouse which serves breakfast from 9 to 10AM (too early for me) for about two or three dollars per adult(too rich for most of us). Alternatively, they have largedumpsters available to feed the Morrises and the Leards. Additional accommodations are available in the motels inTurlock eight miles away, for $36 to $44 per night. Pete says hewill supply more information about these later.

As heclaimed before, it is being held at the Merced River Resortwhich, he further goes on to claim, is a luxurious private resortand park with numerous amenities such as a swimming pool, spa,enormous club house, and neighboring nudist camp. They havebreakfast in the morning for a nominal fee and kids can eat forhalf price. He says that it is so good that they guarantee goodweather. He also says that there are lots of things in the areasuch as the Museum at Castle Air Base, the Musuem of MercedCounty, some sort of Pioneer Exhibit, and the Yosemite WildlifeArea. Doug Leard wrote to commend me on my "internecineapprobation." (Douglas is sometimes excessivelysesquipedalian.) He went on to say that I should spread some moreof that condemnation on other people in the family, besides thelower-grade Ohio member, such as Robert and Richard Morris, whosecombined attendance record is nil and seldom. Robert is nowliving in Florida and I am of the belief that it is not goodpolicy to encourage any Morris to come out of a swamp. Richardlast attended at one of the Santa Cruz reunions where he got tooclose to the campfire and burned his fur pretty badly. I hearthat he still has a large bald spot on his back and is stillshaken up by the experience. Bud wrote to say that he has a new great-grandson named (ofall things) James Richardson, born January 23, 1993, weighing inat seven pounds, eleven ounces, and 21.5 inches long. As usual,Bud took more credit for this event than any three people wouldhave deserved, and says that one of his grandchildren played someminor role in helping to bring this about. We certainlycongratulate him but I think that, in view of the historicalrecord, his parents might have been more judicious in theirchoice of a name. I have heard that Edna took a nasty fall and broke her legpretty badly. She did not explain why she chose to do this, Iwould think that she would have wanted to avoid it. Anyway, Ialso heard that she seems to be recovering pretty well now butmay still have a slight limp when she gets to the reunion. I wassorry to hear about her getting hurt but I have to admit that Iam glad of any advantage I can get whenever she starts chasing me(her favorite nephew) around the table with a butcher knife. Alyssa, our eldest, appeared on the television game show,Scattergories, at the end of February, and will soon be appearingagain on April 19 or 20 because they screwed up the scoring thefirst time. She has completed her schooling to become a realestate appraiser and will soon be taking the licensing test. Ifshe passes the test, she will probably become the youngestcertified real estate appraiser in the state of California. Melissa took some career aptitude tests for high school and,overall, scored higher than the school administrators had everseen before. In fact, they said that she was probably qualifiedto become a research scientist, if she chose. (This is the samegirl whose head whistles when the wind blows.) They said shescored off the top of the scale on one particular aptitude -- theability to talk. That was a great surprise to all of us. Now to raise the hackles of a good number of you. The years ofFascist dictatorship under Reagan and Bush has finally overcomemy political apathy and I have resolved to do something about it.I had hoped that Bill Clinton would make some major changes onsome issues but he appears to be wimping out, so he will probablyhave to be pushed. I am opposed to abortion, for example, but feel that there arebetter ways than criminal laws to prevent or dissuade people fromhaving them. As in many other areas, the use of the police toenforce essentially private behavior does not add any realbenefit to the equation. Clinton appears to have wimped out on the issue of gays in themilitary, too. The fact is that there have been gays in themilitary since the days of Achilles and Patrocles. There were gayguys in my Army Intelligence unit in Korea and they did not seemto be a disruptive influence, except to those people that Ithought were a disruptive influence. They had the same kind ofhysterical talk about disorder in the barracks when they weregoing to racially integrate the armed services. It was balderdashthen and it is balderdash now. As I told you, I have been involved in a campaign todecriminalize drugs. I don't want to get too political here, butwe have people in this family who have suffered greatly, andcontinue to suffer, because of a terribly misguided war againstdrugs. Aside from the political aspects, this is an issue whichhas directly affected this family. Because of some recent eventsin the family, a few more of you have come around to my way ofthinking and specifically asked to hear more of what I had to sayabout the issue. Therefore, I have enclosed some of theliterature I have put together on the issue. I encourage you allto go to the library and read the evidence. No rational personcan support our current drug policy once they have read theevidence. Things seem to be coming to a head on this issue. I have had apretty fair number of speeches and debates, including some on theradio. The most interesting thing was a meeting we held at theHoover Institution at Stanford University on February 26. Themeeting was held at the offices of Dr. Milton Friedman, theNobel-prize winning economist, and included some of the mostprominent medical authorities on drugs in the world. Together, wedrafted a resolution calling for immediate public hearings toform a new drug policy. I have enclosed a copy of the resolutionand a partial list of the people who have signed it. The resolution was published across the nation. It immediatelyreceived the endorsement of Dr. Dean Edell, and the San JoseMercury, and made front-page news in Baltimore and other cities.In addition, the California Medical Association adopted aresolution which went even further and openly called fordecriminalization. We are now trying to sign up as many majorprominent people or organizations as we can and, in anotherninety days or so, we will carry the resolution to Bill Clintonto try to get him to act on it. We have already received atremendous response to our announcement and we are anticipatingmuch more. We believe that, in addition to Baltimore Mayor KurtSchmoke, we will soon have the signatures of several more mayorsof major cities. I have to say that the meeting was intensely interesting.There were nine doctors in attendance, including the Americandoctor who formed Britain's drug treatment plan in 1947, and thedoctor who was appointed by the state legislature to headCalifornia's Research Advisory Panel on Drugs. All of the doctorsagreed that medical patients are suffering unnecessarily becausethe war on drugs has limited doctors' ability to provide painrelief. Dr. Harvey Rose spent three years and more than $100,000fighting charges that he gave too much Darvon to a woman who wasin her 80's and had crippling arthritis. The war against drugshas gone so far overboard that doctors cannot prescribe adequatepain relief, even for people who are desperately ill. I described to them the medical problems of a few members ofthe family and they all agreed on the one thing that they wouldprescribe for severe pain -- heroin. They said it was a highlydesireable analgesic because it was safe, powerful, andshort-acting. They all agreed that, for severe medical pain,heroin is the drug of choice. What was most surprising to me wasthat they consistently used the same word to describe all of theillegal drugs in general, and heroin in particular. The word theyused was "harmless." Doctors are now coming tounderstand that drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and morphinehave very important medical benefits which are not provided byany other type of drug. Marijuana is the treatment of choice forconditions such as glaucoma and nausea from chemotherapy. Heroinand morphine help people heal much faster after severe injuriesor surgery because, by reducing pain, they reduce the stress onthe nervous system. It is with great regret that I must report that Wilma Taylorhas died. We will miss her. Reunion Details Where:                Merced River Resort.

Pete said that he wanted to                            hold the contest on Friday night because there                           was a chance that Bill Henry might show up on                            Saturday and he wanted other people to have a                            fair chance.  He says that ten families are                              already signed up for Friday night.                                      Saturday will be the big day with hot dogs and                           hamburgers at noon, the Bill Henry Cursing                               Contest at two o'clock, and the main meal about                          four.                                                                    Sunday will be Alka-Seltzer, hotdogs, hamburgers,                        and scraps from the carnage of the previous                              night, starting at about 11 AM. Some of the truly                        hard-core will stay until Monday.                  Contribution:         $8.00 per household.                               Pete says that larger contributions will be                              gratefully accepted and will be used to install                          an underground beer vat at his home.                                     Contributions must be in by June 1 and the money                         will be all spent by June 21.  As usual, let us                          know if money is a problem.                        Bring:                Salads (for the grazing members of the family),    beans (here we go again)                           good desserts (as if anyone in this family would                         notice what they were inhaling)                    charcoal -- at least ten pounds per family.                              (Pete did not explain what he wanted to do with a                        fire that big.)                                    drinks (to keep the taylors out of the local                             bars)                                              bathing suits (don't use those same old excuses                          again)                                                                   There will be plastic silverware and plates                              provided.  If you need stronger stuff, bring your                        own.                                                Important:            Pete says he needs to know who wants camp sites    right away.  He said that there were two trailers  left and they are a fantastic deal.  He says the   camp sites can have more than one tent, with a     limit of 8 people per site, so families can share  a site if they want.  Money for camp sites and     trailers is not refundable after April 20.

Nobody of anyimportance is missing from this picture. The Reunion News is coming out a little early for a couple ofreasons. The first is that I got a call the other day fromLaurence. He left a message on my answering machine telling methat he was going to get "fixed" in January and hewanted to invite a whole bunch of people to watch. If it is goingto be held in Santa Rosa I may have to pass. He did not explainmuch about whether this was some kind of civil or criminalrequirement which had been imposed upon him, or whether hethought it would just be a fun way to spend the afternoon. Come to think of it, the tape was not very clear and he couldhave said either that he was going to get "fixed" orthat he was going to get "hitched." I figured the firstwas much more likely, and of far greater public benefit, sothat's how I will pass it on to the rest of you. The second reason I will explain a little later. As you all know (with the exception of those who have neverattended a single reunion), the last reunion was held on theMerced River where it was hotter than Hell most of the time. Youcould drink all day and never take a leak. When I arrived a rather strange looking person came runningtoward me. "Hi, Cliff!" he said. I always find it unnerving when eye-witnesses can identify me.I figured it was best to humor him. "Hi," I said. "Do you know who I am?" he asked. "Stranger," I told him, "I think you are in thewrong camp. We don't ask questions like that around here." "I'll give you a clue," he said, "I'm aTaylor," as if that would have narrowed down the field. "That may well be, but it's nothing to brag on," Itold him, "and taking your word for it, I would hate toguess." "I'm David Taylor," he said merrily, "and Ibrung my whole family with me," apparently not noticing thelook of shock and dread which crossed my face. Don Morris: Redefining handsome I had no reason to believe that this had any relation to thetruth but I decided to accept his story for two reasons. Thefirst is that it is my standing policy not to question anyone'stales of how they could be related to the family, no matter howremarkable the story might be. The second is that I quicklydecided that if anyone wanted to claim to be David Taylor, Iwould not dispute him for the honor of it. Pete's explanation for why he is unemployed. He told me how much he liked reading the Reunion News andassured me that, while some high-falutin' people may have beenoffended by some things I said, he certainly was not. He went onto assure me that he was just as hard to insult as any of theMorrises, and for pretty much the same reasons. It was acomforting thought. He spent the better part of half an hour introducing me to allthe people he had brought with him with the obvious expectationthat I might remember some of them the next time around. I havemade no such effort to remember anyone in the past and no oneshould expect that I would make such an effort now or in thefuture. It makes no difference in the conversation anyway. Fromthen on, he would pull me aside every couple of hours tointroduce me to some new "relative" of his (he claimedthat the majority of them were his children, though he was hazyon more than a few) who had shown up just in time to eat. Ifigure that the eight dollar contribution for his householdprobably worked out to about ten cents a head. David Leard and his wife, Pat, were there. She still uses hermaiden name, Lindsey, in order not to be too closely associatedwith him. They could be legally attached or just living in sin.She was suspiciously friendly and I wondered why until she pulledme aside and slipped me five dollars so I wouldn't say anythingbad about them. The going rate is ten -- each. Laurence under the influence again. Now I am going to tell you something that you probably wouldnot have believed even if you had been there and seen it withyour own eyes, but they decided that David Leard met the sanitarystandards to host a reunion, and that he and the woman who cleanshis cage would host the next family reunion in some place calledSeattle. I know that some of you will find this hard to believebut it is cold, hard fact. I can assure you that I had no part inthe transaction and I would have denied responsibility in anycase. The vote was made and carried entirely by the Alzheimer'scrowd, led by Margaret, whose mental state had apparently beenadversely affected by the long drive from New Mexico. Pete wentso far as to auction off fifteen pounds of perfectly goodhamburger rather than cart it up to Seattle for next year. Lunch wasn't quite enough for Richard and Pat. Laurence was there and spent some time telling me that heagreed with me wholeheartedly on legalizing drugs. "It istremendously important," he said, "that sick peoplehave a right to pain killers and anesthesia." Hedemonstrated the point by applying a liberal dose of anesthesiato himself. As many of you know, Laurence spent some time in the hospitalearlier this year and he says that, because of his emotionalcondition after Wilma's passing, the hospital staff labeled himas being under great stress and therefore allowed him to doanything he chose. "It was great," he said, "Icould cuss and scream and kick and rant and rave and piss on thefloor and they wouldn't do nothing. It was just like home."Despite his emotional stress he was on his best behavior, so mostof the time he actually left the crowd and went behind a trailerto relieve himself. When he was at least a couple of six packs into theconversation, he got into an argument with Dorothy aboutsomething to do with politics. I don't remember what it wasexactly, and I don't think you could have gotten a clearexplanation from either one of them. "Laurence, you are a stupid, ignorant, bigoted,illiterate, and disgusting idiot!" Dorothy told him. "So what's your point?" he asked. He is among thequicker of the Taylors. Louise Leard (my Aunt Polly) was there again. She said thatnothing much new has happened in her life, except that she has anew pair of stove lids for glasses. They look nice on her. Shesays that I should respect her more now that she is ahundred-and-something (or is it two hundred-and-something?) yearsold. I told her that if she had gotten to be that old she shouldstop expecting miracles. I am quite sure that some day Louisewill be just as old as she always wanted to be. Ruthie and Tom were there but Tom spent most of Saturday inthe trailer. Ruthie explained to me that he was laid up becauseof something that had happened between them the previous night.This was no great surprise to me and I would tell you what itwas, but there are some things that I prefer she didn't sharewith me. Ruthie spent the weekend burglarizing cars. James and Edna were there and Edna was sporting the latest inorthopedic appliances for her broken leg. She is doing betterthan anyone would have a right to expect after such an injury(she really did it good when she did it) although she passed up aperfectly good chance to get several cartons of pain-killers andother mind-altering drugs. She claims she likes it better thatway. Not me. I want morphine for paper cuts. Since the reunion there have been a number of interestingdevelopments on the drug legalization front. Judge James P. Grayand Joseph McNamara presented the resolution to Dr. Lee Brown,the current drug czar at a dinner meeting on August 4. The DrugPolicy Foundation in Washington has picked up the resolution as acause. They have already printed it once in their newsletter andwill soon print it again as a tear-out page that people can sendit to Clinton. Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein wrote a majorarticle about the resolution in the July 8 NY Times, it has beenon Nightline, in Newsweek, in High Times, and has received lotsof other media coverage. Dr. Dean Edell mentions the resolutionabout once a month on his radio show and Hugh Downs has done twoshows in which he has mentioned the resolution and quoteddirectly from the things I have written. (Oddly enough, he chosethe only facts in my little booklet which I cannot directlysupport with actual statistics. For example, he used my linethat, "More Colombians die from American tobacco than thenumber of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine." I don'thave any actual statistics for that one, although there is everyreason to believe it is true.) We have received literallythousands of signed resolutions from all over the world,including Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, England, and otherplaces. Unlike Bill Henry, David Taylor scrounged up the cash to makebail and came to the reunion. In one of the more interesting events, I appeared on the MoGaffney show (an Oprah-type talk show) against William Von Raab.Mr. Von Raab is the former Customs Commissioner under Reagan andBush and the father of the "Zero Tolerance" programwhere they confiscated millions of dollars worth of propertyunder the pretext that a marijuana seed was found. He quit theBush administration because he thought they were not tough enoughon drugs and has been one of the biggest campaigners for toughersentences and bigger prisons. James would love him. I had beenwaiting years to get somebody like him in front of an audiencewhere they could not run and could not hide. To make a long story short, I beat the snot out of him for anhour and he caved in and gave up. I did not even give him a breakduring the commercials. At the end of the hour he signed theresolution calling for an objective commission to rewrite ourdrug policy and admitted to me that he did not know anythingabout drugs and, therefore, was not qualified to speak on drugpolicy. He also told me that our previous Drug Czars, WilliamBennett and Bob Martinez, knew even less about drugs than he did,so there was no way they could have been qualified for theirjobs, either. (His words.) I do not believe that he will ever tryto speak out on this issue again. As a result of the resolution, on September 20, a bill wasintroduced into Congress, H.R. 3100, The National Drug ControlPolicy Act of 1993, by Representative Don Edwards of San Jose.This bill calls for a thirteen-member commission to review andrewrite our national drug policy, based on an objectiveevaluation of the evidence. Five members of the commission wouldbe appointed by the President, and four each by the Senate andthe House of Representatives. Currently elected or appointedgovernment officials would not be allowed as members of thecommission. The bill is being supported by the Drug PolicyFoundation, the National Organization for the Reform of MarijuanaLaws, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and others. I urgeeveryone to write to your elected officials and support H.R.3100. Anyway, I told you there is another reason why the reunionnews is coming out early this year. It is because David Leard hasput together the plans for the next reunion and, assumingeveryone agrees to it, it will be necessary to notify the placewhere it will be held by November, 1993. So you all have torespond fairly quickly to let him know. So here is David Leard's proposal for the next reunion,recited verbatim, with only minimal comments on my part. First, he wants to hold it at a place called the "IcicleRiver" in Washington. Pretty inviting, huh? Bring yourbathing suit and watch your body pucker. I guess he thinks thatis the only way he could top Becky after she invited the Morrisesto Mooney Grove. Here is what David had to say. Some corroboratingincriminating evidence is also enclosed. Because of the distance folks will have to travel, they won'tbe able to bring food as they normally do for the Californiareunions. That limited choices to places which could provide foodat reasonable cost, provide activities, have camping nearby andbe beautiful (not hot and dusty) We have chosen Mountain HomeLodge in Leavenworth, WA as the main location for lodging andmeals. There are many activities available here. Those who are driving or camping can plan on going straight tothe Lodge or rv/camping area described below. If you are flyinginto SEATAC airport, you will have to rent a car to drive toMountain Home Lodge. You will need a map of Washington. Detaileddirections to come later should there be enough interest. Mountain Home, Tel.(509) 548-7077, is a destination vacationlodge just outside Leavenworth, WA, approximately 2-2� hoursdrive from SEATAC and Seattle. We have arranged to have theentire lodge if we can book enough rooms in advance. Tentativelyplanned for weekend of Friday/Saturday, June 24, 25, Sundayoptional. We would have to reserve for Friday and Saturday nightsand anyone wishing more nights could do so. (rate sheet enclosed)The cost for entire lodge is $892 for lodging of 18 people, 24maximum. There are eight (8) rooms, each accommodating one tothree people. Rates range from $88 to $118 per night for twopeople. An addition person in a room is $15 more. A buffet dinneron Friday and Saturday would cost $15 per person, per night,Continental Breakfast is $3.50 ea. and big breakfast is $8.25.(Their continental breakfast is quite good and the regularbreakfast is more than ample). Lunch is $6.00; usually soup,sandwiches, lemonade, cookies. In order to guarantee that we are not sharing the loge, wehave to let them know by November. If we don't fill the lodge, wecould still use it as a base, but other guests would be therealso. That could mean younger children would not be allowed inmain lodge accommodations, but OK for day visits. i.e., childrenand pets normally not accepted at lodge. The accommodations aremuch better than average and the food is always good. The ownersare friendly and willing to work with us on the menu. Usuallydinner is BBQ salmon or steaks, done outside main lodge. Lots ofactivities, including: hiking, horseshoes, volleyball, tennis,swimming in the pool, and a hot tub located just off the largemain deck. Lots of things to do. There is the "best RV Park I have ever seen" just afew miles from the lodge. The Icicle River RV Park, 7305 IcicleRoad, Leavenworth, WA 98826. Tel. #(509) 548-5420 They are closedduring winter, open in April, a Good Sam Park, with 10% discountfor Good Sam members, AAA, Golden Age (62), and when taking 5unites or more, other discounts apply, please inquire ifinterested. Rates are: $22.50 per day for full hook up; $15.50per day for tent space. These rates apply to two people per unit.It's very clean, with facilities for laundry, showers, etc. Theyare the kind of place that fills early in the year, so makereservations as soon as possible. They do take reservationsduring the winter when closed. Keep trying if no answer. There is fishing right out your back door if you stay atIcicle River. It's a bit of a drive to Mountain Home from thepark, in the range of 20 -25 minutes because of the road toMountain Home. (A bit primitive, slow going, but it is kept ingood shape during most of summer. Can be muddy in spring if snowmelt is slow.) The Lodge will provide transportation to the Lodge from thebottom of Mountain Home Road, just outside Leavenworth, but theycharge a fee. In addition, if you are not staying at the Lodge,they charge a day use fee of $10 per person allowing access toall facilities at the lodge, this fee is reduced if you include ameal while there. We realize this is more expensive than reunions in the past.Although Margaret volunteered us, we accepted the challenge anddid our best. It was a difficult search because of the summerdemand for recreation and camping in this area. The close-inspots are taken years/months in advance or lease their bestfacilities by the month only and they are all taken. If thisdoesn't work for too many people, there is always the option ofreturning to somewhere in CA. We will be happy to follow throughwith the plan if the OK is given by enough folks to fill thelodge and others can stay in the camping area. Well, there you have it. This plan will probably require afair amount of decision-making so discuss it all among yourselvesand call David Leard Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | General and EntertainmentWT01-B38-74IA031-000655-B034-164http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/GENERAL/family10.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122111118 text/html 18334HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 11:11:07 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 06:30:50 GMTContent-length: 18116 Richardson-Taylor Reunion News February 13, 1994 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | General and Entertainment Richardson-Taylor Reunion News February 13, 1994 David "Bigfoot" Leard wrote to me with a reunionupdate, so I thought I would pass it along. As you all may know, there was something of an earthquake downhere. Some people said it was God's reaction to the thought thatLaurence might reproduce but I take a more charitable view. Thatbig freeway overpass that collapsed that you saw on TV is aboutfive miles from where I live, and I go over that exact stretch ofroad every morning on the way to work. It woke us up (to be sure,it woke us up) at 4:30. The whole house was flying around and allthe lights were out, except for the flashes of the explosions inthe distance. We crawled over the junk to get out of our bedroomand located the kids and they were OK, except that Serena hadgotten buried by falling furniture but was none the worst forwear. Bonnie evidently got hit in the shoulder by a falling lamp.That is all we can figure anyway, because she did not notice itat the time and did not even report any pain until several hourslater. When these things happens, all the best laid plans go rightout the window. We had bought rechargeable flashlights for yearsand had them all over the house most of the time, in addition tonumerous regular flashlights of various types and sizes. In thefirst two hours we could not find any of them. After that, thesun was up. Luckily, however, we did happen to have adequatesupplies of food and drinkable water to last through the next fewdays. There were no utilities at all for about 24 hours, then wegot electricity, and two days later we got running water, but hadto boil it or put bleach in it to drink it for about three weeks.There were people passing out free bottled water all over theplace and the Miller beer company even bottled up a bunch ofwater in beer bottles and passed it out, two cases for eachperson, for free. There was a lot of damage to nearly everything. The roads werebuckled all over the place, and some had inch-wide cracks which Itracked for more than a mile. Water was seeping up through thepavement from the broken water mains and most of the concreteblock walls I saw had fallen down. There were several buildingsaround which suffered severe structural damage and there werethree people that Bonnie works with whose homes were destroyed. Basically, the whole house was trashed. All of the bookcases,entertainment centers, and cabinets in the house fell over. Thechina cabinet fell on the dining room table and pulverized ourcrystal, china, and miscellaneous other collectibles. Everytelevision in the house was face down on the floor and we lost afew VCRs and other appliances. We found out later that the fault ran from Northridge, rightup through the center of Santa Clarita and broke the surface justa little north of us. Considering the size of the quake and itsproximity to us we were pretty lucky. The freeway which collapsed was, of course, the only majorroad into Los Angeles, so that means, naturally, that there arehuge traffic jams at that point nearly all day long because theyhave to steer all that freeway traffic through a bunch of oldsurface roads. (Not real good planning, guys!) As a result,thousands of people who never would have dreamed of taking thebrand-new Metrolink commuter train are now taking it every day.As fate would have, among this crowd was my eldest daughterAlyssa. As a result of the earthquake, Alyssa was on nationaltelevision twice in the same day. The second time was when shegot back to the train depot in Santa Clarita on her way home.When she got off the train, she saw a Channel 7 KABC televisioncrew and recognized the cameraman as a guy who lives just downthe street from us. They interviewed her about the quake (One ofthose typical news interviews -- "You have just seen halfyour town destroyed in a few seconds -- how do you feel?")and what she was doing to solve her commuting problems. Theinterview wound up on the national news feed and was shown allover the US. But that wasn't the good one. It seems that, earlier in the day, Alyssa had been waiting onthe train platform in Burbank and there was a KNBC Channel 4 crewdown there doing a live remote. KNBC was showing the world howall these people were now crowding into the trains and all therest. While this was going on, the train people started makingannouncements to the crowd to tell them to move in back of theyellow line, because the training was coming. Alyssa said thetelevision lights were in everybody's eyes so they could notwhere the yellow line was. So she turned to the cameraman andasked him, "Would you please turn down the lights or pointthem in another direction? Because we can't see where the yellowline is." The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa tapped him on theshoulder (she said he was about 6-2, she says she is a full fivefeet) and said, "Could you please turn down the lights orpoint them in another direction? We can't see the yellowline." The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa stuck her hand infront of the lens and said, a little louder this time,"Would you please turn down the lights or point them inanother direction?" At that point, the cameraman grabbed her hand and twisted itaway rather roughly which hurt her, so Alyssa gave him a fewchoice words but the crowd held her back from an all-out assault.A few minutes later, the camera crew and the dippy newscasterwere looking around for someone to interview and they walked overto Alyssa to interview her. Alyssa was pissed. "You want to interview something?," she said,"Why don't you interview this finger you almost broke?"And she presented it to them -- on live television. That's mylittle lady. The earthquake was quite a shaker but equally unnerving is thefact that ever since the big one we have had other earthquakes, 3to 5 pointers, several times a day. For the first few days wewere having them every five or ten minutes around the clock. Itmade it difficult to sleep because every time you would doze offanother one would come rolling around. It is slowing down latelythough. I can only recall a couple of earthquakes today. The roads were out, the utilities were out, and the phoneswere out so there was nothing left to do but party. A bunch ofSerena's friends came over because our house was in better shapethan their condo and they did not want to be in their condo whilethe rock and roll continued. So we all broke out just abouteverything drinkable, and barbecued all the fish and meat that wethought would spoil and partied hardy for a couple of days. Itwas a major inconvenience to be sure, but we'll make it. Anyway, David sent me a letter, reproduced below, which laysout most of his latest information on the reunion. David alwaystypes his letters on a computer, which makes them very neat. Heis different from Becky who is liable to write her letters acrossthe face of Ed McMahon to save paper, or Pete who has Sandy writehis letters so there will be no spelling errors, or Joanne, who .. . . well, we won't talk about Joanne's letters. Here's the latest on reunion bookings at Mountain Home Lodge.The Lodge's reservations have gone very well. The rooms at theLodge were all booked by January 3. I called them and arranged toalso use one of the owner's cabins. (They call it a cabin, it'sreally much more than a cabin.) There were four additional roomsavailable, now only three. Bud Richardson reserved one of therooms on January 4. If all the rooms at the cabin are taken, I have the names of aB&B and two motels in Leavenworth, WA "Run of the River", a Bed and Breakfast, just southof town, views of the river. 1-800-288-6491. Ritterhauf, Motel, 55 Units, lower cost, with kitchens in some1-800-255-5845 Leavenworth Village Inn, newer place, a little more expensivethat Ritterhauf. 1-800-343-8198. There are other motels in and around Leavenworth, I don't havespecific information on them. I have no new information on thecampground reservations of how they are going. But, thiscampground is really not any more expensive than others used inthe past that were in resort areas. The Icicle River RV Park,7305 Icicle Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826 (509) 548-5420 Now that the Lodge is filled (and possibly the extra cabin), Iam negotiating with the owners next week (January 15) toeliminate the day-use fees for family members who will be eatinglunch and/or dinner at the lodge. Drive your own vehicles to theLodge and save another few dollars. This will keep the costsdown. In addition, those folks who are flying up to the area, maybe able to share rental car expense by meeting at SEATAC Airportand driving together to the lodge. There is also the option ofsharing room(s) at the Lodge or the cabin. Another options ishelping out those who are have special financial difficultieswith money from the Reunion Kitty and any contributions fromthose willing to part with a dollar or two. Kids will be welcomenow that we have booked the entire lodge. Kids will be welcome as long as they are kept on chains. This reunion is a little different from past versions andproving to be more popular than first thought. Give it a try. Butmove quickly, the accommodations are going fast. After the letter came I got a call from Michael who said thatDavid had more news so I called him. When I first called he saidhe couldn't talk right then because Pat had broken her foot whiletrying escape back to her people and he had to go drag her backinto the house before the neighbors saw her, or something likethat. When he called back he told me this tremendously long taleabout how he was out of work because there had been a lot ofsecurities fraud, and embezzlement, and a couple of liquor storestick-ups by employees of the firm and the whole thing had beenshut down by various vice squads. He assured me that he did notsteal near as much as the other employees and, therefore,expected to be able to plea bargain his way out of it. As usual,I wish him the best and I will attempt to protect his rapidlydeteriorating reputation at every opportunity. Then he told me that Pete had sent him an ungodly sum of moneywhich was left over from the hamburger sales at the previousreunion. He asked me to tell everyone that being poor anddestitute and generally socially undesirable should be noimpediment to attending the reunion. He said that money isavailable to help out those who need it. Those who need helpshould just ask, he said. I immediately made a suggestion as tohow this money could be most constructively used but David,thick-headed as he is, did not go for it. He said also that, because the other paying customers hadcanceled all their reservations when they heard that we werecoming, the day use fee has been eliminated, and children will begranted free run of the facilities, including the deer-huntingrange next door. For those who have too much common decency too stay with therest of the group, David said that he had discovered a KOAcampground half a mile or so away from the road to the lodge, anda pretty dumpy RV place at the bottom of the hill. He alsomentioned the Linderhof motel and the Icicle Inn, a particularlyinviting place, just from its name alone. He says that thecampgrounds are going pretty fast up there so you better makeyour reservations fast or you will be sleeping by the side of theroad as usual. And now a spot of news for the drug legalizers among you. Youwill be pleased to know that our Resolution has recently receivedendorsements from, among others, the LA Times, the Mayor ofMinneapolis, the President of the Detroit City Council, a Senatorfrom Colombia, the entire staff of the San Bernardino CountyProbation Department, the entire staff of the Harbor/UCLA MedicalCenter, the Berkeley City Council, and every District Attorney inRotterdam, The Netherlands, just to name a few. Judge Gray and I have made numerous appearances on radio andtelevision down here and we almost never get even a singleopposing phone call. In fact, one of Judge Gray's appearances onradio brought so many favorable letters that the station decidedto run it again. Two weeks ago we appeared together on a TV talkshow in Palmdale. Prior to the show the producers had arrangedfor representatives of the Drug Enforcement Administration, theDistrict Attorney, and the Sheriff to come on the show and takethe other side. The morning of the show the producers got phonecalls from each of the groups and, when they heard who was goingto be on against them, they all suddenly remembered that they hadconflicting appointments, or could not find a baby-sitter, orsomething. The real problem, of course, is that they have beengetting the snot beat out of them every time they showed up. As aresult, the judge and I had about two hours of free TV air timeto say what we wanted. They did manage to find a drug abusecounselor to oppose us, but he wound up agreeing with us andvolunteered to help with the Resolution. The major national drug policy organizations such as the DrugPolicy Foundation, NORML, and various other groups are beginningto see the wisdom in our strategy and have adopted the proposalsI have outlined as their primary strategy. If you were readingthe news lately, you know that Surgeon-General Joycelyn Eldersstated that the issue of drug legalization should be studied.This remark was a direct result of our Resolution. You may notknow that, in a later interview she referred to some things I hadwritten (which someone else had sent her) and said that she hadread some of the research on the subject and was more convincedthan ever that legalization should be seriously considered. Youmay expect to hear more from her on this subject in the nearfuture. H.R. 3100, the bill which calls for a 13-member Federalcommission to study drug policy is alive and well and gainingsponsors in Congress. Basically, the bill calls for a panel ofthirteen people to be appointed, five by the President and foureach by the Senate and House. The panel is supposed to hear allof the relevant evidence on drug policy and make a report on thefindings within eighteen months. This is an intelligent,reasonable approach to solving the drug problem and I hopeeveryone will write to their Senators and Representatives and askthem to support this bill. We are also producing a television show for local access cableTV. I don't know if you know it or not, but if you have atelevision show that you think ought to be aired, the cable TVcompanies are required to show it at no cost to you. (Providedthe content is not obscene, etc.) As a result, we have people allover the country showing these shows on television. One of the most interesting shows is on the history ofmarijuana. It includes a United States Department of Agriculturefilm called "Hemp for Victory." The film was made in1942 and encourages farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) because theUS Navy literally could not sail without it. It was so vital tothe US military during World War II that farmers who grew hempwere exempted from military duty. Prior to 1937, marijuana wasgrown throughout the United States in industrial quantities. Itwas the primary source of durable cloth such as the sixty tons ofsail and ropes carried by the average large sailing ship, or thecanvas which covered the Conestoga wagons of the pioneers. It wasalso the primary source of oil-based fuels, paints, and otherproducts. "Hemp for Victory" really makes people wonderhow it came to be illegal in the first place. That's it for now. Call David if you have any questions.

I did not attend the last reunion inWashington myself and I understand that the turnout was lowerthan any time in recent memory, primarily because of a persistentrumor that Bill Henry would show up. He did not show up, to thegreat relief of everyone in the family and Washington's farmanimals, too. Laurence is the organizer of the 1995 reunion andsays that he has taken steps to have guards posted to preventBill Henry from showing up. Therefore, he says, we will not haveto worry about Bill Henry's ugly mug spoiling any of the grouppictures. He probably would have spent most of his time doing theMorris Moon anyway. Laurence, as you all know, is now a married man which justgoes to prove that the laws against such things are nottremendously effective. He wrote me to tell me that he had beenlaid up recently due to a heart bypass operation (apparently thedoctors found that his heart served no useful purpose) and anoperation for a blood clot in his leg. Both of these problems, hesaid, were the result of what could be politely described as anoverly strenuous honeymoon, which he related at great length, andwas obviously confused with some things which actually happenedin high school. Men really don't need drugs because they havewomen. Barbara, his bride tells a somewhat different story, withconsiderably fewer disgusting details. In any event, he says thathe is recovering nicely now and will be just as gross anddisgusting as we all have gotten used to, and even come tocherish. Like Don Morris, he is something of a gem in his ownright. I have not been in touch with many of you so I cannot relate alot of news about other people. I can assure you it is a greatrelief. However, on my own front, some significant things havehappened. As far as my campaign to get our drug laws changed,there has been more success than we had dared hope. Far too muchhas happened, even in the last six months, for me to relate itall so I will stick to some of the highlights. Both the California Medical Association and the Department of Health and Human Services have issued major reports stating that the undertreatment of pain in the United States is a major national tragedy. They said that narcotics such as morphine are the cheapest, safest, and most effective treatments for pain and the reason doctors do not prescribe them is because they are afraid of prosecution if they do. Both organizations recommended that narcotics be used as soon as the patients request them and that patients be allowed to control their own dose. They both said that the risk of addiction is so small that it is of no practical concern. As the Department of Health and Human Services said, "Addiction (as the result of medical use of narcotics) almost never happens." The head of Interpol, the British Association of Chiefs of Police, the Attorney-General of Colombia, and many other major law enforcement officials have called for either decriminalization or legalization of drugs and it is apparent that several law enforcement officials and organizations are now mounting a major push to get drugs decriminalized in all of Europe. There have been two TV specials and several radio shows in the last six months which were based at least in part on the things I have written, one by MTV which aired in September, and another by the BBC titled "The Drug War, R.I.P.", which aired on the Arts and Entertainment Channel in September. There will also be a one-hour television special coming up on ABC which, I understand, will be based largely on the points I have made and taught others to make. Our campaign for a Federal commission to review drug policy has been successful. Language establishing such a commission was included in the recent Crime Bill, which everyone made such a fuss about. In all the hullabaloo about banning guns, Representative Don Edwards of San Jose was able to slip the language in during the Conference Committee and it went unnoticed in the final vote, even though a number of members of Congress had said they were deadset against it. The commission is due to start its work in 1996 and is supposed to issue its report by 1998. A couple of years ago I published a pamphlet I called Persuasive Strategies. The purpose of it was to teach anyone how to beat the snot out of drug warriors in a debate and do it so completely that there would be no question in anyone's mind who won the debate. These strategies were probably the primary reason for the success of all the things we have done. A lot of other people saw them, liked them, and started using them, including a lot of fairly famous people. As a result, The Drug Enforcement Administration and their allies have found that they have been getting their butts kicked every time they showed up to discuss the subject in public -- all across the nation. They called an emergency meeting in August, calling in drug warriors from all across the country to discuss what to do about it. It must have been an interesting meeting. I can just imagine the conversation, "I got my butt kicked in LA." "I got my butt kicked in Buffalo", "I got my ass kicked in Albuquerque" and so forth. Unfortunately, they did not invite me or I could have given them a few tips myself. In order to try to combat what I have been doing they have issued a 40 page booklet called "How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate" which attempts to train their people how to debate people who are using my tactics. They even lifted paragraphs from my pamphlet and slightly altered the wording. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I thought one paragraph from their booklet was particularly flattering: Legalization proponents are formidable opponents. The groupacknowledged that proponents of legalization are generallywell-prepared and credible people whose arguments, thoughcompelling, are faulty. Proponents effectively use lawyers andpublic relations firms to espouse liberalization of drugpolicies. Shortly after their booklet was published I got a call from apublisher asking me to do a book in reply to theirs, which youshould see in the bookstores next year. But enough about politics. Now we will go on to the sordiddetails of the next reunion.

A few years ago my niece turned her father in for pot afterbeing interrogated by DARE officers in the principle' s office ather school in a very small town. My niece claims they told herthat her parents had a crack problem. She claims all she said was that she knew herparents smoked pot in college and once she thought she smelled itat home. Being a small town ... they ran out and got a searchwarrant and searched their home and their two adjoining homebusinesses a beauty salon and a green house/nursery. Afterripping apart their home and businesses they found nothing! But the trauma of being told their daughter turned them infor crack and having their home torn apart with about 6 officersin front of their neighbors has about destroyed that family andtheir businesses.

Calhoun. Ph.D. Historian Federal Law Enforcement Training Center This is Appendix G from the David Koresh Investigation. It isincluded because it contains interesting information on thebackground of Federal law enforcement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is arelatively young law enforcement organization, having beencreated formally in 1972. Yet, measured by the federal lawsrelated to the regulation and taxing of alcohol, tobacco, andfirearms-the laws ATF now enforces-the history of the bureau'sduties and responsibilities stretches across the full twocenturies of American history. As early as 1791, revenue actstaxed both alcohol and tobacco and created the offices of taxinspector, collector, and supervisor. During the next century,the offices changed names as frequently as the tax rates changed,but the federal interest in raising revenues from alcohol andtobacco remained strong. Indeed, the formal organization of anindependent bureau within the Department of Treasury specializingin alcohol, tobacco, and firearms law enforcement belatedlyrecognized the distinct need for such an agency. After the Civil War, revenue agents battled moonshinersthroughout the South in some of the bloodiest opposition ever tofederal law enforcement. Revenue agents and deputy U.S. marshalsby the score were killed as they roamed the hills and hollowssearching out illicit stills. Prohibition changed thegovernment's focus from taxing whiskey to banning it, yet therevenue agent's job remained as dangerous. After experimenting insocial adjustment a dozen years, Prohibition was rescinded.Spawned by the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, the Alcohol Tax Unitwas established as a tax-collecting branch within the InternalRevenue Service (IRS). Continued concern over the violent,organized mobs that plagued the major cities compelled thefederal government to try to curb the gangsters' ability to armthemselves. Rather than ban outright the purchase of machine gunsand sawed-off shotguns-the weapons of choice for themobsters-Congress in 1934 simply imposed a tax those weapons.Paying the tax required registering the weapon. The registrationrequirement was intended to discourage ownership of such weaponswithout outlawing them. No self-respecting gangster would want toregister, much less pay the tax, on his Tommygun. Their evasionof the tax gave the government another legal tool to use inarresting the gangsters and breaking up the mobs. Because it was a tax rather than a prohibition, it fell toTreasury to enforce the law as part of Treasury's role incollecting all funds due the government. Within Treasury, theAlcohol Tax Unit seemed the logical branch to enforce the newlaw. Registering and taxing stills required many of the sameprocedures and investigatory talents that would be needed toregister and tax weapons. In the end, the new assignment provedcomparatively easy. The unit was not overwhelmed withregistrations nor by the 1940s were the investigations intoevasions of the tax very time-consuming. As the gangstersdeclined in number and power, so did their use of machine gunsand sawed-off shotguns. Enforcing the alcohol taxes againoccupied most of the unit's attention. In 1951, the Alcohol Tax Unit began enforcing federal taxes ontobacco, thus prompting a name change in 1952 to the Alcohol andTobacco Tax Division. Once again, the logic seemed to be thatcollecting the tax on tobacco closely resembled the worknecessary to collect the tax on alcohol, machine guns, andsawed-off shotguns. The 1968 passage of the Omnibus Crime Controland Safe Streets Act and the Gun Control Act expanded the IRSunit's jurisdiction to the criminal use of explosives and bombs.The new laws also defined specific federal offenses involvingfirearms, including transportation across state lines and use inorganized crimes. In recognition of this new enforcementresponsibility, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division changed itsname to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division (ATFD). Twoyears later, Congress passed the Explosives Control Act definingcertain bombings and acts of arson as federal crimes. It assignedjurisdiction for enforcing this new law to ATFD. With theseexpanded responsibilities. the Treasury Department on July 1,1972 created the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms underthe general oversight of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasuryfor Enforcement, Tariffs and Trade, and Operations. For the pasttwenty-one years, ATF has enforced the collection of federaltaxes on alcohol and tobacco and the federal controls andregulations on firearms, with particular attention to their useby criminals. Although on its face the bureau seems a discordant collectionof separate duties, the techniques for enforcing the taxes andferreting out the illicit products, whether cases of whiskey,cartons of cigarettes, crates of automatic weapons, or containersof bombs, are strikingly similar. Subsequent laws have expanded ATF's jurisdiction. The 1976Arms Export Control Act focused the Bureau's attention oninternational gun smuggling. The 1982 Anti-Arson Act gave ATFauthority to investigate the destruction of property by fire aswell as by explosives. Increased taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,and enhanced regulatory measures such as the 1978 ContrabandCigarette Act, have also enhanced the bureau's responsibility toensure the government receives its lawful taxes. The bureau has been an effective force in law enforcement.Supplies of illicit alcohol and smuggled tobacco have steadilydecreased, and tax revenues have risen. During 1991, for example,ATF collected $7.7 billion in alcohol taxes and $4.8 billion intobacco taxes. ATF agents have also focused on tracking downarmed career criminals and criminal gang members. Investigationsin Florida resulted in the arrest of 45 Warlock motorcycle gangmembers in 1991. Members of the Gullymen Posse, a gang ofJamaican drug dealers known for its propensity to commit murder,were arrested in New York by ATF agents in January 1991.Similarly, an ATF investigation into the activities of the Bornto Kill gang culminated in the arrest of a dozen gang members inAugust 1991. Sixteen members of the San Diego chapter of theHells Angels were convicted in 1992. As a result of these andsimilar investigations, ATF has become the nation's principalrepository for gang-related information and intelligence. The bureau has also earned an excellent reputation for workingwell with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. ATFagents also specialize in identifying anonymous bombers by their"signature" habits in making bombs. For example, in1990, the assassin of Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals JudgeRobert Vance was ultimately identified by ATF agents whorecognized the way the bomb was constructed. Similarly, in themidst of the tragedy in Waco, Texas, ATF agents investigating theWorld Trade Center bombing helped to identify the van that wasused to hold the bomb. This early identification led FBI agentsto the rental car company and thereafter to arrests of theterrorists before they could escape the country. The bureau has developed considerable expertise in arsoninvestigations. At the request of the National Fire ProtectionAgency, ATF began developing nationwide standards for fireinvestigators. The State Department's Diplomatic Security Serviceinvited ATF to develop a protocol establishing an InternationalResponse Team of investigators trained to search blast scenesinvolving U.S. property abroad. Despite a rather eclectic arrayof duties, ATF has succeeded in developing considerable expertisein each area of its enforcement responsibilities. The raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compoundresulted from its enforcement of contemporary federal firearmslaws. In a larger sense, however, the raid fit within anhistoric, well-established and well-defended government interestin prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that soughtto arm or fortify themselves. The 1934 law taxing weapons wasonly the first time the federal government addressed privateownership of weapons; it was not the first federal effort tocontrol firearms. From its earliest formation, the federalgovernment has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled orrebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, howeversmall the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition.The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against thegovernment itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federalagents who tried to disband the groups frequently became thetargets. The discomfort over armed organizations predated theConstitution. The outbreak of what became known as Shays' Rebellion in 1786gave added urgency to the establishment of a strong nationalgovernment. During the rebellion, hundreds of angry Massachusettsfarmers, most veterans of the Revolution and facing foreclosureson their farms, banded together to keep the courts from issuingany executions. Calling themselves Regulators, the farmersquickly organized into a small army. Significantly, their firstforay was to capture the arsenal at Springfield. Although theRegulators failed, the specter survived. Five months, delegatesfrom each of the thirteen states met in Philadelphia to design anew experiment in government. The lesson of Shays' Rebellion was not forgotten, even afterthe new government was formed. In 1792, Congress passed a lawempowering the president to call out the state militias tosuppress insurrections if either an associate justice of theSupreme Court or a local district court judge certified thatopposition to the laws was beyond the powers of the civilauthority to suppress. Ironically, the first occasion to resortto that law grew out of the violent, organized, and armedresistance to the federal government's whiskey tax. Thus, two ofthe duties that ATF would later inherent-enforcing alcohol taxesand controlling firearms-combusted in 1794 into the WhiskeyRebellion, the first violent opposition to the new federalgovernment.[1] Across the next century, succeeding presidents had sporadic,though no less fearsome, occasion to dispatch the Army and thestate militias to suppress various outbreaks of armed oppositionto federal laws, taxes. and interests. In 1799, Fries Rebellionagainst a federal tax on houses forced President John Adams tomuster the militia. Fugitive slave rescues during the 1850sprompted the government to call out the military. Organizedresistance in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, andWisconsin raised a troublesome specter. "The mainopposition," President Millard Fillmore warned Congress inDecember 1851, "is aimed against the Constitutionitself." At the end of the decade, John Brown's ill-fatedraid on Harper's Ferry,. Virginia, sparked the government todecisive action. Brown chose Harper's Ferry because of thefederal arsenal there. His intent was to distribute the weaponsamong Southern slaves and lead them in revolt for their freedom.Federal troops, however, thwarted the plan.[2] After the Civil War, the federal government battledunrepentant Southerners to protect the rights of the freedmen.Nonetheless. federal officials acted only after the innumerableKlan-style attacks were finally perceived as organized."Outrages of various descriptions." Attorney GeneralGeorge Williams advised southern U.S. Attorneys and Marshals in1874. "and in some cases atrocious murders have beencommitted in your district by bodies of armed men. sometimes indisguise and with the view it is believed of overawing andintimidating peaceable and law abiding citizens and deprivingthem of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution andlaws of the United States." The attorney general ordered hisattorneys and marshals "to detect, expose. arrest, andpunish the perpetrators of these crimes."[3] Throughout the western territories and along the Mexicanborder, the federal government found occasional need to suppressarmed bands of outlaws, ganged together to steal cattle or robthe mails. General William Tecumseh Sherman. sent to the Arizonaborder in April 1882 to investigate the outlaw troubles there,advised President Chester A. Arthur that "the Civil Officershave not sufficient forces to make arrests, to hold prisoners fortrial or punish when convicted." The President promptlyproclaimed on May 31 that the areas plagued by the outlaws werein a state of rebellion.[4] The federal government looked no more kindly on the laborstrikes that broke out in the closing years of the nineteenthcentury and the opening years of the twentieth. What seemed sodangerous about events such as the 1894 Pullman strike was notjust the disruption of he mails, which was the legal basis onwhich the government relied to break the strike, but the factthat the mails were being violently disrupted by organizedgroups. "We have been brought to the ragged edge ofanarchy," Attorney General Richard Olney franticallyexplained when he ordered that the trains be kept running.Eventually, Eugene Debs and his colleagues in the AmericanRailway Union, which took the lead in the strike, were indictedand convicted. Once again, it was the volatile mixture ofviolence and organization-combinations determined difficult tosuppress-that evoked the full power of the federal government.[5] The passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, the firstfederal effort to control private ownership of firearms, grew outof this historic fear of armed organizations. The variouscollections of gangsters that proliferated during Prohibitionwere the true targets of the law, which required a tax andregistration on the sale of their weapons of choice-machine gunsand sawed-off shotguns. Subsequent federal firearms laws havebeen of a piece. Oher than the 1968 ban on mail-order sales,which was in direct, though delayed, response to theassassination of President Kennedy, federal gun laws havetypically been concerned with the weapons of considerabledestructive power generally preferred by organized groups-bombs,machine guns, and automatic weapons. In recent times, the federal government has shown itself evenless patient with armed groups than it had historically. Radicalextremists of both the Right and the Left have been pursuedaggressively once they began breaking the law. For instance,after the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) launched itsself-styled "people's war" by kidnapping newspaperheiress Patty Hearst and committing a number of daring bankrobberies, the federal government dedicated its full resources totracking the group down. Within approximately three months, FBIagents and Los Angeles police closed in on the group at a housejust outside what was then known as Watts. During an intense gunbattle and fire, every member of the SLA in the house waskilled.[6] Gordon Kahl, who stood at the opposite end of the politicalspectrum from the SLA, met a similar end. Kahl belonged to thePosse Comitatus which refused to recognize the authority of anygovernment above the county level. Accordingly, Kahl consistentlyrefused to pay his federal taxes, even after he served time inprison for not doing so. When U.S. Marshals attempted to arresthim for violating the terms of his probation, Kahl killed two ofthem. For the next five months, Kahl hid among his friends andsympathizers until FBI agents located him in a farmhouse justoutside Smithville, Arkansas. After refusing to surrender, Kahlwas killed, and the farmhouse was burned down.[7] Robert Matthews, the head of a group of right-wing fanaticsknown as the Order, embraced many of Kahl's beliefs. Unlike Kahl,whose resistance was essentially passive until the marshals triedto arrest him, Matthews and the Order launched an aggressiveprivate war against the country. Like the SLA, the Ordercommitted a series of bank and armored car robberies, netting$3.6 million in one heist alone. The Order also assassinated AlanBerg, a radio talk show host in Denver, Colorado. The FBI began an equally aggressive pursuit. After a brief,violent skirmish in Idaho and another in Portland, Oregon, FBIagents finally closed in on Matthews hiding out among threeadjoining houses on Whidbey Island, some fifty miles north ofSeattle. After ngotiating his surrender for two days, Matthewsbegan firing on an FBI Hostage Response Team that attempted toenter the house. Protected by a full suit( of body armor,Matthews ran from the first floor to the second floor firingautomatic weapons. The FBI dropped a magnesium flare from ahelicopter. The flare landed on the roof of the house and burnedthrough it to the room where Matthews had stored his ammunitionand explosives. These ignited, setting off a roaring, explodingfire that consumed Matthews.[8] A year later, in the spring of 1985. ATF collectedconsiderable evidence that an 80-member group styling itself theCovenant of the Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) hadstockpiled a large arsenal at its fortified compound in Arkansas.The group had collected over 150 firearms, (including 35 machineguns), two anti-personnel mines, three anti-aircraft rockets, 50pounds of military plastic explosives, 300 blasting caps, 2,000feet of detonating cord, and around 100 explosive devices. CSAhad also stockpiled food, water, and supplies. TF led the assaulton the CSA compound on April 20, 1985. CSA members retreatedfarther into the compound, barricading themselves behind theirdefenses. The agents set up a siege perimeter and settled in towait. The group used the wait to destroy many of the weapons (andhence evidence) illegally obtained. Negotiators from the FBIarrived and began the tedious, frustrating process of talking thegroup out. Three days later, on April 22, 1985, James D. Ellisonand the 75 members of the CSA surrendered.[9] As both history and recent events clearly show, the UnitedStates has never tolerated armed groups residing within itsborders. The intent of the particular organization, whetherideological or criminal, mattered little. If the group wasbuilding an illegal arsenal, the group was subject to a federalenforcement action. To this day, ATF's enforcement focus retainsthe flavor of that historic concern with armed organizations. Theagency has developed considerable expertise and success ininvestigating the activities of motorcycle, street, and druggangs, all of which share in common a proclivity to amass largearsenals of powerful weapons. The raid on the Branch Davidiancompound occurred in the context of that historical background.

Roth Series: Research in Brief, US Dept. of Justice Published: February 1994 19 pages Issues and Findings Discussed in the Research in Brief: The current status ofresearch on the links connecting violence to alcohol and illegalpsychoactive drugs, and evaluations of interventions to preventviolence related to these substances. Key issues: Correlations between violence and psychoactivesubstances; the social, economic, cultural, psycho-social,neurobehavioral, and other factors that explain the correlations;and prevention strategies for reducing the violence associatedwith these substances. Key findings: Research has uncovered strong correlations between violence and psycho-active substances, including alcohol and illegal drugs, but the underlying relationships differ by type of drug. The links between violence and psychoactive substances involve broad social and economic forces, the settings in which people obtain and consume the substances, and biological processes that underlie all human behavior. These factors interact in chains of events that may extend back from an intermediate triggering event such as an argument to long-term predisposing processes that begin in childhood. Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase aggression. After large doses of amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, and PCP, certain individuals may experience violent outbursts, probably because of preexisting psychosis. Research is needed on the pharmacological effects of crack, which enters the brain more directly than cocaine used in other forms. Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. The most promising strategies for reducing alcohol-related violence are to reduce underage drinking through substance abuse preventive education, taxes, law enforcement, and peer pressure. Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors, arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers, property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more speculatively, social and economic interactions between the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. The most promising strategy for reducing violence related to illegal drugs appears to be reducing the demand that fuels violent illegal markets. Promising tactics include preventive education, pretrial monitoring of arrestees through urinalysis and, for convicted violent offenders, in-prison therapeutic communities integrated with postrelease treatment followup. In the future, medications may reduce violence by reducing cocaine craving and by blocking the aggression-promoting effects of opiate withdrawal and alcohol consumption. Target audience: State and local policymakers, courtadministrators, law enforcement and juvenile justicepractitioners, and drug treatment program staff. As noted by the Panel on the Understanding and Control ofViolent Behavior, the character of violence presents simultaneouschallenges to understanding and opportunities for prevention.First, violence is diverse. Acts as different as spontaneousdrive-by shootings and met-iculously planned serial killings, forexample, are both included in the legal and statistical categoryof murder. Second, the causes of violence are complex, involvinga very wide variety of factors. The panel found it useful toclassify these factors in terms of four levels of analysis atwhich they are usually studied: Broad social and economic forces (macrosocial). Encounters between people in particular settings (microsocial). Individual behavioral development from childhood through adulthood (psychosocial). Neurobehavioral and other biological processes that underlie all human behavior (neurobehavioral). Factors at these four levels operate and interact in chainsof events that may begin long before the violent event thatresults. Therefore, the panel's classification framework alsocategorized causal factors in terms of their temporal proximityto the violent event itself: from the immediate triggeringmechanism (for example, a response to an insult), back throughthe situation that led up to the triggering event, topredisposing factors that months or years earlier increased therisk of a future violent event. This diversity and complexity might at first glance seem todiscourage efforts to prevent violence. In fact, however, theycreate promising opportunities. Merely acknowledging thediversity breaks the overall "violence problem" intoseparate problems that may be preventable through interventionsby different public agencies. Recognizing the causal complexityexpands the list of options for preventing a particular violenceproblem by highlighting all the points at which chains of eventsleading to it may be breakable. Problem-solvinginitiatives--programs that involve design and evaluation ofpreventive interventions at various links in these chains ofevents, that revise these interventions in light of theevaluation findings, and that replicate the evaluations--have thepotential to simultaneously reduce violence and increase theunderstanding of its causes. Many chains of causal events for violence include links toalcohol or to illegal psychoactive drugs. The panel found theselinks worth exploring in depth for at least three reasons. First,statistics consistently demonstrate correlations between violentevents and involvement with alcohol and other psychoactive drugs.Second, the variety of potential causal links between violenceand different psychoactive substances--alcohol, opiates, cocainein smokable and powdered form, amphetamines, hallucinogens, andother illegal drugs--presents an especially rich example of thepanel's classification framework. Third, preliminary evidencefrom research and evaluations suggests that certain interventionsrelated to psychoactive substances should be considered indeveloping strategies for controlling violence. Correlations between violence and psychoactive substances Research supported by the National Institute of Justice andother organizations has repeatedly found strong correlationsbetween violence and psychoactive substances: For at least the last several decades, alcohol drinking--by the perpetrator of a crime, the victim, or both--has immediately preceded at least half of all violent events, including murders, in the samples studied by researchers. Chronic drinkers are more likely than other people to have histories of violent behavior. Criminals who use illegal drugs1 commit robberies and assaults more frequently than do nonuser criminals, and they commit them especially frequently during periods of heavy drug use. In a study of New York City murders in 1988, researchers classified more than half the homicides (53 percent) as drug-related: 39 percent in the course of drug distribution, 8 percent through pharmacological effects on the offender, 2 percent while the offender was obtaining money to buy drugs, and 4 percent through more than one of these links.2 Data from the National Institute of Justice Drug UseForecasting (DUF) program, which tests for drug use among bookedarrestees in 24 sites nationwide, showed the following patternsin 1989: Most males and females who were interviewed after arrest for a violent crime reported drinking alcohol within 72 hours before the crime for which they were arrested. About 60 percent of arrestees booked for violent crimes were confirmed by laboratory test to have used at least one illegal drug3 in the hours before arrest. Explaining the correlations While these statistical patterns strongly suggest thatpsychoactive substances play significant roles in acts ofviolence, they do not explain the nature of those relationships.In trying to sort out links between violence and psychoactivesubstances, the panel categorized potential links in terms of thefour levels noted above: o Social and economic forces (macrosocial): Processes that affect large social units such as nations orcommunities. Examples include cultural practices related toalcohol use and, in the United States, economic and socialprocesses surrounding the illegal markets in which psychoactivedrugs other than alcohol are sold. o Encounters between people (microsocial): Characteristics of encounters between people. Examplesinclude group drinking in settings where violence is expected andsocially acceptable; arguments that are begun or aggravatedbecause the participants are under the influence of drugs oralcohol; and disputes involving organizations, buyers, andsellers in illegal drug markets. o Psychosocial: Influences on individuals' behavior patterns, which begindeveloping in early childhood and continue to evolve throughoutadulthood. Examples include patterns of heavy drinking andaggression that develop during adolescence and psychoses thatpredispose a few individuals toward violent psychotic episodeswhile under the influence of certain drugs. o Neurobehavioral: Processes in the brain that underlie all human behavior andthat may be altered by pharmacological effects of alcohol andother drugs. Examples include effects of substance abuse duringpregnancy on fetal development, effects of chronic substanceabuse on brain functioning, and temporary neurological effects ofbeing "high" or "blue." These and other examples of links at all four levels betweenviolence and alcohol or other drugs are displayed in table 1.Much of the evidence for specific links is suggestive rather thanconclusive. One challenge in understanding and verifying thelinks is the complexity of interactions among factors atdifferent levels. It would be difficult at best to sort out suchinteractions. What makes the challenge even greater is that moststudies measure factors at only one or two levels at a time, sothat the full range of interactions is rarely observed in asingle study. In addition, it is difficult to study violentevents using methods that yield generalizable conclusions.Controlled experiments under laboratory conditions produce thestrongest confirmation of factors that influence behavior, butpractical and ethical constraints generally limit those methodsto studies of behaviors that are far milder than the potentiallylethal violence that occurs in homes and communities. At present,therefore, there are only fragments of scientific evidenceproviding partial support for the existence of many causal linksbetween psychoactive substances and violence. These findingsneither explain definitively how the links interact nor provide abasis for ranking them in order of importance in explainingvariation in violence related to alcohol or other drugs. Neurobehavioral explanations Research on humans and many animal species suggests there areseveral neurobehavioral links between violence and psychoactivesubstances: Expectant mothers' use of psychoactive substances during pregnancy adversely affects fetal development. The resultant damage causes learning and communication problems that, in turn, increase the risk of early grade school failure, a well-documented precursor of violent behavior. Alcohol is the only psychoactive drug that in many individuals tends to increase aggressive behavior temporarily while it is taking effect. However, factors at other levels--behavior patterns when people are not drinking, the setting in which people drink, and local drinking customs, for example--influence the strength of this relationship. Among alcohol abusers, those who also abuse other psychoactive substances, who are diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, and whose parents have been diagnosed as alcohol abusers are at especially high risk of chronic violent behavior. Some researchers have suggested that a genetic process may contribute to this relatively rare pattern. Marijuana and opiates temporarily inhibit violent behavior, but withdrawal from opiate addiction tends to exaggerate both aggressive and defensive responses to provocations. Individual humans and animals deviate widely from these"average" behaviors. For example, theaggression-promoting effects of alcohol are strongest in animalshaving high blood levels of testosterone, the principal malehormone that distinguishes males from females; humans may or maynot exhibit the same pattern. A study of violent Finnish alcoholabusers suggests that the alcohol-violence link may be associatedwith abnormally low levels of blood sugar (that is, hypoglycemia)and of metabolites of the brain chemical serotonin. Another studysuggests that the alcohol-violence link is especially strong inpeople who exhibit certain abnormal brain wave patterns, both atrest and while responding to outside stresses. Common Assumptions Called Into Question On the other hand, several common assumptions aboutconnections between drugs and violence are called into questionby research findings: There is no evidence to support the claim that snorting or injecting cocaine stimulates violent behavior. However, research is urgently needed on the behavioral effects of smoking cocaine in crack form, which affects the brain more directly. Anecdotal reports notwithstanding, no research evidence supports the notion that becoming high on hallucinogens, amphetamines, or PCP stimulates violent behavior in any systematic manner. The anecdotes usually describe chronic users with histories of psychosis or antisocial behavior, which may or may not be related to their chronic use of drugs. Occasional anecdotes about " 'roid rages"--violent outbursts by men who use anabolic steroids to accelerate muscle growth--appear to describe isolated coincidences rather than any common, systematic effect. Psychosocial links Evidence from research on animals and humans indicates thatpatterns of substance abuse and aggressive behavior reinforceeach other. It cannot be said that one "causes" theother. For example, alcohol may trigger violent episodes inaggressive animals and people, but rarely in submissive ones. Patterns of aggressive behavior and substance abuse oftenbecome intertwined starting in childhood. Early childhoodaggression is a predictor of later heavy drinking, and thecombination is associated with an above-average risk of adultviolent behavior, especially among those who also abuse otherpsychoactive drugs. Research suggests at least four possible explanations for thelink between substance abuse and violent behavior in adolescents.First, adolescents may chronically use psychoactive substances tohelp them temporarily escape from such feelings as rage, guilt,worthlessness, or depression--emotions that often precedeaggressive behavior. Second, repeated family arguments overteenage substance abuse may eventually take on a violentcharacter. Next, underlying family problems or socially expectedresponses may lead some adolescent males to patterns of heavydrinking and fighting as ways to demonstrate their masculinity.Last, boys who regularly observe older males fighting whiledrinking may learn to expect that violent behavior accompaniesalcohol use. All of these processes may be at work, but theirroles, interactions, and importance as explanations have not yetbeen sorted out. Preexisting psychosis appears to account for occasionalviolent outbursts by people who are under the influence ofamphetamines or hallucinogens, especially PCP. While these drugsare well known to cause disorganized, bizarre behavior, theytrigger violence in very few people who are not also psychotic.In studies of laboratory mice and monkeys, bizarre behavior onthe part of animals under the influence of PCP fairly commonlyprovokes violent attacks by others in the group. Anecdotalinformation and newspaper accounts report similar attacks onhumans using alcohol, amphetamines, powdered cocaine, or LSD, butthis relationship has not been systematically studied in humans. Encounters between people In a variety of ways, alcohol and drugs modify encountersbetween people in ways that make these substances greater hazardsfor violence. In the case of alcohol, these hazards tend to berelated to use, while for illegal psychoactive drugs they tend tobe related to distribution and purchase. Alcohol use and sexual violence. Some therapists who treatviolent sex offenders have reported that their patients tend tohave both histories of alcohol abuse and high blood levels oftestosterone. Without comparisons to men who are not violent sexoffenders, these clinical observations cannot demonstrate thatalcohol abuse or high testosterone levels cause sexual violence.Studies of many animal species suggest a causal connection--thatalcohol reduces testosterone levels but has strongeraggression-promoting effects in individual high-testosteroneanimals. However, that relationship has not yet been tested inhumans. The frequent involvement of alcohol in acquaintance rapessuggests that social expectations may also be at work; that is,young men who expect to have sex after drinking may try tosatisfy their expectations, sometimes forcibly if they encounterresistance. Illegal drug markets. Illegal drug markets operate outsidethe world of contract law, courts and mediators for resolvingdisputes, and business customs that distinguish sociallyacceptable from unac- ceptable approaches to buying and selling.Illegal markets often develop substitute mechanisms that involvethe threat or actual use of violence. Examples include: Violence by drug distributors in the course of territorial disputes between rival organizations, threats of violence to make "staff" obey organizational rules, violent punishment of rulebreakers to keep the threats credible, battles with police, and protection of sellers or drugs on the street. Violence between buyer and seller during a drug transaction, caused, for example, by attempted robbery of one or the other, failure to hand over drugs or money, or "honest" misunderstandings of local rules of the game on the part of buyers and sellers. Violence involving people other than buyers and sellers who are found around drug markets--third parties such as innocent bystanders and people operating in related illegal markets for "protection," guns, or prostitution. As places where violence tends to occur for the reasonslisted above, illegal drug markets may also serve as"magnets." As such, they attract valuable drugs andcash, weapons, and people who are accustomed to violence. The mixof these ingredients creates hazardous conditions for robberiesand other forms of violence that may not be directly related todrugs. Obtaining drug purchase money. In some settings, the need formoney to buy drugs also increases the chance of a violentencounter. A taxi driver carrying a passenger late at night, forexample, is presumably at greater risk of being robbed if thepassenger wants to buy drugs but lacks the cash to do so. Whilerobbery is still a common way to obtain money to buy drugs, ithas been replaced by drug selling in some large cities. Using alcohol and drugs. If alcohol caused violence only bymaking individuals behave more aggressively, violence would beequally common in all places where drinking occurs. In fact,however, most drinking places are rarely scenes of violence. Afew acquire reputations as "animal houses" or"fighting bars," where people expect drinking andviolence to go hand in hand. Just what characteristics of a drinking place make it ahazard for violence are not precisely known, but there issupporting evidence for several possible explanations. People whodrink in fighting bars may behave violently in order to "fitin" or to advance socially. People who experience anger orfrustration may seek out such settings, because they believe thatdrinking in these types of establishments means social permissionto engage in violent behavior. One study of a group of young menwho were observed during an evening of drinking illustrates thisby suggesting that behavior patterns and situational influencesmay play off each other. As the evening progressed, the groupbegan both to behave more aggressively and to move on toestablishments where aggressive behavior was more sociallyacceptable. Connections between drinking and violence have beenidentified by researchers in many countries with predominantlyEuropean cultures. But they have not been found in many tribaland folk societies, even where binge drinking is common. Forreasons not yet known, expectations that violence followsdrinking have failed to develop in those cultures. Finally, it seems likely that substance abuse is indirectlyrelated to violence in ways that are difficult to identify andcount. Examples of indirect relationships include robberiescommitted to replace household money spent on drugs or alcohol,or spouse assaults arising from disputes over money or time spentaway from home drinking or taking drugs. Violence is related to the distribution, purchase, and use ofillegal drugs or alcohol in a wide variety of human interactions.Unfortunately, the difficulty of counting such interactions makesit also difficult to rank them in order of importance. Bettercounts would help in focusing violence prevention strategies onthe most common interactions in which drug- and alcohol-relatedviolence occurs. Social and economic forces If the patterns of behavior discussed above were the onlylinks between illegal drug distribution and violence, every citythat experienced a crack epidemic in the 1980's would also haveseen a substantial increase in homicide at the same time. Indeed,policymakers have occasionally claimed a "uniform, straightline relationship" between illegal drug use and murder.4 The reality is more complex. The murder rate increased 350percent in Washington, D.C., and by a smaller amount in New YorkCity as their crack epidemics unfolded. However, during the crackepidemics in Detroit and Los Angeles these cities experienceddecreases in the murder rate. This suggests that therelationships between illegal drug market activity and lethalviolence are intertwined with social and economic processes inthe surrounding community. What are these processes? Because causal patterns at thesocial level are especially difficult to establish, the answersare necessarily speculative. Fragments of evidence suggest thatsome or all of the following factors may influence therelationship between levels of violence and illegal drug marketactivity: Stability of drug market control: Situations that produce violent encounters--fights over territorial allocations or misunderstandings between buyers and sellers, for example--arose relatively infrequently in markets controlled by old, stable organizations that had developed operating rules decades ago and enforced them through a standing threat to punish violators violently. Where the spread of crack manufacturing technology encouraged new organizations to enter the markets, the resulting destabilization may temporarily have increased the frequency of violent encounters. Community access to legitimate economic opportunities: Where the rise of crack markets followed the exodus of legitimate economic opportunities from central cities, economic rewards shifted away from skills valued by legitimate employers to those valued by crack distribution organizations; these included the ability to threaten and use violence. Strength of informal violence controls: Where the exodus of legitimate economic opportunities from urban communities took with it many people committed to legal, nonviolent values, those people were no longer available for roles in preventing drug-related violence. They were not available, for example, as nonviolent role models for adolescents, as passers-by who might discourage drug buyers or intervene in emerging violent events, or as concerned individuals who might inform parents if their children began drifting toward involvement in drug markets. Social status and moral authority: During crack epidemics in some communities, successful young drug entrepreneurs either supplanted or intimidated neighborhood "old heads"--unofficial community leaders who upheld traditional values and had exercised moral authority in the neighborhood. Where this occurred, it tended to weaken cultural restraints against violence in all contexts, including drug markets. Because such relationships are difficult to verify, evidencesupporting their influence is only suggestive and fragmentary,and new research is needed to explore them more fully. Preventive interventions A number of intervention strategies for preventing violencerelated to psychoactive substances have been proposed: Police disruption of illegal drug markets. Selectively longer incarceration of violent drug-using criminals. Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol. Substance abuse prevention. Drug abuse treatment. Pharmacological therapies to reduce drug craving and aggressive tendencies associated with alcohol use and heroin addiction. Some of these strategies have been evaluated to test theireffectiveness in reducing violence. Only a few have demonstratedsuccess under any conditions; none have shown universaleffectiveness. Developing better interventions will requirecollaborative problem-solving initiatives that involverepresentatives of criminal justice agencies, providers ofsubstance abuse treatment and other social services, andevaluation researchers. These initiatives are needed to turnpromising ideas into workable programs, to evaluate the programs,and to refine them in light of the evaluation results. Thefindings of evaluations conducted thus far are summarized in thefollowing sections. Disrupting illegal drug markets. Policeattack illegal drug markets through a number of tactics:undercover investigations leading to dealers' arrests;cooperation with community antidrug efforts; and large-scale,high-visibility crackdowns. Evaluations of these tactics inBirmingham, Alabama; Lawrence and Lynn, Massachusetts; New YorkCity; Oakland, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; andWashington, D.C., present a mixed picture. Perhaps the strongestsupportable statement is that their chance of success is improvedby intervening early in emerging markets, by creating a highlycommitted police force, and by generating community receptivityand cooperation in advance. NIJ's Drug Market Analysis (DMA)program is helping with the first prerequisite--early detectionof drug markets. Specific techniques for creating supportiveclimates in police departments and the surrounding communitiesare less well understood, although many approaches are now beingtested as part of community policing initiatives. Incarcerating violent drug-using criminals. Researchershave generally found that compared to other violent offenders,those who use drugs tend to have higher average frequencies ofviolent crimes such as robbery and assault. This finding raisesthe possibility that sentencing drug-involved offenders who areconvicted of these crimes to longer prison terms might reduceviolence. However, analyses suggest that this strategy of"selective incapacitation" would reduce violent crimelevels very little unless it were accompanied by massiveincreases in prison populations. A related strategy--monitoring pretrial releasees'drug use through urinalysis--showed rather surprisingeffects in a Washington, D.C., evaluation. Although positive drugtest results did not predict significantly higher pretrialrearrest rates, failure to show up for the test was a strongpredictor of subsequent new crimes leading to rearrest. Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol.Evidence is fairly clear that increases in tax rates and othermeasures that reduce the availability of alcohol to adolescents(social pressure and enforcement of underage drinking laws) inturn reduce drinking and certain associated problems such asdeath rates due to auto collisions. Therefore, these strategiesmay also reduce adolescents' disproportionate share of violence.That conjecture remains to be tested, however. Substance abuse prevention. By reducing thedemand that fuels violent, illegal drug markets, substance abuseprevention should, in theory, reduce violence levels. Manysubstance abuse prevention programs have been evaluated,including the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), whichbrings police officers into classrooms as instructors.Evaluations of prevention programs have generally found themeffective in delaying the onset of tobacco, alcohol, andmarijuana use. Evaluations have not generally found thateducation succeeds in preventing use of "harder" drugs,perhaps because use of those drugs was rare even in the controlgroups that did not receive preventive education. However, to theextent that minor drugs are "stepping stones" to theharder ones,5 the programs may have meaningful, yet delayed,effects for violence reduction. Prevention may have an especially importantrole to play for one category of adolescents--males whosebehavior meets diagnostic criteria for antisocial personalitydisorder and whose parents abuse alcohol. Research indicates thatthese two factors, coupled with both alcohol and drug abuse,create a high-risk profile for violent behavior in adulthood. Drug abuse treatment. Successful drugtreatment programs reduce criminal activity among adult clients.For drug abusers who are not in prison, stays of at least 3months in therapeutic communities reduce the tendency to commitcrime after discharge. Up to about 18 months, longer stays in thetherapeutic community produce greater reductions. For drug abusers in prison, treatment usually involves onlyindividual or group sessions a few times a week with nopostrelease followup. Evaluations of this approach have not foundit sufficient to reduce criminal behavior following release.However, a more intensive approach--combining inprisontherapeutic communities, planning for postrelease treatment, andpostrelease treatment in the community--reduces overall rearrestrates of inmates who complete the program. At least threeprograms have used this approach: Stay 'n Out (in a New Yorkprison), Cornerstone (in the Oregon State Hospital), and theCalifornia Civil Addict Program. In addition to these beneficial effects of drug treatment onoffenders' behavior, successful treatment may reduce aggregatelevels of violence related to drug markets by lowering the demandthat fuels the markets. Such an effect would, however, bedifficult to measure. Pharmacological interventions. Like otherforms of drug treatment, pharmacological therapies that reducedrug craving may also lower the demand that supports violent drugmarkets. For decades, methadone and related chemicals have beenused to reduce craving for heroin. There is no analogue tomethadone for treating addiction to cocaine in powdered orsmokable form. However, using animals as test subjects,researchers have identified the receptors for certain subtypes oftwo brain chemicals, dopamine and norepinephrine, as promisingsites to begin developing such medications. Animal research alsosuggests neurochemical starting points for developing medicationsthat reduce violence in other ways: by disrupting theaggression-promoting effects of alcohol and by preventingaggression during withdrawal from heroin addiction. Conclusion Too few of the links between violence and psychoactivesubstances have been established with enough certainty toadvocate a comprehensive national policy for preventing violencerelated to those substances. Instead, a program of testing andevaluating tactics for implementing a variety of promisingstrategies is called for. Among these strategies, criminaljustice agencies have particular roles in developing and testingtactics to disrupt illegal drug markets, in monitoring drug useof pretrial releasees, in establishing drug abuse treatment forconvicted criminals, and in creating effective substance abuseprevention programs. Fulfilling these roles will requirecooperation between the criminal justice system and drugtreatment, prevention, and education authorities. Eventually,efforts to prevent drug-related violence may be assisted bypharmacological therapies to reduce the aggression-promotingeffects of alcohol and the craving for other psychoactive drugs. Notes 1. Among studies of this relationship, many group all illegaldrugs together. Those that distinguish among drugs usually listcocaine, heroin, amphetamines, barbiturates, and hallucinogensother than marijuana.

The DUF program uses urinalysis to confirm self-reports.The urine specimens are tested for cocaine, opiates, marijuana,PCP, methadone, benzodiazepine (Valium), methaqualone,propoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines. Samplesare collected at the time of arrest on a voluntary basis; anaverage of 80 percent of arrestees voluntarily cooperate. Testcriteria are set to detect use of most drugs in the preceding 24to 48 hours, but marijuana and PCP can be detected in the urineseveral weeks after use. 4. Isikoff, M., and K. Sawyer, "Thornburgh Says All DrugAbusers Fuel Nation's Crisis," Washington Post, August 17,1990. 5. Until recently, research on developmental pathwaysconsistently found these drugs to be "gateways" or"stepping stones" to cocaine use. Preliminary findings,presented after the Panel completed its report, suggest thatsince the New York City "crack epidemic" of the early1980's, crack-using youth in increasing numbers are skipping thegateway drugs and starting directly with crack. Author's Biography Dr. Jeffrey A. Roth served as study director for the Panel onthe Under-standing and Control of Violent Behavior. Currently heis research director in the Bethesda, Maryland, office of the Lawand Public Policy area of Abt Associates, Inc. Sidebar 1 Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior Violence is universally recognized as a pervasive part ofcontemporary American society and of our Nation's past as well.Many of the attempts to understand the phenomenon have been madein response to specific situations, such as the lawlessness ofthe Prohibition era, the assassination of President John F.Kennedy, and the urban riots of the mid-1960's. Other attempts atunderstanding violence singled out particular causes foranalysis. In none of these studies, however, was the full body ofresearch on violence reviewed comprehensively, and none of themtook an interdisciplinary approach. The Panel on the Understanding and Control of ViolentBehavior was set up to meet the need for a more comprehensiveassessment of what is known about violent behavior. It wasestablished in response to a request made by three Federalagencies: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the NationalInstitute of Justice (NIJ), and the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC). NSF asked for a review of current knowledgeabout the causes of violent behavior and recommendations forfuture research. The other two agencies shared these goals, buttheir areas of interest reflected their particular missions. Asthe research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, NIJ wanted tofind out about means to prevent and control violent crime. TheCDC wanted assistance in setting priorities for preventinginjuries and deaths caused by violence. Created in 1989, the panel reviewed research on"interpersonal violence"--events involving at most afew perpetrators and victims. This limitation excluded suicideand self-mutilation as well as large-scale collective and Stateviolence. The focus was on describing, understanding, andcontrolling violence in the United States. Research inbiomedical, psychological, and other social sciences wasreviewed. The work of the panel was intended both to help guidefuture research and evaluation projects aimed at prevention andcontrol and to suggest strategic directions for violence controlpolicy. The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the panelwere published in Volume 1 of Understanding and PreventingViolence, published by the National Academy Press. Three volumesof background papers commissioned by the panel are forthcoming.The panel concluded that numerous, often interacting factors giverise to violent events. Although the underlying interactions arenot well understood, attention to the factors suggests manypromising preventive interventions. Testing and evaluating theseinterventions creates opportunities to prevent particular typesof violence while gaining better understanding of them. The panelmade recommendations in a number of areas, among them developmentof problem-solving initiatives to control and understandviolence; better statistical systems for measuring violence; anda program of research to identify underlying causes. ThisResearch in Brief is one of a series that summarizes the panel'sfindings. NIJ is committed to implementing the recommendations of thepanel. Its commitment has begun through support for the Programon Human Development and Criminal Behavior, a longitudinal,multicommunity research project that is exploring the factorsassociated with violence. In addition, the panel'srecommendations have helped shape the goals of NIJ research andevaluation activities and its long-range plans for research.

TheD.A.R.E. program, designed to prevent students' use of tobacco,alcohol, and other drugs, uses trained, uniformed police officersin the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum.Developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and the LosAngeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as a collaborativeventure, the primary or core D.A.R.E. curriculum is directedtoward pupils in the final grade of elementary school (usuallygrade 5 or 6). Additional curricula for students in kindergartenthrough fourth grade, junior high school, senior high school, andfor parents have been developed and implemented. Purpose of the Study D.A.R.E.'s popularity, as demonstrated by the extraordinarygrowth in its rate of dissemination and by abundant anecdotalreports of its success, is self-evident. In part because of itspreeminent position, policymakers, researchers, educators, andparents are asking a number of fundamental questions about theprogram: o How effective is D.A.R.E. in preventing drug use? o What are D.A.R.E.'s effects compared with those of otherschool-based drug prevention programs? o What are some of the basic features common to most D.A.R.E.programs? o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program? o How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide? o How do other alcohol and drug prevention programs comparewith D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? To address these and other questions, the National Instituteof Justice (NIJ) awarded the research team of the ResearchTriangle Institute (RTI) and the University of Kentucky's Centerfor Prevention Research (CPR) a grant to conduct an extensivereview of the D.A.R.E. program and to assess its place within thecontext of the broad spectrum of school-based drug preventionefforts. Study Objectives The research team proposed and carried out two distinct typesof assessments, the first pertaining to implementation and thesecond to outcomes or effectiveness. The primary objectives ofthe implementation assessment were to o assess the organizational structure and operation ofrepresentative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; o review and assess factors that contribute to the effectiveimplementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; and o assess how D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug preventionprograms are tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. The first two objectives for the implementation assessmentrelate exclusively to D.A.R.E. The third targets D.A.R.E. butalso includes other drug use prevention programs. The primary objectives of the outcome assessment were to o identify all outcome evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s corecurriculum conducted to date in the United States and Canada; o assess the methodological rigor of those evaluations; o examine the nature and extent of the effects of D.A.R.E.'score curriculum; and o compare the effectiveness of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculumwith that of other school-based drug use prevention programstargeting 5th- and 6th-grade pupils. Although the first three objectives of the outcome assessmentfocus exclusively on D.A.R.E., the fourth places D.A.R.E. in alarger context by comparing it with other drug preventionprograms. In this report, we synthesize the most important findingsfrom both of the assessments and present overall conclusions, andsome recommendations. Description of the Study To achieve the study's goals and objectives, the researchteam designed a set of research strategies that would yield datapertinent not only to a review and critique of D.A.R.E., but alsoto an assessment of how D.A.R.E. compares with other school-baseddrug prevention programs, and of future directions for theseprograms. For the implementation assessment, we collected original databy conducting o informal interviews and discussions with the coordinatorsand/or educational advisors of D.A.R.E.'s Regional TrainingCenters (RTCs); o a survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators; and a survey of drug prevention coordinators in a representative, stratified sample of school districts that included districts with and without D.A.R.E. We also conducted site visits to two pairs of schools (one school in each pair had D.A.R.E. and the other did not). We discuss the methodologies used for each component of the implementation assessment in Section II of this report. For the outcome assessment, the research team conducted areview and assessment of the published and unpublishedevaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum conducted to date. Wecollected no primary data, but instead studied prior D.A.R.E.evaluations using meta- analytic techniques. The methodologies weused for the outcome assessment are presented in Section III ofthis report. At the conclusion of our data collection and analysisefforts, the research team joined Tom Colthurst of the Universityof California at San Diego Extension Program in March 1993 tohost a conference in San Diego, California, titled"Evaluating School-Linked Prevention Strategies Alcohol,Tobacco, and Other Drugs." Almost an entire day of this3-day conference for policymakers, researchers, and practitionerscentered on the preliminary results from this study. Thisconference provided an opportunity to disseminate early studyfindings from both the implementation and outcome assessments,and to incorporate participants' responses (including responsesfrom D.A.R.E. America as well as D.A.R.E. and other drugprevention researchers) to the findings in this final report. Strengths and Limitations of the Study We believe our approach to this study was fully responsive toNIJ's solicitation. Among the many strengths of this approach arethe following: o a multifaceted study methodology that collected informationfrom the national, regional, State, and school district levels ofD.A.R.E. and reviewed all short- term evaluations of the D.A.R.E.core curricula conducted to date; o a rigorous examination and synthesis of the results ofprevious evaluations of D.A.R.E.; and o incorporation into this final report of both formal andinformal feedback from researchers and practitioners attendingthe dissemination conference. However, we recognize that there are limitations to ourstudy, due primarily to limitations in the resources available tous. For example, our study budget would not allow us to surveylocal D.A.R.E. officers and classroom teachers, or monitor thedelivery of D.A.R.E. in the classroom. Additionally, somequestions raised in NIJ's solicitation, such as issues relatingto the effectiveness of the regional and State D.A.R.E. trainingcenters, could be answered only in part. A complete answer wouldhave required a many-layered study that examined trainingcenters' objectives, how these objectives are put into effectthrough training received both by trainers and by D.A.R.E.officers, and ultimately how the officers perform in theclassroom. This was clearly outside the scope of this study. Wealso were limited in assessing certain questions, such asvariability in effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. curriculum by thesociodemographic characteristics of the respondents because ofthe lack of research in this area (see Chapter 8 for furtherdetails). Given the level of resources available for this study, theresearch design required some compromises among the multipleobjectives invoked in NIJ's stated purposes, goals, objectives,and program strategies. However, the research team believes that the study representsan optimal mix of data collection methods and sources.Discussions with members of the D.A.R.E. America RTC AdvisoryBoard and other officials associated with the D.A.R.E. trainingcenters, when combined with information gathered from the surveyof State D.A.R.E. coordinators, provided answers to the questionsrelating specifically to the structure and operations of theD.A.R.E. program. The survey of school district drug preventioncoordinators yielded information about D.A.R.E. and itsrelationship to other school-based drug prevention programs. Thesite visits provided an illustrative, if unrepresentative,snapshot of D.A.R.E.'s implementation in two schools. A rigorousexamination of past D.A.R.E. evaluations provided information onthe effects of the program on students. Overview of the Report This report is organized into four sections and fourappendices. Section I contains the first two chapters, whichprovide an overview and history of school-based drug preventionprograms, with detailed information about the curricula andteachers of D.A.R.E. Section II has four chapters that present the methodologiesand results of each of the four components of the implementationassessment. In these four chapters, we present information aboutthe national/regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 3),State-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 4), and theimplementation of D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs atthe local level (Chapters 5 and 6). Section III (Chapter 7) presents the methodology and resultsof the outcome assessment. In Section IV (Chapter 8), wesynthesize and discuss findings from both the implementation andoutcome assessments, and present recommendations. Appendix A contains sampling information for the schooldistrict drug prevention coordinators survey. Appendix B contains descriptions of each study utilized inthe meta-analysis conducted for the outcome assessment. AppendixC presents a bibliography of comparison program evaluations, andAppendix D contains data collection materials for theimplementation assessment. CHAPTER 2 OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF SCHOOL-BASED DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMSAND D.A.R.E. History of School-Based Drug Prevention Programs School-basededucational programs are the most common approach to drugprevention aimed at young people. Prevention efforts are located in educational settings both because drug use typically begins during adolescence and because classrooms provide the best opportunity for reaching a large number of youth simultaneously.=20 Although rates of drug use among U.S. students generally have been declining over the past few years (University of Michigan, 1994), these rates are still higher than rates of all other Western industrialized nations. =20 The U.S. Congress reacted to concerns about youth drug use by enacting the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) of 1986. The DFSCA was designed to establish programs of drug abuse education and prevention throughout the Nation. A key part of the DFSCA is Subtitle B of Title IV, which provides Federal money to States, schools, and communities to initiate or expand drug prevention programs. Actions resulting from Subtitle B of Title IV quickly resulted in the single largest drug prevention activity offered by the Federal Government, reaching $498,565,000 in FY 1993.=20 Research conducted by RTI staff concerning the implementation of State and local programs of the DFSCA found that in the 1988-1989 school year all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have actively participated in programs funded by the DFSCA at the State and local levels. Of all the school districts in the Nation, 78% reported that they received DFSCA funding, either directly or through regional or county education organizations (Thorne, Holley, Wine, Hayward, & Ringwalt, 1991). The DFSCA funds appear to have had a positive effect on the school-based prevention programs of school districts. To be eligible for DFSCA funding, schools must implement a comprehensive drug prevention program.=20 More than half of the districts receiving DFSCA funding reported that since the advent of such support, they had been able to expand or increase numerous aspects of their programs, including=20 o number of grade levels with substance abuse curricula, o school-wide emphasis on substance abuse prevention,=20 o number of teachers and staff involved, and=20 o number of students involved. =20 A total of 25% of these districts had increased their curriculum development activities, and 48% had increased their degree of involvement with other groups in the community. The availability of DFSCA funds may be more limited in the future. Drug Use Prevention Strategies A variety of school-based intervention programs have been developed over the past three decades for preventing drug use among youth (Botvin, 1990; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, Malvin, Schaeffer, & Schaps, 1983; Tobler, 1986). The types of programs differ both in terms of what they teach as well as in how they are taught (Tobler, in press, 1994). Program content generally reflects assumptions about why young people use drugs. For example, activities to boost self- esteem reflect the belief that low self-esteem is a risk factor for drug use; strategies that teach youth how to refuse offers of drugs from friends assume that peer pressure leads to drug use. Similarly, teaching methods implemented in various strategies reflect beliefs about the most effective means for teaching young people not to use drugs. Programs that use didactic methods reflect a traditional expert model for learning; programs that emphasize group activities reflect the belief that participatory activities enhance understanding and learning more effectively. Although hundreds of individual school-based prevention programs have been developed, they generally fall into three broad categories:=20 (a) knowledge/information programs, (b) affective programs, and (c) social influences programs. A fourth category of prevention programs, alternative programs, includes those usually offered outside the school setting. Knowledge/information and affective education programs have sometimes been grouped together as more traditional approaches, while social influences programs represent newer approaches (Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, in press, 1994). These three types of programs tend to differ in content, in methods, and in their effectiveness. Even so, there is overlap among them. Knowledge/information programs were the earliest school-based prevention efforts to be developed. These strategies are based on the assumption that youth begin using drugs because they are not sufficiently knowledgeable about adverse consequences. Once youth have adequate and accurate knowledge about drugs, it is assumed that they will behave rationally and choose not to use drugs. It is also assumed that changes in knowledge about drugs will promote more negative attitudes toward drug use, which in turn will be a deterrent to using drugs. Knowledge programs typically present factual information about the legal, biological, and psychological effects of drug use. Some of these programs have adopted scare tactics to present the risks of drug use to youth in a dramatic fashion. The methods used by knowledge/information programs typically include didactic presentations, discussion, and audiovisual presentations. Affective programs were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and are based on the assumption that young people use drugs because of personal and social deficits. These programs emphasize increasing self- esteem, enhancing self-awareness, clarifying values, making responsible decisions, and improving interpersonal skills. Affective programs often do not mention drug use at all. By enriching personal and social development, it is assumed that youth will make responsible decisions about drug use. These programs typically are taught by the same types of methods as for knowledge/ information programs, but they also may include group activities. Social influences programs are the most recent approach to drug use among youth. These programs are based on the assumption that youth use drugs because they do not have the social competencies needed to resist social pressures to use drugs. Some programs focus specifically on teaching youth the skills needed for resisting drug use influences. Other programs emphasize developing more general social competencies, such as increasing decisionmaking, improving communication, and reducing anxiety, in addition to enhancing drug-specific social skills. They may also include activities to correct misperceptions about the prevalence and acceptability of drug use among peers, as well as activities that seek to establish conservative group norms about drug use. Social influences programs typically include active, participatory learning experiences, such as modeling, role-playing, and practicing behavioral skills. Social influence strategies also frequently and actively involve "peers leaders" as teachers, in role-playing, or to facilitate discussion. Despite the differences across program categories, there is actually much overlap among school-based prevention programs in their components. Affective programs share similarities with some social influences programs in their emphasis, for example, on developing personal competencies. Social influences programs frequently include information about drugs and adverse consequences. Some programs include elements of all three categories of programs and have been labeled comprehensive programs. Indeed, many school-based curricula, including D.A.R.E., combine strategies that reflect knowledge/information, affective, and social influences programs. Research on the effectiveness of school-based prevention programs suggests that all three program strategies are not equally successful in preventing adolescent drug use (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Knowledge/information programs generally have not been effective in preventing drug use among youth. The evidence suggests that, although information-based programs may increase students' knowledge of drugs, they are unlikely to result in positive changes in either attitudes or behavior. In fact, some research indicates that these programs may lead to undesirable changes in attitudes (Bruvold & Rundall, 1988). Affective strategies also have not performed well in previous evaluations and meta-analyses (Botvin, 1990; Tobler, 1986). For example, Hansen, Johnson, Flay, Graham, and Sobel (1988) found that students who received an affective education program reported significantly more drug use than students in a comparison group and that these differences increased over time. In contrast, the results of evaluation of social influences programs have been generally more positive (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993, 1986; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, 1989; Pentz et al., 1989; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). In comparison with knowledge/information and affective programs, social influences programs have been more effective at preventing adolescent drug use. History of D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is a school-based drug prevention program designed to prevent students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. Most D.A.R.E. activities are directed toward pupils in the last grade of elementary school (grade 5 or 6), which is thought to be the age at which youth are most receptive to an anti-drug message, and before they begin experimenting with drugs (Bureau of Justice Assistance [BJA], 1991b). The original D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which was implemented in 1983, was developed by Dr. Ruth Rich, health education specialist from the LAUSD. Dr. Rich based the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on a review of other prevalent drug prevention programs, particularly Project SMART (Self-Management and Resistance Training), a prevention program designed by the Health Behavior Research Institute of the University of Southern California. =20 From its inception, D.A.R.E. was designed to be a continuing education program for kindergarten through high school. To that end, junior high and senior high curricula were developed in 1986 and 1988, respectively.=20 Additionally, D.A.R.E. designers created a parent curriculum to teach parents how to recognize and prevent drug use among youth and to provide them with information about the program. D.A.R.E. is distinctive among school-based drug prevention programs in that it uses trained, uniformed police officers in the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum. D.A.R.E. officers enter the classroom not only because of a cooperative agreement between the local school district and law enforcement agency, but also because the community is willing to forgo or replace the time that D.A.R.E. officers lose to other police duties. During D.A.R.E.'s first year, 1983- 1984, 10 officers taught the curriculum to around 8,000 students in 50 Los Angeles elementary schools (BJA, 1991a). D.A.R.E. is now widely implemented throughout the Nation and parts of Europe and Asia. According to the BJA (1991b), some 6 million students in the United States received D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year, and D.A.R.E. is currently implemented in 8,000 cities across the Nation (Glenn Levant, personal communication).=20 Indeed, the D.A.R.E. workbooks are currently available in Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Braille. In addition, D.A.R.E. has been adopted by several governmental agencies that sponsor schools, including the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Capitol police, the National Park Service, and all overseas branches of the Department of Defense. D.A.R.E. combines an essentially local, grass-roots effort with a high degree of centralized program control asserted by coordinating mechanisms at the national, regional, and State levels. At the national level, D.A.R.E. America assumes the primary responsibility for implementing and managing D.A.R.E., assisted by five RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board.=20 A detailed examination of the roles of national, regional, and State D.A.R.E. organizations is presented in Section II, Chapter 3.=20 D.A.R.E. Curricula The primary purposes of all the D.A.R.E. curricula for students are to o teach students to recognize pressures to use drugs from peers and from the media, o teach students the skills to resist peer inducements to use drugs, o enhance students' self-esteem,=20 o teach positive alternatives to substance use, and o increase students' interpersonal, communication, and decision-making skills (BJA, 1991a). Each of the curricula is periodically updated; an updated version of the core curriculum is currently being pilot tested and will be implemented in September 1994. A brief summary of each of the five D.A.R.E. curricula follows. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is taught in the 5th or 6th grade, comprises 17 hour-long weekly lessons. The D.A.R.E. officers have sole responsibility for teaching all of the lessons, although classroom teachers are encouraged to participate. Officers use a variety of teaching approaches, including the presentation of facts, group discussions, role-playing, and workbook exercises. =20 The core curriculum was updated in 1993 and will be fully implemented in 1994. The updated curriculum differs from the previous version in a variety of ways.=20 The new curriculum, which has been renamed "D.A.R.E. to Resist Drugs and Violence," o includes specific lessons concerning tobacco and inhalants, o emphasizes normative beliefs and protective factors, o adds violence prevention/conflict resolution strategies, o uses more participatory learning activities, and o employs a more collaborative partnership between the D.A.R.E. officer and the teacher in the classroom (Charles Dunn, personal communication, June 22, 1993). In both the old and new versions of the core curriculum, the lessons are cumulative, building upon concepts introduced in previous lessons. With the exception of lesson 14 in both versions, the lessons are implemented in sequence and without variation. The data collection for the implementation assessment and the evaluations studied in the outcome assessment occurred before the introduction of the new curriculum. We, therefore, believe it is important to provide information on both versions. Exhibit 2.1 presents a summary of the original version of the core curriculum upon which the outcome evaluation was based, and Exhibit 2.2 displays a summary of the updated curriculum.=20 In elementary schools that receive the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, officers may also visit students in kindergarten through 4th grade to teach brief introductory (15- to 20- minute) lessons. Topics in this curriculum include personal safety, the consequences of taking medicine and using drugs, saying "no" whenasked to engage in antisocial activities, and learning about feelings. The D.A.R.E. junior high school curriculum was originally developed to provide or reinforce information and skills that help students resist pressure to use drugs. Revisions were made in 1989 to include violence reduction, conflict resolution, and anger management. The 10 lessons are taught cooperatively by the officer and the classroom teacher.=20 The lessons and activities (summarized in Exhibit 2.3) are implemented over a 10-day period as part of a required course, such as health, science, or social studies. The senior high school curriculum also focuses on drug abuse and its effect on communities and young people (see Exhibit 2.4 for a summary of the lessons). The senior high school curriculum was designed to be taught over an 11-day period during health or another appropriate class. Responsibility for teaching the lessons is divided between the officer and the classroom teacher. Officers and teachers are trained together and are encouraged to be present during the entire 11-day period. Because of the difficulties educators have continually faced persuading parents to attend school educational functions, the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum was designed to be implemented where parents live and work.

provides an awareness of safety measures that can be used in the home to reduce likelihood of dangerous exposure to drugs; introduces strategies parents can use to reduce the likelihood that young children will be at risk of drug abuse (2B) Risk factors (early adolescents) Introduces risk factors of substance use in early adolescents; introduces parents to basic drug identification and stages of adolescent chemical dependency 3 Youth pressure resistance skills Helps parents in awareness and under- standing of life skills, particularly in areas dealing with peer pressure and media influence; assists in strengthening the family network 4 Panel discussion Initiates discussion by members of the community from a variety of backgrounds on the scope of local substance abuse; provides an exchange of ideas on resources and referrals sessions generally held in the evenings (see Exhibit 2.5 for a summary of these lessons). Topics covered in this curriculum include developing better skills to interact with children, learning about peer pressures, and identifying signs and reducing risks of potential substance abuse. D.A.R.E. Officers and Training Law enforcement agencies exercise considerable discretion in identifying qualified, motivated police officers to be trained as D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. officers must be full-time, uniformed officers with at least 2 years of experience. When selecting candidate officers, local police departments are encouraged to consider the officer's ability to interact with children, ability to organize, and ability to handle the unexpected, as well as whether the officer would provide an exemplary role model and refrain from sexual, racial, stereotypical, or inappropriate remarks (BJA, 1991b). =20 Selected officers undergo an intensive, 2-week course of at least 80 hours of training. Officers are trained not only in the core curriculum, but also in public speaking, teaching skills, and classroom management. Their performance is directly critiqued by assigned mentors, who are experienced and specially trained D.A.R.E. officers. Outside speakers and consultants are also used to instruct the officers in areas requiring special expertise (e.g., a psychologist may present information on the stages of child development). The core curriculum training course includes opportunities to practice lessons both with peers and in an actual classroom setting. =20 Additional training is provided for officers teaching the junior and senior high school and parent curricula. Officers teaching these curricula are required to be certified as a D.A.R.E. officer and to have taught the core curriculum at least two semesters.=20 In-service training is provided to review what officers have previously learned in light of their actual classroom experiences and to acquaint them with changes to the curricula. The time that D.A.R.E. officers commit to the program varies considerably from one law enforcement jurisdiction to the next. For some officers, particularly those in large urban departments, teaching D.A.R.E. is a full-time occupation. In departments that serve rural communities, D.A.R.E. officers administer the program on a part-time basis, devoting the remainder of their time to other law enforcement tasks. =20 Once in the field, D.A.R.E. officer performance is monitored by mentors who observe classroom presentations and evaluate performance. Mentors may also use input from school administrators, classroom teachers, health education coordinators, and advisory committees to provide officers with feedback on their presentations. =20 D.A.R.E. in the Context of Other School-Based Drug Use Prevention Programs Considering that the D.A.R.E. curricula were based on several preexisting school-based drug prevention curricula (primarily Project SMART), it is not surprising that the curricula closely resemble other programs in content. Exhibit 2.6 show that D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum includes lessons that represent all three curricular strategies discussed earlier.=20 D.A.R.E. differs from most other school-based drug prevention programs in the structure by which it is organized and implemented. First, D.A.R.E. is implemented by law enforcement officers; most other programs are taught by teachers. Second, D.A.R.E. officer training lasts 2 weeks and is highly intensive; most drug prevention program training for teachers is of a shorter duration. Third, D.A.R.E. officers are strongly encouraged to deliver their lessons in sequence, departing only minimally (if at all) from their lesson plans; teachers are much more free to adapt curricula at will, emphasizing those areas they believe to be most salient or useful or integrating the drug prevention material into their general education curriculum.=20 Fourth, D.A.R.E. officer performance is often carefully monitored and evaluated; generally, the accountability mechanisms for teachers' implementation of their curricula are less structured. Fifth, the mission of D.A.R.E. officers in the school is exclusively drug prevention; to most teachers, drug prevention is often only part of a larger curriculum.

In essence, it is a product of memoranda of understanding between community law enforcement and local public school districts across the Nation. The primary purposes of the D.A.R.E. hierarchy described in this chapter are to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. curriculum and the fidelity with which it is delivered; to develop and uphold standards for the integrity, coordination, and quality of D.A.R.E. operations; and to provide support to D.A.R.E. at the community level. As we have said, in its degree of organization at the national and regional levels, D.A.R.E. differs greatly from other school-based drug use prevention programs, most of which limit their activities to delivering packaged curricula to school districts and offering some level of training to teachers. In contrast, the D.A.R.E. organization oversees all aspects of the prevention program, including the consistency with which it is implemented in the classroom. In this chapter, we discuss the functions of D.A.R.E. America, the preeminent D.A.R.E. organization, and its relationship with the o D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board; o State Training Centers, State Charter Organizations; and State D.A.R.E. Coordinators; o Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD); and o D.A.R.E. America Scientific Advisory Board. We obtained much of the information for this chapter from an interview conducted in August 1994 with Glenn Levant, Executive Director of D.A.R.E. America. This information is supplemented by relevant D.A.R.E. documents. We also summarize a series of loosely structured interviews conducted in 1992 with representatives of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. D.A.R.E. at the national, regional, State, and local levels is promoted, monitored, and overseen by D.A.R.E. America, which is chartered as a nonprofit organization. As specified in its charter, D.A.R.E. America has responsibility for a variety of key func- tions, including o administering the D.A.R.E. program, o providing educational materials to communities implementing D.A.R.E., o overseeing D.A.R.E. officer training and ensuring its consistency, o improving the curriculum, and o providing support to D.A.R.E. both nationally and internationally. =20 In 1988, the BJA awarded four grants to establish the RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board, and a fifth RTC was established the following year. The RTCs are located in Arizona, California, Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina, and the States associated with each are presented in Exhibit 3.1. The responsibilities of the RTCs include making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the accreditation of State-level training centers. In addition, the RTCs provide oversight to the local D.A.R.E. programs to ensure that the copyrighted curriculum is taught as specified. Educational specialists representing the five RTCs, together with staff of the LAUSD, are charged with curricular development, taking advice from the Scientific Advisory Board and other specialists. In Federal FY 1994, it is expected that the BJA grant, which in the past has flowed to the RTCs, will come directly to D.A.R.E. America to support the RTCs. D.A.R.E. is also organized at the State level. In more than one-third of the States, D.A.R.E. America has helped charter a nonprofit (501C3) organization, over which D.A.R.E. America has oversight, and which is designed to support the program in that State. The board of the chartered organization typically comprises the State's attorney general, the superintendent of education, and prominent business and education people.=20 The board of directors may also include a representative of the State's D.A.R.E. Officers' Association (described below) as well as, in some States, a D.A.R.E. coordinator whose prominence and position may vary considerably. It is expected that in time there will be D.A.R.E. charter organizations in the remaining States. In those States that currently lack a charter organization, there is typically some individual identified as the State D.A.R.E. coordinator who often is a State employee. This person's responsibilities include coordinating candidate selection and scheduling training for D.A.R.E. officers, obtaining State funds to support D.A.R.E. programs, providing local technical assistance, and overseeing policy development and implementation at the State level.=20 D.A.R.E. America meets with these individuals, and with the State charter organizations, on a quarterly basis. In addition to D.A.R.E. State charter organizations at the State level, a total of 42 States currently have developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. These centers are differentially accredited; all conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers in the core curriculum, while only some are accredited to teach the other curricula or to train D.A.R.E. mentors.=20 The STCs are supported both by the States and by D.A.R.E. America. The level of activity of these centers varies considerably given the size of the State and demand for D.A.R.E. officer training. At present, there are some 20,000 certified D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. America also owns and protects the copyright to the D.A.R.E. name, logo, and associated slogans. D.A.R.E.'s name is considered a valuable intellectual property. D.A.R.E. America approves all materials (e.g., bumper stickers) and celebrities used to promote the D.A.R.E. program. In addition, the organization screens sponsors for fund-raising events to exclude companies manufacturing alcohol or tobacco products. =20 Together with the LAUSD, D.A.R.E. America owns the copyright to the core curriculum. The superintendent of the LAUSD has been represented on the board of D.A.R.E. America since 1983. Through the RTCs, D.A.R.E. America monitors the implementation of D.A.R.E. in each community and may withdraw its permission to use D.A.R.E. if a local school district has improperly modified the curriculum. To fulfill its responsibility of improving the curriculum, D.A.R.E. America established in 1993 a Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Dr. Herb Kleber of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University. Dr. Kleber was formally the chief official for demand reduction in the Bush Administration's White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The board includes prevention specialists from across the Nation. The National D.A.R.E. Officers' Association, which D.A.R.E. America helped to found in 1987, serves to improve communications among police officers within D.A.R.E. The association now has a State D.A.R.E. Officers' association in each of the 50 States. Each of the 18 other countries that have adopted the D.A.R.E. program also has an association of D.A.R.E. officers, although those association are not formally a part of the national association. However, all associations, both domestic and foreign, look to D.A.R.E. America for guidance in matters of policy. Finally, D.A.R.E. America provides considerable support to communities implementing D.A.R.E. in the form of the educational materials that support the curriculum.=20 In some cases, D.A.R.E. America offers communities direct financial support as well. We collected further information by means of informal interviews and discussions we conducted with the coordinators and/or educational advisors of each of the five RTCs in January 1992. The RTC coordinators/advisors discussed with us a number of their needs and recommendations for the D.A.R.E. program. Summaries of their discussions with us are presented below. An increasing need for in-service training. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that a substantial number of officers have received D.A.R.E. training in the past decade. However, they stressed that the original training of many officers may now be several years old.=20 RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that although mechanisms for providing in-service training do exist, these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Furthermore, they suggested that because training of new officers already stretches available resources, the increasing need for in-service training for existing D.A.R.E. officers will strain D.A.R.E.'s budget further.=20 Exhibit 3.1 Jurisdictions of D.A.R.E.'s Regional Training Centers Southeast Midwest =20 Southwest East RTC RTC RTC RTC West RTC Connecticut Alabama Arkansas =20 Alaska California* Delaware Florida Illinois* =20 Arizona* Hawaii District of Columbia Georgia Indiana =20 Colorado Idaho Maine Louisiana Iowa =20 Kansas Montana Maryland Mississippi Kentucky =20 Nebraska Nevada Massachusetts North Carolina* Michigan New Mexico North Dakota New Hampshire South Carolina Minnesota =20 Oklahoma Oregon New Jersey Tennessee Missouri South Dakota Washington New York Ohio Texas =20 Wyoming Pennsylvania Wisconsin Utah Rhode Island Vermont Virginia* West Virginia *Indicates location of Regional Training Center. The increasing need to train State D.A.R.E. coordinators. RTC coordinators/ advisors indicated that most States now have State D.A.R.E. coordinators (see Chapter 4). However, they reported that many are relatively new in these positions or have received little formal information about how to conduct their jobs. They stated that coordinator training should include the responsibilities and roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators, as well as how they can effectively interact both with their RTC and the schools in their States. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that plans are currently under way to establish procedures to accredit State D.A.R.E. coordinators. =20 The need to improve lines of communication and clarify lines of authority. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that because of the lack of formal training and the lack of communication among State coordinators, many State D.A.R.E. coordinators have had to learn their jobs by trial and error. They stated that although a certain amount of communication occurs among State D.A.R.E. coordinators (especially among coordinators in neighboring States), increasing communication would greatly enhance efficiency by enabling coordinators to draw on the experiences of others instead of"reinventing the wheel."=20 RTC coordinators/advisors also indicated that State coordinators may need assistance with getting local programs to recognize developing lines of authority. For example, they stated that in the past, local programs worked directly with RTCs; they said that many local programs will need to be prompted to now work with the STC instead. The need for increased D.A.R.E. officer mentoring.=20 At present, RTC coordinators/ advisors reported that there is a well-developed system for monitoring D.A.R.E. officer performance in the classroom. They reported that D.A.R.E. mentors periodically monitor and evaluate officer performance by observing classes taught by the officer. They also indicated that teachers are given the opportunity to rate officer performance. They reported that D.A.R.E. officers are informed of any problem areas, told how to correct these problems, and later reevaluated to ensure that the problem has been corrected. However, to be truly useful, RTC coordinators reported that these mentors should have the time and resources necessary to work closely with D.A.R.E. officers to improve their performance. The need for increased collaboration between education and law enforcement. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that because D.A.R.E. was created as a close partnership between the LAUSD and the Los Angeles Police Department, the program is dependent on a strong and continuing relationship between education and law enforcement at every level. At the State level, RTC coordinators/advisors see close collaboration between the department of education and the organization administering D.A.R.E. (typically related to law enforcement) as essential. They indicated that the institutional commitment of State Departments of Education to D.A.R.E. is essential, in part, to help resolve any community-level problems. Further, they indicated that as administrators of DFSCA funds, State Departments of Education have an increasing role to play in providing guidance concerning the various components of a school district's comprehensive K-12 curriculum (including D.A.R.E.) and how these components should be integrated to ensure a comprehensive approach. RTC coordinators indicated that ways in which State Departments of Education could play a role in assisting with the evaluation of D.A.R.E. officer performance should be examined. At the local level, RTC coordinators indicated that D.A.R.E. is initiated when a school district invites a police department to teach the program. They reported that the police department nominates a candidate for D.A.R.E. officer training, and the candidate must be acceptable to the school district administration. In the classroom, they stated, the role of the teacher is evolving from an observer and monitor of the officer's performance to an active partner in D.A.R.E. instruction.=20 The need to maintain limits to the D.A.R.E. "bureaucracy". RTC coordinators/ advisors stressed that pressures on D.A.R.E. to expand its operations are considerable. They indicated that as an institution, D.A.R.E. remains committed to maintaining high standards at the community level. They reported that as the role of the State coordinator continues to become more important in this regard, the need for the RTCs to provide technical assistance and to monitor State activities becomes even more crucial. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that because existing RTC resources are already strained by current demands, further growth at the national level seems inevitable.=20 They indicated that even if support for such growth exists, however, there is concern that a bureaucracy will develop that may weaken the "grass-roots" nature ofthe enterprise. Coordinators/advisors indicated that it will be a challenge to increase the size and capabilities of the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy to manage and control this burgeoning program with the need to keep the bureaucracy streamlined and responsive to the needs of the communities that D.A.R.E. serves. The need to locate permanent funding sources. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that D.A.R.E. currently receives substantial support from DFSCA. However, they feel that Federal DFSCA funds appear to have reached a plateau in the past 3 years and are likely to be subjected to budget cuts in the future. RTC coordinators/advisors fear that D.A.R.E. could be reduced or even eliminated as a line item. Regardless, they reported that Federal funding may have been a mixed blessing, insofar as Federal support may displace local efforts to secure the resources necessary to implement the program.=20 Summary In this chapter, we focused on the national- and regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. We conducted unstructured interviews with the executive director of D.A.R.E. America and representatives from each of the RTCs. We also reviewed available documents. D.A.R.E. is a grass-roots program that operates through memoranda of understanding between community law enforcement agencies and local schools. D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization, coordinates, promotes, monitors, and assumes ultimate responsibility for the D.A.R.E. program at all levels. The D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board, which is composed of staff from the RTCs, serves in an advisory capacity to D.A.R.E. America. In addition to making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America, RTCs are responsible for oversight of the local D.A.R.E. programs and coordinating and conducting D.A.R.E. officer training. Organizations and individuals working to promote and coordinate the D.A.R.E. program at the State levelinclude State-chartered nonprofit organizations, State D.A.R.E. officers' associations, and State D.A.R.E. coordinators. Also at the State level are STCs that provide training to D.A.R.E. officers. Curriculum development and changes are the responsibility of educational specialists from each of the RTCs, together with staff from the LAUSD. A Scientific Advisory Board, composed of leading prevention specialists, assists in these endeavors. Our interviews with the RTC coordinators indicated the following key issues: a need for increased in- service training and mentoring, providing training to State D.A.R.E. coordinators, improving communication and collaboration between agencies, maintaining limits on the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy, and locating permanent funding sources. Findings from this chapter and resulting recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 4 STATE-LEVEL OPERATIONS In this chapter, we present the second component of the implementation assessment, a survey of those individuals who generally manage the State-level D.A.R.E. operations: the State D.A.R.E. coordinators. This component was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information concerning: o features common to most D.A.R.E. programs, o funding arrangements for D.A.R.E., o management of D.A.R.E. and supporting organizations, and o availability of the D.A.R.E. curricula. The primary objective of this component was, of course, to provide information concerning D.A.R.E.'s State-level operations. As a secondary objective, we collected preliminary information to facilitate sample selection for the school district drug prevention coordinators survey, the results of which we present in Chapter 5. This chapter covers both the methodology for and findings from the survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators.=20 The findings section presents data concerning the administration, funding, implementation, challenges, and problems of State-level D.A.R.E. operations. Methodology Instrument Design We based the content of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators' survey on the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the literature on D.A.R.E.'s structure and operations, and an examination of prior studies of school-based drug education conducted at RTI.=20 Recognizing that State D.A.R.E. coordinators have considerable demands on their time, we designed the instrument to be as brief and straightforward as possible. To minimize ambiguity and burden, we used mostly close-ended items. A few open-ended questions were included to encourage respondents to provide detailed information. =20 The survey instrument was composed of two parts: a questionnaire and a list of school districts. The questionnaire contained items concerning administration, funding, and implementation of the State D.A.R.E. program. The list of school districts contained those districts we selected from that State for the first-phase sample of the school district drug prevention coordinators' survey (see Chapter 5). We asked State coordinators to indicate whether each district on their list used D.A.R.E., and we then used this information to draw the second-phase sample for the school district survey. We pretested the instrument on three State D.A.R.E. coordinators in early February 1992. We also shared the instrument with all five RTC coordinators and requested their feedback. We incorporated the responses of pretest participants, as well the comments of the RTC coordinators, the NIJ program manager, and other alcohol and drug prevention program experts into the final draft of the data collection instrument. A copy of the survey instrument and other data collection materials can be found in Appendix D. Data Collection In January 1992, the RTC coordinators provided us with lists of names and addresses of State D.A.R.E. coordinators. Based on this information, we identified 44 States with D.A.R.E. coordinators. We mailed each coordinator a package containing cover letters from the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and RTI, a questionnaire, and a list of school districts in the coordinator's State. The cover letter from the RTC Advisory Board expressed support for the research effort and encouraged participation. The cover letter from RTI explained the study, provided assurances that all information would be kept strictly confidential, and requested copies of any pertinent State documents concerning the organization and/or administration of D.A.R.E. =20 We mailed the packages to the State D.A.R.E. coordinators on February 18, 1992. Two weeks after the initial mailout, we contacted nonresponders by telephone.=20 We made repeated attempts by mail and telephone to secure the return of completed materials or to collect the information by phone. The RTCs were again of great assistance to us in urging coordinators to return surveys. Of the 44 respondents identified by the RTC coordinators, 39 completed the instrument. For purposes of verification, one question in the survey asked respondents to confirm that the State had a D.A.R.E. coordinator. Although four States responded that they did not have such a position, we determined after some investigation that they did have a person who performs a coordinator's role. Respondents from all four of these States reported that administration of the State D.A.R.E. program was one of several roles they performed as supervisors or directors in law enforcement agencies.=20 We, therefore, did not delete these responses from our analysis. It should be noted, however, that because of skip patterns in the survey instrument, these four respondents did not complete survey items specifically directed to the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. =20 Findings Administration To address issues raised in the NIJ solicitation concerning management of the D.A.R.E. program, we asked a series of questions about the agencies involved in D.A.R.E.'s administration at the State level, the functions of each agency, and the relationships among them. Findings from these questions are presented below. Agencies Involved. We first asked respondents to report the agency with primary responsibility for managing the State D.A.R.E. program. As shown in Exhibit 4.1, the great majority of States indicated that a law enforcement or criminal justice agency was entrusted with this responsibility. =20 Exhibit 4.1 Percentage of State D.A.R.E. Programs Primarily Managed by Various State and Local Agencies Agency (N=3D39) % State Department of Public Safety 17.8 State Police 15.4 State Investigative Agency 7.7 State Highway Patrol 5.1 Other State Criminal Justice Agency 10.3 Governor's Office 7.7 State Attorney General's Office 10.3 State Department of Education/ Public Instruction 2.6 City/County Law Enforcement Agency 12.8 D.A.R.E.

We asked coordinators if the State had a policy advisory board (PAB), and 15 States (38%) reported affirmatively. To explore PAB membership, we asked the 15 coordinators with PABs to indicate the agencies/individuals who held memberships on these boards and to indicate the representative who chaired it.=20 Exhibit 4.2 shows that 65% or more of the States with PABs listed State and local educational agencies, local law enforcement agencies, and State D.A.R.E. officer associations among their members. The leadership role of the PABs was primarily held by law enforcement representatives. The board was chaired by State law enforcement agencies in six States, by local law enforcement in three States, by local education agencies in two States, by the State Department of Education in one State, by another State agency in one State, and by an Association of Chiefs of Police in one State. =20 Exhibit 4.2 Percentage of States with D.A.R.E.

Yet another agency encouraged to become involved in D.A.R.E. is the State Department of Education. States are encouraged to retain an educational consultant to act as a liaison between the State Department of Education, local school administrators, and D.A.R.E. instructors (BJA, 1988). We, therefore, asked if the State had an educational consultant. Twenty-five (64%) of the 39 respondents reported having an educational advisor, and two States reported two advisors. Further, we inquired about the employers of these consultants and found that educational systems employed 17 of the 27 educational advisors and law enforcement agencies employed 4 (Exhibit 4.3).

Functions. Next, we sought to examine the responsibilities of both the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs by asking respondents to indicate the functions of each agency (Exhibit 4.4). The most fre- quently mentioned roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators were D.A.R.E. advocacy and officer training within the State. The most frequently mentioned roles of PABs were formulating State policy, exploring funding sources, and advocating for D.A.R.E.=20 We also asked respondents to list functions performed by the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs that were not provided as close-ended response options.=20 Additional duties mentioned for State D.A.R.E. coordinators included=20 o acting as liaison to other D.A.R.E. agencies (three States), o distributing D.A.R.E. materials (three States), o making and managing grant applications (two States), o training D.A.R.E. officers for schools on military bases (one State), o recertifying officers (one State), o selecting officers (one State), and o serving as a clearinghouse for information (one State). Other duties performed by the PABs included long-term planning (two States) and the selection and supervision of the State D.A.R.E. coordinator (one State). Exhibit 4.4 Percentage of State D.A.R.E.

As mentioned earlier, State D.A.R.E. programs are strongly encouraged to develop relationships with State Departments of Education.=20 Having an educational consultant, however, does not guarantee communication between the agencies. We, therefore, asked the State coordinators about how well they communicate with the Department of Education. Most of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported having a great deal (35%) or some (47%) communication with the State Department of Education. In six States, coordinators reported little communication, and only one reported none. Seven coordinators (20%) reported having a signed agreement between the State D.A.R.E. coordinator and the Department of Education. =20 We also asked coordinators about the level of communication between the PABs and the State Department of Education. Most of the coordinators reported that PABs had a great deal of communication with the Depart- ment of Education. Eight of the 15 States with PABs reported that their boards had a great deal of communication, three reported some communication, three reported little, and one reported none. =20 Only one State reported that both the State D.A.R.E. coordinator and the PAB had little communication with the Department of Education. Funding The NIJ solicitation also requested information on funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. To this end, we asked respondents to report the amount of funding received by the primary managing agency. Exhibit 4.5 presents ranges of funding received for D.A.R.E. at the State level. Four States reported that no funds were received for State-level D.A.R.E. operations, and two State coordinators were unable to provide this information. =20 The mean amount of funds received by the primary managing agency for operating D.A.R.E. at the State level in the 1991-1992 school year (excluding $0 values) was $273,657; funding ranged from $25,000 to $2,635,000. The total amount received by the responding States was $9,260,700. Exhibit 4.5 Funding Received in 1991-1992 School Year for State-Level D.A.R.E.

Four of the 33 respondents did not answer this question. We also asked coordinators to indicate the percentage of funds received from each source. Fifteen States indicated that all funds were received from one source (six from the BJA, four from State governors' grants, two from the State Department of Education, two from legislative funds, and one from other sources). Eight States reported that funding was received from two sources, and eight States reported receiving funding from three or more sources. =20 Additionally, we asked respondents to report other sources of funding not mentioned in the close-ended response options. Responses included State and local matching funds, special education trust funds, State penalty assessment funds, funds from the Exhibit 4.6 Numberof States Receiving Funds for State- Level Operations from Sources in 1991-1992 School Year Funding Source (N=3D31) % Bureau of Justice Assistance Grant 58.1 Grant from Governor's Office 29.0 State Department of Education 12.9 Legislative Funds 25.8 Grant from Other State Agency 29.0 Local Funds 9.7 Corporate Donations 9.7 Individual Donations 3.2 Civic or Community Groups 3.2 D.A.R.E.

America has informed us that all State-level programs receive support from D.A.R.E. America (Glenn Levant, personal communi- cation, August 9, 1994). Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), fund-raisers, and Federal forfeiture funds. State Training Centers As mentioned in Chapter 3, one goal of the RTCs has been to develop STCs in their geographic areas.=20 Increasingly, RTCs have adopted a "train thetrainer" model to prepare STCs in their jurisdiction to conduct their own D.A.R.E. officer training and certification procedures. We, therefore, asked coordinators whether their State had its own STC. About 87% (34 States) reported affirmatively. One of the five States without a training center reported that the State was in the process of establishing a training center. Implementation To obtain a general idea of the level of implementation of each of D.A.R.E.'s curricula, we asked respondents to indicate each curriculum used in the State during the 1991-1992 school year. All respondents reported that the core curriculum and the K-4 visitations were used in at least one school in the State.=20 Furthermore, 28 States (72%) implemented the junior high curriculum, 26 States (67%) implemented the senior high school curriculum, and 9 States (23%) implemented the parent curriculum in at least one school. Challenges and Problems To acquire an understanding of the challenges and problems facing D.A.R.E. and the State D.A.R.E. coordina- tor in the coming years, we asked two open-ended questions about these issues. We categorized the responses and counted the number of State coordinators indicating each category. (We advise caution in using these findings to make recommendations given the small number of coordinators mentioning each category.) =20 First, we asked respondents to identify the most significant issues they face in working with the State's Department of Education. The two most common responses were improving communication between agencies (mentioned by eight States) and acquiring a full-time educational advisor (mentioned by seven States). Most of the other responses were specific actions that coordinators wanted the State Department of Education to undertake, such as o assisting with program evaluation and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers (six States), o formally mandating the D.A.R.E. program (three States), o understanding the role of law enforcement in education (three States), o assisting with funding for D.A.R.E. (three States), o providing greater support for the D.A.R.E. program (two States), o assisting in training programs (one State), and o helping resolve problems between officers and teachers (one State). We then asked respondents to indicate the most significant issues facing the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. It should be noted that most of these issues could be mentioned by coordinators of other drug prevention programs, as well as coordinators of D.A.R.E.=20 Most of the responses centered on funding, communication, evaluation, and training. The responses, by category, were as follows:=20 Funding o maintaining or increasing funding (13 States) o locating funding sources (8 States) o locating funding specifically for training (6 States) Communication o increasing communication between D.A.R.E. agencies at the local, regional, and national levels (10 States) o improving relations with State Department of Education (4 States) o coping with the disorganization of the program (4 States) o improving public relations (3 States) o keeping up with constantly shifting policies of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board (2 States) Evaluation o monitoring officers in the classroom (8 States) o evaluating the program (4 States) Training o improving training (3 States) o handling problem officers (2 States) o obtaining STC certification (1 State) Staffing o increasing staffing (6 States) o formally establishing a State D.A.R.E. coordinator position (2 States) o forming a PAB (2 States) Expansion o expanding D.A.R.E. to other grades or schools (7 States). Summary This chapter focused on a survey of the administrators of the State D.A.R.E. programs. Thirty- nine of the 44 States with State D.A.R.E. coordinators responded to the survey. =20 We found that most of the State D.A.R.E. programs are managed by law enforcement or criminal justice agencies and that most retain educational consultants.=20 About two-fifths of the States had PABs. Most of the coordinators reported high levels of communication between themselves and the State Department of Education.=20 They also reported high levels of communication between the PABs and the Department of Education. Most States received at least $50,000 in funding for training and administrative purposes, and most States had their own STC. Findings from this chapter and resulting recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 5 SCHOOL DISTRICT DRUG PREVENTION COORDINATOR SURVEY A survey of school district drug prevention coordinators was the main component of our implementation assessment. This component of the assessment was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information about the implementation of D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug prevention programs at the local level. NIJ specifically requested information on the following questions: o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program at the local level? o How involved in D.A.R.E. are classroom teachers, churches, and community groups? o How extensively are D.A.R.E. and other school-based alcohol and other drug (AOD) prevention programs implemented nationwide in terms of geography, target populations (such as ethnic groups, economic strata, and urbanicity), and grade levels? o How do other AOD programs compare with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? o What are local funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs? How do these resources affect implementation? A careful reading of these questions reveals that NIJ had three primary objectives: (a) to secure information about the administration of D.A.R.E., (b) to develop estimates of the national prevalence of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs, and (c) to make comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. =20 RTI staff developed and conducted a comprehensive survey of school district drug prevention coordinators that addressed each of the above-mentioned objectives and questions. We selected drug prevention coordinators as respondents, as opposed to classroom teachers or police officers, because we believed that drug prevention coordinators were the school district staff members best able to provide us with a broad perspective on all drug prevention activities in the district, including both D.A.R.E. and other AOD prevention programs. This chapter presents the methodology and findings for this survey. We should note that for this chapter the results we display will be descriptive, as opposed to explanatory, in nature. That is, our purpose is to report what the school district drug prevention coordinators have told us, and not attempt to explain why they responded as they did. Although efforts to explain our respondents' answer are feasible, we believe they would ultimately prove unsatisfactory because our explanatory variables (e.g., the school districts' racial balance or percentage of youth in poverty) are very limited, and any differences we find may be misleading. The findings section first presents information we received from districts with D.A.R.E., followed by estimates of the numbers of districts with D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs, and comparisons of D.A.R.E. with other AOD programs. At the end of the findings section, we also provide some general information about drug policies in all the districts surveyed. Methodology Sample Design The sample design for the school district drug prevention coordinators' survey was a two-phased stratified random sample. The two-phases of the sample design was necessary to meet the multiple goals of this survey. The goal of the first-phase sample was to produce estimates by region, district size, socioeconomic status (SES) categories, ethnicity categories, and urbanicity. The goal of the second-phase sample was to enable comparisons between districts with and without D.A.R.E. A detailed discussion of each phase of the sample design is discussed below. Sampling frame. The first step in our sampling design was to obtain a list of public school districts nationwide. We obtained such a list from Quality Educational Data (QED) Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The QED file, which is updated every summer, lists all public school districts nationwide and contains a wealth of useful information for each school district. We used this file as our sampling frame. Information that we used from this file included the school district's o SES (defined as the percentage of children in the district below poverty level), o urbanicity (defined as urban, suburban, or rural), o ethnicity (defined as the percentage of children in the district who were black or Hispanic), and o district size (defined as the number of students enrolled in the district). =20 For each of the 14,715 districts on the QED file, we created five new variables that we later used for stratification and weighting purposes. First, we created a region variable that was based on the jurisdictions of D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3.1). Next, to keep the total number of stratum cells within reasonable bounds, we dichotomized urbanicity, SES, ethnicity, and district size. We first collapsed the urban and suburban categories on the QED file into one category. We computed percentiles for minority status, SES, and district size within each region-by-urbanicity group. We then used the median of each variable to define two categories (low/high) for each of the three variables. The number and percentage of school districts in the sampling frame in each of the strata are presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.1. First-Phase Sampling. The goal of the first-phase of our sampling design was to ensure that we selected a nationally representative sample of school districts.=20 Additionally, we wanted to ensure that districts in each region, urbanicity category, SES category, minority status category, and district size category were adequately sampled. Therefore, our first-phase sample was a stratified random sample. =20 The first step in selecting our first-phase sample was to define each strata. We initially constructed 10 region-by-urbanicity strata by crossing the 5 regional strata with the 2 urbanicity strata. We then crossed each of these 10 strata with 2 SES categories (resulting in 20 strata). We then crossed each of those 20 strata by minority status (resulting in 40 strata). Finally, we crossed each of those 40 strata by district size (resulting in 80 strata). The number of school districts in the sampling frame in each of the 80 strata is presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.2. The next step in our sampling design was to determine how districts from each strata would be selected for inclusion in the first-phase sample. We assayed two methods of allocating the sample to strata.=20 In the first method, we assigned equal sample sizes across strata (i.e., we sampled 15 districts from every stratum regardless of whether the stratum in the sampling frame contained 15 or 200 districts). This method would have ensured good precision across strata. In the second method, we assigned sample sizes proportional to the frame size within each stratum. For example, if 5% of the districts in the sampling frame were in a particular stratum, proportional sampling would have ensured that 5% of the first-phase sample would be allocated to that same stratum. Unlike equal allocation, proportional allocation yields approximately equal sampling weights, reduces variance, and thus provides better precision for overall survey estimates. =20 Because of its clear advantages, we chose proportional sampling. Thus, we randomly selected a proportional number of school districts within each of the 80 strata. The first-phase sample consisted of 1,500 school districts. Exhibits displaying the sample allocation to strata are provided in Appendix A, Exhibits A.3 and A.4. Second-Phase Sampling. The goal of the second- phase of our sampling design was to ensure that the second-phase sample included both D.A.R.E. and non- D.A.R.E. school districts. To make this determination, we asked State D.A.R.E. or DFSCA coordinators to classify the 1,500 school districts in the first-phase sample as either D.A.R.E. or non-D.A.R.E. districts (see Chapter 4). Because some State coordinators did not return this information or only partially completed the information, we created a third category of school districts with an unknown D.A.R.E. status. State coordinators reported that 43% of the sampled districts used D.A.R.E. and 40% did not; D.A.R.E. status was unknown for 17% of the districts. Exhibit A.5 in Appendix A displays the responses of the State coordinators on the D.A.R.E. status of the first-phase sample by region. The next step in selecting our second-phase sample was to determine the number of districts to be selected.=20 Calculations to determine the number of districts needed in the second-phase sample were based first on the type of analysis we planned to conduct and second on an anticipated 80% response rate. Because we calculated that 400 responding school districts were necessary to achieve sufficient statistical power and precision, we selected a second-phase sample of 500 school districts. Finally, we used the classifications provided by the State coordinators to select proportional numbers of school districts with D.A.R.E., without D.A.R.E., and with unknown D.A.R.E. status across the five regions.=20 Thus, we selected 215 school districts with D.A.R.E., 200 without D.A.R.E., and 85 with unknown D.A.R.E. status.=20 Exhibit A.6 in Appendix A displays the second-phase sample by region and D.A.R.E. status. Survey Estimation. All survey estimates were computed using software developed at RTI specifically for the analysis of surveys based on complex sample designs.=20 We computed analysis weights that took into account the two-phase stratified sample design. Weighted data provides a less biased estimate than unweighted data because the weighted data more accurately represents the true population. The weights varied across strata based on region, ethnic composition, urbanicity, SES, and size of the school district. Analysis weights were computed as the product of the first-phase sample weight and the second-phase sample weight. Sampling weights were also adjusted for nonresponse. We performed quality checks on the analysis weights to ensure that the sum of the analysis weights coincides with the number of districts in the frame. We also examined the variability of the analyses weights and their impact on survey variances. Instrument Design RTI staff determined the contents of the school district drug prevention coordinators' survey based on the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the literature, and examination of the studies of drug education programming previously conducted at RTI. We used close-ended items whenever possible to minimize ambiguity and burden. A few open-ended questions were included to encourage respondents to provide detailed information. =20 All drug prevention coordinators completed a set of core items that were designed to provide background information about the district and about the specific drug prevention curricula used. Additionally, coordinators in districts using D.A.R.E., alone or in combination with other drug prevention curricula, completed a set of items concerning the D.A.R.E. program only. Coordinators in districts using other AOD prevention programs, alone or in combination with D.A.R.E., completed a set of items concerning other AOD (i.e., non-D.A.R.E.) programs only. Therefore, school districts implementing D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of items. After submitting the data collection instrument to our NIJ program manager for comment and discussion, we formally pretested all data collection materials and procedures. Both regional and State DFSCA coordinators assisted in identifying pretest subjects. Seven school district drug prevention coordinators (two in New York, two in South Dakota, one in North Carolina, one in Rhode Island, and one in South Carolina) completed a pretest questionnaire in early April 1992. We used the responses of pretest participants, as well as the comments of our NIJ program manager and other AOD prevention program experts, to make final decisions on the data collection procedures and instruments. A copy of the survey instrument and other data collection materials for this component of the study can be found in Appendix D. Data Collection On May 1, 1992, we mailed a cover letter, questionnaire, and prepaid return envelope to school district drug prevention coordinators in each of the 500 selected school districts. The cover letter included a brief statement of study objectives, information on how the data would be used, and confidentiality assurances.=20 Approximately 2 weeks after the initial mailing, we sent postcards to coordinators who had not responded. The postcard asked if the initial packet had been received, reminded the coordinator of the importance of the study, and offered the RTI toll-free number in case assistance was needed. Upon request, we provided duplicate mailouts. Four packages were returned as undeliverable. Each of these was followed up by telephone inquiry to ascertain the correct address. We obtained correct addresses for three of the four returned packages and remailed the material. The remaining school district had recently merged with another school district. Because this merged district was already included in the sample, the duplicate was dropped. We began making follow-up telephone calls to nonresponders approximately 2 weeks after the reminder postcards were mailed. Follow-up phone calls were made by trained RTI telephone interviewers between June 2 and July 15, 1992. Interviewers encouraged coordinators to complete and return their instruments as soon as possible. Those coordinators who indicated to interviewers that they would not otherwise complete the instrument were asked to complete the survey over the telephone. The survey instrument was exactly the same for both telephone and mail administration. The final response rate was 85.6%, which considerably surpassed our expected response rate of 80%. The final sample disposition is presented in Exhibit 5.1. Exhibit 5.1 Final Sample Disposition N % Completed by phone 289 57.8 Completed by mail 139 27.8 Refused 8 1.6 No response 63 12.6 Duplicate 1 0.2 As indicated, we completed almost twice as many interviews by phone as by mail. We attribute this to several factors. First, phone surveys traditionally have higher response rates than mail surveys. Second, the questionnaires were not mailed until late in the school year; therefore, coordinators may have had end-of-the- year obligations that limited the amount of time they could spend on additional duties. Third, the part of the instrument that asked about each of the packaged drug prevention curricula was imposing; we believe that having the interviewers read these questions to the respondents may have made answering them less burdensome. Because the information gathered in this survey was not sensitive in nature, we believe that data obtained via both methods of administration are comparable. Returned questionnaires were delivered to a check-in station where they were logged in, coded, manually edited, keyed, and key verified. We implemented machine-editing procedures to verify and correct skip patterns and logical inconsistencies. We recontacted a few school district drug prevention coordinators to resolve problematic responses, such as incomplete or contradictory information. Findings Administration of D.A.R.E. The first objective of this survey was to obtain information about the administration of D.A.R.E. at the local level. This section presents findings concerning the implementation, administration, participation of teachers and the community in the D.A.R.E. program, integration and coordination of D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug prevention efforts, problems with D.A.R.E., and future plans for the use of D.A.R.E. Data from survey items asked only of the districts with D.A.R.E. are presented in this section. =20 Implementation. In the 1991-1992 school year, D.A.R.E. was implemented in 51.8%, or 222, of the school districts surveyed. Some 42% of all school districts surveyed used the core curriculum, 17% used K-4 lessons, 11% implemented the junior high school curriculum, 3% used the senior high school curriculum, and 3% used the parent curriculum. =20 Of the 222 school districts with D.A.R.E., the great majority (81%) implemented the core curriculum, around 33% used the K-4 visitations, 22% used the junior high school curriculum, 6% implemented the senior high school curriculum, and 5% used the parent curriculum. We further asked the respondents to indicate every grade in which the D.A.R.E. curricula were used. Exhibit 5.2 displays the percentage of school districts with D.A.R.E. implementing the program at each grade. Almost 70% of the districts with D.A.R.E. implemented the curriculum in 5th-grade classes, and almost 60% used it in 6th-grade classes. Thus, a substantial number of districts implemented the core curriculum in both grades, which probably reflects the different cutoff grades separating elementary from junior high or middle schools in that district. Administration. One objective of NIJ's solicitation was to ascertain what agencies usually manage D.A.R.E. and have responsibility for various aspects of the program at the local level. To address these issues, we first asked coordinators to report all agencies managing D.A.R.E. Around 81% of the districts with D.A.R.E. reported that a single agency administered the D.A.R.E. program, while 16.3% reported that two agencies and 2.3% reported that three or more agencies administered the program (Exhibit 5.3). Almost 34% of the school districts with D.A.R.E. reported that the county sheriff's department alone administered the program, and about 34% reported city/town police departments administered it.=20 We next asked coordinators to report whether law enforcement or education was responsible for various activities. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. most frequently reported that law enforcement agencies were responsible for selecting D.A.R.E. officers and determining classroom activities (Exhibit 5.4). They reported that responsibility for selecting schools to receive D.A.R.E., selecting classrooms to receive D.A.R.E., and assigning extracurricular D.A.R.E. activities were performed by education. Participation of Teachers and Community. NIJ's solicitation also requested an examination of the extent of involvement of classroom teachers. About 84% of the coordinators reported that classroom teachers were actively involved in the program. We also asked coordinators about classroom teachers' level of participation during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 21% reported a great deal of participation, 46% reported some participation, 28% reported little participation, and 5% reported no participation by the classroom teachers. =20 Exhibit 5.2 Use of D.A.R.E., by Grade Note: Based on responses of coordinators in school districts with D.A.R.E.

Most of the school district drug prevention coordinators (89%) reported that teachers remain in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 72% reported that classroom teachers integrate the D.A.R.E. message into other activities, 39% said that teachers collect D.A.R.E. homework, and 15% reported that teachers assign D.A.R.E. homework. The NIJ solicitation also requested that we examine the extent to which members of community groups (e.g., church or youth groups) participate in the D.A.R.E. program. Indeed, recent research suggests that linking school-based interventions with the larger community strengthens their effectiveness (Pentz et al., 1989; Perry & Tobler, 1992). Therefore, we asked the prevention coordinators to specify members of the community who were actively involved in D.A.R.E. About 51% of the coordinators said that parents were actively involved, 22% indicated that civic groups were so involved, 13% said that youth groups were so involved, and 5% said that church groups were so involved. Integration and Coordination. Another objective of this study was to examine the extent of D.A.R.E.'s integration and coordination with other school-based drug prevention efforts. To address this issue, we first asked coordinators to indicate the level at which D.A.R.E. was integrated with other AOD programs. About 63% of the prevention coordinators reported D.A.R.E. was very well integrated, 31% reported it was well integrated, and 7% reported it was poorly integrated. To determine whether D.A.R.E. was better integrated in some types of school districts than in others, we examined the differences in the percentages of coordinators reporting that D.A.R.E. was very well integrated by minority status, SES, urbanicity, and district size. No statistically significant differences were found.=20 D.A.R.E. was equally well integrated with other AOD programs across different types of school districts. One type of mechanism for coordinating the D.A.R.E. responsibilities of law enforcement with those of education agencies are written agreements that solidify commitment, define roles and duties, and establish sound working relationships. We asked coordinators about the existence of such agreements and found that approximately 44% of the coordinators reported that their district had a written agreement. We asked those coordinators with written agreements about the contents of these agreements. The following components of the agreements were mentioned by the accompanying number of coordinators: o the responsibilities of all parties (23 coordinators); o time (21 coordinators); o funding/fees (20 coordinators); o scheduling (15 coordinators); o curricula (10 coordinators); o schools to be offered in (9 coordinators); o grades used in (6 coordinators); o general use of D.A.R.E. (6 coordinators); o length of program (5 coordinators); o school policies (4 coordinators); o sequence of lessons (3 coordinators); o materials (3 coordinators);=20 o graduation program (3 coordinators); and o "don't know" (4 coordinators). Problems. We asked school district drug prevention coordinators to provide information concerning problems with implementing and coordinating D.A.R.E., and to suggest how the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. might be improved.=20 We asked coordinators to indicate whether there were any barriers to implementing D.A.R.E. and then to specify these barriers. Only 26% of the school district drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned any barrier to implementing the program. Some 16% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned inadequate funding as a barrier to implementation, 13% mentioned too few officers, and 11% mentioned scheduling difficulties (Figure 5.5). The two most frequently mentioned barriers were in areas over which the school system has little control (funding and number of officers). Exhibit 5.5 Problem Areas That Are Barriers to Implementing D.A.R.E. in All Schools Note: Based on responses of coordinators using D.A.R.E. (N=3D222). Next, in an open-ended question, we asked coordinators to elaborate on any problems with the coordination of D.A.R.E. The responses of those with problems were o lack of time (19 coordinators); o insufficient funding/staff (12 coordinators); o scheduling problems (9 coordinators); o officers not good teachers (5 coordinators); o difficulties getting program started (4 coordinators); o inadequate officer/teacher interaction (4 coordinators); o officer scheduling problems/absences (4 coordinators); o other officer problems (4 coordinators); and o lack of coordination between school and police (3 coordinators). Finally, we asked coordinators what, if any, changes they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective in their district, and then to elaborate on these changes. About one-third of the coordinators mentioned that there was at least one change that they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective. The following responses were the changes they mentioned: o expand to other grade levels (26 coordinators); o increase staff/officers (11 coordinators); o increase parental participation (7 coordinators); o increase funding (6 coordinators); o increase community involvement (6 coordinators); o increase teacher training and involvement (5 coordinators); o improve quality/dependability officers (4 coordinators); o increase integration with other curricula (4 coordinators); o increase time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 coordinators); o decrease time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 coordinators); =20 o increase publicity (2 coordinators); o adapt curriculum to grade level (2 coordinators); o change curricula (2 coordinators); o teach officers to be teachers (2 coordinators); o increase refresher training for officers (2 coordinators); o include D.A.R.E. as part of student assistance program (1 coordinator); o increase D.A.R.E.'s availability in rural/isolated areas (1 coordinator). Future Use of D.A.R.E. To examine whether the demand for D.A.R.E. is going to increase or diminish over the next few years, we asked coordinators about their future plans for D.A.R.E.=20 Some 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. planned to expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, and 55% planned to maintain the current level (only 2% planned to decrease use). Of the 208 school districts without D.A.R.E., 38% had not considered using D.A.R.E., 21% planned to implement D.A.R.E. in the future, 20% were undecided, 15% reported they definitely will not use D.A.R.E., and 6% had discontinued use of D.A.R.E. Further, to determine whether any particular type of school district was more likely to expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, we examined the differences in the percentages of districts planning to increase their use of D.A.R.E. by minority status, SES, or urbanicity. No statistically significant differences were found. Plans for the expansion of D.A.R.E. were fairly equal across different types of school districts.=20 National Prevalence Estimates of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs The second objective of this survey was to develop national estimates of the prevalence of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. To accomplish this objective, we asked coordinators to indicate all published drug prevention curricula used by the school district in the 1991-1992 school year. Based on previous research and discussions with school-based drug prevention curricula experts, we provided a list of 13 published curricula that we thought coordinators would mention most often.=20 In addition, we provided ample space for open-ended responses concerning other published curricula. We used this information in combination with the sample stratification variables to develop estimates by geographical area, ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity. We also asked respondents to complete a series of questions concerning grade levels and substances targeted, as well as type of teachers for each of these curricula.=20 Based on the number of school districts in our sample using the three most frequently mentioned curricula, we estimated the number of school districts nationwide using these curricula. These prevalence estimates and other findings concerning the three most frequently mentioned published drug prevention curricula used in the 1991-1992 school year are presented below. Prevalence. According to our estimates, the published curricula used most often by our respondents in the 1991-1992 school year were D.A.R.E., Quest, and Here's Looking at You. Exhibit 5.6 presents the estimated numbers and percentages of school districts nationwide using these three curricula overall and by the districts' region, urbanicity, SES, minority status, and district size. Urban/suburban school districts were significantly more likely than rural districts to use D.A.R.E. (p<.01) and Here's Looking Exhibit 5.6 Percentage and Estimated Number of School Districts in the Nation Using Top Three Packaged Curricula During the 1991-1992 School Year, by Minority Status, SES, and Urbanicity of the School District Here's Looking D.A.R.E.

Due to sampling variability, stratum-level estimates will not coincide exactly with the corresponding stratum counts in Exhibit A.1 in Appendix A. at You (HLY) (p<.05). Large school districts were significantly more likely than small school districts to use D.A.R.E. (p<.01). =20 Grade Levels Targeted. To determine grade levels targeted by each of the three most frequently used curricula, we asked coordinators to indicate which curricula were used in the school district at each grade level. Grade levels targeted by coordinators with D.A.R.E. were presented in Exhibit 5.2. Around 46% of the school districts with Quest targeted the program to the elementary school level, 81% to the middle/junior high school level, and 12% to the senior high school level. Almost 89% of the school districts with HLY targeted the program to the elementary school level, 55% to the middle/junior high school level, and 35% to the senior high school level. Coordinators reported that all three curricula were more likely to target elementary or middle/junior high school levels. Substances Targeted. To determine whether the three most frequently mentioned curricula differed in substances targeted by the program, we asked the school district drug prevention coordinators to indicate which substances each of the prevention curricula targeted. We found no significant differences in substances targeted among D.A.R.E., Quest, and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). All three of the packages were comprehensive in targeting all substances.=20 Exhibit 5.7 Substances Targeted by, and Types of Instructor of, the Three Most Frequently Mentioned Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs (%) Here's Looking at D.A.R.E.

Type of Instructor. We also asked coordinators to indicate who taught each of the prevention curricula. As expected, almost all school district drug prevention coordinators reported that police officers were responsible for teaching the D.A.R.E. curricula.=20 Classroom teachers were primarily responsible for teaching Quest and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). More than one- fifth of the coordinators reported that classroom teachers were also involved in teaching D.A.R.E. =20 Comparison of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs The final objective of this study was to make comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. Comparison data are presented in this section. Topics include funding, satisfaction with the curricula, support for the curricula, and adaptations to curricula. We asked respondents to report on other AOD curricula in general because it would have been too burdensome and time-consuming for them to answer each of the questions for every curricula in use during the 1991- 1992 school year. =20 We first asked school district drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. (222 of the 429 respondents) to answer a set of survey items concerning their D.A.R.E. programs only. We asked all coordinators using other (non-D.A.R.E.) AOD programs (406 of the 429 respondents) to answer an identical set of items concerning their other AOD curricula only. The respondents using both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of items. Information gathered from these matched sets of questions allowed a direct comparison of responses about the D.A.R.E. curricula with responses concerning other AOD curricula. Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. Funding. The first comparisons we examined were comparisons of funding. We asked respondents to indicate all sources of funding for the districts' D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs (Exhibit 5.8). The most frequently mentioned sources of funding for D.A.R.E. were law enforcement agencies and DFSCA education funds. The most frequently mentioned sources of funding for other AOD programs were DFSCA education funds and school district funds. D.A.R.E. programs were more likely than other AOD programs to receive funding from city/county funds, corporate donations, and individual donations. Satisfaction with Curricula. Next, we compared satisfaction ratings for each of the curricula. We asked the school district drug prevention coordinators to rate five program components as very satisfactory, satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory. The five components were curriculum, teaching, administrative requirements, student receptivity, and effects on students. None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. rated any of the five components as very unsatisfactory.=20 Approximately 1% of the respondents with other AOD programs rated teaching, administrative requirements, or effects on students as very unsatisfactory. D.A.R.E. was much more likely than other AOD programs to be viewed by the school district drug prevention coordinators as very satisfactory on each of the five components (Exhibit 5.9). Well over half of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated each of the components as very satisfactory. Between 23% and 35% of the coordinators with other AOD programs rated each of the components as very satisfactory. Students' receptivity was the component with the highest percentage of coordinators rating it as very satisfactory for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. =20 Exhibit 5.8 Sources of Funding for D.A.R.E. and Other Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs in the 1991-1992 School Year (%) D.A.R.E.

Among coordinators with D.A.R.E., those in high-percentage minority districts were significantly more likely than those in low- percentage minority districts to rate student receptivity as very satisfactory (p<.05) (Exhibit 5.10). Among coordinators with other AOD programs, those in urban districts were significantly more likely (p<.05) than those in rural districts to rate student receptivity and effects on students as very satisfactory (Exhibit 5.11).=20 There were no significant differences in components rated as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in low and high SES districts or between other AOD programs in low and high SES districts. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in components rated as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in small and large districts or between other AOD programs in small and large districts. Support for Curricula. We also asked the school district drug prevention coordinators to indicate how supportive they perceived the community, school personnel, students, parents, law enforcement, and civic groups to be of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 Response options for these questions were very supportive, somewhat supportive, and not supportive.=20 None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. perceived students or law enforcement as unsupportive of the program (data not shown). The percentages of coordinators who perceived any of the listed individuals or agencies as unsupportive were very small for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 Exhibit 5.10 Components of D.A.R.E. and Other Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs Rated as Very Satisfactory, by Minority Status of School District (%) D.A.R.E.

Coordinators with D.A.R.E. were most likely to report law enforcement as being very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, followed by students and school personnel (Exhibit 5.12). Coordinators with AOD programs other than D.A.R.E. were most likely to report law enforcement and school personnel as being very supportive of other AOD programs. =20 Exhibit 5.12 Individuals, Groups, and Agencies Very Supportive of D.A.R.E. and Other Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs (%) D.A.R.E.

Furthermore, there were no significant differences in support between D.A.R.E. programs in urban and rural districts or between other AOD programs in urban and rural districts. Adaptations of Curricula. Some drug prevention curricula, such as D.A.R.E., require instructors to strictly adhere to the curricula and established procedures. Other curricula allow instructors to adapt the curricula to meet their particular needs. However, little is known about how prevention curricula are actually adapted. We asked the school district drug prevention coordinators whether D.A.R.E. or other AOD programs were adapted in any way as a result of gang activity, drug availability, the racial/ethnic composition of the district, student or community poverty, urbanicity, or for some other reason. About 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported adapting D.A.R.E. for at least one of these reasons, while about 54% of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting for one of these reasons. Exhibit 5.15 presents the percentage adapting D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula as a result of the above-mentioned issues. The most frequently mentioned reasons for adapting both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs were drug availability and student/community poverty.

Adaptations mentioned by the coordinators included: o targeting particular drugs prevalent in the area; o making adaptations for the physically and mentally handicapped; o adding more information on violence prevention; o discussing drug abuse in the home environment; o teaching students to be more tolerant of others; o discussing local drug arrests; o involving high school students as role models; o communicating with families of youth to gain familial support and ensure attendance at graduation; o taking field trips; and o omitting lessons. General Drug Policies In this final section of Chapter 5, we present information from responses to questions that were designed to examine general drug policies in the school districts. All coordinators responded to these questions regardless of whether they used D.A.R.E. or any other drug prevention curricula. =20 Anti-Drug Policies. We first asked whether the school district had a written anti-drug policy. We found that 96% did have such a policy. Student Assistance Programs. One type of drug prevention program that many schools have adopted is the student assistance program (SAP). Modeled after employee assistance programs (EAPs) in businesses, SAPs conduct such activities as screening for alcohol and drug involvement, making referrals, and developing and coordinating early intervention plans for youth with problems that could lead to substance abuse. =20 Almost 55% of the school district drug prevention coordinators reported that their districts had SAPs in place during the 1991-1992 school year. Of the 237 districts with SAPs, 51% targeted these programs to the elementary school level, 78% focused on the middle/junior high school level, and 81% targeted the senior high school level. We asked the school district drug prevention coordinators using SAPs to indicate what types of individuals were trained to participate in these programs (Exhibit 5.16). Almost 89% of the coordinators mentioned that teachers had been trained, and nearly 75% mentioned that principals and guidance counselors had been trained to participate in SAPs. We also asked the coordinators using SAPs to indicate the types of individuals who actually implemented the programs and how effective they were (Exhibit 5.17). Coordinators most frequently mentioned that teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and students implemented SAPs. However, they perceived guidance counselors, D.A.R.E. officers, and district/school nurses as the most effective at implementing these programs. Coordinators most frequently mentioned that community professionals and community volunteers were not effective.=20 Exhibit 5.16 Individuals Trained to Participate in Student Assistance Programs Individual/Agency (N=3D237) % Teachers 88.6 Principals 74.9 Guidance Counselors 74.7 District/School Nurses 49.7 Community Professionals 42.5 Students 37.3 D.A.R.E.

A total of 429 school district drug prevention coordinators responded to the survey. Data presented in this chapter were weighted to take into account the complex sample design. Over half of the school districts in the United States used D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year.=20 Additionally, demand for the program is going to increase over the next few years; two-fifths of those with the program planned to expand its use and one-fifth of these without the program plan to begin use. The two other most frequently used packaged curricula were Quest and Here's Looking at You, both used by about one-fourth of the districts. Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. Most of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported receiving funding for the program from law enforcement and/or DFSCA funds. Most of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported receiving funding for these programs from DFSCA and/or district funds. D.A.R.E. was more likely than other AOD programs to be rated very satisfactory in terms of curriculum, teaching, administrative requirements, student receptivity, and effects on students. Furthermore, coordinators were more likely to indicate that the community, school personnel, students, parents, law enforcement, and civic groups were very supportive of D.A.R.E than of other AOD programs. Around two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over one-half the coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting the program to meet their needs. The most common reasons for adaptation for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs were drug availability and student/community poverty. Most of the D.A.R.E. programs were administered at the local level by a single law enforcement agency (i.e., sheriff's department or city/town police department). In most districts, coordinators reported that officer selection and classroom activities were the responsibility of the police, while school and classroom selection were the responsibility of education. Findings from this chapter and resulting recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 6 SITE VISITS The final component of the implementation assessment consisted of site visits to school districts.=20 We designed these visits to obtain a snapshot of the organization and operations of D.A.R.E. and other school- based drug prevention programs. The site visits also gave us an opportunity to speak with the officers, teachers, and students directly and to see the D.A.R.E. program in action.=20 For the site visits, we selected four schools in three school districts. Two of the school districts were adjacent to one another in a northern inner-city environment, with a large minority population and a substantial drug problem. The third school district was located in a rural area in the South; it also had a substantial minority population but less of a drug problem. The school in one urban school district had D.A.R.E., and the school in the other urban district did not have D.A.R.E. In the rural district, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did not. Because the school districts and schools were limited in number and purposively, rather than randomly, selected, the information gathered from these sites is not representative of schools in general. We present data gathered from this component of the assessment to illustrate and complement findings from other components of the implementation assessment. We recognize the need to exercise caution in interpreting site visit findings and encourage readers to use similar discretion. For the site visit interviews and observations, we developed site visit protocols that were based on issues raised in the previous components of the implementation assessment. The protocols were designed to elicit general, open-ended, and free-flowing discussions. We used protocols instead of structured surveys because we believed the structured format would inhibit the exploration of schools' individual characteristics.=20 Further, we expected respondents would provide us with a wealth of information that a structured format might have prevented. We often departed from the protocols to follow up any line of inquiry that appeared of potential interest. As a result, the reports from our sites are in some ways dissimilar. Copies of the protocols can be found in Appendix D. =20 Site visits were conducted by two teams. Each team included at least one senior investigator with considerable experience in conducting site visits. A two-person team conducted a 2-day site visit in the urban schools, and a four-person team conducted a 1-day site visit in the rural schools. Two or more site visitors jointly interviewed key individuals, and each interviewer took notes to reduce the chances of missing key information. When appropriate, we interviewed up to four individuals at the same time. Each team conducted interviews with a variety of individuals, including o the coordinator responsible for the development and implementation of drug prevention efforts in the school district; o individuals teaching drug prevention curricula to students (including D.A.R.E. officers at schools with D.A.R.E.), o their supervisors (if any), and o teachers in whose classes D.A.R.E. officers teach (at D.A.R.E. sites). When available, we also interviewed others involved in drug prevention program planning, delivery, or referral (e.g., representatives of community advisory or drug action groups). =20 In each of the two D.A.R.E. schools, the site visit team monitored a D.A.R.E. lesson and the officer's activities in the school outside the classroom. We also observed a drug prevention lesson in both of the schools without D.A.R.E. We note that both of the classroom observations in the non-D.A.R.E. schools were conducted in special education classes. The selection of classes to be monitored was based on what teacher was teaching drug prevention the day of our site visit and the discretion of the school district drug prevention coordinator. This chapter contains two sections. In the first, we discuss drug prevention programming in the urban schools; and in the second, we describe drug prevention programming in the rural schools. Within each section, we present information about the D.A.R.E. school, followed by information about the non-D.A.R.E. school. Urban Schools Urban School with D.A.R.E. The school we selected received D.A.R.E. after being on a waiting list for approximately 1 year; all 5th-grade classes and one 6th-grade class in the school received D.A.R.E. We interviewed three individuals involved in the D.A.R.E. program: o the police administrator in charge of the local D.A.R.E. program (an officer with many years of experience who had administered D.A.R.E. for 5 years); o a D.A.R.E. officer (involved with D.A.R.E. for 5 years and currently teaching 16 classes a week); =20 o the school district drug prevention coordinator.=20 The following summarizes our discussions with these respondents. =20 Administration. According to the police administrator, the D.A.R.E. program in this city follows the same procedures employed nationally. He stated that the local police, State police, and Board of Education work together to provide the D.A.R.E. program. He further indicated that this coordination has ensured the integrity of D.A.R.E.'s implementation, D.A.R.E.'s consistency with drug education required by the State, and smooth integration with other drug education initiatives. =20 Implementation. Initial steps in the implementation of the D.A.R.E. program, as reported by the police administrator, are as follows. The local police department conducts initial screening of candidate officers for the D.A.R.E. program. Potential D.A.R.E. officers are interviewed by the local police department, and then by the State police. Successfully screened candidates are sent for a 2-week training program offered by the State police. After completing the training, officers are assigned to particular schools or sets of schools by the local police department. The D.A.R.E. officer who was interviewed indicated that he is assigned a general target area and allowed to select the schools in that area in which he wishes to teach. He indicated that he and other officers are provided with a list of schools that have requested D.A.R.E. to guide their selections. He further reported that no more than 20% of the schools he selects can be private. According to the police administrator, a limited attempt is made to match officer and student characteristics. For example, he stated that in the Hispanic community, the local police department attempts to provide D.A.R.E. officers who can speak Spanish.=20 Beyond this, however, he indicated that little matching occurs. =20 The police administrator said that the D.A.R.E. program is monitored by both the State and local police departments. He reported that a staff member from the State police visits each D.A.R.E. instructor during the year to observe and assess teaching skills and students' receptiveness to the program, as well as to solicit feedback from classroom teachers. The administrator also stated that he monitors classroom activities as part of his supervisory responsibilities. According to the police administrator, school personnel are very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, in part because the program is free to the school. The schools are, thus, able to use their drug prevention resources for additional drug prevention purposes. The police administrator indicated that some teachers get involved in the D.A.R.E. program because of personal interest, but that most do not. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that although State policy requires teachers to remain in the classroom during the lesson, they assist him only in disciplinary matters. The drug prevention coordinator indicated that although teachers do not participate in teaching the lessons, they have been very receptive both to the program and the officers.=20 The coordinator noted that teachers cannot be required to allow D.A.R.E. into their classrooms, and the fact that no teacher has refused D.A.R.E. indicates the degree of acceptance that the program enjoys. When asked about problems between regular teachers and D.A.R.E. officers, the police administrator reported that although there are some individuals who do not get along, it is not a system-wide problem. The D.A.R.E. officer stated that although principals are supportive of the program, he has yet to see one in his classes, and that no other school staff participate in the program. The police administrator indicated that parental involvement generally has taken the form of assistance from the PTA in co-sponsoring D.A.R.E. graduation ceremonies. However, he stated that the level of parental involvement varies substantially from one school to another. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that in his experience parents generally do not show an active interest in D.A.R.E. According to the police administrator, the investment of the community in the D.A.R.E. program is limited. He further indicated that D.A.R.E. officers have little time to seek community involvement: "The reality is that the D.A.R.E. instructor has a full day teaching classes; there isn't time to do anythingelse."=20 The D.A.R.E. officer also reported that community groups have little participation in the program. Funding. The police administrator reported that when the D.A.R.E. program began in this city, much of the funding came from the Federal Government (i.e., from BJA through a grant to the State police). He reported that support received from the State police is currently limited to training and materials. Salaries of officers and supervisors are paid by the local police department, and limited contributions are provided by the community.=20 According to the police administrator, there is real danger of D.A.R.E. becoming a victim of budget cuts because of the current budget crisis; he indicated that implementation has already been severely restricted because of lack of resources. Curriculum. We asked the police administrator whether the D.A.R.E. curriculum was adapted to meet the special needs of his area. He responded, "We teach D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is D.A.R.E. Once you decide to use a program that is administered throughout the country, then you do not tailor it." When asked about addressing the needs resulting from gang activity, he indicated that officers incorporate their own street experiences and information they received from the police academy into the D.A.R.E. gang lessons. He reported that local gangs and their behaviors are discussed. =20 The police administrator stated that local D.A.R.E. advocates believe that classroom activity should be supported by parental involvement. He, however, did not express interest in the parent curriculum at this time.=20 The reasons he gave were that the program is still experimental and has not been evaluated, the supply of officers is already inadequate to meet the demand, and the cost of the parent program would dramatically increase overall costs (i.e., because the parent curriculum is generally offered in the evening, officers would be paid time-and-a-half). The police administrator stated that "If more money was available, this (parent curriculum) would certainly be an option the local department would look into." Problems and Improvements. The police administrator stated, "One of our major problems is that we have so few officers and so many schools." He indicated that the department tries to "keep D.A.R.E. moving through the schools" and to cover as manystudents as possible. The administrator reported that although this rotation policy maximizes the number of schools reached within the department's limited resources, it also creates problems (i.e., just about the time the school becomes accustomed to D.A.R.E., the program is discontinued and moved to another school). The administrator reported that many school officials are angry about this policy. The police administrator also indicated the need for more evaluation. He stated, "Evaluation is the only way to find out what works and what doesn't. I don't think we're ever going to find that D.A.R.E. solves the drug problem in the United States, but that it is a first step. Evaluation must be written into everything. It has taken too long for evaluations to come about." He said that he would at least like to have information on how effective the program is in suburban, rural, and inner-city areas. He asked, "If we find the program is working in a certain area, that's great, but what can we do in the other areas to enrich the program and diversify it to meet those needs?" =20 The D.A.R.E. officer mentioned several problems areas. First, he indicated that although one of his schools is heavily Hispanic, it does not have D.A.R.E. books in Spanish. Second, he stated that the program was designed for the officer to stay in contact with the school and that in his current situation, he is in and out of the school with little chance for further contact with the students. Finally, he reported the need for greater recognition of graduates of the program.=20 "Something should be done to get the parents and principals more involved so that students feel they have really accomplished something that has meaning." The only problem mentioned by the drug prevention coordinator was the need for a bilingual officer. Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade classroom of 25 students, composed of 6 Hispanics, 4 African Americans, and 15 Caucasians. Two of the students spoke limited English and needed translations of the D.A.R.E. lesson.=20 The D.A.R.E. instructor was a white male police officer in his forties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The officer presented himself to the class as a friend. The officer's teaching style was very straightforward and "streetwise," and he was bothgruff and engaging. He was very knowledgeable about the material and taught the whole lesson without notes. The interaction between officer and students was an easy, bantering one. The 40-minute lesson that we observed focused on the media and how advertisement can be used to persuade consumers and children to purchase and use different products. The lesson began with a short introductory lecture on the influences of advertising and the goals of the media. The officer then asked students questions about different products to show them how much they have learned from the media. The officer gave examples of different types of advertisements (e.g., "personal testimony," "bandwagon") and also used adsfrom magazines to illustrate his point. Most of the class period (30 minutes) was spent in interaction. =20 During the class, the students were rowdy but attentive. They called out answers to the officer's questions and felt free to make comments. The students treated the officer with genuine respect. The interest and interaction level in this particular lesson was high.=20 The classroom teacher was present during the lesson, leaving only once to go to the principal's office. The teacher sat at the back of the room grading papers; however, he had a D.A.R.E. book and followed the lesson as it progressed. Most of the teacher's input occurred in the beginning of the class before the lesson got started. The only other time the teacher spoke was to maintain discipline in the classroom, and then he only reprimanded talkers. Once the lesson was completed, the officer left immediately. There was no evidence of any outside contact with students. =20 Urban School Without D.A.R.E. We interviewed two individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. school, the drug prevention coordinator for that school district and the classroom teacher who taught the drug prevention lesson that we observed. The following summarizes the discussions with these individuals. Administration. The drug prevention coordinator reported that there is no specific drug prevention program in place. She indicated that drug prevention textbooks are used and, at times, individuals from outside the school make presentations at drug prevention assemblies. According to the coordinator, a teacher might incorporate a drug prevention lesson into a reading class or show a video. She stated, "We put together lots of little things that add up to something you might call a program, but we don't have a structured program." =20 Implementation. The coordinator indicated that each student at the school receives drug education information at least on a monthly basis. However, she reported that lower grades receive less and in a more loosely structured format. The teacher reported that he makes sure his students receive some drug prevention education every week. According to the coordinator, classroom teachers do not have specific times set aside for drug prevention, but rather fit it in when they can.=20 The seventh and eighth graders do use and follow a drug prevention textbook and have regular discussions. =20 The coordinator indicated that teachers' support for the drug prevention program depended on which teacher you were talking about. She indicated that all teachers think that drug prevention education is important, but that some are far more committed than others to incorporating drug prevention lessons into their curriculum. The classroom teacher stated that most of his fellow teachers support the school's drug prevention efforts, but that some teachers just did not know how to talk to students about issues like drugs and gangs. He stated, "Some either don't know what to say or justdon't care enough." =20 The coordinator reported that law enforcement personnel have been sporadically involved in the school's drug prevention activities and have attended local school council meetings and conducted in-service training with teachers about drug awareness. She noted that 2 years ago law enforcement officials came into the school to work with students targeted as high risk. She stated that "the success of that program depended upon whether or not the student accepted the officer." =20 When we asked the coordinator about the involvement of individuals from the community in the school's drug prevention efforts, she responded that no person from the community has been involved in implementing the school's drug prevention program. She indicated that most of the community has no idea about what the school is doing in terms of drug prevention education. She stated, "I don't think the community feels that it is their place to be involved." =20 Funding. According to the drug prevention coordinator, there were virtually no drug prevention activities until the school began receiving money specifically designated for drug prevention education (DFSCA) about 3 or 4 years ago. She reported that the school was currently in its third year of receiving DFSCA funds and that the amount of funding had steadily increased over those years. She noted, however, that this funding cannot be counted on from year to year, and it is difficult for the school to make long-term plans.=20 According to the coordinator, the lack of resources prevents consistency in the school's drug prevention program. =20 Curriculum. The drug prevention coordinator indicated that although all drugs are covered by their drug prevention efforts, alcohol is targeted. The coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that alcohol is the most widely abused drug among children and adults in their community. The teacher indicated that he spends a great deal of time on this issue and that he spends more time teaching students about self-esteem and resisting peer pressure than teaching specifically about drugs. The classroom teacher stated it is a mistake to spend too much time educating students about the types of drugs and their effects unless a strong foundation of self-esteem has first been created. When we asked whether the school drug prevention program had been adapted to meet the needs of ethnic minorities, the coordinator indicated that stereotypes about who is on drugs and who is selling drugs are reflected in the materials she has purchased; that is, many of the pictures are of minorities. If anything, she felt that white suburbs would have to work more with adapting materials to fit their population. The classroom teacher indicated that he was aware of the cultural diversity in his school and addressed it on an individual basis with students and their parents. The teacher expressed frustration about the difficulty of teaching drug prevention when many of the students live in homes where the norm is to "drink heavily and abuse family members." =20 Problems and Improvements. The drug prevention coordinator said that in the future she would like to purchase a packaged curriculum=FEpossibly D.A.R.E. She indicated that she did not know very much about D.A.R.E., but would like information about how to get the program.=20 One negative factor she reported having heard about D.A.R.E. is that there is a long waiting list for the program. She stated, "When you first called and asked if we had D.A.R.E., I got excited and thought that someone was going to give us D.A.R.E.; I don't really know what D.A.R.E. is, but I assume that because it is in other schools, it is good."=20 The drug prevention coordinator also indicated that she would like to increase the amount and consistency of delivery of the drug prevention education program, and to bring greater structure to. The coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that they want to have the drug prevention program administered by one person who would come in and take responsibility for the program. =20 Classroom Observation. We observed a special education class of 22 students. It was a remedial class comprising 14 Hispanics, 6 African Americans, and 2 Caucasians. There were 12 girls and 10 boys. =20 The teacher was a white man in his forties, dressed in a suit and tie. He encouraged the students and drew on their strengths. He often called on students who would not otherwise volunteer answers and helped them formulate answers. When an answer was not exactly correct, he encouraged the student to think further about the question asked. The teacher carefully and adequately answered students' questions. The topic of the observed lesson concerned the functioning of the lung and heart. This was a lesson designed to provide students with background information about the human body, before the impact of drugs on the body's major organs were discussed. The teacher followed the textbook closely. Because the students were slow learners, he altered the lesson slightly by asking the students to read sections aloud and then immediately asking questions about the section just covered. Most students appeared interested in the lesson. They followed along in the textbook and answered questions with sincerity. A few students consistently put their hands up to answer questions, but most were quiet. There were no discipline problems during the class. After class, we asked the teacher whether he ever used group discussions. He reported that this group of students was too remedial to use a discussion format. =20 Rural Schools Rural School with D.A.R.E. The D.A.R.E. program in the rural district employed four D.A.R.E. officers. We interviewed five individuals, including: o the police administrator in charge of the D.A.R.E. program, o a D.A.R.E. officer, o the school district drug prevention coordinator, o the school guidance counselor, and o the teacher in whose class the D.A.R.E. officer taught. The following summarizes our discussions with these respondents. Administration. The police administrator indicated that the D.A.R.E. program was administered by the city police department. He reported that this was the first semester that D.A.R.E. had been offered in this particular school. He stated that the agreement between the school and police department is informal. Implementation. The police administrator reported that the initial steps in implementing the D.A.R.E. program include selection of a D.A.R.E. officer by the local police department, approval of the officer by the State police, and training for the officer at a D.A.R.E. training course. The officer reported that there are no problems coordinating D.A.R.E. activities. He stated that there is "eagerness from all sides to make the programwork."=20 According to the officer, some classroom teachers participate in the lesson, but most do not. He further indicated that much of the time students are just as receptive without the teacher present. The D.A.R.E. officer indicated that parents are becoming more involved in the program. He stated that they are very interested and supportive of D.A.R.E., and that his attendance at nonclassroom school functions, such as Friday night dances, has greatly improved his relationships with parents. He reported that he hopes to receive training on the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum as soon as possible. According to the officer and the police administrator, there was little community involvement.=20 They attributed this to the program being new and hoped that there would be more community involvement in the coming semesters. However, the coordinator did report that D.A.R.E. is well received by the "educated" community. He indicated that churches in the community have not been particularly receptive and simply do not want to get involved. The coordinator and the guidance counselor saw the lack of involvement by churches as a loss to the program. According to the school counselor, students' attitudes toward police had changed considerably since the D.A.R.E. lessons began. She stated that "students now see the officer as a friend instead of someone to avoid." Funding. The police administrator reported that the police department funds the salary of the D.A.R.E. officer, while the school pays any costs for the curriculum (i.e., books, materials). The school district coordinator indicated that the school did not have the funds to purchase D.A.R.E. T-shirts and related paraphernalia. He further stated that the district is seeking a State grant for additional supplies. Curriculum. The guidance counselor reported that D.A.R.E. classes are a "wonderful way of teaching students to say no" and that the self-esteem modules are particularly valuable and effective. According to the district coordinator, D.A.R.E. complements all their other drug prevention programs, but that unfortunately there was little coordination between different curricula.=20 The D.A.R.E. officer reported that he does not target the curriculum to any particular substances and does not adapt the curriculum to specific ethnic needs.=20 He indicated that he does teach the gang lesson (as do most D.A.R.E. officers in the State), even though in this community there is little gang activity. Problems and Improvements. The guidance counselor indicated that she would like the school to provide D.A.R.E. in all classrooms in grades 5 through 7. The guidance counselor and the classroom teacher indicated the need for the school to offer D.A.R.E. or some other drug prevention education at earlier grade levels.=20 According to the counselor, "Trying to teach drug prevention education in high school is futile." The classroom teacher indicated that D.A.R.E. and other programs need to focus more on at-risk children.=20 She indicated that there are some 15- and 16-year-olds still in the 6th grade. She reported that these students usually have poor attendance records, are poorly motivated, and are frequently in trouble. She stated that current prevention programs, including D.A.R.E., are not adequately meeting the needs of these students.=20 The district coordinator indicated that one problem has been the lack of ongoing evaluations of D.A.R.E. Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade class of 22 students, 12 boys and 10 girls. Twenty students were African American, and two students were Caucasian. The D.A.R.E. officer was a white man in his thirties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The officer presented himself as a "big brother,"someone whom the students could seek out if they needed guidance or assistance. The officer brought the D.A.R.E. mascot-- the D.A.R.E. bear--with him to class. The lesson that we observed focused on alternatives to drug use. The officer discussed how athletics could be used as an alternative to drug involvement. He used examples of well-known, drug-free athletes. The officer encouraged students to ask questions. He also used a "D.A.R.E. question box." In the previous week,students had been asked to write questions for the officer and place them in the box. During the lesson, he drew a question from the box and answered that question. For the remainder of the lesson, the officer took the students outside to play games to illustrate alternatives to drug use. He also involved the school's gym teacher in supervising the games. During the class, students were interested and inquisitive. They seemed to feel free to ask the officer questions. There were no disciplinary problems. The classroom teacher remained present during most of the lesson, sitting at the back of the room and grading papers. =20 The officer seemed to spend a great deal of time in the school. After the lesson was over, he talked to students in the hallway. Indeed, almost all students seemed to know him. When an emergency occurred (a student fell and broke his arm) and the principal was not present, the staff sought the officer's assistance. This was not the first such occurrence, and we learned that the school staff relied frequently upon the D.A.R.E. officer to act as a sort of assistant principal.=20 Clearly, he was viewed as an integral--and important-- part of the school staff. Rural School Without D.A.R.E. We interviewed four individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. school, including the school district drug prevention coordinator (who was the same for both rural schools), the supervisor of health services, and two members of a local advisory board for substance abuse. The following summarizes discussions with these individuals. Administration. Coordination of the drug prevention efforts in the observed non-D.A.R.E. school and other such schools in the community rests with the school district drug prevention coordinator. He indicated that there are a variety of programs currently available to schools but that implementation and coordination are sporadic. Implementation. According to the coordinator, parents in this school are becoming more aware of the drug problem and are beginning to ask what they can do to get involved. He stated that many parents are realizing that they cannot "send their kids to school to get fixed," and so are starting to take responsibility for their children's problems. He also indicated that school personnel are becoming more involved.=20 Funding. According to the district coordinator, the school receives most of its drug prevention funds from DFSCA. He also indicated funds were provided by the school board and a local university, as well as the Indian Education Act. These latter resources, however, could only be spent on programs delivered to Native American children. Curriculum. According to the coordinator, a variety of curricula are available to teachers at this school, but not all teachers use the same curriculum, and some do not provide drug prevention education at all.=20 The coordinator reported that Here's Looking at You 2000 is one package available to teachers in this school.=20 However, he indicated that only about half the teachers had been trained to teach this program. The advisory board members informed us of a community drug abuse treatment program currently in use in this and other area schools that follows the"12-step" model. This program offers intervention, education, and prevention to youth who have been suspended for substance use, as well as to their families. One board member stated that suspended youth must attend this program before returning to school. The coordinator indicated that the SAP is just now being implemented in this school. The health supervisor reported that the school also sponsors Red Ribbon week, a program sponsored by the National Federation of Parents that invites youth and community members to pledge their support for drug-free lives by displaying red ribbons. Problems and Improvements. All individuals interviewed indicated the need for greater coordination between the different types of drug prevention programs, as well as assessments of drug prevention efforts. The coordinator reported that he would like to have someone responsible for the delivery of drug prevention programs in the school and someone responsible for evaluation. He said that "a lot of people are working very hard, but have little idea of whether or not their efforts are successful." The coordinator indicated that time is also a major problem in the delivery of drug prevention education. He stated that preparing students for end of the year testing takes up most of the classroom teachers' time and allows them little time to teach drug prevention. Classroom Observation. We observed a 5th grade class of three girls and seven boys. This was a class for exceptional children that included students with emotional and behavioral problems. Five of the students were Caucasian, three were African-American, and two were Native American. The instructor was an African-American woman in her twenties. She used an approachable and upbeat teaching style. She was careful to include all of the students in the lesson. Because this was a class for exceptional children, the teacher tailored the drug lesson to the students.=20 The teacher drew her lesson from health textbooks used in regular classes. The lesson lasted approximately 1 hour.=20 The teacher indicated that the length of the class and how much time she spends on the drug lesson generally depends both on her assessment of how much of the lesson the students are absorbing and their interest level. She indicated that drug prevention lessons are usually taught two or three times a week. The observed lesson was about learning how to make healthy choices. Topics included why people smoke and use drugs, how magazine advertisements promote smoking and drinking, and the differences between drugs that are helpful and harmful. The teacher covered a wide range of concepts, including how self-esteem and peer pressure contribute to drug use, the importance of reading warning labels on medications, and techniques advertisements use to glamorize drug use. The class format was primarily question and answer, and the teacher encouraged each student to participate. The teacher used a variety of visual aids, including charts, examples of magazine ads, and a collection of common medications that can be inappropriately used. For the most part, the students were very attentive. Most were eager to be called on and to participate in the class. The teacher encouraged participation by all the students. Summary This chapter focused on site visits to four schools in three school districts. Two of the schools were located in one rural school district; one of these schools had D.A.R.E. and one did not. The other two schools were located in adjacent school districts in an urban area; again, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did not. In both of the schools with D.A.R.E., limited participation of teachers, parents, and the community were reported. Both schools also mentioned having inadequate resources for the program. Neither school reported adapting the curriculum for any reason. In both schools, the need for ongoing, long-term evaluations was stressed. Neither of the non-D.A.R.E. schools had a specific drug prevention program. Both reported that implementation and coordination was sporadic. Both schools reported wanting one person who would be responsible for administering the drug prevention program in the school. CHAPTER 7 D.A.R.E. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT Project D.A.R.E. is a drug use prevention program with curricula targeted at elementary, middle, and senior high school students. The original core curriculum used in elementary schools is the subject of this review (a revised core curriculum will be implemented in September 1994). The junior and senior high school curricula are not included in the review because they are more recent, not as prevalent, and generally have not been evaluated.=20 Future evaluation efforts should focus on these curricula, as well as on the cumulative effects of the comprehensive program. The purpose of the current review is to assess the short-term effectiveness of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum by using meta-analytic techniques to synthesize the evaluation findings of several studies.=20 We searched for all D.A.R.E. evaluations, both published and unpublished, conducted over the past 10 years (i.e., since D.A.R.E. originated) and selected for further review those studies that met specified methodological criteria. To establish a comparable measure of effectiveness across studies, we calculated effect sizes for each study. In addition, to put D.A.R.E. in the context of other school-based drug use prevention programs, we compared the average magnitude of the effect sizes for D.A.R.E. with those of other programs that target youth of similar age. This chapter covers six topics. First, we briefly summarize the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Second, we provide some general background on meta-analysis and describe the methodological criteria used to select evaluations for the review. Third, we identify the eight studies that met the criteria and provide an overall description of these studies. Fourth, we examine the reported immediate effects of D.A.R.E., based on these studies. Fifth, we compare the D.A.R.E. effect sizes averaged across studies with the average effect sizes of other drug use prevention programs. Finally, we discuss several methodological considerations related to the evaluations included in our review that are important to interpretation of the results. Further discussion of the results is included in Chapter 8 of this report. The D.A.R.E. Core Curriculum The D.A.R.E. core curriculum is offered to pupils in the last year of elementary school, typically fifth or sixth grade. The 17 lessons in the core curriculum are usually offered once a week for 45 to 60 minutes. The lessons focus on teaching pupils the skills they need in order to recognize and resist social pressures to use drugs. In addition to information about drugs, lessons emphasize decisionmaking skills, building self-esteem, and choosing healthy alternatives to drug use. Officers use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, group discussions, question-and-answer sessions, audiovisual materials, workbook exercises, and role- plays. Several aspects of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum suggest that it should be successful as a drug use prevention curriculum. First, the curriculum includes elements of prevention strategies generally thought to be effective, such as emphasis on peer resistance and social competence skills (Botvin, 1990; Hansen, 1992). Interac- tive programs have shown more promise than those using more traditional teaching methods (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994), and at least some of D.A.R.E.'s teaching strategies encourage role-playing and interactions among pupils. Also, the core curriculum is offered to children at the age when they are believed to be most receptive to antidrug use messages, which is just before experimenta- tion with drugs begins (BJA, 1988; Oetting & Bauvais, 1990). In addition, the program targets cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana--the "gateway drugs" thatchildren tend to experiment with first (Ellickson, Hays, & Bell, 1992; Kandel, 1975). Finally, the structured nature of the curriculum and extensive training of the officers helps ensure that the program is implemented as designed (BJA, 1988). Meta-Analysis Background and Study Selection Criteria Meta-analysis is a methodology for integrating the research findings of a body of studies (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Cook et al., 1993). The purpose of meta-analysis is to discover whether some pattern of results is discernible in a set of studies pertaining to the same research question (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981; Rosenthal, 1991). Meta-analysis differs from a traditional narrative review of studies by providing statistical techniques for summarizing the research findings from the studies. By quantifying outcomes across studies and making them comparable with each other, meta-analysis provides an objective rather than subjective basis for drawing conclusions about patterns of study results. Three basic steps are commonly followed in conducting meta-analyses (Bangert-Drowns, 1986). First, all relevant studies are collected, and some studies are selected for inclusion according to a set of a priori defined methodological criteria. Second, effect sizes are calculated for each study. Effect sizes represent the statistical outcomes of each study transformed to a common metric. This transformation allows comparisons across different scales of different outcome measures.=20 Third, effect sizes for the set of studies are averaged.=20 In addition, explanations for variability in effect sizes across studies usually are tested. We followed these three steps in conducting our assessment of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum; we did not, however, examine possible causes of differences in outcomes across the D.A.R.E. studies (e.g., differences in D.A.R.E. outcomes by the racial/ethnic composition of the study samples). The relatively small number of D.A.R.E. studies precluded this type of analysis. In selecting studies, our review focused on student-based, quantitative evaluations of D.A.R.E. that measured program effects on drug use behavior and/or other outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, such as attitudes about drug use. Evaluations that reported only subjective assessments or satisfaction ratings are outside the scope of this review. We also did not consider the results of parent, teacher, administrator, or D.A.R.E. officer surveys, which sometimes were conducted as part of the total evaluation effort. (For information about the opinions of school district drug prevention coordinators concerning D.A.R.E., see Chapter 5.) It should be noted that there are many possible D.A.R.E. outcomes of importance other than the ones we examined in this meta-analysis, such as improved school and police relations and greater trust in law enforcement among youth. We attempted to locate all the quantitative evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum conducted to date through a survey of D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs, telephone interviews with individuals known to be involved with D.A.R.E., and computerized searches of the published and unpublished literature using several data bases. The computerized data bases included ERIC, PsychINFO, and Dissertation Abstracts Online.=20 Through the combined sources, we identified 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluations conducted in 12 States and one Canadian province. The location and primary reference for each evaluation are shown in Exhibit 7.1.=20 Several of the evaluations were reported in multiple reports or papers; we generally used the final, most complete report or the published paper for our review. From the 18 studies, we selected studies to include in our meta-analysis that met the following criteria:=20 (a) use of a control or comparison group; (b) pretest- posttest design or posttest only with random assignment; and (c) use of reliably operationalized quantitative outcome measures. Quasi-experimental studies were excluded if they did not control for preexisting differences on measured outcomes with either change scores or covariance adjusted means (Tobler, in press, 1994). In addition, to ensure the comparability of results, we used only results based on immediate posttest. There were an insufficient number of long-term evaluation studies to adequately assess the longer-term effects of the core curriculum. We selected these criteria because they help to ensure confidence in the study results by removing a number of alternative explanations, other than true D.A.R.E. impact, that could account for outcomes observed. For example, the first criterion, a comparison group made up of schools and/or subjects that did not receive the curriculum, makes it possible to determine whether changes in the D.A.R.E. youth are unique to them or are shared by other youth. If youth receiving and not receiving D.A.R.E. change on some outcome of interest, then the cause is due to some other factor, such as maturation, rather than to D.A.R.E. Pretest measures (the second criterion) are neededExhibit 7.1 D.A.R.E.Evaluation Studi= es (N=3D18) Location References British Columbia* (BC) Walker, 1990 California-A Becker, Agopian, & Yeh, 1992 California-B DeJong, 1987 California-C Evaluation and Training Institute, 1990 Colorado Dukes & Matthews, 1991 Hawaii* (HI) Manos, Kameoka, & Tanji, 1986 Illinois-A Kethineni, Leamy, & Guyon, 1991 Illinois-B Earle, Garner, & Phillips, 1987 Illinois-C* (IL) Ennett et al., 1994; Ringwalt, Curtin, & Rosenbaum, 1990; Rosenbaum et al., 1991, 1992 Indiana Aniskiewicz & Wysong, 1987,=20 1990 Kentucky-A* (KY-A) Clayton et al., 1991a, 1991b Kentucky-B* (KY-B) Faine & Bohlander, 1988, 1989 Minnesota* (MN) McCormick & McCormick, 1992 North Carolina* (NC) Ringwalt, Ennett, & Holt, 1991 Pennsylvania Anonymous, 1987 South Carolina* (SC) Harmon, 1993 Tennessee Faine & Bohlander, 1989 Virginia McDonald, Towberman, & Hague, 1990, 1991 *Study selected for further review (with State abbreviation). for testing the assumption that the D.A.R.E. and comparison groups are equivalent at the outset. In the absence of random assignment, this assumption must be tested. In addition, pretest measures provide a benchmark for evaluating changes in outcome measures after program implementation. Reliably operationalized measures of the outcomes of interest (the third criterion) are important for ensuring that the constructs intended to be measured are the ones actually measured.=20 For example, for assessing outcomes related to knowledge, attitudes, and skills, we considered multiple item scales to be more reliable than single-item measures. We also examined a number of other methodological features, such as the correspondence between the unit of assignment and unit of analysis, whether a panel design was used, whether schools in the intervention and comparison conditions were matched, and whether attrition rates were reported and examined. Although these factors were considered in assessing the overall methodological rigor of the studies, no evaluations were eliminated on the basis of these criteria. Studies Selected Eight of the original 18 evaluation studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. One additional study met the methodological criteria but did not administer the first posttest until 1 year after D.A.R.E. implementation and so could not be included in the analysis of immediate effects (Nyre & Rose, 1987; Nyre, Rose, & Bolus, 1987). The eight evaluations are indicated by an asterisk (*) in Exhibit 7.1.=20 Characteristics of the studies are summarized in Exhibit 7.2. A more complete description of each study is provided in Appendix B. Each of the evaluations represented a State or local (e.g., city, school district) effort using either the entire population of schools in a locale or a convenience sample. The number of student subjects in all studies was large; each study included at least 10 schools and approximately 500 to 2000 students in the combined D.A.R.E. and control groups. Demographic information about each sample, including gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and metropolitan status, was not consistently given across studies. Based on the information available, the samples were about equally divided between girls and boys; included white, black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian-American youth, with whites usually in the majority; and represented urban, suburban, and rural areas.=20 Information was generally not given on the SES of the sample. Assignment of D.A.R.E. to intervention and control groups was by school for all eight studies. In one study, D.A.R.E. was also assigned by classroom in certain schools (Manos et al., 1986). Because the control group classrooms in that study were potentially contaminated by their close proximity to D.A.R.E. classrooms, these control classrooms were eliminated; only control schools with no D.A.R.E. classes were included. Two of the studies used a true experimental design in which schools were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. or control conditions; a third study used random assignment for two-thirds of the schools. The remaining five evaluations used a nonequivalent control group quasi-experimental design.=20 For these, assignment was based on some other criterion; if the criterion was stated, usually it was the administrative convenience of either the school district or law enforcement agency.=20 A fundamental consideration in reviewing the studies was the equivalence of the D.A.R.E. and control groups before the intervention. Because there were relatively few sampling units across studies (ranging from 11 to 63 schools, with under 40 schools in all except one study), it is unlikely that equivalence between groups was obtained without prior matching or blocking of schools, even with randomization. Only half the studies matched comparison schools on selected demographic characteristics. The majority of studies (75%), however, assessed the equivalency of the comparison groups at pretest and made adjustments for pretest differences on demographic characteristics. All studies adjusted for pretest differences on outcome measures. Exhibit 7.2 Sample and Methodological Characteristics of theD.A.R.E.

All but one of the studiesused a pan= el design that matched subjects from pretest to posttest using a unique identification code. Outcome measures used in the studies were based on responses to self-administered questionnaires. Seven of the eight studies used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; six studies reported scale reliabilities (usually Cronbach's alpha) that were generally high. Validity information, however, was rarely reported, and none of the studies used either a biochemical indicator or "bogus pipeline"technique to validate self-reports of drug use. Informing youth that their self-reports of drug use will be verified by a biological specimen (e.g., saliva) or a purported lie detector (i.e., bogus pipeline) is believed to enhance the validity of their responses (Bauman & Dent, 1982). As is unfortunately typical of school-based evaluation studies, most (75%) of the D.A.R.E. evaluations did not use a data analysis strategy appropriate to the unit of assignment. Because schools, not students, were assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, it would have been appropriate to analyze the data by schools with subjects' data aggregated within each school or to use an analysis strategy that accounts for clustered data (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray & Hannan, 1990). Six of the studies ignored schools altogether and analyzed individual subjects' data, thereby violating the statistical assumption of independence of observations.=20 The result of ignoring schools as the unit of analysis is a positive bias toward finding statistically significant program effects (Murray & Hannan, 1990). Five of the studies reported attrition rates, which generally were small. None of the three studies that analyzed attrition rates found that attrition differed significantly across experimental and control conditions.=20 In addition, subjects absent from the posttest were not more likely to be drug users or at risk for drug use.=20 Although attrition usually is greater among drug users (Biglan & Ary, 1985), given the young age of the sample, when dropping out of school is unlikely and drug use prevalence is low, these results are not surprising. D.A.R.E. Effect Sizes To assess the impact of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum on youth drug use, as well as on other outcomes targeted by the curriculum, we calculated effect sizes. An effect size (ES) is defined as the difference between the mean for the intervention group (MeanI) and the mean for the control group (MeanC), standardized by dividing by the pooled standard deviation (SD): [ES =3D (MeanI - MeanC)/ SD] (Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Perry & Tobler, 1992; Rosenthal, 1991). If means and standard deviations are not available, effect sizes can be calculated using formulae developed to convert other test statistics (such as, t or F), as well as percentages, to effect sizes (Perry & Tobler, 1992). Effect sizes are expressed as standard deviation units and may be positive or negative. A positive effect size indicates an effect in the desired direction as a result of the intervention. An effect size of 1, for example, indicates that the intervention group performed one standard deviation unit better than the control group on some outcome of interest. Although there are no clear conventions for defining "small,""medium," and "large" effect sizes in the context of drug use prevention programs, review of several meta-analyses of adolescent drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1992 ) suggests that effect sizes below .15 reflect a small effect; effect sizes between .15 and .30 indicate a modest effect; and effect sizes above .30 reflect stronger program effects. For each of the eight D.A.R.E. studies, we calculated effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to six outcomes that reflect the aims of the D.A.R.E. curriculum. The six outcomes were knowledge about drugs, attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and self-reported drug use. We calculated effect sizes using the procedure appropriate for the summary statistics reported. In all cases, we used statistics reflecting covariance-adjusted means, with pretest values as covariates, rather than unadjusted means so that any differences between the comparison groups prior to the intervention would not be reflected in the effect sizes (Tobler, in press, 1994). Where possible, we used statistics that also were adjusted for sample demographic characteristics (six of eight studies). Some studies did not include all six outcomes of interest, and some outcomes were measured by more than one indicator. When multiple indicators were used, such as two measures of social skills, we calculated separate effect sizes and then averaged them. This procedure yielded one effect size per study for each type of measured outcome. In the one study that reported only that a measured outcome was not statistically significant and did not provide any further statistics, we assigned a value of zero to that effect size. To calculate effect sizes for reported drug use, we considered only alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use; we averaged effect sizes across these substances. In a supplementary analysis, we also considered use of these substances separately. Use of other drugs, such as cocaine, was measured by some studies, but the prevalence of use was too small to produce meaningful effects. The unweighted effect sizes at immediate posttest for each outcome for each study are shown in Exhibit 7.3.=20 Several of the effect sizes are .30 or higher, although most are less than .20. The largest effect sizes are for knowledge (that was only measured by three of the eight studies) and social skills. The effect sizes for self- esteem, attitudes about drug use, and attitude toward police tend to be smaller. The smallest effect sizes are for drug use, with none being greater than .11. The higher effect sizes for knowledge compared with drug use is consistent with other studies and supports the conclusion that knowledge is easier to change than behavior (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986).

In addition to calculating one effect size for each outcome for each study, we calculated the weighted mean effect size and 95% confidence interval for each type of outcome across the eight studies. The weighted mean provides a summary measure across the eight studies that is useful for indicating D.A.R.E.'s general effectiveness with respect to each outcome. The weighted mean provides a less biased estimate than the simple unweighted mean because estimates from larger samples are given more weight. It is computed by weighting each effect size by the inverse of its variance, which is a reflection of the sample size (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The effect size estimates from larger studies are generally more precise than those from smaller studies (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The 95% confidence interval provides an upper and lower bound for the estimate; in 95% of samples drawn, the estimate would fall within these bounds. To calculate the 95% confidence interval, 1.96 multiplied by the square root of one divided by the sum of the study weights is added to or subtracted from the mean (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The weighted mean effect size at immediate posttest and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome are depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The largest weighted mean effect size is for knowledge about drugs (0.42), followed by social skills (0.19), attitude toward police (0.13), attitudes about drug use (0.11), self-esteem (0.06), and drug use (0.06). The weighted mean effect sizes for knowledge, social skills, attitude toward police, attitudes about drug use, and self-esteem are statistically significant. The statistical significance of these D.A.R.E. effect sizes, however, should be interpreted cautiously because the significance may be positively influenced by the failure of most studies to account for data Exhibit 7.4 Magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s WeightedMean Effect Size (and 95% Confidence Interval), by Outcome Measures at Imme- diate Posttest clustered by school. The confidence interval for the weighted mean effect size for drug use overlaps with zero, meaning than it is not significantly different from zero. Because averaging alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use for the drug use effect size could obscure substantial differences among substances, we calculated D.A.R.E.'s weighted mean effect sizes separately for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. None of the individual effect sizes for any of the three substances from any study is larger than 0.15. The mean immediate effect size for alcohol use is 0.06 (95% CI: .00, .12); for tobacco use, 0.08 (95% CI: .02, .14); and for marijuana use, =FE0.01 (95% CI: =FE.09, .07). Only the mean for tobacco use is statistically significant. =20 The range of effect sizes, both individually by study and averaged across studies, suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective at immediate posttest in influencing some outcomes than others. The core curriculum has been most effective in increasing knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills.=20 Although some studies reported fairly large effect sizes for attitudes about drugs and attitude toward police, overall the studies show less D.A.R.E. success in influencing these factors and self-esteem. Based on these eight studies, the core curriculum has been least effective at immediate posttest at influencing drug use outcomes: alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The small effect sizes for drug use and attitudes about drugs and police reflect, at least in part, the low levels of drug use by this age group and their already negative attitudes about drugs and positive attitude toward police. Comparison of D.A.R.E.'s Effectiveness to Other Drug Use Prevention Programs for Youth To see how D.A.R.E. compares with other school- based drug use prevention programs, we compared the weighted mean D.A.R.E. effect sizes with weighted mean effect sizes computed for similar programs. For comparison, we used the effect sizes reported in Tobler's recent meta-analysis of school-based drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). To allow the most appropriate comparisons with D.A.R.E. effect sizes, we obtained Tobler's results for only those programs, excluding D.A.R.E., aimed at fifth and sixth graders.=20 Although pupils in the comparison programs were in the fifth and sixth grade, some sixth graders were in middle school, whereas all D.A.R.E. sixth graders were in elementary school. Like the D.A.R.E. studies, the interventions analyzed by Tobler were implemented in geographically diverse areas. Also similar to the D.A.R.E. studies, demographic information was not reported across all studies. The available data suggest that the studies in Tobler's review represented both white and minority populations and included urban, suburban, and rural areas with urban areas predominating.=20 These programs are a subset of 25 from the 114 programs included in Tobler's meta-analysis. The studies from Tobler's meta-analysis are referenced in Exhibit 7.5 and listed in Appendix C. We selected Tobler's meta-analysis for comparison because it is more similar to our review than other meta- analyses of drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986). Tobler's meta-analysis and ours used similar processes and criteria to identify and select program evaluations for examination and included both published and unpublished studies. Like the D.A.R.E. criteria, Tobler selected student-based quantitative evaluations that included a control or comparison group and used a pretest-posttest sign or posttest only with random assignment. In addition, Tobler reported separate weighted mean effect sizes for four categories of outcome measures that are comparable to four of our outcome measurements: knowledge, attitudes toward drugs, social skills, and drug use. The meta-analyses differed, however, in that Tobler excluded studies that did not measure drug use and that included results from later posttests. In addition, some of Tobler's programs focused on a single drug rather than on multiple drugs as in D.A.R.E.

Overall, the D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies are highly comparable in terms of program focus, study methodology, and target audience. In assessing the magnitude of the effect sizes reported for the Tobler studies, it should be noted that the studies typically did not correct for the correlation among students in the same school. As explained for the D.A.R.E. studies, this may produce inflated effect sizes.=20 Because neither the D.A.R.E. nor Tobler studies generally made adjustments for this interdependence of observations, the net effect on the comparison of effect sizes should be minimal. The evaluation studies included in Tobler's meta- analysis are classified into two broad categories based on typical combinations of program content and program process (process describes the teaching approach, or how the content is delivered): noninteractive (N=3D9) and interactive programs (N=3D16). =20 Noninteractive programs emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional teaching approaches.=20 Activities typically are designed to increase knowledge about drugs, boost self-esteem, promote self-awareness, increase problem-solving skills, and promote values clarifications. These activities, in turn, are expected to encourage youth to make a personal decision to abstain from using drugs. Program content is usually introduced by the teacher in a didactic manner, and participatory activities often involve teacher-led discussions. Interactive programs emphasize interpersonal factors and use a participatory teaching approach.=20 Activities are designed to counter peer pressure to use drugs through developing drug refusal skills, promoting general social competencies, and correcting beliefs about the prevalence of drug use among peers. Program process emphasizes the interaction and exchange of ideas among peers, and it encourages active participation of all students in the classroom, particularly in small groups. Consistent with other meta-analyses showing that programs emphasizing social skills tend to be the most effective at achieving their outcomes (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986), Tobler's interactive programs produced larger effect sizes in all four outcome measures than noninteractive programs. Because D.A.R.E. has features of both noninteractive and interactive programs, we compared D.A.R.E. with both categories of programs.=20 The weighted mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals by outcome for the D.A.R.E. studies and the two types of comparison programs are shown in Exhibit 7.6.=20 To test whether the mean effect sizes differed significantly between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive programs and between D.A.R.E. and the interactive programs, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval around the difference between the means. If the confidence interval spans zero, this indicates that the difference between the two effect size means is not statistically significant. Conversely, if the confidence interval does not include zero, then the means are determined to be significantly different; that is, the D.A.R.E. mean is significantly greater or less than the mean for the comparison programs. The difference between the weighted mean effect sizes for D.A.R.E. and both noninteractive and interactive programs and 95% confidence intervals are shown in Exhibit 7.7. In addition, Exhibit 7.7 indicates whether the difference favors D.A.R.E. or the comparison programs.

For knowledge about drugs, the mean immediate effect size achieved by D.A.R.E. (0.42) is substantially and statistically significantly higher than the mean effect size for noninteractive programs (0.16). The D.A.R.E. effect size is lower than that of interactive programs (0.53), but the difference is not significant. For attitudes about drugs, the mean immediate effect size achieved by D.A.R.E. (0.11) is larger than the mean achieved by noninteractive programs (0.06); the difference is not statistically significant. The D.A.R.E. effect size is significantly less than the mean for interactive programs (0.33). The same pattern is observed for skills. The mean D.A.R.E. immediate effect size (0.19) is larger than for noninteractive programs (0.08) but smaller than for interactive programs (0.76). The difference in means between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive programs is not statistically significant, whereas the D.A.R.E. mean is significantly less than for interactive programs. For drug use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana averaged together), the mean immediate effect sizes achieved by D.A.R.E. (0.06) and noninteractive programs (0.08) are not significantly different.

The D.A.R.E. effect sizes for all three substances are significantly smaller than the comparable effect sizes for interactive programs. A comparison of D.A.R.E. effect sizes with effect sizes of noninteractive and interactive drug use prevention programs for fifth and sixth graders reviewed by Tobler suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and skills outcomes than noninteractive programs, although only the knowledge difference is statistically significant. D.A.R.E. has been less effective, however, than interactive programs across all outcome measures, most prominently for social skills and drug use. The only difference in effect size means between D.A.R.E. and interactive programs that was not statistically significant was for knowledge. For drug use, the average effect size for interactive programs was three times greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times greater than D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times greater. These findings suggest that greater effectiveness is possible with school-based drug use prevention programs for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils than is achieved by the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Methodological Considerations Several methodological considerations relating to the evaluations included in our review and to the approach we used in conducting our review bear on the interpretation of the results. Fundamental considerations are whether the D.A.R.E. evaluations selected for review are methodologically strong and are sufficient in number. As is appropriate for meta-analysis, we used stated and objective criteria to select D.A.R.E. evaluations for review. Because the evaluations we selected had a comparison group, administered both pretests and posttests, used quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures, we can be reasonably confident in their findings. Eight evaluations were included in the review; this is not a large number compared with the vast number of sites where D.A.R.E. has been implemented. It far exceeds, however, the number of evaluations of any other widely available drug use prevention program. Most prevention programs developed and evaluated by researchers have been much less widely implemented, and have received less scrutiny, than D.A.R.E. More important, however, when considering the adequacy of the number of studies, are the uniformity of D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content and method of delivery across implementation sites, and the consistent results found across geographically heterogeneous studies. This uniformity and consistency suggest that a sufficient number of evaluations were identified for assessment of the original core curriculum's immediate effects. Even so, we would have preferred a full set of eight effect sizes for each outcome. The immediate effect sizes for the D.A.R.E. studies may have been attenuated compared with the comparison drug use prevention programs because the control groups were not pure "no treatment" groups. As documentedby Tobler (1986, in press, 1994), effect sizes are lower when the control group receives some sort of drug education. Information generally was lacking from the D.A.R.E. evaluations on alternative interventions received by the control groups, but it is likely that most control groups received some drug education because the studies occurred after the passage of the 1986 DFSCA.=20 However, approximately half (54%) of the comparison programs used for Tobler's study also were conducted between 1986 and 1990, suggesting that they also may suffer from the same effect. Nevertheless, the lower effect sizes of the D.A.R.E. programs compared with the interactive programs in Tobler's study could be due in part to the likelihood that the control groups for the D.A.R.E. studies received a stronger intervention than did the control groups in the studies reviewed by Tobler. Most of the drug use prevention programs evaluated by Tobler are smaller-scale university research-based evaluation studies, while D.A.R.E. is a widely available curriculum. In both cases, however, the interventions were implemented by service providers and the evaluations were conducted by researchers. Even so, the intensity of efforts devoted to interventions conducted for evaluation research may be greater, the implementation conditions more optimal, and the possibility for scrutiny and control greater than would be the case for a program that is widely disseminated. Some diminished effectiveness may be inevitable once programs are implemented under real-world conditions. This could be an important factor in explaining some of the differences in effect sizes between D.A.R.E. and the comparison programs. Differences in the studies selected for our D.A.R.E. review and selected by Tobler could also contribute to the relative differences in effect sizes between these programs. The differences include the exclusion of studies by Tobler that did not evaluate drug use behavior and the inclusion of outcomes from later posttests. In addition, some sixth graders in the programs reviewed by Tobler were in middle rather than elementary school, and some programs focused on a single drug, such as tobacco, rather than multiple drugs as is the case with D.A.R.E. It is possible that these differences could decrease, increase, or not change the relative differences in effect sizes. For example, differences might have been less if programs focused on a single substance were not included in Tobler's meta- analysis. It is possible that single substance programs have greater impact on use of that substance than generic drug education programs, although study of this possibility is limited and findings are mixed (Tobler, 1994). On the other hand, differences might have been greater had Tobler excluded results from posttests beyond immediate follow-up because curriculum effects tend to decay rather than increase with time (Ellickson, Bell, & McGuigan, 1993; Murray, Pirie, Luepker, & Pallonen, 1989). The limited number of programs precluded assessment of these possibilities, as well as whether program effects differ, and in what direction, for sixth graders in elementary versus middle school. Finally, it is possible that our results might have differed if there had been sufficient numbers of D.A.R.E. evaluations and studies in Tobler's analysis to analyze effect sizes while controlling the effects of other factors. In addition to the differences between the D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies described above, it is possible that other factors may have varied across the intervention programs and associated evaluation studies that contributed to the observed differences in effect sizes. For example, substantial variation in characteristics of the students (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- experimental design) could have contributed to the differences in program effects. In other words, some of the differences in effect sizes observed between the D.A.R.E. studies and Tobler's studies could have been due to other factors than the type of program.=20 Unfortunately, these possibilities could not be tested because of the small number of studies. Further testing is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. Summary From a pool of 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluation studies identified by this review, eight met specified methodological criteria and were selected for further review. Each of these eight evaluations had a control group, administered both pretests and posttests, used quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures.=20 Effect sizes for these studies at immediate posttest, both individually by study and averaged across studies, showed that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum had strong and statistically significant effects on knowledge about drugs. The curriculum also had a positive and significant impact on social skills. The core curriculum had smaller, although statistically significant, effects on attitudes about drug use, attitude toward the police, and self-esteem. The curriculum had limited immediate effects on use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.=20 Although the effect on tobacco use was small, it was statistically significant. Weighted mean effect sizes were used to compare D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug use prevention programs targeted at same-age youth. The original D.A.R.E. core curriculum compared favorably with noninteractive drug use prevention programs, which emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional teaching methods. The original core curriculum compared less favorably, however, with interactive drug use prevention programs. Interactive drug use prevention programs, which emphasize interpersonal skills and an interactive teaching style, have been shown to be the most successful drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). Several methodological considerations should be noted in interpreting the results of this review. These include the number of methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies in our review; the purity of the control groups in the D.A.R.E. evaluations compared with those in the comparison programs; and the relative impacts of commercial programs such as D.A.R.E. and smaller scale research-based interventions; and the small number of D.A.R.E. and comparison studies available for assessing other potential explanations for differences in program effectiveness. The findings of the D.A.R.E. outcome assessment are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS In preceding chapters, we presented data acquired from our implementation and outcome assessments of D.A.R.E. Information about D.A.R.E.'s operations, prevalence, and effectiveness was collected from a variety of sources. Given the complex nature of the D.A.R.E. organization, it is not surprising that the findings are voluminous. Nor is it surprising that although some findings attest to the strengths and robustness of D.A.R.E., others indicate limitations.=20 This final chapter presents a discussion of these findings. In the course of this discussion, we highlight the key findings and, where appropriate, make recommendations for programmatic changes and additional research. =20 This chapter is organized into three sections.=20 Highlights from the implementation assessment are presented in the first section, followed by key findings from the outcome assessment. To facilitate a review of the study's many and sometimes disparate findings, our discussion is organized by some of the questions that guided these study components. In the final section, we attempt to synthesize the most important findings and present overall conclusions derived from the study. Implementation Assessment As discussed in Chapter 1, we conducted an implementation assessment of D.A.R.E. that had two primary objectives. These were, first, to conduct an assessment of the organizational structure and operation of representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide to learn what factors contribute to the effective implementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide and, second, to determine how D.A.R.E. is tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. To address these issues, we collected data from sources at all levels of the multi-layered D.A.R.E. institution. We presented information concerning operations at the national and regional level of D.A.R.E. in Chapter 3, State-level operations in Chapter 4, and local-level operations in Chapters 5 and 6. We obtained information from interviews with Glenn Levant of D.A.R.E. America and with coordinators and/or educational advisors from each of the five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), a review of available BJA documents, a survey of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators, a survey of a nationally representative sample of school district drug prevention coordinators, and site visits to four purposively selected schools (two with D.A.R.E. and two without). How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide, and how does D.A.R.E.'s prevalence compare with that of other curricula? One of the most important findings of this study was the extraordinary prevalence of D.A.R.E. In the 1991-1992 school year, 44 of the 50 States had State coordinators fortheir D.A.R.E. programs. Based on our sampleof school districts, we estimate that over half the districts in the country implemented at least one of the D.A.R.E. curricula in one or more of their schools. In comparison, the two other most prevalent prevention programs, Quest and Here's Looking at You (HLY), were used in at least one school in about 27% and 24% of the districts, respectively. Another important finding is that the demand for D.A.R.E. over the next 5 years is going to increase substantially. Over 40% of the districts with D.A.R.E. planned to expand its use. Of those districts without D.A.R.E., 21% expressed the intention to institute it, and 20% reported that they were as yet undecided about using D.A.R.E. Slightly over half of all school districts implemented D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum, which is targeted at 5th- and 6th-grade pupils; around 17% implemented the K-4 curriculum, 11% the junior high school curriculum, and 3% the senior high curriculum. Around 12% of the school districts used Quest at the elementary level, 22% at the middle/junior high school level, and 3% at the senior high school level. Around 22% of the school districts used HLY at the elementary level, 14% at the middle/junior high school level, and 9% at the senior high level. =20 Does the extent of D.A.R.E. implementation vary by demographic characteristics of school districts, such as geographic region, urbanicity, SES, and minority status? How does D.A.R.E. compare with other curricula in this regard? The Midwest region had the highest percentage of districts using D.A.R.E. (59.9%) , followed by the Southeast (56.8%), East (55.8%), West (48.8%), and Southwest (37.1%). Use of Quest was highest in the Midwest region (35.8%) and use of HLY was highest in the East (46.4%). Use of all three prevention programs was lowest in the Southwest region. The lower rates of program use in the Southwest can probably be largely attributed to its rural nature, and thus the greater difficulties in fielding D.A.R.E. officers to geographically dispersed schools. There were no statistically significant differences in the use of D.A.R.E., Quest, or HLY by either the minority status or SES of the school districts.=20 Urban/suburban school districts were, however, significantly more likely to use D.A.R.E. and HLY than rural districts. Further, large districts were significantly more likely than small districts to use D.A.R.E. We suspect that these findings may be attributed to the relatively greater resources available to urban and large law enforcement agencies. In the case of D.A.R.E., these agencies may be at greater liberty to free up their officers' time to teach D.A.R.E. It is difficult to determine what adjustments might make D.A.R.E. more accessible to rural and small school districts. We believe that ways of improving access to D.A.R.E. in rural and small districts should be examined.=20 For example, methods for distributing DFSCA funds to favor rural and small school districts instead of distribution solely on a per capita basis could be explored. =20 How well integrated is D.A.R.E. with other drug use prevention programs offered in schools? Neither D.A.R.E. nor any other drug prevention program can or should stand alone in a school district; instead, such programs should be integrated into a comprehensive curriculum that is developmentally appropriate and implemented at every grade level.=20 Indeed, all school districts receiving DFSCA funds must implement a comprehensive K-12 drug prevention program.=20 Even were a school district to implement all four of D.A.R.E.'s student curricula, additional drug prevention programming would still be required in the grades to which D.A.R.E. was not directed. Our survey showed that only 2% of the school districts used only D.A.R.E. and no other drug prevention program. Almost two-thirds of the school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported that the program was "very well" integrated with other prevention programs. How does D.A.R.E. compare with other alcohol and other drug (AOD) programs in terms of support and satisfaction for the programs? The school district drug prevention coordinators indicated that support for D.A.R.E. is very strong not only among students and school staff=FEwhose support the coordinators rated as very high=FEbut also among parents and the community. These ratings were also markedly higher than those for other AOD programs.=20 The responses of the coordinators also indicated the high regard in which the D.A.R.E. curricula are held.=20 Two-thirds of the school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated the curricula, as well as how it is taught, as "very satisfactory"; over three-quartersgave the same rating to how students receive it. This endorsement is all the more vivid when contrasted with coordinators' ratings of other AOD prevention programs; only one-third of coordinators with other AOD programs rated these programs as highly. =20 A close examination of these findings reveals that coordinators in districts with a high percentage of minority students were more likely to rate students' receptivity to D.A.R.E. as very high than those in districts serving predominantly white students. This finding is not confounded by the district's urbanicity or SES because comparisons between coordinators from these pairs of districts (i.e., by high and low SES and by rural and urban/surburban) were not statistically significant. =20 Of even greater importance are the satisfaction ratings that the prevention coordinators gave to D.A.R.E.'s effects on students. Almost two-thirds of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. indicated that they were very satisfied with D.A.R.E.'s effects; less than one-quarter of those with other AOD programs reported that they were very satisfied with the effects of these AOD programs.=20 Are D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs adapted to a community's particular needs? D.A.R.E. is distinguished by the integrity and consistency with which its curricula are administered.=20 During their training, D.A.R.E. officers are instructed not to deviate in any substantive fashion from the curriculum. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum allows only one modification--a gang activity lesson that can be added in schools where gangs are perceived to be a problem. Over two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over half of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported that the curriculum had been adapted at least to some degree, however modest. The most frequently mentioned reason for adaptation of both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs was drug availability at their schools. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. provided some hints as to the types of topics introduced, which included discussing specific locally prevalent drugs, drug abuse at home, and local drug arrests. During the site visit to the urban school district, we learned that some police officers incorporate their own street experiences into their lessons. The second and third most frequently mentioned reasons for adaptation for D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs were student/community poverty and racial/ethnic composition. Although we recognize that some tailoring of D.A.R.E. to the needs of a particular audience may be appropriate, we encourage fidelity to the curricula and careful monitoring of officer presentation. We strongly suggest that current procedures of notifying the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board curriculum committee of limitations in the curricula and of substantive modifications of the curricula originating from that agency be continued. Allowing officers to modify the program at will would quickly result in disintegration of the curriculum and the program. To what extent are classroom teachers and other community members or agencies involved in D.A.R.E.? The original core curriculum, which was in use when the survey was conducted, encouraged classroom teachers to remain in the classroom and to communicate D.A.R.E.'s objectives to students. However, teachers played little active part in the actual instruction. Teachers and D.A.R.E. officers together teach the junior and senior high curricula; at the senior high level, they are even trained together. According to the drug prevention coordinators, teachers in almost 90% of the districts remained in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons, and in 84% teachers were reported as "actively involved"in D.A.R.E. The revised core curriculum encourages classroom teachers to take a more active role. D.A.R.E. officers already are expected to meet for an hour or so with the classroom teachers in a brief, structured orientation and discussion. To the extent that time and resources permit, we encourage the co-training of teachers and officers at every curricular level because we believe that such training would enhance effective communication and coordination between the two.=20 =20 One of D.A.R.E.'s strengths is the active involvement of individuals in D.A.R.E., both within and outside of the school. Half of the prevention coordinators reported that school staff, other than classroom teachers, were actively involved in D.A.R.E., and almost one-quarter reported that civic groups were actively involved. This level of involvement surely makes a major contribution to the high level of enthusiasm that D.A.R.E. generates. We note that only a relatively few coordinators reported that "youthgroups" were involved in D.A.R.E. We recommend increasing the involvement of both youth and church groups as a way to reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message and to help establish anti-drug use norms throughout the school and community.=20 About half of the coordinators reported that parents were actively involved in D.A.R.E. Our site visits, however, suggested that parents tend to be rather detached. D.A.R.E.'s efforts to reach out to parents through the parent curriculum are commendable and, we hope, will prove successful. Many such efforts in the past have proved futile because the parents who are most in need of educational intervention are also the most difficult to reach and most resistant to attending meetings. One additional method to involve parents more directly in D.A.R.E. is to assign specific parent-child homework exercises that, at the very least, will open vital lines of communication between parent and child concerning drug use. A second method that could supplement the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum would be to develop a freestanding, 1-hour video. This video could be used to provide an introduction to D.A.R.E. and a synopsis of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, as to well as provide information about how to effectively reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message. It might, for instance, include advice about how to talk to youth about drugs and stress the importance of serving as a model for a drug-free life. We, thus, recommend that D.A.R.E. consider and weigh the relative merits of a variety of strategies designed to reach parents who may not respond to the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum. What role, if any, do D.A.R.E. officers have in treatment referral for students who already have substance abuse problems? An additional role that D.A.R.E. officers can undertake is to serve as members of student assistance program (SAP) teams. Of the school districts that had both SAPs and D.A.R.E., 37% had D.A.R.E. officers who had been trained to participate in the district's SAP. Most of the coordinators rated D.A.R.E. officers as highly as they did guidance counselors (and much higher than teachers) in effectiveness in implementing SAPs. We recommend that D.A.R.E. officers become familiar with SAPs in their schools and, when feasible, become involved in these programs. We also recommend that the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board establish procedures for officers to follow when their work with SAPs comes in conflict with their duties as a police officer, so that the confidentiality of youth and their parents who have drug problems may be maintained. How is D.A.R.E. managed at the national, regional, and State level, and what are the major responsibilities of the governing bodies? At the national level, all D.A.R.E. operations are overseen by D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization that bears ultimate responsibility for promoting, monitoring, and overseeing the program. In this capacity, D.A.R.E. America is assisted by a number of regional and State organizations. These include five RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the accreditation of State-level training centers and monitor the fidelity with which the D.A.R.E. curriculum is taught at the local level. Educational specialists representing the RTCs, together with staff from the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) and assisted by a Scientific Advisory Committee, also make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning modifications to the various D.A.R.E. curricula. State-level D.A.R.E. entities include chartered nonprofit D.A.R.E. organizations designed to support the program in that State; such organizations currently exist in over one-third of the States, and it is expected that they will be chartered in all 50. In those States that currently lack such an organization, there is typically a State employee designated as a D.A.R.E. coordinator. In addition, 42 States currently have developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. Updating and improving curricular materials and teaching strategies is a difficult task. We commend D.A.R.E. America for convening a Scientific Advisory Committee, and for choosing Dr. Kleber as committee chair. It is our understanding that the committee's charge is an expansive one and includes reviewing current and ongoing D.A.R.E. evaluations, and integrating relevant findings from other evaluations of school-based drug prevention programs. We recognize the constraints that D.A.R.E. faces in updating the curricula, given the considerable costs required to retrain D.A.R.E. officers appropriately. Hence, it is probably not feasible to make substantive changes to the curricula more frequently than once every 5 years, at a minimum. Another source of expertise that should be tapped as input for curricular changes is the U.S. Department of Education. Various D.A.R.E. materials encourage the establishment of strong ties between D.A.R.E. and education at both the State and local levels. At the national level, an educational consultant from each of the five RTCs make suggestions concerning the curricula.=20 However, it is our understanding that this group lacks representation from a national-level education agency.=20 We thus recommend thatthe D.A.R.E. America request anappropriate member of= the U.S. Department of Education to serve as an ex officio member, who should represent the department's extensive drug prevention program. Such an individual would be able to provide D.A.R.E. America with guidance as to how effectively to integrate D.A.R.E. into the Department of Education's comprehensive, K-12 drug prevention strategy.=20 Furthermore, the inclusion of a U.S. Department of Education staff member seems particularly appropriate as long as D.A.R.E. continues to be mentioned as a specific line item on the DFSCA budget. =20 State coordinators informed us that over one-third of the States had policy advisory boards (PABs), a proportion that may have increased in the 2 years since our survey. Because PABs can be instrumental in developing and maintaining communications and positive relationships among the various agencies involved in D.A.R.E., we recommend that all States establish such boards. The great majority of the PABs comprise representatives of both State and local law enforcement and education. Other key individuals from the community who have a stake in the success of D.A.R.E. or who could provide different and valuable perspectives on D.A.R.E. were less well represented. These include parents, members of community-based organizations, citizens-at- large, members of associations of educators, and business representatives. The latter could be particularly helpful in securing resources for D.A.R.E. We thus recommend that State-level PABs systematically examine their representation and seek ways to reach out to new and potentially useful constituencies by expanding their membership. Because of the unique partnership between D.A.R.E. and education, it is critical that State-level D.A.R.E. operations have strong ties to education at the State level. Around one-third of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported a great deal of communication with the State Department of Education, and another 50% reported having at least some communication. We also note that one State D.A.R.E. coordinator was affiliated with a State Department of Education, and that three PABs were chaired by staff members from State or local education departments. The need to improve communication with their State's education departments was mentioned by several State D.A.R.E. coordinators. One way to improve communication between D.A.R.E. and education is for State D.A.R.E. programs to retain educational consultants to act as liaisons. Two-thirds of the State coordinators reported employing such a consultant, and almost all of the States without educational consultants considered acquiring a full-time educational consultant to be priority. We recommend that all State D.A.R.E. programs secure educational consultants. In a few States, the State D.A.R.E. programs employed their own educational consultants. In most States, however, educational consultants were employed by education departments. We believe the liaison between law enforcement and education will be most effective if the consultants are based in the State Departments of Education. Ideally, to ensure a maximum level of coordination both with the State Departments of Education as a whole and with their drug-free schools program in particular, these consultants should be members of the departments' alcohol and drug prevention offices.=20 Certainly, regardless of whether the education consultants are employed by education or directly by the State D.A.R.E. program, they should seek all appropriate means to establish meaningful affiliations with State- level educational agencies. By the same token, education agencies should be apprised of=FEand take seriously=FEtheir responsibility to include D.A.R.E. representatives in planning statewide drug prevention activities. To be truly effective, education and law enforcement need to work together in a partnership at the national and State levels as well as at the local level. Educational consultants' roles may vary, but besides providing a "bridge" between the two organizations, the consultants should help ensure that D.A.R.E.'s multiple curricula fit into a comprehensive, developmentally appropriate drug prevention program.=20 Several coordinators mentioned that consultants could assist with program evaluation and with monitoring officer performance in the classroom. It may be appropriate to consider expanding the roles of educational consultants further, perhaps to provide assistance in these areas. =20 How is D.A.R.E. managed at the local level? At the local level, the majority of the D.A.R.E. programs were managed by a single law enforcement agency, primarily the sheriff's or city/town police department.=20 Officer selection and classroom activities was most frequently mentioned as the responsibility of the police department, selection of D.A.R.E. classrooms was the responsibility of the school administration and staff, and responsibility for selection of D.A.R.E. schools was shared by the police department, school administration and staff, and the school superintendent.=20 In a number of places throughout this report, we have mentioned that D.A.R.E. is a collaborative venture between a local school district and a law enforcement agency, and we have emphasized the importance of developing a positive relationship between the two from the outset. One way to foster this relationship at the local level is with written agreements that clearly state the roles and responsibilities of each. Less than half of the drug prevention coordinators mentioned that their districts had such an agreement. We recognize that some of the coordinators responding to our survey may simply not have known that a written agreement existed, particularly if they were new in their position and the agreement had been written before they were employed. We recommend that the law enforcement agencies without such agreements secure them. Furthermore, we recommend that the agreements be reviewed with school administration/ staff at least every other year. This biennial review would ensure that all parties are aware of their responsibilities and could also serve as forums to discuss issues relating to D.A.R.E.'s implementation and to develop additional ways in which the D.A.R.E. officer can serve the schools. They could also provide opportunities for the school district to recognize the officer's contribution. Another way to engender a positive collaboration between law enforcement and education is by developing close liaisons between the D.A.R.E. officer and classroom teacher. Such liaisons have obvious benefits, including providing a role model for new officers, sharing the burden of difficult classes or difficult students, and increasing the likelihood that the teacher will reinforce the D.A.R.E. message in other areas of instruction. We learned from the drug prevention coordinators' survey that classroom teachers in almost three-quarters of the school districts with D.A.R.E. now integrate the D.A.R.E. message into their other activities in the classroom, so that the program has a strong foundation in this area on which to build. We thus recommend that D.A.R.E. officers spend more time consulting with classroom teachers, both formally at the beginning of the semester and informally as the semester progresses. Topics for conversation should include both the content of the D.A.R.E. curriculum and how teachers can effectively articulate an anti-drug message. What funding mechanisms are at the national/regional, State, and local levels? At the national/regional level, funding is received primarily from BJA. The RTC coordinators mentioned the need to find permanent funding sources that will supplement Federal support and make D.A.R.E. less vulnerable to the vicissitudes of such funding. One solution to this issue is to establish or strengthen reliance on State or local support, particularly the latter. =20 The majority of State D.A.R.E. programs receive funding from BJA grants; around one-fourth of the States received funding from governors' grants, grants from other State agencies, and legislative funds. Four States reported that they received no funding for their State- level operations, and around one-third mentioned that maintaining and increasing their funding or locating new funding sources were among the most significant issues facing them. If they are to discharge multiple responsibilities for developing and managing their D.A.R.E. programs successfully, the States must have sufficient support. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board explore further the various sources of support used by the State programs, and how these have been obtained, and then provide technical assistance to those States that currently operate with either no funding or whose funding is precariously low.=20 D.A.R.E. America could perhaps play a role in assisting the development and maintenance of the STCs by providing modest grant programs to assist States. =20 At the local level, the cost of assigning a police officer to deliver D.A.R.E. is assumed by the local city or county law enforcement agency, and thus, ultimately, by the community. Only a small minority of prevention coordinators (one in six) indicated that program costs were a barrier to implementation. D.A.R.E. America assumes the costs of program curriculum materials. The coordinators also informed us that primary support for D.A.R.E. came from law enforcement, but that DFSCA funds also played a major role in supporting D.A.R.E., as did (to a lesser extent) school district funds. We note that non-D.A.R.E. drug prevention programs appear much more dependent on DFSCA funds than does D.A.R.E. Given projected cuts in the DFSCA budget, which we understand may amount to as much as 25% in the near future, D.A.R.E.'s relative lack of reliance on DFSCA funds will prove beneficial. We also note that D.A.R.E. is relatively less dependent on local funds than are non- D.A.R.E. programs, which also decreases D.A.R.E.'s vulnerability to cuts as competing demands increase ever tighter budgets. How adequately does D.A.R.E. training meet the needs of an expanding and changing program? As noted earlier, the core curriculum has recently been revised, and the new version is currently being implemented. Because of D.A.R.E.'s magnitude, curricular changes are far-reaching and, thus, expensive and time- consuming to implement. Therefore, modifications to any of the D.A.R.E. curricula must necessarily be weighed against the substantial costs associated with updating and distributing material, as well as retraining D.A.R.E. officers. Nevertheless, modifications to the curricula will need to be made periodically if D.A.R.E. is to remain on the "cutting edge" of drug prevention programming.=20 To reduce the burden on D.A.R.E. of keeping officers up-to-date with modifications to the curriculum, the RTCs should explore novel means to provide officers with curriculum and teaching updates and to provide formal in-service training on a periodic basis. One in- service training method that should be considered is the use of the Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).=20 Because a substantial and growing number of police and sheriffs' departments are linked to this network, it could be an effective and cost-efficient means of providing high-quality in-service programming to D.A.R.E. officers around the country. Ideally, such a system should be interactive to allow for discussions between officers and trainers. Another less costly and more accessible method that could be explored is the use of videotaped programs to explain and demonstrate changes to curricula and teaching methods. Still another alternative is to use an on-line computer billboard to distribute the latest D.A.R.E. information. This method could be made available at very low cost to all police departments with computers and modems. We learned from the January 1992 D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board minutes that such a system was being developed by D.A.R.E. America and indeed may now be in place. In-service training should clearly not be restricted to teaching D.A.R.E. officers how to implement modifications to existing curricula. Such training could also serve to increase the competence of newly minted officers over their first semester. Regardless of how powerful and effective the initial 80-hour introduction to D.A.R.E. is, D.A.R.E. officers are bound to forget some of what they have been taught when, 3 months later, they are teaching one of the final D.A.R.E. lessons for the first time. One potentially useful device would be to develop and distribute taped versions of an expert D.A.R.E. officer delivering the curriculum to real classrooms, which new officers could be encouraged to review immediately prior to the first time they teach the lesson. Such tapes could serve several purposes: to reinforce the content of what should be taught, to model how the lesson should be taught, and to teach classroom management techniques. Each videotape might highlight dealing with a special problem (e.g., how to generate a discussion when students tend to be silent; how to draw out a shy or largely silent child; and how to respond when a child discloses drug use by a peer, friend, or family member). Each of these tapes should be relatively short (or they will not be viewed) but could be followed by a summary of the key points the officer should keep in mind in teaching the next lesson. The tapes would also help ensure that a primary goal of D.A.R.E. be reached-- that lessons be taught uniformly. Another training issue confronting the RTCs is the development and maintenance of STCs. As D.A.R.E. continues to grow=FEand our study has demonstrated that demand for D.A.R.E. shows no signs of abatement=FEthe RTCs will become increasingly challenged to meet the training and monitoring needs of their constituent States. The development and maintenance of STCs is critical because the RTCs cannot assume the multiple burdens of training, mentoring, and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers, as well as assisting local law enforcement in developing and maintaining effective ties with school districts. RTC coordinators indicated that training and monitoring officers already strain the capacities of the RTCs. We recommend that sufficient funding be appropriated to establish and/or maintain an STC in every State. =20 D.A.R.E. officers are not the only D.A.R.E. staff in need of ongoing training and technical assistance; several RTC coordinators indicated that many of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators have a similar need. RTC coordinators also indicated that State coordinators need support in developing lines of communication and authority with local-level law enforcement agencies and school districts, many of which have been operating with a fair degree of autonomy or have been used to dealing directly with the RTCs. It might be helpful if the RTCs brought together their constituent State coordinators at least yearly to discover and discuss common needs and concerns and provide technical assistance to the coordinators as a group as appropriate. However, the need will still exist for resources to support individual consultation between the RTCs and their respective State coordinators. As we mentioned earlier, the demand for D.A.R.E. in school districts that currently lack the program is likely to be exacerbated by the lack of available D.A.R.E. officers. Fully 60% of the school districts indicated that they want either to begin or increase their use of D.A.R.E. Some of the RTC staff indicated training may not be able to keep up with the demand for D.A.R.E. Almost 15% of the drug prevention coordinators identified lack of sufficient officers as a barrier to implementing D.A.R.E. This problem was illustrated in the urban D.A.R.E. school district we visited, where lack of available officers led to dissatisfaction on the part of school officials as officers were moved from one school to another to accommodate demand. Clearly, those communities in which D.A.R.E. is a high priority but which lack sufficient D.A.R.E. instructors should provide greater support to their law enforcement agencies to recruit and train additional officers. Further, the surprisingly high prevalence of the relatively new junior and high school D.A.R.E. curricula suggests that each community should examine the extent of the perceived need for each D.A.R.E. curriculum and develop a long-range plan to identify and fund additional officers as necessary. Any substantive curricular changes affecting what, and especially how, D.A.R.E. officers teach, should be accompanied by a determined effort to ensure that these changes are fully reflected in officer behavior in the classroom. The RTC coordinators clearly stressed the need for increasing officer monitoring in the field as well. Monitoring officers, however, is only part of the task. Adequate resources should also be made available to allow mentors to work closely with officers whose performance needs improvement. Outcome Assessment The D.A.R.E. outcome assessment, described in Chapter 7, had four primary objectives. These were (a) to identify prior studies of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness as a drug use prevention program, (b) to assess the quality and adequacy of the methodologies of these studies, (c) to summarize D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness based on this research, and (d) to compare D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs. We focused our assessment on the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is the heart of the D.A.R.E. program. We did not include the junior high school, senior high school, and other D.A.R.E. curricula in the outcome assessment because they are more recent, not as prevalent, and generally have yet to be evaluated.=20 Future evaluation efforts should focus on these curricula, as well as on the revised core curriculum implemented in September 1994. Questions that guided the outcome assessment are discussed in this section. What were the scope, reliability, and technical quality of the D.A.R.E. assessments? A number of States and smaller localities have been actively involved in assessing the D.A.R.E. core curriculum since 1983, when the program was initiated in Los Angeles. By using multiple sources to identify studies, we obtained reports of 18 outcome studies in twelve States and one Canadian province. These studies collected data from students concerning D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness in influencing outcomes the curriculum seeks to change. We defined a set of methodological criteria to use in assessing the quality and adequacy of the study methodologies. The criteria, based on review of the evaluation methodology literature, were (a) that the study compared students who received D.A.R.E. to students in a control or comparison group who did not receive D.A.R.E.; (b) that outcomes of interest, such as drug use, were measured both before D.A.R.E. was implemented and after the program ended; (c) that measures of the outcomes were constructed so as to ensure reasonable certainty that they were measured accurately; and (d) that in the absence of random assignment, the analysis strategy adjusted for any initial differences on outcome variables between D.A.R.E. and comparison students. Half of the 18 studies met these methodological criteria; however, one study was not considered further because the children were tested 1 year later rather than immediately after the program. That 50% of the studies were of this technical quality suggests that a high level of effort has been invested in carefully evaluating D.A.R.E. Because these studies avoid many of the problems that commonly undermine evaluation studies, reasonable confidence can be placed in their findings.=20 Some of the studies exceeded our criteria, for example, by randomly assigning D.A.R.E. to schools, by analyzing attrition effects, by statistically adjusting differences in students' background characteristics, or by using an analysis strategy appropriate to the research design. We recommend that these features be incorporated into future studies. In assessing the findings of the eight methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies, it should be noted that the studies are not a national sample of representatively selected sites. It is reassuring, however, that the findings tended to be consistent across studies, indicating that the conclusions they suggest about the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum are reliable. What gaps in the D.A.R.E. assessments merit attention? Our review of studies suggested several methodological issues that should be addressed directly and critically by future studies. These include the complete and careful reporting of the research design and results, contamination of the comparison group, the appropriateness of the analysis strategy, and the control and analysis of attrition. Although most of the studies we reviewed documented the research procedures and methods, some did not provide sufficient detail. Thorough documentation is needed for assessing and interpreting the results; information was most often lacking in the description of the study sample. In addition to the exact sample sizes of the D.A.R.E. and comparison groups, sociodemographic information such as whether recipients live in urban, suburban, or rural areas, their racial/ethnic composition, and their SES, should all be reported. This information is needed for assessing the degree to which study results may be generalized. It also can be used to test whether D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness varies by characteristics of the sample. For example, is D.A.R.E. equally effective among inner-city, suburban, and rural students and among white, African American, and Hispanic students? Almost none of the studies we reviewed made these sorts of assessments. Sociodemographic information also is relevant when making comparisons between studies (as we did between D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug use prevention programs) in order to assess the similarity of the recipients of programs being compared. An issue related to the completeness of reporting is the need for reports of research to be accessible to all those interested in D.A.R.E., including sponsors, educators, parents, police officers, other researchers, and concerned citizens. Most of the studies we identified were not reported in the published literature, and therefore are not easily accessible. It is vitally important that reports be made quickly and widely available. As we have suggested earlier, we recommend that a library of D.A.R.E. evaluation reports and associated summaries of key findings be maintained by the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. The extensive communication channels between local, state, and national D.A.R.E. entities should facilitate the prompt identification and dissemination of evaluation studies. One of the most important methodological issues raised by our review is the potential contamination of the control group by exposure to D.A.R.E. or to other drug use prevention programs. Although none of the comparison groups in the methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies was exposed to D.A.R.E. between pretest and immediate posttest, contamination was an issue for some studies conducting longer-term evaluations. This contributed to our inability to evaluate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness beyond immediate posttest. Ironically, contamination is particularly problematic for D.A.R.E. evaluations because of the rapid dissemination of the program and because of the various curricula now prevalent for students at different grade levels. It is increasingly possible, for example, for a control group not receiving the D.A.R.E. core curriculum to receive the junior high school curriculum, effectively reducing its utility as a control group. A larger, but more subtle comparison group problem is that the prevalence of school-based drug use prevention programs in general makes it virtually impossible to find a true "no treatment" controlgroup.=20 Hence, when comparing D.A.R.E. to another drug education program, effectiveness is determined on a comparative rather than an absolute basis. For example, a finding of little difference in effectiveness may indicate that both programs are effective rather than that D.A.R.E. is of limited effectiveness or both programs are ineffective.=20 None of the studies we reviewed indicated whether the control group received any drug use prevention programming, much less provided information about it.=20 Future studies should describe any prevention interventions being delivered to the comparison group and discuss the implications for the results. An increasingly recognized methodological concern in the evaluation of school-based interventions is the importance of following an analysis strategy that is appropriate to the study design (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray & Hannan, 1990). Only two of the methodologically rigorous studies addressed this issue in the statistical analyses. When D.A.R.E. is assigned by schools, which is usually the case, or by classrooms rather than by individuals, the analysis strategy must take into account the correlations among students in the same school or classroom. This requires performing analyses at the aggregate level (e.g., through comparison of school or classroom means) or by statistically correcting for within-school or within-classroom correlations. Analyses that do not account for the correlations among subjects tend to underestimate the variability in outcomes across schools and therefore overstate the statistical significance of treatment effects (i.e., the difference between the D.A.R.E. and control schools). Because statistical significance is often used as an indicator of effectiveness, this can artificially inflate the effects and thus unfairly bias interpretation of the results. Related to this issue is the need for sufficiently large samples to provide adequate statistical power for detecting significant differences between D.A.R.E. and comparison groups. Most of the D.A.R.E. studies reviewed had large numbers of students. However, because the sample of interest, as described above, usually revolves around schools as opposed to students, it is important that sample size determinations in future studies be based on analysis of the number of schools needed in treatment and control conditions. The final methodological issue raised by our review of studies concerns the careful control and analysis of study attrition. Attrition can affect both the external and internal validity of the study. Attrition rates were usually reported in the D.A.R.E. studies selected for review. However, data on demographic and pretest differences in drug use and other predictor measures between those who remained in and those who dropped out of the study were less frequently reported. Attrition analyses can reveal whether subjects who were lost to follow-up disproportionately represent drug users or those at risk of drug use. When this is the case, it compromises the external validity of the study by limiting the population to which the study results may be generalized. When differential attrition occurs by experimental condition, for example, such that a larger proportion of drug users is lost from the intervention than the control group, the internal validity of the study is undermined. That is, the extent to which either positive or negative outcomes can be attributed to the intervention is limited. We recommend that all future D.A.R.E. evaluations not only meet, but also exceed each of the methodological criteria used for our review by addressing these methodological issues. Specifically, in addition to meeting the criteria used for this review, we recommend that studies report sample demographics, draw a sample with sufficient statistical power to detect differences in outcomes, use an analysis strategy appropriate to the way D.A.R.E. is assigned, minimize attrition, and analyze differential attrition across treatment groups. In addition, we strongly recommend the use of an experimental research design, in which schools are randomly assigned to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions. It is probably insufficient to assign classrooms at random within schools, because the activities of D.A.R.E. officers outside the classroom may affect (or "contaminate") other classes. Althoughthere frequently are difficulties inherent in using an experimental design, results from experimental studies always will be subject to fewer questions about validity than those of quasi-experimental studies. A small set of the D.A.R.E. evaluations studies we reviewed used an experimental study design and incorporated other methodological features into the design. This level of rigor is needed if future D.A.R.E. evaluation research is to contribute further to knowledge about D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness. What overall assessment of D.A.R.E. do the study findings suggest? As described in Chapter 7, we used meta-analytic techniques to synthesize and assess the findings of eight methodologically rigorous studies of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Our approach required calculating individual study effect sizes for drug use and other outcomes targeted by the core curriculum and then averaging effect sizes across studies. Effect sizes facilitate comparing and summarizing results across studies because they transform the results of the studies, which may have been derived from a wide variety of statistical tests, to a common metric. Hence, in terms of statistical output, the results of one study are comparable with those of another study. Furthermore, effect sizes are a more useful indicator of effectiveness than comparing whether results are statistically significant from one study to another. This is because statistical significance can be influenced by such factors as sample size and analysis strategy, making comparisons problematic. The magnitude of the effect sizes, when considered both within each study and averaged across studies, indicated that D.A.R.E. was most effective at immediate posttest in increasing knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills. The average effect sizes reported for these outcomes were statistically significant and larger than for other outcomes. It is consistent with other meta-analyses for the largest effect sizes to be associated with knowledge change, supporting the general observation that knowledge is more amenable to change than attitudes or behavior. Averaged across studies, D.A.R.E. also had statistically significant effects on attitudes about drugs, attitude toward the police, and self-esteem. The effect sizes were smaller, however, than for knowledge and social skills, indicating fewer meaningful changes in these areas. The smallest immediate effect sizes were for drug use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana separately and averaged together), and except for tobacco use, none was statistically significant. In interpreting the small magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to drug use behavior, it is important to note that the immediate effect sizes may reflect, at least in part, the relatively low frequency of drug use by the elementary school pupils targeted by the original core curriculum.=20 The effect sizes probably also reflect the short time interval from pretest to immediate posttest for behavior change to occur. D.A.R.E. was more effective at influencing factors believed to mediate drug use. It is most noteworthy that D.A.R.E. had positive effects on social skills because it is widely believed that children with greater social competencies are more able to resist social pressures to use drugs. Long-term impact of D.A.R.E., therefore, may result from D.A.R.E.'s immediate impact on social skills. As described earlier, few longer-term longitudinal studies have been conducted, and some have been compromised by contamination of the control group. However, based on two experimental studies for which reliable information 1 and 2 years after implementation is available, there is no evidence that D.A.R.E.'s effects are activated when subjects are older (Clayton et al., 1991b; Ennett et al., 1994). Most long-term evaluations of drug use prevention programs have shown that curriculum effects decay rather than appear or increase with time (Ellickson et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1989). Future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies should continue to assess drug use, attitudes about drug use, social skills, and attitude toward police. Drug use indicators should include tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless tobacco), alcohol (particularly beer, wine, and wine coolers), and marijuana. In addition, use of inhalants and any other drugs that are locally prevalent should be monitored. It is also important to continue to measure outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. curriculum, such as social skills, that are believed to indirectly influence drug use. This requires linking outcome measures to specific objectives addressed by the various lessons of the curriculum. These data are needed for measuring a variety of potentially important program effects other than drug use behavior, and for testing assumptions about the means by which the D.A.R.E. curriculum influences drug use.=20 For maximal usefulness, we further recommend that effect sizes be routinely reported with the study results to facilitate comparison both to the results of this meta-analysis and those of future studies. As demonstrated by this meta-analysis, effect sizes can be readily calculated from a variety of statistical tests, so this should not place an undue burden on researchers. When the results of future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies become available, they should be carefully studied and compared with the results of the studies reviewed here. As we recommended earlier, the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board could coordinate periodic reviews of the evaluations. It is likely that ongoing review of evaluation results will suggest areas where the curriculum might need modification. How well does D.A.R.E. address drug involvement by youth in general? The effect sizes discussed above indicate the extent to which the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum influenced drug use by youth and other outcomes at immediate posttest. To put the D.A.R.E. results in context, we compared D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs to determine whether D.A.R.E. had greater, smaller, or similar effects. Hence, we compared the average D.A.R.E. effect sizes for drug use, knowledge, attitudes, and skills to average effect sizes calculated for other methodologically strong school-based drug use prevention programs. We restricted the comparison programs to those for upper elementary school pupils to make the comparisons most meaningful. We compared D.A.R.E. to two broad categories of prevention programs, namely "interactive" and "noninteractive" programs (Tobler, in press,1994).=20 These two program categories cover most types of current school-based prevention efforts described in Chapter 2.=20 Interactive programs generally are the same as the social competence programs described in that chapter. These programs represent the most recent advances in drug use prevention strategies, and emphasize social competencies and interactive teaching methods. Noninteractive programs generally include knowledge and affective programs, also described in Chapter 2. These programs represent earlier approaches to drug education that emphasize changing knowledge and attitudes about drug use through more traditional learning styles. Interestingly, D.A.R.E. shares similarities with both noninteractive and interactive programs. The original core curriculum was developed when prevention efforts were in transition between noninteractive programs (knowledge and affective education programs) and the emergence of interactive programs (these emphasizing social influence). Average D.A.R.E. immediate effect sizes were greater, except for drug use, than the comparable average effect sizes for noninteractive programs. The D.A.R.E. effect sizes were smaller, however, than the effect sizes for interactive programs. For drug use, the average effect size for interactive programs was three times greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times greater than for D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times greater. Interactive programs have been shown to be the most promising drug use prevention programs; noninteractive programs generally have been shown to be less effective (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Because D.A.R.E. shares features of both interactive and noninteractive programs, it is perhaps not surprising that the effect sizes we reported should fall somewhere between. In Chapter 7, we described several methodological reasons that could help account for the differences in effect sizes between the D.A.R.E. studies and the interactive comparison programs. These included the possibility that the control groups in the D.A.R.E. studies were exposed to some sort of alternative drug education programs, whereas the control groups for the various interactive studies were not. Another possibil- ity is that because the interactive programs were primarily university research-based evaluation studies, the evaluations--and programs themselves--may have been more stringently implemented and more closely monitored.=20 Under these conditions, greater effectiveness might be expected than in real-world conditions, such as those surrounding D.A.R.E. Other possibilities include factors that may have varied across the intervention programs and associated evaluation studies that contributed to the observed differences in effect sizes. For example, substantial variation in characteristics of the studients (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- experimental design) could have contributed to differences in program effects. Such possibilities could not be tested because of the small number of studies.=20 Further testing is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. It is also important to consider substantive reasons that could account for the differences. Possible explanations include the content of the original core curriculum, the use of law enforcement officers as instructors, and the more didactic approach of the instruction. Consideration of each of these explanations suggests areas for future research and possibly for programmatic change. As we have indicated, D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content has similarities with both noninteractive and interactive programs, although it has more of an intrapersonal focus than most interactive programs and, conversely, more of a skills focus than most noninteractive programs. Perhaps greater emphasis in the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on social influences, and less emphasis on affective factors, might result in effect sizes nearer to those reported from interactive programs. However, it is difficult to speculate on the effect of altering the D.A.R.E. curriculum by adding or subtracting particular lessons. Most evaluations of school-based prevention programs have assessed the effectiveness of overall programs rather than of the various program components or combinations of components. Future research in this area might suggest particular curriculum changes. D.A.R.E. instruction offers another possible area of explanation for D.A.R.E.'s relatively poorer performance compared with interactive programs. Although instruction by police officers is the sine qua non of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, their effectiveness may be less than other possible program providers. For example, despite the extensive D.A.R.E. training received by law enforcement officers, they may not be as well equipped to lead the curriculum as classroom teachers are. No studies have been reported in which the D.A.R.E. curriculum was offered by anyone other than a police officer; examination of the results from such a study might suggest whether police officers are as effective as other possible instructors. Regardless of the leader, however, the generally more traditional teaching style used by D.A.R.E. has not been shown to be as effective as an interactive teaching mode (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Traditional didactic approaches that involve teachers delivering information, with little response from students, are increasingly recognized as undesirable. More effective are strategies that engage students in a dialogue with the teacher; more effective still are cooperative or participatory learning approaches in which the teacher serves as a facilitator or catalyst to generate discussions and other interactions among students.=20 Although some D.A.R.E. activities encourage pupil interaction, the original core curriculum relies heavily on the officer as expert and makes frequent use of lectures and question-answer sessions between the officer and pupils. In fact, it is in teaching style, not curriculum content, that D.A.R.E. differs most from the interactive programs examined by Tobler. In the revised D.A.R.E. core curriculum, there is greater emphasis on such cooperative learning experiences. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. training programs urge officers to employ more interactive methods and provide specific guidance on how they can do so. What are the intended and unintended consequences of D.A.R.E.'s approach to drug abuse prevention? None of the studies we reviewed examined consequences of the D.A.R.E. program, either intended or unintended, other than those related directly to the curriculum. However, a number of consequences can be envisioned. These include effects related to other behaviors than drug use (e.g., effects on violent and delinquent behavior). More likely, perhaps, may be consequences related to the relationship that develops between the D.A.R.E. officers and students, which may in turn have positive consequences for police and community relations in general. Research indicates that the effects on police officers through their exposure to students and the problems they face may also be substantial and beneficial (D.A.R.E. Southeast Regional Training Center, 1992). It is possible, in fact, that some of D.A.R.E.'s most important effects are related to the relations between students and police officers. The studies we reviewed provided little insight into these areas. This suggests the importance of research to explore other consequences related to D.A.R.E.'s approach to drug use prevention. Conclusion As might be expected of an institution as large as D.A.R.E., our implementation and outcome assessments present an array of findings and raise a number of issues deserving of consideration by the D.A.R.E. organization and all those concerned with this program. Perhaps most prominently, the findings show a program that has been extremely successful at placing drug education in our Nation's schools. Indeed, D.A.R.E. is now implemented in the majority of school districts in the country and is expected to grow substantially in coming years. At the same time, however, as our findings confirm D.A.R.E.'s prevalence and popularity, they also suggest that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum has not been as successful in accomplishing its mission to prevent drug use among fifth and sixth graders as have interactive programs. Review of the rigorous evaluations of the original core curriculum, the heart of D.A.R.E., showed that D.A.R.E. had only limited immediate effects on students' drug use. Although the curriculum was more successful in influencing other outcomes, such as social skills, more work is needed to make D.A.R.E. more effective as a drug use prevention program. Given D.A.R.E.'s strengths, the task of increasing the effectiveness of the core curriculum is feasible.=20 D.A.R.E. has achieved its accomplishments to date through building a complex and solid organizational structure that reaches from local to national levels, by forging close partnerships between education and law enforcement, and by winning substantial community support for the program. In no other program of this magnitude have school districts welcomed into the classroom outsiders who lack traditional educational credentials to replace teachers as instructors of a major curriculum. These resources, as well as the dedication of the D.A.R.E. officers in the classroom, should enable D.A.R.E. to move forward more effectively to meet the challenges of drug use prevention. In this final section of our assessment, we briefly recapitulate our major findings and recommendations. =20 D.A.R.E. 's prevalence. D.A.R.E. is now implemented in over half the school districts in the country and is expected to grow substantially in the coming years. Because it is least prevalent in small and rural school districts, we believe that ways for these school districts to increase access to D.A.R.E. should be examined. =20 D.A.R.E. 's organization. D.A.R.E. is at once both hierarchical and community-based. Although it is carefully controlled, monitored, and overseen at the national, regional, and State levels, it is also very much a grass-roots movement, dependent on local initiatives to form partnerships and secure support. At the State level and above, we suggest that sufficient resources be made available to support this burgeoning organization to ensure adequate authority, communication, technical assistance, and oversight. At the local level, we believe that alternative sources of support should be explored so that D.A.R.E. can be freed as much as possible from dependence on public funds. =20 =20 D.A.R.E. 's partnership with education. Law enforcement's relationship with education is the cornerstone of D.A.R.E. We believe that at all levels a variety of mechanisms could be instituted to strengthen this critical partnership. This includes improving methods for co-teaching D.A.R.E. at the local level, as well as increasing where possible the already multifaceted involvement of D.A.R.E. officers in school life. We also suggest ensuring adequate representation on advisory boards by staff of departments of education at the State and national levels. =20 Popular support for D.A.R.E. Anecdotal evidence of grass-roots support for D.A.R.E. is abundant and is fully confirmed in our study. School-based drug prevention coordinators tended to rate school staff's attitudes toward D.A.R.E. as well as those of students, the parents, and the community as very supportive. The D.A.R.E. curriculum and students' receptivity to the program, and perhaps most important, D.A.R.E.'s effects on students were rated as very satisfactory. This persuasive evidence suggests that whatever modifications and enhancements may be made to the D.A.R.E. curriculum and how the program is taught, D.A.R.E.'s organization and structure at the local level is sound and should be preserved. =20 The original D.A.R.E. core curricula. Drug prevention coordinators' endorsements of D.A.R.E.'s positive effects on students are generally not supported by the results of the methodologically sound short-term evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum we summarized. As indicated earlier, D.A.R.E. demonstrated somewhat greater effects than those of didactic school-based drug prevention methods that are based on affective approaches, but considerably fewer effects than those of interactive methods that use social influence approaches. Because D.A.R.E. already incorporates many interactive features, we believe that appropriate modifications can be made both to the core curriculum and to the way D.A.R.E. is taught that are well within the context of the institution as a whole. These modifications should be made periodically (perhaps every 2 years), as refinements are suggested by evaluations of drug prevention programs in general, and of D.A.R.E.inparticular. We comm= end D.A.R.E. for convening a Scientific Advisory Committee that comprises drug prevention specialists who will review relevant drug prevention research findings and make recommendations concerning improvements to the curricula.=20 In conclusion, D.A.R.E. represents an institution that is unique in the area of drug use prevention: a partnership between law enforcement and education that has the substantial support of children, parents, and the community at large. Not unexpectedly, along with this highly visible profile come high expectations. Our report demonstrates D.A.R.E.'s success in meeting many of these expectations, as well as challenges that lie ahead.=20 Key to the continued growth of D.A.R.E. will be careful monitoring of the effectiveness of the various curricula, coupled with the willingness to make and assess modifications that could enhance effectiveness. D.A.R.E. has already demonstrated its responsiveness to change by the introduction of new curricula, revisions to the core curriculum, and expanded roles for D.A.R.E. officers.=20 Equally important to D.A.R.E.'s viability will be its continued coordination of the roles and responsibilities of the many D.A.R.E. players. In both of these efforts, we recommend that D.A.R.E. seek to strengthen its partnerships with individuals and institutions outside its bounds. The advice, support, and perspectives of those who are not part of the D.A.R.E. structure but who are equally committed to drug use prevention will enhance the vitality and integrity of the program. We believe these efforts will result in a program that maintains its unique identity and place in drug education, while meeting more effectively the challenge of reducing drug use among youth.

Appendix B Individual Study Descriptions Brief descriptions of the eight methodologically rigorousstudies selected for the meta-analysis are given below in alphabetical order by the location of the study. The research design, sample size and characteristics, and results for drug use knowledge, attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and drug use behavior are reported. Additional information and greater detail about the study methodologies and results are available in the reports or papers issued by each study. 1.British Columbia The British Columbia evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Walker, 1990)used a quasi-experimental design in which seven schools were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and four schools with similar demographic characteristics were selected for the comparison condition. The study administered an anonymous pretest and immediate posttest; assessed pretest equivalence on some demographic variables and all outcome variables; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables by analyzing change scores at the aggregate level. The sample included 463 fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade pupils. No information was given on the ethnic composition of the sample. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statisticallysignificant effect on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have a statistically significant effect on attitudes about drug use or on drug use behavior (use of tobacco, beer, pop, marijuana, acid, valium, wine, aspirin, uppers, downers, heroin, crack, liquor, candy, glue, and PCP). 2. Hawaii The Hawaii evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Manos, Kameoka, &Tanji, 1986) used a quasi-experimental research design in which 23 schools were assigned to either D.A.R.E. or comparison conditions. In three other schools, some classrooms were assigned to D.A.R.E. and other classrooms to the comparison condition; data from these comparison classrooms were not included in our analysis. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used some measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables. The sample included 2,009 fifth-grade pupils (not including the pupils in comparison classrooms in the D.A.R.E. schools). No information was given on the ethnic composition of the sample. Attrition was not analyzed but was approximately 6%. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statisticallysignificant effect in the desired direction on one social skills indicator (choices in a risk situation). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on another social skills indicator (assertiveness) or on subjects' attitudes about drug use. 3. Illinois-C The Illinois-C evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ennett, Rosenbaum, Flewelling, Bieler, Ringwalt, & Bailey, 1994) used both an experimental and quasi-experimental design: 12 pairs of schools serving urban and suburban areas were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, while 6 pairs serving rural areas were assigned using a nonrandom procedure. The study matched schools on metropolitan status, ethnic composition, number of students with English proficiency, and percentage of pupils from low- income families; administered a pretest and three posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted for school effects with a nested cohort strategy; and assessed attrition. The sample included 1,323 subjects who were fifth and sixth graders at pretest; 54% were white, 22% were African American, 9% Hispanic, and 15% were American Indian, Asian American, or "other." The attritionrate over the three posttests was 26% and did not differ across experimental conditions. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statisticallysignificant effects in the desired direction on subjects' self- esteem, attitude toward police, and increased use of cigarettes at immediate posttest. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude toward use of specific drugs, perceived benefits of cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived costs of cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived media influence on smoking and beer drinking); social skills (assertiveness and peer refusal skills); or on other drug use behavior (initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, or heavy drinking; increased use of alcohol or heavy drinking; or quitting alcohol). 4. Kentucky-A The Kentucky-A evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Clayton, Cattarello,Day, & Walden, 1991a; Clayton, Cattarello, & Walden,1991b) used an experimental design employing random assignment of 31 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions.=20 The study administered a pretest and three posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition. The sample included 1,925 subjects who were sixth graders at pretest; 76% were white and 21% were African American.=20 The attrition rate over the three posttests was approximately 21% and did not differ across experimental conditions. The results showed that, at immediate posttest, D.A.R.E. had statistically significant effects in the desired direction on some indicators of subjects' attitudes about drugs (general attitudes about drugs and negative attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana).=20 D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects at immediate posttest on other indicators of subjects' attitudes about drug use (positive attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), social skills, self- esteem, or drug use behavior (use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana). 5. Kentucky-B The Kentucky-B evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Faine & Bohlander1988, 1989) used a quasi-experimental research design in which 16 schools, stratified by school type (rural, inner-city, suburban, and parochial), were randomly selected among schools assigned to receive D.A.R.E. immediately or at a later semester (a delayed intervention comparison group).=20 The study administered a pretest and two posttests (immediately and one year after implementation); matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and type of school. The sample in the first year included 783 fifth-grade pupils; sample demographic characteristics were not given. Attrition information was not given. By year 2, all the comparison groups had received the D.A.R.E. program. The immediate posttest results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically significant effects in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs, attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, and attitude toward police. 6. Minnesota The Minnesota evaluation of D.A.R.E. (McCormick &McCormick, 1992) used a quasi-experimental research design in which D.A.R.E. was implemented by semester in 63 schools; random samples of D.A.R.E. participants and pupils who would receive D.A.R.E. in the next semester (a delayed intervention comparison group) were drawn. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; assessed pretest equivalence on selected demographic variables; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables. The sample included 943 fifth graders; 62% of the D.A.R.E. group participants were white; 18% Asian Americans, 12% African American, and 7% Native American or Hispanic (demographic information on the comparison group was not given). The attrition rate was 9%. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statisticallysignificant effect in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, or attitude toward police. 7. North Carolina The North Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ringwalt, Ennett,& Holt, 1991) used an experimental research design employing random assignment of 20 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted for school effects; and assessed attrition. The sample included 1,270 fifth- and sixth-grade students; 50% were African American, 40% were white, and 10% were American Indian, Asian American, or Hispanic. The attrition rate was 9% and did not differ across experimental conditions. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statisticallysignificant effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude toward use of specific drugs, perceived peer attitude toward drug use, perceived costs of using alcohol and cigarettes, and perceptions of the media portrayal of beer drinking and cigarette smoking) and social skills (assertiveness). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' drug use behavior (alcohol, cigarettes, or inhalant use). 8. South Carolina The South Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Harmon, 1993) useda quasi-experimental research design in which five schools were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and six schools matched on demographic characteristics were selected for the comparison condition. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition.=20 The sample included 602 fifth-grade pupils. The attrition rate was 13.5% in the D.A.R.E. group and 16.3% in the comparison groups. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statisticallysignificant effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes about drugs, social skills (assertiveness), and initiation of alcohol use in the past year. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' self-esteem, attitude toward police, or other drug use behavior indicators (previous year tobacco and marijuana use, and previous month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use).

Russell, Acting Director, NationalInstitute of Justice: Chemicals diverted from legitimate commerce are used in theproduction of illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, PCP,and LSD. Controlling illegal diversion and use of such chemicals isessential to limiting illicit drug production. Recent efforts to addressthis problem are based on the belief that illicit drug production can betraced from the records of chemical manufacturers and dealers of rawmaterials in the same way that laundered money can be traced through financialrecords. The principal U.S. statute to control chemical diversion isthe Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, which establishedrecord keeping requirements and enforcement activities, initially for 20chemicals. The Act has already proven effective in limiting theinternational illicit diversion of the identified chemicals and controlling somedomestic manufacturing. However, illicit drug production in the UnitedStates has been rising at an alarming rate, with illegal domesticlaboratories now capable of producing enough stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, andnarcotics to satisfy demand for these substances. Adequate record-keeping ensures that there are paper trailson chemicals sent to illegal laboratories that make drugs. Thirty-two States,however, do not require record-keeping of transactions involving chemicalsidentified as necessary for producing illegal drugs. Criminals camouflagediversion of chemicals by moving shipments through States withoutrecord-keeping requirements. To focus attention on the need for all State law enforcementagencies to supplement Federal controls over chemical traffic and itsdiversion into illicit drug manufacturing, the National Institute of Justicesponsored a project to create a Model State Chemical Control Act. TheModel Act seeks to balance and accommodate the interests of law enforcement andlegitimate commerce. This Research in Brief explains how the Model Actcan be used to help halt the growth of illegal domestic drug manufacturingby stopping the diversion of chemicals from legitimate to illegitimatepurposes. [End letter] Law enforcement agencies around the world are using a varietyof methods to attack the illegal and deadly "industry" of illicitdrugs. Enforcement officials seize contraband substances, break up distributionnetworks, disrupt money-laundering operations, and destroy crops. Acritical part of this multifaceted attack on drug trafficking is the controlof specific chemicals that are necessary to produce illegal drugs. The United States is one of the world's leading producers anddistributors of the chemicals that are used to make controlled substances.Each year our Nation exports more than 50,000 metric tons of chemicals toLatin America, many of which find their way into the clandestinelaboratories of cocaine- and heroin-producing countries. In fact, seizures of illegallabs in Colombia and other Latin American countries often uncover chemicalcontainers with US. company logos. Until 1989 much of the cocaine entering ourcountry was produced using chemicals originating in the United States. Although there has been a decline in the export of chemicalsfor manufacturing illegal drugs, there has been an increase inthe chemicals' distribution at home. Illegal domestic laboratories are nowcapable of producing enough illicit drugs to satisfy U.S. consumers'demand. In 1991 the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) supported aproject to help the States develop a legislative response to the problem ofdistribution of chemicals and their manufacture into illegal drugs. Toprepare the Model State Chemical Control Act of 1992 (the Model), the AmericanProsecutors Research Institute (APRI), the research arm of the NationalDistrict Attorneys Association, brought together investigators andprosecutors from Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington State.In addition, APRI solicited comments from the Department of Justice and theDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on the lessons they had learned at theFederal level and sought to understand the concerns of the chemical andpharmaceutical industries. This Research in Brief describes how chemicals are used tomake illicit drugs, discusses existing Federal and State legislation tocurtail the diversion of chemicals for illicit drug production, andreviews the Model statute. DOMESTIC ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCTION --Essential and precursor chemicals: All major illicit drugsexcept marijuana are either extracted or synthesized in a process requiringchemicals that are categorized as either "essential" or"precursor." Essential chemicals are used to extract drugs, such as cocaine, from plants. Althoughthese chemicals do not become part of the drug's molecular structure, theyare crucial to the manufacturing process. Precursor chemicals are used tosynthesize drugs (such as PCP), which are not naturally derived. These chemicals dobecome part of the drug's molecular structure. --Clandestine Labs: Highly sophisticated laboratoryoperations are sometimes necessary to manufacture drugs. For example, producingmarketable quantities of cocaine requires large-scale operations to handle theenormous amounts of coca leaves and solvents required. On the other hand, illegaldrug production is often a simple process, without need of complextechnology, sophisticated education, or training. Many synthetic drugs such asmethamphetamine and PCP can be produced in someone's home with readily availablelaboratory equipment. In fact, with equipment and precursor chemicalsworth $200, a criminal can in 18 hours produce a batch of methamphetaminewith a street value of $98,000.(ref. 1) In the 1980's States faced an outbreak of clandestinelaboratories because chemicals were readily available on the open market or wereeasily diverted from legitimate commerce. In 1986 the Oklahoma Bureau ofNarcotics (OBN) seized 28 labs, an almost 100 percent increase over the 16labs seized in 1985. Another 100 percent increase in seizures occurred in1988 when OBN seized 62 laboratories, compared to the 30 labs seized theprevious year. From 1985 to 1987, Texas narcotics officers seized more thantwice the number of labs as OBN. Clandestine laboratories range from small crude operations insheds, bathtubs, mobile homes, boats, and motel rooms to highlysophisticated operations with professional quality laboratory glassware andequipment. More than 80 percent of the clandestine labs in the UnitedStates produce methamphetamines.(ref. 2) With a knowledge of chemistryequivalent to that learned in high school, illicit lab operators are believed toproduce 25 tons of methamphetamines annually with a street value of $3billion. Less than 1 percent of that amount is spent on the chemicals needed forproduction.(ref. 3) CHEMICAL DIVERSION AND TRAFFICKING ACT In 1988 Congress enacted the Chemical Diversion andTrafficking Act (CDTA), Subtitle A of the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments of 1988(codified as amendments to the Federal Controlled Substances Act). CDTA establishedrecord-keeping and reporting requirements and authorized enforcementactivities for domestic and international transactions in designated precursor andessential chemicals. Originally CDTA regulated machines for making thedrugs into tablets or capsules, 12 precursor chemicals, and 8 essentialchemicals. Now, 27 precursor and 7 essential chemicals are on the CDTA list.Chemicals may be added or deleted under standard Federal rule makingprocedures. CDTA applies to any individual or legal entity thatmanufactures, distributes domestically, imports, or exports any of the listedchemicals. The Act makes the unauthorized trade in these listed chemicals equivalentto trafficking in illegal drugs. Each chemical has been assigned a threshold amount, by volumeor weight, or a threshold number of monthly transactions. Once the thresholdhas been reached or exceeded, regulated individuals and entities must complywith Federal record-keeping, reporting, and identification requirements.However, threshold quantities do not apply to machinery; distributionof a single tableting or encapsulating machine triggers CDTA provisions. Among the provisions are requirements that purchasers supplyproof of identity in all regulated transactions. The type ofidentification required depends on whether the customer is new, is an individual orestablished business, is paying in cash, or is exporting the chemical toanother country. Records of regulated domestic transactions involving aprecursor chemical or a tableting or encapsulating machine must be kept for 4years. For an essential chemical, the record must be kept 2 years. Recordsmust be readily retrievable either at the business where the transactionoccurred or some other central location. Each record must contain specificinformation about the transaction and is subject to inspection and photocopyingby the Drug Enforcement Administration. CDTA requires that regulated individuals and entities reportsome circumstances both orally and in writing to DEA. Theseinclude uncommon methods of payment, loss or disappearance of a chemical, andsuspicion that a chemical has been diverted for illegal purposes. As withrecords, reports must contain the date of the transaction, quantity of thechemical purchased, name and address of each party, method of transfer, and otherdescriptive details. On the basis of the reports or a lapse inrecord-keeping, DEA has the authority to stop chemical shipments. Receipt of therequired advance notice of shipments can trigger DEA suspension when anillicit transfer is suspected. --The effect of Federal control: Shortly after implementationof CDTA, DEA noted a downward trend in domestic illegal lab activity asmeasured by the number of lab seizures. Of the 1,000 projected DEA labseizures for 1989, 807 materialized. A sharper decline occurred the following yearwhen DEA seized 521 laboratories. This decline was the first time seizureshad dropped significantly since 1981. CDTA has also been successful in controlling exports ofessential chemicals to Latin America. But as the pathways to foreign buyers havenarrowed, some U.S. exporters have turned their attention to the domesticmarket. Opportunities for diversion exist all along the domesticcommercial chain. Although CDTA's strict requirements help safeguard the legaltransfer of chemicals above the threshold levels, illicit operators arerestructuring their businesses to avoid Federal regulations. They arefocusing their efforts on States that do not have effective mechanisms forcontrolling chemicals. --Closing the door: The Office of National Drug ControlPolicy has estimated that the world supply of cocaine in 1990 was 1,000 metrictons, or about 2.2 million pounds. To produce this amount of cocaine, millionsof pounds of essential chemicals were required for processing. But many ofthese chemicals such as hydrochloric acid also have hundreds of legitimateuses, and for this reason, they are common substances in international trade. Criminals obtain these substances from manufacturers throughtheft, bribery of employees, or even legal purchase, especially in areasthat lack chemical control laws or do not enforce them. Poor plant security canincrease theft, and some retail purchasers are actually "frontcompanies" set up by producers to disguise the illicit drug trade. In addition, the vast international network of freightforwarders, brokers, and agents provides access to chemicals through multiplesales transactions, similar to money-laundering operations. In ports and freetrade zones, criminals can obtain the desired chemicals by repacking orre-labeling materials. CDTA has greatly decreased U.S. exports of essentialchemicals to Latin America. This Federal statute has added to costs borne bycriminals, and the new regulation and record-keeping requirements of the Actmake it increasingly likely that illicit operators are restructuringtheir businesses to avoid Federal regulations. They are focusing their effortson States that do not have effective mechanisms for controlling chemicals. THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE STATE CONTROLS State regulatory and enforcement efforts are needed tosupplement Federal controls over the movement of chemicals into illegalchannels. If State officials can follow the trail of precursor and essentialchemicals from the chemical manufacturer to the illicit drug producer, thenproducers can be identified and apprehended before they manufacture illegaldrugs. Controlling these chemicals, therefore, is a potent strategy that canhelp identify drug criminals and interfere with their operations. Effective regulation of chemical transactions could dry upthe sources that supply illegal labs. However, clandestine drug production isa nomadic business. When chemicals become difficult to obtain in onelocale, illegal lab operators simply move their operations to a locationwhere acquisition of chemicals is less complicated. Differences in the extent ofcontrol exercised by the States currently make that a fairly easy process. Moreconsistent State laws could curtail movement of illegal labs from Stateto State. EXISTING VARIATIONS IN STATE CONTROLS To date 18 States have sought to control the existence ofclandestine labs by enacting their own detailed chemical tracking requirements.Some jurisdictions have incorporated these requirements into theircontrolled substances acts already on the books, while others haveadopted new, distinct statutes. --Number of chemicals: Colorado controls the largest numberof chemicals (35) while Montana regulates 9. The differences reflect eachState's experience or policy regarding diversion, abuse, and the potential illicituse of a chemical. Nearly all of the States that have controls excludeprescription or over-the-counter drugs, or both, from chemical requirements,with special exemptions for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,norpseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. --Registration: All 18 States require a license or permit tolawfully manufacture or transfer a regulated chemical. Only a fewregulate the purchase or possession of chemicals. Registration renewalgenerally happens annually and involves a reasonable fee; the definition ofreasonable varies from a maximum of $25 in Arkansas to a minimum of $250 in NewMexico. Grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation include fraud; drug lawviolations and convictions; and denial, suspension, or revocation of Federalregistrations. --Record-keeping: Differences also occur in the requirementsfor record-keeping. For example, several jurisdictions mandatethat chemical transfer records be kept for 2 years after the transactiondate, but Minnesota requires that records be kept for 5 years. Texasrequires that records of sales of laboratory apparatus also be kept. Hawaiiand Missouri maintain the confidentiality of information obtained throughrecords. Pennsylvania penalizes wrongful use of the information. --Reporting: Required reporting of intrastate transfers andout-of-State purchases also varies among States. In several States theregulatory agency must be given 21 days advance notice of any chemicaldelivery. Some States provide a monthly reporting alternative for individuals andentities with a history of lawful use, a regular relationship with arecipient, or both. While California and Montana require notice of receipt ofchemicals within 3 days after delivery, Oregon allows 10 days. Ten Statesrequire that special reports be submitted within 3 days after discovery of a theftor loss of chemicals, and eight require reports within 3 days for adiscrepancy in quantities shipped and received. Iowa and Washington extendthese deadlines to 7 days. --Exemptions: Medical professionals, agents, and licensedentities such as common carriers are traditionally exempt from licensing orreporting obligations. Some States expand the exemptions to includecollege chemistry students, government employees, or researchers. --Purchaser identification: Most jurisdictions mandate thatindividual purchasers identify themselves with a photograph, proof ofstreet or residential mailing address, and signature. Somejurisdictions ask for the purchaser's birth date, driver's license or otherState-issued identification number, year in which the purchaser's vehicle wasmanufactured, and vehicle license tag number. Most business recipients must furnish anauthorization letter listing an identification number, an address, a phonenumber, and a description of the chemical's intended use. --Responsibility: Finally, there is no consensus among theStates on which government agency should be given regulatory responsibility.The 18 States assign this duty to a wide variety of health, pharmaceutical,commerce, and enforcement agencies. ILLEGITIMATE USES FOR LEGITIMATE PRODUCTS Many people recognize ephedrine as an ingredient in sinusmedications. However, consumers are often unaware that ephedrine is alsothe primary precursor used to illegally produce methamphetamine (meth).In 1990, 53 percent of the clandestine meth labs seized by the DrugEnforcement Administration used the ephedrine reduction method to producethe drug.(ref. 4) State officials report that illicit meth laboratories in theWest and Southwest began using ephedrine after phenylacetic acid cameunder State regulation. In northern California 85 percent of the seizedmeth labs used single-ingredient ephedrine tablets. In Oregon officialsdiscovered that over-the-counter ephedrine tablets sold in the Portland areahad become a source of ephedrine for northwest meth lab operators.(ref. 5) For this reason, ephedrine has been included in the list ofchemicals targeted for regulation under the Model State ChemicalControl Act. MODEL STATE CHEMICAL CONTROL ACT In developing the Model State Chemical Control Act of 1992,the drafters sought to close loopholes in existing Federal and Statelegislation and to foster greater consistency among State regulations. Unlikemost criminal laws, the Model is a preventive measure. Its goal is to stopdrug offenses before they occur by preventing precursor and essentialchemicals from being diverted to illegal channels. It seeks to protect theinterests of legitimate commerce without limiting the ability of law enforcement tostop illicit chemical transactions. Monitoring every transaction involving a regulated chemical.The Model creates a monitoring system that tracks 35 chemicals fromsource to use. It covers a comprehensive range of chemicals controlled byStates and the Federal Government. The Model's reporting and record-keeping requirements applyto every transaction involving a regulated chemical, not just thoseexceeding a legal threshold. Under Federal law, manufacturers and distributorsdo not have to report or keep records on individuals or businesses who buychemicals in amounts below the legal threshold. Individuals can circumventthe law by making multiple purchases of small quantities, therebyaccumulating large amounts of chemicals for clandestine production.Unfortunately, Federal officials have no way of obtaining information about suchtransactions. The Model permits State and local officials to address this typeof diversion activity, which would otherwise escape detection until afterillegal use of the chemicals. The list of regulated chemicals can be modified by rule inresponse to changes in diversion or use. Under the Model, State officialsmay regulate a chemical on an emergency basis while awaiting completion ofnormal rule-making procedures. Emergency regulation is sometimes necessary to preventimminent hazards to public health and safety. Some chemicals are flammable ortoxic and their use must be controlled as soon as possible to prevent explosions,environmental damage, or illness. Registering manufacturers and distributors. Responsibilityfor the control of regulated chemicals rests primarily with manufacturers anddistributors. Therefore, the Model requires that they annually furnish lawenforcement with detailed information about the sources, location, and amountof chemicals available for sale. The purpose of annual registration isthreefold: --To convey to manufacturers and distributors anunderstanding of the critical role they play in eliminating illegal chemicaltransfers. --To help government officials determine if the chemicalsfound at clandestine lab sites have been supplied by a legal or"underground" source. --To help government officials more accurately assess theextent of illegal diversion. The drafters anticipate that the number of annualregistrations to be processed will be manageable. For example, in Californiaofficials currently register only 40 to 45 companies per year. Requiring permits to possess a regulated chemical. Permitsidentify which persons intend to use specific quantities of chemicals for aspecific purpose. With certain exceptions, every applicant for a permit mustprovide detailed personal information, including a criminal history andnotarized fingerprint card. Based on this information, government officialsascertain the fitness of a potential chemical recipient and ensure that theintended use is lawful. The permit provision is modeled after Oklahoma's chemicalcontrol statute, which extends the law beyond the traditional"receiving" category of purchasers to individuals who want to "possess" aregulated chemical. By requiring that they obtain a permit each time they seek topossess a regulated chemical, the Model eliminates a significantloophole in many existing statutes. For example, some illegal"cookers" manufacture controlled substances using chemicals produced in their own clandestinelaboratories. They are not subject to existing regulation and liabilityprovisions, which apply solely to purchasers, because they do not buy thechemical from an outside source. Under the Model statute, "cookers"would be subject to the law because although they do not "receive" thechemicals, they nonetheless "possess" them. The Model's permit process protects legitimate commerce intwo ways. First, it exempts the owners and officers of publicly heldcorporations (those with 35 shareholders or more) from the disclosure requirements ofpermit applications. These corporations are often fairly sizablebusinesses or are headquartered out-of-State. Their shareholders and officerslack the personal access necessary to illegally use or transfer regulatedchemicals. The Model assumes that there is no need for detailed backgroundinformation or fingerprint cards for such persons. Second, the Model includes a reporting alternative forpossessors who demonstrate a history of regular, legitimate use. The risk ofthese possessors diverting chemicals for unlawful purposes is lessthan with other possessors. Therefore, they may submit retrospective monthlyreports of actual chemical use in lieu of obtaining permits. The Modelprevents unnecessary duplication by accepting copies of Federalreports containing information about threshold amounts of regulated chemicals. --Exempting individuals from regulation: The Model exemptscommon carriers pharmacists, physicians, and other authorized practitionersfrom the statute's requirements. Manufacturers can obtain a specialexemption to continue marketing bona fide drug products such as over-thecounter sinus and asthma medications. A special exemption is granted upon afinding by State officials that a product is manufactured and distributed in amanner that prevents its diversion. In making the finding, Stateofficials consider the product's packaging, advertising, and actual or potential fordiversion.(ref. 6) --Safeguarding possession of regulated chemicals: The Modelcontains a number of safeguards to prevent unauthorized or unscrupulous personsfrom gaining access to regulated chemicals. It specifies that thefollowing persons are ineligible to apply for a registration or permit: Convicted drug offenders. Persons who have had a prior registration or permit Minors Because juveniles are subject to milder penalties thanadults, they frequently have been recruited to become participants incriminal activity. Therefore, making minors ineligible should preclude drugbalers from using juveniles to acquire chemicals for illegal purposes. The Model also provides for denial, suspension, or revocationof a registration or permit. Violation of the statutory rules,falsification of a document, and similar acts are grounds for denial ofauthorized access to regulated chemicals. Spotting discrepancies in the flow of chemicals. The Modelestablishes four information-gathering mechanisms to help State officials spotpossible diversion activities. First, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors, andpossessors to report any suspicious transaction or circumstance. cashpayments, discrepancies between quantities shipped and received, andtheft or loss of chemicals are all examples of suspicious circumstances. Second, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors,brokers, and traders to provide monthly reports detailing every transactioninvolving a regulated chemical. The reports allow officials to identify the truepurchaser of chemicals and ascertain whether the actual chemical use isconsistent with the stated intended use. Third, the Model requires purchasers to submit informationabout themselves, their permit or other authorization, and their vehicles priorto receiving or distributing a regulated chemical. This provision, whichincorporates California's purchaser identification requirements, alsofacilitates determination of the ultimate purchaser and the chemical'suse. Fourth, manufacturers and distributors are required to takeinventory annually and to keep all transaction records readilyaccessible for 4 years. --Providing for enforcement: The Model vests State officialswith the authority to identify and respond to situations ofnoncompliance. It authorizes limited warrantless inspections during regularbusiness hours and allows State officials to routinely inspect inventories,storage facilities, records, papers, files, and equipment.(ref. 9) It also grantsState officials the power to subpoena witnesses and require documentproduction. The Model provides for stiff fines and terms of imprisonment fornoncompliance. To eliminate the economic incentive for this type of criminalactivity, the Model applies a State's drug forfeiture procedures to moneyand property used in violation of the chemical diversion statute. --Recovering expenses: As with any proactive regulatoryscheme, the Model requires a continuing investment of time and money. Toprevent financial strain on scarce State resources, a system of nonrefundableapplication fees is recommended to help offset the cost of administering theprogram. In addition, the Model imposes a special civil assessment onviolators of the statute to be used for cleanup of illegal laboratory sites.Seizure of clandestine laboratories often reveals significant amounts ofhazardous or toxic waste and other byproducts that have been found. UnderFederal law, law enforcement agencies become liable for various cleanup andtransporting operations, damage to natural resources, and subsequenthealth risks that remain after the lab is dismantled.(ref. 10) Last year Oklahoma spent approximately $6,000 to clean upillegal labs, and for several years California has spent more than $1 million ayear for similar tasks. However, these expenses were only for removingbulk contamination. In the future site restoration throughhazardous waste removal may require even larger sums of money. The civil assessmentwill prevent violators from escaping financial liability for theenvironmental damage they cause and help States address the issue of long-termhazardous waste or residual contamination. APPLYING THE MODEL The chemical control legislation in California, Oklahoma,Texas, and Washington served as guides for creating the Model. Oklahomaand Texas officials have already noted the positive effect of theirlegislation on the struggle to eliminate illegal drug production. The OklahomaBureau of Narcotics and Texas Department of Public Safety indicate thattheir States' precursor laws significantly reduced the availability ofchemicals throughout Oklahoma and Texas. The reduction in supply has led to adecrease in clandestine laboratory activity in both States. The TexasDepartment of Public Safety reports that the availability of illicitamphetamine and methamphetamine in Texas decreased about 50 percent duringthe 3-year period since passage of its statute." Despite the success of these States' efforts, the lack ofadequate chemical controls in many states provides illegal drug manufacturerswith opportunities to expand their production of controlledsubstances. The toll in health, welfare, enforcement, and safety costs as well ashuman suffering is incalculable. The Model is designed to help Statepolicymakers and criminal justice professionals develop legislation that willseverely curtail domestic illegal drug production while protecting legitimatecommercial interests. COPING WITH CHEMICAL HAZARDS Seizures of clandestine labs pose special problems for lawenforcement officers because many of the chemicals used in drugmanufacturing are dangerous. For example, acids and solvents are corrosive andflammable, and some are highly explosive. About one-fifth of clandestine labseizures result from reports of fires caused by chemical processes.(ref. 7) In addition, many precursor and essential chemicals arecorrosive and can cause lung and eye damage, even upon exposure to vaporsemanating from the lab. Furthermore, according to a study in California,one-tenth of seized labs were booby-trapped with explosives or with disfiguringand poisonous chemical devices.(ref. 8) For these reasons, law enforcement experts recommend thatpolice officers in all areas of the criminal justice system be given specialtraining in handling these substances. They note that rural policeagencies are just as likely to encounter clandestine labs as urban police. Highwaypatrols and other agencies in jurisdictions with large railroad and othertransportation hubs are likely to find such substances en route to aclandestine location. NOTES 1.

These courts monitor the treatment and behavior ofdrug-using defendants. Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Actof 1994 (the 1994 Crime Act) authorizes the award of federal grantsfor drug courts. The act requires that we assess the effectiveness andimpact of these grants and report to Congress by January 1, 1997. Toassist Congress in its deliberations on whether to fund drug courts,we developed this preliminary report. Specifically, we gathered information on drug courts in existence prior to the awardingof grants under the 1994 Crime Act, assessed evaluations ofthese courts, and reviewed the Department of Justice's (DOJ) responsibilities and plans for implementing the federal drugcourt grant program. During April and on May 11, 1995, we briefed the Committeeson the results of our work. -------------------- \1 Throughout this briefing report, we use the terms drugcourts and drug court programs interchangeably. RESULTS ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :1 In response to the deluge of drug cases since the late 1980sand the cycle of recidivism (rearrest rates) common to drugoffenders, some state and local jurisdictions created drug courts, themajority of which have been operating since 1993. The main purpose ofdrug courts is to use the authority of the court to reduce crimeby changing defendants' drug-using behavior. In exchange for the possibility of dismissed charges or reduced sentences,defendants are diverted to drug courts. Judges preside over drug courtproceedings, monitor the progress of defendants through frequent statushearings, and prescribe sanctions and rewards as appropriate incollaboration with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, andothers. Although there are basic elements common to many drug courtprograms, they vary in terms of participant eligibility, length of theprogram, penalties and rewards, and other practices. The courts aresupported by a variety of local, state, federal, and private funds and participant fees, according to the Drug Court ResourceCenter.\2 As of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug courtsoperating nationwide, most of which had been fully operational for atleast 9 months. Thirty-three drug courts responding to ourquestionnaire reported having accepted over 20,000 defendants, of whom athird had completed their programs. According to the Project Directorof the Drug Court Resource Center, none of the drug courts acceptdefendants currently charged with a violent offense, and most do notaccept defendants with prior violent convictions. However, at leastone drug court accepts defendants regardless of prior offenses.(See sect. I for more general information on drug courts.) We assessed six evaluations of five drug courts completed asof March 1995. Although some evaluation results indicated that drugcourts may have some beneficial effects, limitations in theirdesigns and methodologies, as well as the relative newness of drugcourts, precluded firm conclusions about the overall impact of these programs. The evaluations showed mixed results in recidivismand other defendant outcomes. For example, two evaluations showedless recidivism by drug court defendants. However, three other evaluations showed no significant differences in recidivism. Additionally, two evaluations of the same drug court showed contrasting recidivism results. (See sect. II and app. IIIfor more information on the evaluations we assessed.) The 1994 Crime Act authorized the Attorney General to awardand administer discretionary grants for drug court programs. Akey requirement of the act is that violent offenders areprohibited as drug court participants. The act authorized $1 billion fromfiscal years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. Forfiscal year 1995, $29 million was appropriated. However, Congresshas proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts in a pending rescissionbill. In addition, the House has passed legislation repealing thedrug court grant program authorized in the 1994 Crime Act. DOJ expects to award grants beginning in the summer of 1995.The 1994 Crime Act also authorizes the Attorney General toprovide for a national evaluation of drug courts supported by federalgrants. DOJ expects to complete the evaluation to assess the impact and effectiveness of drug court grants in about 2 years. (Seesect. III for more information.) -------------------- \2 The Bureau of Justice Assistance funds the Drug CourtResource Center. The Resource Center began operating October 1, 1994,under the direction of The American University in partnership withthe National Center for State Courts and the National Consortiumof Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime Programs. The ResourceCenter assists state and local justice system officials in planning, implementing, managing, and evaluating drug courts. It alsoacts as a clearinghouse and provides technical assistance and otherservices to jurisdictions interested in developing or expanding drugcourts. OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :2 In preparation for our 1997 mandated study, we initiated a preliminary review of drug court programs. Our objectiveswere to determine the number, location, and key elements of drug courts; the results and validity of evaluations of drug courts; and DOJ's responsibilities and plans for implementing statutory requirements for the federal drug court grant program. The Drug Court Resource Center, which is based at TheAmerican University, Washington, D.C., provided us with generalinformation on drug courts. To obtain more current information, we sent a questionnaire to 37 drug courts. We received responses from33 drug courts as of March 31, 1995. We did not verify the accuracyof the data provided to us by the Drug Court Resource Center anddrug courts. In addition, we attended a January 1995 nationaltraining conference for drug court professionals in Las Vegas, NV, andvisited drug courts in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. To determine the results and assess the validity ofevaluations of drug courts, we obtained 11 drug court evaluations completedas of March 1, 1995, from the Drug Court Resource Center. These evaluations were done by a variety of sources, includingindependent researchers, county officials, and court representatives. We reviewed them and assessed the evaluative methodology usedand the validity of reported findings. We did not analyze thereported results of three of them because they reported outcome datafor drug court defendants without any reference to comparison orcontrol groups. We were unable to assess the validity of one becauseit did not include a description of the methodology used. Two dealtwith one drug court and were assessed as one evaluation becauseone was a follow-up to the other and contained the same methodology and findings. To determine DOJ's responsibilities and plans forimplementing the federal grant program, we met with representatives of theOffice of Justice Programs, DOJ. We held discussions and revieweddocuments regarding their responsibilities and plans for implementingthe federally supported drug court program. We also obtained drugcourt funding information from the Department of Health and HumanServices' Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. Our review was done from January 1995 to April 1995 inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. AGENCY COMMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :3 In April 1995, we provided a draft of this report for commentto the Attorney General and the Project Director of the Drug CourtResource Center. On April 21, 1995, we discussed the report with the ProjectDirector of the Drug Court Resource Center. On May 5, 1995, we alsodiscussed the report with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General andother officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs. Theseofficials generally agreed with the information presented in the reportand provided comments that we incorporated as appropriate. DOJ officials said the report was positive, informative, andwill be helpful to drug court professionals. They explained thatthere is no universal model for drug courts, and as a result, each drugcourt operates differently due to local needs and conditions.Similarly, the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center saidthat the information presented in the report was comprehensive,accurate, and objective. ----------------------------------------------------------Letter :3.1 We are sending copies of this briefing report to otherinterested congressional committees and Members and the AttorneyGeneral. Copies will also be made available to others upon request. The major contributors to this briefing report are listed inappendix IV.

Rabkin Director, Administration of Justice Issues Briefing Section I DRUG COURTS ==============================================================Letter TYPES OF DRUG COURTS ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :4 (See figure in printed edition.) In the late 1980s, state and local criminal courts wereinundated with drug cases. One response to this challenge was thecreation of drug courts, a relatively recent grassroots movement to dealwith drug-related crime and drug-using defendants. According to DOJ, two main types of drug courts have evolved,those that (1) expedite the processing of drug cases and (2) use court-monitored drug treatment to attempt to achieve changesin defendants' drug-using behavior. In addition, some drugcourts combine these two types. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes grants for those drug courtsthat have programs offering court supervised drug treatment. The actdoes not authorize grants for courts designed solely to expedite the processing of drug cases. This briefing report providesinformation on drug treatment courts. Courts offering court-monitored drug treatment are referredto as "drug treatment courts" or simply "drugcourts." Although there is no standard definition applicable to drug treatment courts, theNational Association of Drug Court Professionals\3 defines them asfollows: "A Drug Court is a special court given theresponsibility to handle cases involving less serious drug using-offendersthrough a supervision and treatment program. These programs include frequent drug testing, judicial and probation supervision,drug counseling, treatment, educational opportunities, and the useof sanctions and incentives." One of the first drug courts to employ drug treatment as anintegral part of the processing of drug felonies is located in DadeCounty (Miami), FL, and began operations in June 1989. This courtbecame a model for other jurisdictions that implemented drug courts. Although drug courts share certain common elements such as court-monitored treatment, the courts are uniquely designedto meet local needs and can vary considerably in the way theyoperate. Organizationally, drug courts generally are distinct parts oftrial courts. -------------------- \3 This is the principal organization of professionalsinvolved in the development of treatment-oriented drug courts. Itsmembers include judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatmentservice providers, educators, researchers, and community leaders. DRUG COURT APPROACHES ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :5 (See figure in printed edition.) DRUG COURT APPROACHES ----------------------------------------------------------Letter :5.1 According to a report provided by the Drug Court ResourceCenter, drug courts have generally taken two approaches to processingcases: (1) deferred prosecution and (2) postadjudication. In thedeferred prosecution approach, shortly after being charged, defendantswaive their right to a speedy trial and enter a treatment program. Defendants who fail to complete the treatment program havetheir charges adjudicated. Defendants who complete the treatmentprogram are not prosecuted further or have their charges dismissed.This approach is intended to capitalize on the trauma of arrestand offers defendants the opportunity to obtain treatment and avoid the possibility of a felony conviction. In the postadjudication approach, defendants are tried andconvicted, but their sentences are deferred or pronounced andincarceration is suspended until they complete or withdraw from the treatmentprogram. This approach provides an incentive for the defendant torehabilitate because progress toward rehabilitation is factored into the sentencing determination. Appendix I presents examples of how cases are processed underthe two drug court approaches. PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :6 (See figure in printed edition.) PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ----------------------------------------------------------Letter :6.1 According to the Drug Court Resource Center, drug courtsgenerally accept defendants with substance abuse problems who arecurrently charged with drug possession and/or other nonviolent offensessuch as property crimes. Some drug courts accept defendants who haveprior convictions, and others do not. The Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center alsopointed out that drug courts do not accept defendants currentlycharged with a violent offense. The Project Director further commentedthat most drug courts do not accept defendants with prior violentoffenses. However, at least one drug court accepts defendantsregardless of prior offenses possibly including defendants with priorconvictions for violent crimes. Under the 1994 Crime Act, federal grantscannot be awarded to any drug court that allows either current orpast violent offenders to participate in its program. DRUG COURT PLAYERS ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :7 (See figure in printed edition.) DRUG COURT PLAYERS ----------------------------------------------------------Letter :7.1 According to a DOJ-funded report on the first national drugcourt conference,\4 judicial leadership is the foundation on whichthe overall drug court approach is most often built. Ajurisdiction's trial court provides the leadership, authority, andmanagement capacity to enable the drug court to operate. The drug courtis headed by a judge whose role is generally expanded beyondnormal court duties to include active involvement in monitoring thestatus of defendants in the treatment program. The judge's dutiesmay include conducting hearings, reviewing treatment progressreports, issuing bench warrants, and deciding who may enter theprogram and who should be terminated considering recommendations ofprosecutors, public defenders, and treatment providers. The judiciary alone, however, cannot successfully implementand operate a drug court, according to the conference report.Rather, a drug court requires a special collaborative effort amongjudges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and related criminal justiceagencies along with treatment providers and other social services and community organizations. This collaborative effort is basedon local needs and the targeted population being served and may differ considerably among drug courts. Specifically, drug courts create new and different roles for prosecutors and defense attorneys. In most drug courts theseplayers are not adversaries in the traditional sense but rather areto work in concert with the court for the sole purpose of helpingdefendants become drug free. This nonadversarial role is significantbecause the court does not arbitrate in the usual fashion and has the opportunity to address addiction-related issues. Further,drug courts place the defendant in the unique role of being heldpublicly accountable for his or her actions. -------------------- \4 Justice and Treatment Innovation: The Drug Court Movement,A Working Paper of the First National Drug Court Conference,December 1993, John S. Goldkamp, October 1994. COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT PROGRAMS ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :8 (See figure in printed edition.) COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT PROGRAMS ----------------------------------------------------------Letter :8.1 According to the Drug Court Resource Center, in most drugcourts, treatment is designed to usually last at least 1 year and is administered on an outpatient basis with limited inpatienttreatment as needed to address special detoxification or relapsesituations.\5 These courts operate with the philosophy that because drugaddiction is a disease relapses can occur, and that the court mustrespond with progressive sanctions and/or enhance treatment rather than immediately terminate a participant. The central element of all drug court programs is attendanceat the regularly scheduled status hearings at which the drug courtjudge monitors the progress of participants. Monitoring is based on treatment provider reports on urine test results that detectdrug use, attendance at counseling, etc. The judge reinforcesprogress and addresses noncompliance with program requirements. Theprimary objective of the status hearing is to keep the defendant in treatment. -------------------- \5 These programs recognize that some individuals willrequire a longer period to complete the program. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------Letter :9 (See figure in printed edition.) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------Letter :9.1 Overall, according to the Drug Court Resource Center,treatment program requirements are more demanding than the applicablesanction received through traditional adjudication. Most drug courtprograms require that defendants attend status hearings, participatein counseling sessions, and submit to urine tests with the goalof becoming drug free. Some programs focus on special classes of defendants such as women. Many programs also provide support services such as public health services; assistance withhousing, food, and child care; vocational training; and job placement. TREATMENT PHASES -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :10 (See figure in printed edition.) TREATMENT PHASES ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :10.1 Treatment services are generally divided into three phases:(1) detoxification, (2) stabilization, and (3) aftercare. First,the defendant's physical dependence on drugs is eliminatedthrough detoxification. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an adjunctto treatment in the detoxification phase. According to theProject Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, 9 of 20 drugcourts responding to the Center's 1994 survey indicated that theyused acupuncture. Second, the defendant's psychological cravingfor the drugs is treated during stabilization. Frequent group and/or individual counseling sessions are employed during thisphase. And third, aftercare focuses on helping the defendant obtaineducation or job training, find a job, and remain drug free. PROGRAM SANCTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :11 (See figure in printed edition.) PROGRAM SANCTIONS ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :11.1 Sanctions for failing to abide by program rules can include(1) verbal admonition from the judge; (2) demotion to an earlierstage of the program; (3) incarceration for several days or weeks,increasing with the number and severity of the violations; and (4) morefrequent status hearings, treatment sessions, or urine tests. Manyprograms also use graduated sanctions, increasing the severity of thesanction with subsequent violations of program rules. DOJ also pointed out that most drug courts use sanctions notto simply punish inappropriate behavior but to augment thetreatment process. For example, many drug courts will place a defendantin residential treatment if he or she is unable to achievesatisfactory progress in an outpatient setting. In addition, many drugcourts incarcerate defendants for the purpose of detoxificationrather than detain them for inappropriate behavior. REASONS FOR TERMINATING DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :12 (See figure in printed edition.) REASONS FOR TERMINATING DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :12.1 Drug courts use various criteria for ending a defendant's participation in the program before completion. These mayinclude a new felony offense; multiple failures to comply with program requirements, such as not attending status hearings ortreatment sessions; and a pattern of positive urine tests. According toDOJ, many drug courts do not terminate defendants for a new drug possession offense. Before terminating a defendant for continuing to use drugs,drug courts will use an array of treatment services and available sanctions. There are no uniform standards for the number offailed urine tests and failures to attend treatment sessions thatresult in a participant being terminated that apply to all programs.Each drug court sets its own standards. Relapses are expected and theextent to which noncompliance results in terminations varies fromprogram to program. Generally, the drug court judge makes the decision toterminate, but the prosecutor or treatment provider can recommend thetermination. Once a defendant is terminated, he or she will be referredfor adjudication or sentencing. PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :13 (See figure in printed edition.) PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :13.1 Drug courts typically require defendants to complete atreatment program in order to graduate. Some impose other conditions defendants must meet after treatment. These could includeremaining drug free and not being arrested for a specified period oftime, paying restitution, being employed full-time, or performingcommunity service. For example, the Seattle, WA, drug court requires that adefendant complete all phases of the program to graduate. However, the Beaumont, TX, drug court requires that, in addition tocompleting the treatment program, the defendant maintain sobriety for aspecified time and participate in education and vocational trainingand/or be working full-time. EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :14 (See figure in printed edition.) EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :14.1 In many jurisdictions, completion of the drug court programleads to a dismissal of charges or cessation of prosecution. Inothers, the guilty plea can be stricken, the defendant can be sentencedto probation in lieu of incarceration, or the defendant'sprobation can be shortened. DOJ pointed out that some drug courts will seal all caserecords, including arrests, when defendants complete the program. Thesealing of records is particularly significant when attempting tomeasure the impact of drug court programs at a later date. NUMBER OF DRUG COURTS STARTED, 1989-1994 -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :15 (See figure in printed edition.) Note: One drug court was started in March 1995.

NUMBER OF DRUG COURTS STARTED, 1989-1994 ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :15.1 According to the Drug Court Resource Center, as of March1995, there were at least 37 drug courts operating across the country.\6Of these drug courts, 29 had been fully operational for at least 9months, and 8 others had been operating for a lesser period. The number of drug courts steadily increased from 1991 to1994, with substantial increases since 1993. As of March 1995, 24jurisdictions were developing drug courts. Another eight jurisdictions had exhibited interest in starting drug courts by initiatingfeasibility studies. Appendix II lists the number of drug courts in operation andbeing developed. -------------------- \6 Because of the absence of any official requirement toreport their existence to a central organization, additional drug courtsmay exist. DRUG COURT LOCATIONS AS OF MARCH 1995 -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :16 (See figure in printed edition.) Source: Drug Court Resource Center data. (See figure in printed edition.) DRUG COURT LOCATIONS AS OF MARCH 1995 ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :16.1 According to the Drug Court Resource Center, the 37 drugcourts in operation as of March 1995 are located in 15 states and theDistrict of Columbia. The largest number of drug courts are located in Florida, with 10, followed by California, with 6. There aretwo drug courts in each of six states, and there is one drug court ineach of the remaining eight states and the District of Columbia. The specific location of each drug court is shown in appendix II. DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :17 (See figure in printed edition.) N = 20,421 (See figure in printed edition.) Note 1: Based on responses from 33 drug courts. (See figure in printed edition.) Note 2: Percentages do not add to 100 percent due to rounding. (See figure in printed edition.) Source: GAO questionnaires. (See figure in printed edition.) DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :17.1 Data obtained from 33 of 37 drug courts responding to our questionnaire showed that since inception of the first drugcourt in 1989, 20,421 persons have participated in drug courts. Ofthese, 7,235 participants have graduated, and 7,595 are currently inthe programs. The remaining participants did not complete theprograms. Generally, when participants do not complete drug courtprograms it is because they were terminated, voluntarily withdrew, ordied. Based on the data received, these totaled 5,591.\7 The number of participants currently in each of these drugcourt programs varied widely, ranging from a low of 1 participantin Santa Ana, CA, a new drug court,\8 to a high of 1,200 participantsin Miami, FL, one of the oldest drug courts. The median numberof participants in these drug court programs is 105. It should be noted that many of the drug courts have beenoperating for less than a year and would not yet have graduates. Asshown, more than one-third of the total participants are currentlyenrolled in drug court programs. -------------------- \7 We calculated the number (5,591) of participants notcompleting the programs by subtracting the number (7,235) of graduatesand the number (7,595) of participants currently in the programs fromthe total number (20,421) of participants in the programs sincetheir inception. \8 At the time of our review, Orange County, CA, had filedfor bankruptcy and curtailed resources for its drug court. FUNDING SOURCES -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :18 (See figure in printed edition.) According to the Drug Court Resource Center Project Director,drug courts generally piece together funding from a variety ofsources. Information reported to the Drug Court Resource Center by 15drug courts showed that these sources included local taxes andsurcharges, state alcohol and drug agency funds, private foundationmonies, participant fees, and federal grants. Some drug courts have developed innovative fundingapproaches. For example, a drug court judge from Orange County, CA, told usthat when the county filed for bankruptcy, it cut back servicesnecessary for the drug court operation. The judge said that he was forminga nonprofit corporation to try to provide funding for the drugcourt outside of the bankruptcy proceedings. Until the 1994 Crime Act, there was no federal grant program specifically designed for drug courts. However, some drugcourts have received federal grants and technical assistance fromthe Department of Health and Human Services' Center for SubstanceAbuse Treatment (CSAT) and DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance(BJA). According to CSAT, it has provided or plans to provide anestimated $15 million in assistance to some drug courts. Of the $15million, about $6 million is for a drug court demonstration projectfor the District of Columbia Superior Court. BJA could not provide us with complete information on DOJgrants used in support of drug courts. According to a BJA official,"drug courts" was not a specific grant category that granteescould designate for funding. However, this official commented thatBJA is aware that DOJ grant funds provided under other grantcategories such as "corrections options" have been used in supportof drug courts, and that three drug courts had received $2.5 million from the Corrections Options program.\9 -------------------- \9 The Corrections Options program assists states withdesign, development, and implementation of innovative alternatives to traditional modes of incarceration. PARTICIPANT FEES -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :19 (See figure in printed edition.) PARTICIPANT FEES ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :19.1 We obtained data (based on our questionnaire and informationprovided by the Drug Court Resource Center) from 34 drug courts onfees charged to participants in drug court programs. Twenty-threeof the 34 drug courts reported that they charged fees, and 11reported that they did not. Insufficient data on fee amounts actuallycollected precluded us from determining the extent to which drug courtsrelied on participant fees as a funding source. Of the 23 drug courts charging participant fees, the amountscharged for the total cost of treatment ranged from $20 to $2,500.One drug court reported charging fees on a sliding scale from $60 to$300 for treatment based on a defendant's ability to pay, whileanother reported charging on a sliding scale from $500 to $2,500. Atleast nine courts responded that they charged fees ranging from$200 to $350. Several drug courts reported applying participant fees tocounseling and treatment costs, drug testing costs, and other programexpenses. In addition, DOJ commented that many treatment providersbelieve participant fees are a useful therapeutic tool and should becharged regardless of the extent to which fees are needed to coverprogram costs. COST SAVINGS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :20 (See figure in printed edition.) COST SAVINGS ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :20.1 Drug courts have reported information to the Drug CourtResource Center on savings that they believe their programs haveachieved in the costs of court and other criminal justice systemoperations. One of the larger categories of savings reported by drugcourts was jail costs avoided, i.e., the estimated costs ofincarcerating a typical drug court defendant that would be expected to incurif he/she were not participating in a drug court program. Onecourt estimated savings of $5,400 per drug court participant, andanother estimated savings of $2,566 to $5,185. Another drug court claimed a savings of $2 million over a3-year period resulting from drug court participants spending fewerdays in custody and the consequent ability of the county to rentunused jail cells to other law enforcement agencies. Still another drugcourt estimated it had saved about $875,500 in jail costs for itsprogram but did not specify the time frame. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals notedthat drug court programs are much less costly than the incarceration of drug-using offenders. The Association reported thatincarceration of drug-using offenders ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 annually,and the cost to build a prison cell is $80,000 to $90,000. It alsosaid that drug courts cost less than $1,500 annually for each offender. Some drug courts identified savings such as reduced caseloadsof other trial judges not in the drug court program. Inaddition, some drug courts claimed savings in court-appointed attorney fees,reduced probation office caseloads, and costs of prosecution,arrests, and police overtime. We did not verify this information, and further analysis ofall drug court costs is essential to fully understanding the benefitsof these programs. Briefing Section II EVALUATIONS OF DRUG COURTS ==============================================================Letter DO DRUG COURTS MAKE A DIFFERENCE? -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :21 (See figure in printed edition.) In evaluating the effectiveness of drug courts, the basicquestion is: Do drug courts make a difference? Specifically, dodefendants who successfully complete drug court programs exhibit reduced recidivism, decreased drug use, and other socially beneficialeffects as a result of participating in drug court programs whencompared to their counterparts, i.e., control groups who were not exposedto the same drug court treatment? Based on evaluations we reviewed, drug courts generally mayhave some beneficial effects. However, because of the nature of thestudy designs and the short periods of time elapsed betweentreatment and measurement of outcomes (drug courts are relatively new),firm conclusions cannot be drawn about the effects of drug courts. It is both difficult and costly to conduct programevaluations that can measure program effects. Although the strongest designinvolves assembling and randomly assigning defendants to controlgroups (comparing drug courts versus traditional courts, forexample), such studies raise serious logistical and ethical issues.Additionally, according to the Project Director of the Drug Court ResourceCenter, control groups cannot be used properly unless a drug court is originally designed to define such groups. An alternative approach is to design studies allowing theresearcher to create comparable groups from existing programs, throughthe use of various analytical techniques. However, even such studiesare often made more difficult by the fact that existing programschange over time, resulting in individuals at the end of the studyperiod being exposed to different treatments than those at thebeginning. Also, different locations of the same program may have verydifferent implementation needs, making it more difficult to comparesuch programs. GAO ASSESSED DRUG COURT EVALUATIONS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :22 (See figure in printed edition.) We assessed six evaluations that compared performanceoutcomes for drug court defendants to the experiences of other defendants,i.e., previous divertees or unsuccessful drug court defendants or defendants who had never been in a drug court. In order todetermine whether a drug court has an impact on its participants, anevaluation should compare outcomes of drug court defendants to those ofother groups of similar defendants who are not in drug courts. The six evaluations covered five drug courts and variedconsiderably in terms of the study designs, types of outcomes measured,and scope of analyses performed on the available information. Ourassessment indicates that the evaluations differed particularly in termsof the validity of the designs, which determine the extent to whichthe reader is able to draw conclusions from any findings. Of thesix studies: two studies had fairly strong designs; of these, one providedsome evidence of an effect of the drug court program, and theother study's results were too preliminary to draw any conclusions; two studies had designs with more serious problems; of these,one suggested possible effects of the program, and the other was inconclusive; and two studies had design weaknesses that prevented anyconclusions about the effects of the program. The major outcome measure used, in five of the sixevaluations, was recidivism (rearrest rates). To a lesser degree,recidivism-related measures were also used, such as length of time beforerearrest and days spent in custody for felony offenses. We focused onthese measures in this report because they provided the strongestevidence for the long-term effect of the drug court programs, eventhough other measures were used in these studies. EVALUATION OUTCOMES -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :23 (See figure in printed edition.) Two of the six evaluations were well-designed. However, theresults in terms of recidivism outcomes were mixed. One of theevaluations showed that drug court defendants had significantly lowerrearrest rates than defendants not in drug court, and that they spentfewer days in custody for felony offenses (app. III, evaluation 1).This evaluation also showed that drug court defendants had a lowerrate of failures-to-appear for required court hearings than did other defendants. However, the other evaluation, with preliminary information only, showed no significant difference so far inrearrest rates between drug court defendants and defendants who werenot in the drug court (app. III, evaluation 2). Although these evaluations have strong study designs and one indicates some beneficial effects on defendants resultingfrom the drug court programs, the evidence does not permit firmconclusions about the effects of the drug courts studied. Additionally,for one of the evaluations, insufficient time had elapsed to providefirmer evidence of program effect. Of the next two evaluations, both of the same drug court, one provided some suggestive evidence of program effect. Itshowed lower recidivism by drug court defendants and longer time beforerearrest (app. III, evaluation 3). The other generally showed nodifference in recidivism rates (app. III, evaluation 4). Design problemsmade it difficult to attribute these findings to the programs.There are too many potential differences between the drug courtparticipants and the groups to which they were compared to develop strong conclusions. The final two evaluations did not provide reliable evidence concerning the effects of the programs. One showed nosubstantial difference in recidivism between drug court defendants anddefendants who left the drug court (app. III, evaluation 5). The other evaluation measured defendants' drug abstinence andfailure-to-appear rates and showed positive results for drug court defendantsas compared to defendants terminated from the drug court (app.III, evaluation 6). Because the study design did not control for anumber of factors, such as motivation and susceptibility totreatment, these evaluations do not permit conclusions to be drawn about theeffects of the programs. Appendix III contains further information on each of these evaluations. Briefing Section III FEDERAL DRUG COURT GRANT PROGRAM ==============================================================Letter THE 1994 CRIME ACT -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :24 (See figure in printed edition.) THE 1994 CRIME ACT ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :24.1 Beginning in fiscal year 1995, DOJ may provide jurisdictionswith drug court grants. Title V of the Violent Crime Control andLaw Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) authorizes theAttorney General to award discretionary drug court grants to states,units of local government, Indian tribal governments, and state andlocal courts. Grants may be awarded to drug court programs when ajudge continuously supervises the progress of nonviolent offenderswith substance abuse problems. The act requires the Attorney General to issue regulations toensure that jurisdictions receiving drug court grants to supporttheir programs do not allow violent offenders to participate. Itdefines a violent offender as a person who is charged with or convictedof an offense involving a firearm, dangerous weapon, death, seriousbodily injury, or force; or who has one or more prior convictionsfor a violent felony crime. Drug court programs must also integrate a number of judicial sanctions and treatment services. Specifically, the actrequires programs to include (1) mandatory periodic testing for theuse of addictive substances; (2) substance abuse treatment; (3)diversion, probation, or other supervised releases with the possibilityof prosecution, confinement, or incarceration when participantsdo not comply with program requirements or fail to show satisfactory progress; and (4) program and aftercare services, such asrelapse prevention, health care, education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement, and child care. FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG COURTS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :25 (See figure in printed edition.) FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG COURTS ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :25.1 The 1994 Crime Act authorized a total of $1 billion forfiscal years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. Althoughthe act authorized $100 million for fiscal year 1995, DOJ's fiscalyear 1995 Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-317) included only $29million for the drug court program. However, Congress has proposed fiscalyear 1995 budget cuts for the drug court program. On March 16,1995, the House passed H.R. 1158, the Emergency SupplementalAppropriations Act of 1995, which rescinds $27.75 million for the drug court program. During its consideration of H.R. 1158, the Senatereduced the rescission to $17.1 million. On April 6, 1995, the Senatepassed its version of the bill and requested a conference with theHouse. The House and Senate conferees began May 3, 1995, to try toreconcile the separate provisions of the bill. The President's fiscal year 1996 budget requests $150 millionfor drug court grants. However, H.R. 667 (The Violent Crime Incarceration Act of 1995) passed by the House ofRepresentatives on February 10, 1995, would amend Title V of the 1994 Crime Actand in doing so would repeal the 1994 Crime Act's drug courtdiscretionary grant provisions. On February 22, 1995, H.R. 667 was referredto the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DRUG COURTS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :26 (See figure in printed edition.) DOJ recognizes that no single model exists for an effectivedrug court. Consequently, DOJ plans to maintain flexibility inawarding grants to programs that use a variety of approaches tocoordinate drug treatment and persuade offenders to abstain from drugswith the goal of becoming drug free. In addition, given the greatdiversity in the structure and operation of state and local courts andcriminal justice systems, DOJ plans to allow jurisdictions to tailorlocal initiatives to best suit their needs and local conditions. DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has overallresponsibility for the new federal drug court program, including policy setting.To carry out this responsibility, OJP has hired an actingdirector and policy analyst to staff its Drug Court Program Office. Inaddition, BJA, an office of OJP, recently established a Drug CourtProgram Office to manage and monitor drug court program grants,according to an OJP official. BJA has hired four people to staff thisoffice. Since November 1994, OJP and BJA staffs have worked togetherto develop program guidelines and application materials.\10 Currently, these staffs are considering the most appropriateand effective ways of providing technical assistance to federally supported drug courts, operating drug courts, and relatedfederal projects to be funded with other fiscal year 1995 resources.The level and source of funding to support this technicalassistance is also under review. OJP's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is responsible forfunding a national evaluation of drug court program impacts. Thisevaluation will assess whether federally supported drug court programshave helped their participants to break the cycle of substanceabuse and crime. It will also assess the cost-effectiveness of theseprograms. NIJ is also responsible for ensuring that drug court programsuse part of their grants to conduct process evaluations. Theseare aimed at determining, among other things, if the drug court isachieving its objectives, if it was implemented as originally intended,and whether major changes are appropriate. They will also examinehow drug courts affect the rest of the court system and otherelements of the criminal justice system. -------------------- \10 In March 1995, DOJ published Drug Court Grant ProgramGuidelines and Application Information. FISCAL YEAR 1995 DRUG COURT GRANT PROGRAM -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :27 (See figure in printed edition.) FISCAL YEAR 1995 DRUG COURT GRANT PROGRAM ---------------------------------------------------------Letter :27.1 If Congress does not rescind the fiscal year 1995appropriation, DOJ plans to award grants for planning, implementing, andimproving or enhancing drug court programs. Eligible applicants may applyonly for one type of grant. Assuming no rescission is enacted, ofthe $29 million appropriated for fiscal year 1995, DOJ plans to awardup to 100 planning grants for not more than $35,000 each tojurisdictions interested in establishing drug courts, 10 implementation grants for not more than $1 million each to jurisdictions that have identified their target populationsand case processing procedures, 3 additional implementation grants for not more than $2million to larger jurisdictions with populations exceeding 1 million,and 20 improvement and enhancement grants for not more than $1million to jurisdictions that have already established drug courts. Federal grants for each drug court program will be 75 percentof program costs. The grantees will be required to provide cashto fund the remaining 25 percent. Applications are due by May 23, 1995. Then, OJP and BJAstaffs will focus on screening and processing qualified applications for potential grant awards, pending final congressional action onthe fiscal year 1995 budget rescission. If the current deadlinefor filing drug court applications does not change, the firstgrants are expected to be awarded in the summer of 1995. EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED DRUG COURTS -----------------------------------------------------------Letter :28 (See figure in printed edition.) Evaluating effectiveness is a critical element of the federaldrug court program. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes the AttorneyGeneral to carry out or make arrangements for evaluations of programsthat receive discretionary program grants. The act also mandatesus to study and assess the effectiveness and impact of thesediscretionary grants and report to the Congress by January 1, 1997. OJP program guidelines require recipients of drug courtgrants to cooperate with a national evaluation team. The evaluationwill be aimed at measuring program impact primarily through the useof the following criteria: reduction in recidivism rates of program participants, maintenance of acceptable treatment completion rates, decreased participant drug use, and maintenance of a cost-effective program. NIJ is responsible for overseeing the national evaluation.The evaluation will focus on treatment and its impact and isexpected to take at least 2 years to complete. At the time of our review,NIJ was developing the solicitation for proposals to conduct the evaluation. Program guidelines also require each drug court grantrecipient to conduct process evaluations of their programs. For these evaluations, grantees are expected to collect descriptiveinformation on the role of drug court players, potential eligiblepopulation, and participant program characteristics. Grantees will also beasked to collect information on program procedures used to identifyand screen eligible offenders, accept and assess offenders, respond torelapses, manage and monitor cases, and discharge and referparticipants.

OUTCOMES REPORTED IN AND GAO'S ASSESSMENT OF EVALUATIONS OF FIVE DRUG COURTS =========================================================Appendix III EVALUATION 1: F.I.R.S.T. OAKLAND -------------------------------------------------------Appendix III:1 TREATMENT GROUP --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:1.0.1 Drug use defendants granted admission to a diversion program. Admission requirements changed during the course of thestudy. STUDY DESIGN --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:1.0.2 Comparison of 110 defendants in a program with a similargroup of 110 defendants in a different program a year earlier. TIME OF STUDY --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:1.0.3 Drug court participants referred in January and February of1991; earlier group referred in January 1990 through March of 1990.The report contained a 3-year follow-up study. KEY MEASURES --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:1.0.4 (1)Felony rearrests: Drug court defendants had a loweraverage rate of felony rearrests per defendants (0.75) than had previousdivertees (1.33). (2)Days in custody for felony offenses: Drug courtdefendants, on average, spent fewer days in custody per defendant (44) thanhad previous divertees (78). (3)Bench warrants: Drug court defendants, on average, hadfewer bench warrants issued for failures to appear at courthearings (0.67) than had previous divertees (1.1). ASSESSMENT --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:1.0.5 There were some questions concerning the comparability of thetwo groups, as well as the eligibility requirements for the twoprograms. (The report stated that eligibility requirements were relaxedfor the drug court program participants in order to obtain a broadergroup for comparative purposes.) In spite of these concerns, theevaluation suggested some fairly strong evidence of program successafter 3 years. EVALUATION 2: MARICOPA COUNTY -------------------------------------------------------Appendix III:2 TREATMENT GROUP --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:2.0.1 Offenders sentenced to probation for first-time drugpossession convictions. STUDY DESIGN --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:2.0.2 Random assignment to four groups: (1)No drug testing, frequent visits (n=approximately 154). (2)Monthly random drug testing, occasional visits(n=approximately 154). (3)Biweekly scheduled drug testing, limited visits(n=approximately 154). (4)Drug court, with testing and treatment supervised by aprobation officer (n=177). TIME OF STUDY --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:2.0.3 Participants in program between March 1992 and April 1993.Current data reported only preliminary findings after 6 months. KEY MEASURES --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:2.0.4 (1)Rearrest rates: No statistically significant differences(16.95 percent for the drug court group vs. 15.37 percent forothers). (2)Rates of technical probation violations: Drug court grouphad lower rates than those of others (7.9 percent vs. 11.9percent). ASSESSMENT --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:2.0.5 Although the evaluation design was quite strong, the resultswere preliminary; insufficient time had elapsed to provide a firm indication of program effect. Future comparisons may becomplicated by the fact that the drug court sample had lower rates ofreported history of prior marijuana use. Otherwise, the control groups (groups 1-3) were quite similar to the drug court group(group 4). EVALUATION 3: DADE COUNTY (GOLDKAMP AND WEILAND) -------------------------------------------------------Appendix III:3 TREATMENT GROUP --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:3.0.1 Persons arrested for 2nd and 3rd degree drug-relatedfelonies. STUDY DESIGN --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:3.0.2 Five key groups:\11 (1)Persons admitted to drug court program (n=326). (2)Sample of felony drug defendants in same period noteligible because of more serious drug-related offenses (n=199). (3)Sample of nondrug felony defendants in same period(n=185). (4)Sample of felony drug defendants in period several yearsearlier (n=302). (5)Sample of felony nondrug defendants in period severalyears earlier (n=536). In addition, the evaluation compared persons completing thedrug court program with those failing to complete. -------------------- \11 An additional sample of offenders could not reliably beused as a control group because they were exposed to the drug courtprogram. TIME OF STUDY --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:3.0.3 Participants in groups 1-3 had charges filed in August 1990and September 1990. Charges for groups 4-5 were filed in thesummer of 1987. Data report results after 18 month follow-up. KEY MEASURES --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:3.0.4 (1)Rearrest rates: Drug court defendants were rearrested at a statistically significant lower rate (33 percent, vs. 40percent to 53 percent for other groups). (2)Time before rearrest: Drug court defendants hadstatistically significant longer time before rearrest (median of 235 days,vs. 52 to 115 days for other groups). (3)Rearrests and treatment completion: Rearrest rates were associated with failure to complete the treatment program. ASSESSMENT --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:3.0.5 The results suggested an effect of the program. However, thestudy design was unable to make the comparison with offenders inthe same situation with similarly serious drug offenses; therefore,the results must be interpreted cautiously. In particular, thedrug court sample had fewer prior arrests than had the othercomparison groups, and the key group of felony drug defendants used for comparative purposes were not eligible for the drug courtprogram because of the seriousness of their charges or prior records. The comparisons between those completing and failing tocomplete the program must also be viewed with caution, due to possible motivational and other differences between the groups. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials notedthat this study had a strong design with carefully drawncomparison groups. We agree that the study's design was generallystrong. However, as we state in this report, there were somepotentially important differences in prior arrest rates between thegroups, and the study was not able to compare similarly situated drugdefendants in a roughly similar time period. Therefore, as we noted, the study's results should be interpreted cautiously. EVALUATION 4: DADE COUNTY (SMITH, DAVIS AND GORETSKY) -------------------------------------------------------Appendix III:4 TREATMENT GROUP --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:4.0.1 Defendants with no prior convictions charged with a drugpossession offense, admitting to a drug problem for which they wantedtreatment. STUDY DESIGN --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:4.0.2 Comparison of 318 defendants assigned to the drug court witha sample of 99 narcotics cases in early 1988. In addition, a group ofdrug court defendants who were accepted into the drug courtprogram were compared on rearrest rates. TIME OF STUDY --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:4.0.3 Participants were assigned to the drug court in January 1990through March 1990. The comparison group was charged between January1988 and March 1988. KEY MEASURES --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:4.0.4 (1)Rearrest rates: There was no statistically significantdifference in the rate of felony rearrests after 1 year between thoseassigned to drug court (32 percent) and the comparison group ofdefendants charged 2 years earlier (33 percent). Those defendantsaccepted by the drug court did have lower rates of rearrest (15 percent),but the authors noted that these individuals constituted "ahighly select group . . . least disposed to commit new crimes." Therearrest results in this evaluation differed from those in the other evaluation of Dade County (evaluation 3). (2)Sentencing dispositions: There were statisticallysignificant differences in dispositions between those assigned to drugcourt and the comparison group of earlier defendants. Those assigned todrug court were more likely not to face further prosecution andless likely to serve probation or short jail terms. ASSESSMENT --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:4.0.5 There were concerns about the comparability of theparticipants in the various groups. In particular, the finding of lowerrearrest rates for program participants should be viewed cautiously inlight of the selectivity of admission to the program. As a result,there were strong reservations about the results reported. DOJ officials, in commenting on a draft of this report,indicated that this study had several flaws. They pointed out that thestudy was done when this drug court was less than 10 months old.They further noted that information on successful drug courtparticipants was not available for evaluation because the participants'records were sealed. We concur with these comments. EVALUATION 5: BROWARD COUNTY (TERRY) -------------------------------------------------------Appendix III:5 TREATMENT GROUP --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:5.0.1 First-time offenders arrested for possession or purchase ofcocaine. STUDY DESIGN --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:5.0.2 Comparison of 392 defendants completing or remaining in thedrug court program with 241 defendants not completing the drugcourt program. TIME OF STUDY --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:5.0.3 Participants entered the program from July 1991 through June1992. Study results were reported for October 1993. KEY MEASURES --------------------------------------------------- AppendixIII:5.0.4 Rearrests: Persons remaining in the program committedfelonies at a slightly lower rate than did those leaving the program (7.7percent vs. 12.0 percent). (Cases dismissed were not included inthese comparisons.) No differences occurred in comparing theproportions having committed misdemeanors (4.1 percent for personsremaining in the program vs. 5.0 percent for those leaving the program).

Yet evidence from the researchliterature continues to accumulate, indicating that some drugtreatment programs have been successful in reducing recidivism.Following an overview of pertinent research findings, this paperoutlines the elements of an effective strategy for treatingcocaine and heroin abusing offenders. The interventions proposed in this paper grow out of the drugabuse research literature, the authors' urban-based research, andtheir clinical expcriencc with drug abuse treatment incorrections. In addition, the suggested interventions emerge fromyears of correctional outcome research which has assessed whatworks, with whom, and under what circumstances. Although thispaper will focus on heroin and cocaine involved offenders, somerecommendations may apply to offenders who use other illicitdrugs. Research findings The problem Recent research provides amplc evidence that offenderpopulations are composed of large numbers of drug abusers-andthat drug-involved offenders commit substantial number-, ofundetected crimes. Very recent cocaine and heroin abusers constitute amajority of the arrestees and inmates in jails and prisons in NewYork City and some other jurisdictions. National surveys of jail and prison populations, smallerself-report studies, and urine testing results indicate thatincreasing proportions of offenders are users of drugs and thatcocaine use is increasing the most rapidly. More thanthree-quarters of the nation's inmates and almost all inmates inNew York City report illicit drug use.' Similarly, sclf-rcportstudies among prison and jail inmates in California, Michigan,and Texas reveal that approximately half are heroin users andmany are daily heroin users.' Recent urinalysis-based studies ofarrestees in Washington, D.C. reveal that well over half testpositive for at least one illicit drug and a quarter testpositive for two or more illicit drugs, In a recent Manhattanstudy the level of co caine use had doubled .;ince 1984.Eighty-three percent of arrestees in September and October 1986tested positive for cocaine, compared with 42 percent in 1984;the increase in cocaine was found at all age levels and for alloffenses. Comparable increases have also been reported inWashington, DC. Frequent users of heroin and cocaine in the generalpopulation exhibit a multiproblem lifestyle that mayinclude a pattern of persistent criminal behavior. Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that is partof a complex multiproblem lifestyle which is highly resistant torehabilitation. Several studies show that daily or near dailyheroin users-many of whom also use other illicit substancesdaily-are not in treatment, and do not seek treatment. Many alsoconsume alcohol heavily. They average over 200 non-drug crimcsand hundreds of drug distribution offenses annually, yet areunlikely to be arrested more than once a year, and then spendless than a month in incarceration, The majority commit manycrimes for which they are not arrested or incarcerated, butbecause of sheer volume of activity, they still have many morearrests and incarceration periods than non-drug offenders. Overhalf their generally modest income comes from drug distributionactivities. They usually spend most of that income on drugs.Daily heroin abusers also generally do not have a residence normake their own meals, but rather stay and eat with a relative orfriend. They do not receive or seek public assistance. They haveno legal employment during a typical week nor do they seek any.Thus, they are typically an economic burden on the poorestmembers of their low-income communities. Many aspects of theirlifestyle also put them at high risk for violence and many othersocial and health problems such as AIDS, alcoholism, and TB.Therefore, whatever treatment programming is applied to thispopulation, it must contend with all or most of these problems ifit is to achieve long-term changes in this lifestyle.' Data about chronic cocaine users' crime rates are not as welldeveloped. Recent evidence from street and treatment settinginterviews with crack users indicate that about 60 percent admitpaying for their cocaine with money derived from illicitsources-ranging from drug dealing and prostitution to theft androbbery. The persons using cocaine, however, generally come frommore varied socioeconomic backgrounds than heroin users, theirlifestyles vary accordingly, and many do not ever get arrested.Nevertheless, the lifestyles of cocaine abusers who do becomeinvolved with the criminal justice system appear to be verysimilar to those of heroin abusers, as cocaine users often alsouse heroin. The criminal justiceresponse While much remains to be learned about the precise nature ofthe links betnveen doing drugs and doing crime, the two behaviorsare clearly associated. Yet criminal justice agencies have fewstrategies for routinely detecting and intervening in the druguse of arrested heroin and cocaine abusers. The justice systemfocuses almost exclusively on its criminal processing functionsof arrest, adjudication, probation, incarceration, and parole.Even these interventions often represent a limited intrusion onthe criminal activities of the drug abusing offender. Criminal justice agencies, with rare exceptions, do notseek or use information about the drug use of persons who arearrested or convicted of crimes. Littlc cffort is made to identify drug abusers, to recordinformation about their drug use, to provide treatment (otherthan dctoxification) while in jail or prison, to refer them totreatment programs in the community, or to use such informationin plea bargaining or case dispositions (where legallyappropriate). Only a few jurisdictions maintain anyinformation about the drug use of arrestees or convictedoffenders, and there is a strong likelihood that the druginformation in their records is both incomplete and inaccuratebecause it is most often based on self-report and notsubstantiated through urinalysis. Thus, information that couldhelp inform criminal justice processing is not generallyavailable.' To the extent that criminal sanctions are applied, theirability to interrupt the life style of the vast majority ofcocainc-heroin abusers is minimal. Nationally, only a low percentage (less than 10 percent) ofall felony arrests lead to a felony conviction resulting inincarceration. Over half of all felony arrests (60 percent inManhattan) lead to conviction, but there is much variation byjurisdiction. Typically, offenders plead guilty to lesser chargesand are sentenced to time served, a fine, community service,probation, or a few months in jail. Consequently, the vastmajority of offenders, mainly those arrested on less severefelony and misdemeanor charges, are at liberty within threemonths after arrest. In addition, many felony offenders (asignificant portion of whom are involved with drugs) are atliberty on bail or on personal recognizance while awaiting trial.Active heroin-cocaine users have higher failure-to-appear ratesand much higher rates of rearrest while out on bail thanoffenders not involved with drugs.9 The efficacy ofcriminal sanctions Little evidence is available that criminal justice sanctionsalone are as effective as drug treatment in reducing the drug useand criminality of cocaineheroin abusers at liberty. The centralvalue of the criminal process may lie in the leverage that can beexerted to bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment. Existing evidence does not show that criminal justicesanctions (fine, probation, or parole, or length of time served)reduce criminality or drug use more effectively than drugtreatment among cocaine-heroin abusers. It is not known whether or to what extent jail or prison timealone suppresses post-incarceration criminality or cocaine-heroinabuse among drug involved offenderq- The limited evidenceavailable suggests that two-thirds or more of arrestedheroin abusers return to heroin-cocaine use and their diversecriminal patterns within three months after release fromdetention. In contrast, several studies of drug treatmentoutcomes with criminal justice clients (mainly probationers) showsubstantial post-treatment reductions in both drug use andcriminality.10 Outpatient clients in methadone treatment reportless than half as much criminal activity as heroin abusers not intreatment. Compared with their pretreatment criminality,methadone clients report 50 to 80 percent less crime duringtreatment." Even among those who continue criminal activityduring treatment, methadone clients report reduced involvement inserious crimes such as robbery, burglary, or dealing of heroin orcocaine; they report mainly low-level property crimes, con games,and sale of marijuana or pills." Residential drug programs have sizable proportions(frequently over half) of clients who are on probation or paroleor under related legal pressure, and whose criminality isnear zero while in the residential program. This nearzerocriminality of cocaine-heroin abusers while in residentialprograms is documented for therapeutic communities in severalcities. A study of treatment facilities in New York found thatabout a third of residential clients were criminal justicereferrals and had extensive criminal histories. These clientstended to stay longer and have as good or better outcomes thanclients with similar pretreatment criminal and drug abusehistories who were not referred by the criminal justice system.13 The coercive power, surveillance potential, and timeoffcmd through criminal justice sanctions, open significantopportunities for effectively treating cocaine-heroin abusers. Although criminal justice sanctions alone may have uncertainvalue in reducing the criminality of drug involved offenders,those sanctions can serve a powerful role by facilitatingeffective drug treatment. There are a variety of pressures thatbring hardcore drug abusers into treatment: parents, employers,loved one, and friends may all apply psychological and socialpressures. The most powerful pressure, however, may be the threatof legal sanction -- the threat of arrest and conviction, andmost importantly, the threat of incarceration. The leveragecreated by this threat, and by the sanction itself, permitstreatment to be considered as a viable option by serious abusers.Moreover, by reducing early program termination, it allows thetreatment and aftercare to continue for the length of thepermissable custody. Cocaine-heroin abusers typically wish to avoid the"hassles" associated with changing their lives. Whenthe alternative is lengthy incarceration, cocaine-heroin abusersmay be more willing to be referred to drug treatment. If,however, the alternative is a short sentence, detainees and jailinmates may prefer the incarceration rather than diversion tolong-term drug abuse treatment. Unfortunately, relatively few offenders voluntarily seektreatment. Many offenders are referred by the criminal justicesystem to drug treatment as the result of negotiated pleabargains in which the offender agrees to enter treatment insteadof receiving a substantial sentece. For many years TASC(Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) has operated in selectedjurisdictions to recruit clients and negotiate with court stafffor release of offenders to drug programs. TASC clients are morelikely to select treatment because the alternative is consideredmore onerous. Few cocaine-heroin abusers in custody volunteer for drugtreatment unless the treatment program is seen as an attractivealternative. Prison inmates seek out in-house treatment programsbecause they often provide better living conditions, a saferenvironment, parole release considerations, and an opportunity topossibly change one's lifestyle. In-prison programs that offersuch conditions are substantially better able to recruitparticipants than those which do not. Although these offendersmay not be completely sincere at admission, there is anopportunity for the program to engage them in an effectivetreatment experience. In short, the threat of substantialsanctions (for arrestees) or the promise of better in-prisonconditions (for those in custody) can operate as extremely usefulincentives for treatment. Nevertheless, it must be understoodthat a significant portion of offenders who have long chronicheroin or cocaine abuse patterns will not want treatment underany circumstances. Some dimensions of effective drugabuse treatment. As the preceding section has demonstrated, the criminality ofheroin abusers is substantially reduced while they are receivingsome form of treatment. The experiences of effective programssuggest that whatever treatment method is used must have a soundtheoretical and empirical basis for its implementation.Additionally, the treatment method must emerge from a powerfulsocial restoration tradition (discussed further below) that iscapable of teaching offenders to interact with others in lessdeviant, more socially acceptable ways. Such an approach must becredible to participants and not be perceived to be coercive andauthoritarian. The approach must have the capability to convinceoffenders that the demanding path to a socially acceptablelifestyle is worthwhile despite their deprived backgrounds, theirexperience with quick criminal profits, and their recognitionthat there is a low probability they will be caught for theircrimes. Despite the often cited conclusion that "nothingworks", evidence from the research literature continues toaccumulate that some programs have been successful in reducingrecidivism." The majority of successful programs have been based on asocial learning theory of criminal behavior." According tothis theory, criminal behavior is learned through a process ofsocial interaction with others. Thus, pro-social behaviors mustbe learned to replace deviant behavior. Effective approachesinclude: therapeutic communities, self-help groups, familytherapy, contingency contracting, role playing and modeling,vocational and social skills training, training in interpersonalcognitive problem-solving skills, and other programs involvingongoing peer monitoring of participants' behavior." Successful programs have several things in common: authoritystructures that clearly specify rules and sanctions,anti-criminal modeling and reinforcement of pro-social behavior,pragmatic personal and social problemsolving assistance, programstaff knowledgeable about the use of community resources, andrelationships between staff and clients which are empathic andcharacterized by open communication and trust. Ex-offender-addictcounselors who serve as credible role-models of successfulrehabilitation also are often utilized." The "Stay 'NOut" program (see Appendix A) provides an example of asuccessful program that employs these treatment principles. Conversely, unsuccessful programs are frequently based on amedical (disease) model of criminology which suggests thatcriminal behavior is a sickness.'9 Similarly, interventionprograms based on deterrence models (e.g., "ScaredStraight") have shown very limited effects and have evenbeen associated with increased offending."' Other types ofprograms that have been unsuccessful include those that relysolely on open communication, "friendship" models,inmate-directed therapy groups, and those that arenon-directive.,, While inmate-dircctcd therapy groups have not had a record ofsuccess, behavioral programs that are simply imposed-withoutinvolving inmates in their development-do not appear to workeither. Such programs are often focused on anti-social ratherthan pro-social behaviors and as a result give undue attentionand reinforcement to negative behavior. Other features ofunsuccessful programs include the failure to either neutralize orutilize the inmate's peer group and failure to sustain continuityof care after release from prison. 22 A number of factors have been identified that degradetreatment integrity23 and impede treatment success. Many arecommon to intervention pro grams in any setting. The absence ofsound theoretical basis for treatment is a typical obstacle tothe development of successful programs. Often, the quality andintensity of treatment interventions are inadequate. Sometimesprograms propose treatment interventions that are based on soundprinciples which are not followed when the program isimplemented. Another common problem is lack of staff training andtreatment experience, and/or their inadequate commitment to.boththe clients' and program success. Other impediments to the establishment and maintenance ofsuccessful treatment programs are related to a lack ofcorrectional system support and the negative influence of inmatesubcultures. Fundamental differences between custodial andtreatment perspectives often contribute to the failure of thecorrectional environment to support program staff and goals, Thelack of support from the custodial forces of an institution isexacerbated within prisons by the negative influence of theanti-authoritarian and antitherapeutic "prisoners'code." Under this code, suspicion colors most interactionsbetween staff and inmates. The result may be a program thatreceives neither staff support nor inmate cooperation. Time in community drug treatment is inversely related toposttreatment cocaine-heroin abuse and criminality. Turning to a more quantitative dimension of treatmentprogramming, the available research clearly suggests the longerheroin and cocaine abusers remain in treatment, the greater thereduction in post-treatment criminality. Those who remain incommunity-based residential, methadone, or outpatient programsfor more than three months have lower levels of bothpost-treatment heroin and cocaine abuse and criminality thanthose who drop out before three months and significantly lowerrates than their own pre-treatment levels. Subsequent months oftreatment in these programs yield even greater reductions inpost-treatment criminality, especially after 12 months oftreatment and after each subsequent treatment cycle. Treatment personnel generally agree that it is hard even tostabilize the cocaine-heroin abuser's lifestyle in three months,much less begin to transform long-standing patterns of deviance.After three months, clients can begin to be comfortable with thetreatment regime and start to make progress in changingdisruptive patterns in their lives. However, due to the chronicrelapsing pattern characteristic of the drug addict, several"cycles of treatment" are frequently necessary forhardcore drug abusers to achieve substantial improvement in theirbehavior and lifestyle. Clients who leave treatment early against program advice aresignificantly more likely to recidivate than those who completethe recommended program, Early leavers who later return totreatment ultimately have less heroin use and criminality thanthose who fail to return." Outcome studies have shown that the first 12 months intreatment are critical to long-term reductions in criminalityafter leaving treatment. For cocaine and heroin abusers who areincarcerated and who participate in prison-basedtherapeutic community programs, the optimum period of treatmentappears to be nine to twelve months followed by release into thecommunity. Longer stays are associated with diminishing results.It is believed this occurs for two reasons: First, longer periodsof program participation while in prison creates increaseddependency on the program and less transference of the learnedexperiences to the community upon release. Secondly, some personsare transferred as rehabilitated back into the general prisonpopulation after completing more than a year of treatment, andthe criminal subculture undermines some gains made during thetreatment period. Thus, the timing of treatment and release forprison inmateswith serious drug abuse problems needs to becoordinated to achieve the optimum outcome Conclusion Clearly, much has been learned about effective ways ofreducing the drug involvement of heroin and cocaine abusingoffenders. Given the chronic recurring nature of addiction, noprogram can realistically expect to eliminate severe heroin andcocaine abuse for all offenders. Yet even if a program succeedsonly in reducing the frequency of use, substantial reductions incriminality may follow. The evidence is clear: cocaine-heroinabusers commit much less crime when they use once or twice a weekor less often than when they use once a day or more often. If,for example, daily cocaine-heroin users were placed undercourt-directed intensive surveillance and frequent urinemonitoring which curtailed their use of drugs by half or more, avery substantial drop in their criminality'. would be likely tooccur, especially in crimes such as robbery and burglary- Policy recommendations What steps should be taken by the criminal justice system todeal more effectively with the drug-involved offender? Based onthe research findings discussed in the preceding section and theexperience and opinions of the authors, this sectionpresents a series of policy recommendations. While it may not bepossible to institute all or even most of these recommendationsin many jurisdictions, they are offered as goals or guidelinesfor the practitioner. We argue that the interventions proposedwill improve the system by leading to the effective integrationand coordination of offender supervision and drug treatmentapproaches. Beginning with the crucial need to identify heroin andcocaine abusers at arrest, the recommendations focus in turn onjail-based interventions, inprison programs, and communitytreatment options. Also included are systemwide recommendationspertaining to the organization and staffing of drug abusetreatment programs. All of the recommendations presented in this;ection call for the criminal justice system to supervisecocaine-heroin users frequently and systematically: � Convicted cocaine-heroin abusers under communitysupervision should be intensively supervised and compelled toattend treatment for their maximum period of custody. Optimalsupervision includes near daily validation of employment, time inresidence, associations, and absence of drug use. � Convicted cocainc-hcroin abusers sentenced to prisonshould be required to participate in drug treatment for ninemonths to one year prior to release and to continue incommunity treatment as a condition of parole. Their urine andbehavior should be carefully monitored while under fieldsupervision to insure attendance and prevent relapses." � Steps should be taken to ensure that drug-involvedoffenders in city and county detention facilities are placed intreatment after release, During their confinement, methadonemaintenance should be continued for addicts previously assignedto this program or initiated for other heroin users. Naltrexonecombined with urine surveillance should be used for those heroinusers on work release who opt for drug-frcc treatment. The identification of drug-involvedoffenders In areas with a large number of heroin and cocaine users,urinalysis should be used to identify these users at arrest. Most cocaine-heroin abusers who have contact with thecriminal justice system are arrested about once per year. Resultsof the pretrial drug-testing program operating in Washington,D.C. suggest that recent users of cocaine or heroin can beidentified accurately at arrest through urinalysis. By collcctingurine samples from all arrestees, and analyzing the specimens forfive types of drugs including opiates, the D.C. Pretrial ServicesAgency has been able to identify and increase supervision of drugusers released pen-ding trial. These procedures appear to havereduced the rates of rearrest and failure-to-appear. Moreover, bysystematically retaining the results of the urine tests, theinformation has been made available to help determine appropriatecriminal sanctions for those arrestces ultimatelyconvicted." The costs of a urine testing program may be amply justifiedin any jurisdiction with a significant drug problem. As in D.C.,the data collected should be systematically maintained and usedfor determining conditions of pre-trial release and sanctions forthose convicted. In particular, the opportunity should be seizedto present appropriate treatment options. Jail-based interventions Treatment orientation and referral to drug treatmentprograms should be instituted in metropolitancourts and jails. A central intake staff and/or representatives of drugtreatment programs should be present at court and in jails. Alloffenders who test drug positive at arrest should be required toattend orientation and preliminary intake procedures while indetention. These preliminary treatment steps may help ensure thatthose who are released from custody are placed in appropriatetreatment after returning to the community." Full treatment interventions, however, should not beinitiated for cocaineheroin offenders who will be free of custodyin less than three months. It is neither cost effective northerapeutically wise to implement full treatment programming whenthere is little expectation that treatment can be completed. Methadone programs should be permitted to maintain clientsin jails to facilitate resumption of treatment at the end ofdetention. Methadone treatment has proven effective in reducing dailyheroin use and substantially reducing criminality among heroinabusers. Enrolled methadone clients who are arrested can bemaintained on methadone while detained. In this way, return tomethadone treatment upon release after short-term jail custodywould be facilitated. Those who are convicted and sentenced toincarceration should be given the option (when medicallyrecommended) to remain on methadone or to detoxify from methadoneand enter an in-prison therapeutic community. Considerationshould also be given to initiating methadone treatment in jailsfor chronic heroin addicts. Heroin addicts serving shortsentences who arc introduced to methadone treatment whileincarcerated are more likely to enter and remain in methadonemaintenance treatment in the community when they are releasedfrom custody. Daily naltrexone consumption should be used for someconvicted heroin abusers in combination with drug-free treatmentand intensive supervision. For her-oin-abusing offenders who receive jail orprobation sentences and who opt for drug-free treatment,use of naltrexone (Trexan@), combined with urine surveillance,could be instituted. Its use with jail inmates on work release orschool furlough appears particularly appropriate. Naltrexone isan easily administered narcotic antagonist drug which taken dailyproduces almost immediate withdrawal symptoms in addicts whenthey use an opiatc, but is harmless to nonaddicts. It is mosteffective with heroinaddicted offenders who have a high level ofcommunity integration. It has no effect on cocaine, however;therefore, urine monitoring must be sustained.'o In-prison treatment Therapeutic communities and other intensive milieu drugtreatments should be made available to cocaine-heroin abusingstate prisoners about one year prior to parole eligibility. A successful therapeutic community, the "Stay 'NOut" program (see Appendix A), was developed at twocorrectional facilities in New York Stateone for men and one forwomen. This model therapeutic community in prison holds thegreatest promise for changing hard-core, drug-abusing inmates andreducing recidivism." Despite their proven effectiveness, few therapeuticcommunities such as "Stay 'N Out" are in place forcriminally involved drug abusers. One of the factors that limitsthe creation of additional programs of this type is the concernthat such programs might engage in activities that threatensecurity and encourage inmate resistance to the correctionalsystem. Nonetheless, correctional administrators learn quickly asthey become exposed to the operation of well-run programs thatsuch undesirable variance can be avoided. In fact, ininstitutions where most of these programs have been established,the wardens and correctional officers frequently are their mostvocal champions. To encourage their development, however, staffand administration need education and training. Further, a numberof fiscal and practical issues have to be addressed prior toimplementation- The implementation of prison-based treatment programsrequires isolation from the general prison population. The inimical influence of the criminal inmate subculture("prisoners' code") will inevitably undermine anyattempts to establish viable programming if the program is notisolated from this anti-therapeutic force. Separate livingquarters, recreation, food services, etc. should be maintainedwithin the institution for this separation to be ideallyeffective. Total isolation is, however, neither necessary nordesirable; rather, some contact with the general inmatepopulation is useful for the purpose of allowing the inmate intreatment to see where he has come from and how much he haschanged. In addition, the contact experience provides theopportunity for the program resident to test both his newprosocial values against the inmate subculture and his resistanceto negative influences. This kind of isolation is most possiblein medium security institutions with dormitorytype housing spacewhere one dormitory or two are physically segregated or separablefrom the main institution. Prisoners in therapeutic communities who make goodtreatment progress should be paroled to residential drug-freeprograms that sustain the therapeutic community model prior tocompletion of (heir sentence. They should be required to stay intreatment as a condition of parole until their date of maximumcustody or until the program deems them recovered. It is essential for the successful treatment ofcocaine-heroin abuser offenders to maintain continuity-of-carefrom the outset of treatment to termination of custody. Whilethere is benefit from prison treatment alone, these effects areaugmented and sustained by continuing that specific treat inentin the community. Ideally, release to the community facility would becontingent on the progress made during in-prison treatment. Underthis incentive system, specific behaviors would be rewarded witha specified number of restitution or release "points"that might be administered as a form of "good timc"system. Alternatively, prisoners might earn more favorableconditions of confinement or higher status and associated programprivilege.-,. However it is administered, the basic notion is toreinforce the desirability of pro-social behaviors. Community treatment programs Drug-abusing misdemennants should be considered forcommunitybased sentencing alternatives. In lieu of confining drug-involved offenders in jails andcounty penitentiaries, a range of intermediate sanctions shouldbe considered for heroin and cocaine abusers convicted ofmisdemeanors. These might include house arrest with electronicmonitoring, intermittent sentences (e.g., weekend or eveningincarceration), TASC programs, or residence in a facility such asa "halfway in-halfway out" center (a "HiHo").Again, in any of these alternatives offenders would ideally beable to achieve release status more quickly by providingdrug-negative urine samples, routinely attending andparticipating positively in treatment sessi ns, paying back theirvictims, and providing evidence of prosocial activity.'2 The community treatment resources available to supportintermediate sanctioning policies range from self-help groupsthat meet once a week for a couple of hours to residentialfacilities that provide 24 hour supervision and programming- At aminimum, almost all communities have an Alcoholics Anonymous orNarcotics Anonymous group that provides an context for recoveringsubstance abusers to meet, discuss day-to-day steps formaintaining a drug free life, and participate in many differenttypes of social activities not involving alcohol or drugs."Some communities provide drug treatment counseling through theDepartment of Mental Health. And in many cities, recoveringsubstance-abusers operate group homes that use many of the sameprinciples of Alcoholics Anonymous or therapeutic communitiesfound in prison programs. TASC programs run throughout the nation provide staff who arefamiliar with the particular resources available fordrug-involved offenders in specific communities. And almost allstates have an agency that periodically determines theavailability of both private and public programs available fordrug treatment. A list of these agencies is available fromthe National Association of State Drug and Alcohol AbuseDirectors, in Washington, DC Even if no other treatment is provided, heroin-cocaineabusers who are on probation and parole should be required tohave frequent urine tests. Drug-abusing offenders on probation or parole who are in nospecial treatment programs, as a minimum should be routinelyrequired to provide specimens for urinalysis over the entirelength of their probation or parole. At the outset the frequencyof urinalysis should be near daily, and decreascd as positiveprogress warrants. The effective monitoring of urinalysis resultswill help to interrupt relapse to daily heroin or cocaine use,and, hence, high-rate criminality is likely to dropsubstantially." When drug positive urines are detected,offenders should be immediately confronted, clearly warned afterthe first such incident, be required to enter treatment fordiagnosis and assessment after the second positive urine, and berequired to remain in treatment if relapse seems imminent or hasoccurred. Refusal to enter treatment upon an affirmativediagnosis should be considered a violation of release conditions. Organization and staffing issues The integrity of the treatment programs for convictedoffenders must be maintained by developing structural safeguardsof independence and autonomy from correctional management. All too often well designed interventions operated bycompetent and motivated agency and institutional staffs do notsucceed. Usually, the efforts arc not trusted by the criminaljustice clients, are overwhelmed by the difficulty of theclients' problems, are weakened by inadequate funding andinstitutional resistance, and are subject to high rates of staffburnout and turnover. For a treatment program to last long enoughto make a substantial difference, it must maintain its ownintegrity, ie., honesty and commitment to the treatment goals andprogram participants. The staff must also have sufficientindependence and automony to deliver on their promises. Treatment programs conducted by organizations independent of(but closely linked to) corrections agencies are more likely tomaintain their integrity thz programs operated by correctionalstaff within institutions or community corrections settings. Thissuggests that an outside agency working in cooperation with orunder contract to the Department of Corrections may be the mostappropriate treatment organization. Management responsibility forthe rehabilitation program should be assigned to a team ofcommitted treatment professionals, as well asex-addict/ex-offender peer counselors, For this approach to work,the power and authority of the treatment team should becomparable to and complement the criminal justice authority. Thismanagement group should be associated with and monitored byrespected professional self-help/therapeutic communityorganizations, for example, Therapeutic Communities of America. Probation and parole officers should have their functionsdivided into Surveillance Officers and Community 'fteatment TeamLeaders. For many years, correctional observers have debated thewisdom of vesting probation and parole officers with thepotentially conflicting responsibilities of surveillance andtreatment. In the opinion of the authors, surveillance andtreatment functions of field supervision officers should beseparated to resolve the inherent conflicts and strengthen eachfunction. Essential to the effectiveness of thetreatment/counseling relationship is trust and confidentiality.Persons tinder field supervision are unlikely to freely admitcriminal acts or drug use to someone in a position to return themto prison for such violations. Therefore, surveillance andrehabilitation responsibilities should be handled by staffs whowork separately but cooperatively to avoid role confusion forboth officer and offender. As the next recommendation suggests,both types of officers should be augmented by carefully selectedexoffeiider-addicts who would serve as Monitors for theSurveillance Officers and as Treatment Team staff for theCommunity Treatment Team Leader. The Treatment Team staff should rotate between working inprison and the community to maintain continuity between therehabilitation efforts in both environments. For in-prisonprograms, the objective of separating custodial and treatmentfunctions is satisfied by the organization discussed in thepreceding point. Former addict-offenders who have shown clear evidence ofprosocial change should have training and employmentopportunities, for example, as Monitors and Rntment Team members. Large numbers of offenders who have been chroniccocaine-heroin abusers are unable to gain and to keels legalemployment. Their background is so limited and so stigmatizedthat legal employers are reluctant to employ them, and suspiciousafter they do. Thus, even after making good treatment progress,many offenders may still be unable to gain stable employment.First, systematic skill development and training programs shouldhe providcd. Second, providing employment to ex-addict-offenderswithin the treatment program itself is a valuable opportunity todeal with this unemployment issue as well as cope with shortagesof field supervision personnel. The employment of ex-addict-offenders in a variety ofprogressively more responsible paraprofessional and professionalrolcs will help new monitoring and drug treatment systemsfunction effectively. They also will serve as role models tooffenders they supervise. The ex-addict offenders are the rolemodels (as in "Stay 'N Out") whose presencedemonstrates the realistic possibility of achieving successfulrehabilitation. Graduation from a drug treatment program,evidence of successful integration into community life, andadditional training are prerequisites for the employment ofex-addictoffenders as Monitors and Treatriient Team members. Conclusion By substantially reducing their cocaine-heroin abuse, thecriminality of drug-involved offenders may be reduced by 20 to 50percent or more. To do so, however, the criminal justice systemmust develop an alliance with the drug treatment system geared toachieve the goals of effective rehabilitation, enhanced prosocialbehavior, and reduced recidivism. The difficulties inherent in bringing about this allianceshould not be minimizcd. Some reallocation of resources clearlywill be required, with all the tensions attendant on anysignificant shift in funding and operational priorities. Ifcustodial and treatment functions are to be effectivelyseparated, recruitment, training, and retraining programs willhave to be developed for community corrections personnel.Institutional corrections environments must be prepared to acceptindependent treatment organizations. Procedures must be developedto identify and train those therapeutic community graduates bestqualified to become competent treatment team members andmonitors. The problem of intensive community resistance toaccepting community treatment facilities (HiHo's) that housefelons and substance abusers must also be addressed. Withinprisons, space will have to be reallocated to create therapeuticcommunities to house clients during treatment. If institutionsare converted for total therapeutic community utilization,abandoned mental hospitals may be utilized, with significantcapital expenditures necessary for conversion. Beginning at thepoint of arrest, screening procedures will have to be developedto monitor drug use and to identify cocaine-heroin users who canmost benefit from the proposed interventions. Perhaps most important, cooperation will be needed amongstable drug abuse agencies and drug treatment programs andcriminal justice organizations (courts, probation, corrections,and parole) that traditionally have had competing political andfiscal interests and often lack a history of successful Jointventures. Careful documentation of pilot results will also beneeded to evaluate whether the system is moving in desired orunanticipated directions. For this, evaluation researchers willhave to be in place from the outset. Since many problems willarise that have the potential for compromising the interventions,the evaluation design must provide decision makers with timclyinformation to assist them in formulating corrective actions. Atthe same time, ongoing dissemination of outcome informationthrough professional and media channels will help foster andmaintain the support necessary to accomplish the changesproposed. Appendix A "Stay 'N Out": A model for prison-based drugtreatment "Stay 'N Out" is a therapeutic community(TC), in part based upon the Phoenix House model, that has beenoperating in the New York State prison system for the last tenyears. Over time the program has been modified to operate moreeffectively within the prison environment. The program has beenfortunate to be operated by many of the founding staff who haveprovided the vision, commitment, and determination necessary fora successful prison program. An early evaluation of the "Stay 'N Out" programindicated that it was successfully implemented, maintained apositive TC environment, and produced positive psychological andbehavioral changes in participants. In 1984, the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse funded an evaluation of "Stay'N Out", comparing it to two other prison-bascd programs inNew York State and a control group of inmates on program waitinglists, but receiving no treatment. A milieu program and astandard counseling program were the comparison groups. Althoughparticipants were not randomly assigned to thcsc treatmentconditions, preliminary results of the comparison areprovocative. The data indicate the "Stay 'N Out"participants who remained in the program for nine to twelvemonths were less likely to have problems while on parole thaneither those who left "Stay 'N Out" earlier or those inother prison-based programs. For example, "Stay 'N Out"participants who remained in the program more than nine monthswere more likely to have a positive parole discharge (80 percentpositive) than those who remained in the program less than threemonths (50 percent positive). Positiv e parole discharge isdefined as no reported violations of parole during the parolecustody period. Long-term (9-12 months) participants of the otherprograms studied also had fewer cases of positive paroledischarge; the milieu program reported a 56 percent positivedischarge rate and the counseling program a 47 percent positiverate. Preliminary analysis indicates that long-term "Stay 'NOut" participants may also have a more encouraging patternof re-arrest than those in the other programs. Continuingfollow-up shows that only 27 percent of the TC participants werere-arrested compared to 35 percent of the milieu participants, 50percent of the counseling participants, and 42 percent of thewaiting list persons. In addition, TC participants averaged 18months to rearrest compared to 11 months for the milieu and ninemonths for the counseling group. These data should be interpretedwith caution, however, as variation in the actual number of daysat risk may vary greatly among samples. Program overview 64 Stay IN Out" programs were begun as a joint effortamong New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services (DSAS), New YorkTherapeutic Communities (NYTC), New York Department ofCorrectional Services (DOCS), and the New York State Division ofParole. Currently, NYTC. operates the programs, DOCS suppliesfunding, and Parole provides increased opportunities for programresidents. The DSAS Bureau of Research and Evaluation continuesto evaluate the program. The current program consists of two treatment units for maleinmates in one facility with 35 beds per unit (a total capacityof 70 beds), and one treatment unit with 40 beds for women-inmates in another facility. Each unit is staffed by a total ofseven persons, including both professionals andparaprofessionals. Inmates selected for the programs arerecruited at Statc correctional facilities. The criteria forselection are: history of drug abuse, at least 18 years of age,evidence of positive institutional participation, and no historyof sex crimes or mental illness. "Stay IN Out" clientsare housed in units segregated from the general prisonpopulation. They cat in a common dining room, however, and attendmorning activities with other prisoners. The optimum length oftreatment is from nine to twelve months. Most program staff areex-addict-offenders who are graduates of community T)Cs: they actas "role models" exemplifying successfulrehabilitation. The course of treatment is a developmental growthprocess with the inmate becoming an increasingly responsiblemember of the program. During the early phase of treatment, the clinical thrustinvolves assessment of client needs and problem areas.Orientation to the prison TC procedures occurs through individualcounseling, encounter sessions, and seminars. Clients are givenlow-level jobs and granted little status. During the later phasesof treatment, residents are provided opportunities to earnhigherlevel positions and increased status through sincereinvolvement in the program and hard work. Encounter groups andcounseling sessions are more in-depth and focus on the areas ofself-discipline, self-worth, selfawareness, respect forauthority, and acceptance of guidance for problem areas. Seminarstake on a more intellectual nature. Debate is encouraged toenhance self-expression and to increase self-confidence. Ilpon release, participants are encouraged to seek furthersubstance abuse treatment at cooperating community TCs. Extensiveinvolvement with a network of community TCs is central to theprogram's operation. Staff and senior residents of community TCsvisit "Stay IN Out" on a regular basis to recruitresident inmates for their programs. These visitors provideinspiration since they are ex-addicts and ex-felon role modelswho are leading economically and socially productive lives.

The Bureau, a componentof the Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice,reported that the number of inmates in the nation's 3,312 local jailsgrew 77 percent from 1983 to 1989. More than 40 percent of thatgrowth resulted from the increased number of persons held for orconvicted of drug offenses. "The dramatic increase in the number of persons in jailson drug charges occurred both among those awaiting trial andthose already convicted of crimes," said Bureau DirectorSteven D. Dillingham. "And more than one-half of all convictedjail inmates said they had committed the offense for which they wereincarcerated under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both." The findings were drawn from a nationally representative survey of 5,675 inmates held in 424 local jails. SimilarBureau surveys of jail inmates were conducted in 1972, 1978 and1983. A jail is a locally administered institution that holds peopleawaiting trial or already sentenced, usually for one year or less. About half of all jail inmates in 1989 had been convicted and were serving time, 7 percent had been convicted but not yetsentenced, 26 percent were awaiting or on trial and 16 percent wereawaiting arraignment. An estimated 46 percent of the jail inmates in 1989 were on probation, on parole, on bail or were in some other criminaljustice status at the time of their arrest. More than three-quartersof all inmates being held in 1989 for any offense had had a priorsentence of probation or incarceration. At least a third of the inmateswere in jail for a violent offense or had been previously sentencedfor a violent offense. Other survey results: --More than four of every 10 convicted inmates said they had been using an illegal drug during the month before theycommitted the offense for which they were incarcerated. About one in fourconvicted inmates said they had used a major drug, such as heroin,cocaine, crack, LSD or PCP, in that month. --Women and Hispanic prisoners were the most likely among all jail inmates to be held on drug charges--about one-third ineach group. --Among convicted inmates, 29 percent reported they had committed their offenses under the influence of only alcohol,15 percent under the influence of only drugs and 12 percentunder the influence of both. --Almost one-third of all jail inmates said they had participated in a substance abuse treatment program at sometime in their lives--about 18 percent of the inmates had receivedtreatment for drugs, 9 percent for alcohol and 6 percent for both. --More than four of every 10 female inmates reported they had been abused at some time before their currentincarceration--33 percent physically and 36 percent sexually. --About 39 percent of all jail inmates had grown up in a single parent household and an additional 11 percent hadlived in a household without either parent. --The racial and ethnic composition of local jails changed between 1983 and 1989--blacks increased from 38 percent to 42percent of the inmates population, Hispanics increased from 14percent to 17 percent and the percentage of white non-Hispanics decreasedfrom 46 percent to 39 percent. --The female jail population increased from 7.1 percent in 1983 to 9.5 percent in 1989. One of every four female inmateswas in jail for larceny or fraud. --About 11 percent of the inmates were being held for other authorities--most awaiting transportation to a state prison. --Among the inmates who had been sentenced to serve theirtime in local jails, half had received a sentence of six months ofless. It is estimated that about half of the inmates sentenced tolocal jails would serve less than five months.

Detailed program guidelines and applicationmaterials for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug Court Program will beavailable in early 1995. DATE: All comments must be received by February 24, 1995. ADDRESS: All comments should be addressed to Reginald L.Robinson, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Officeof Justice Programs, 633 Indiana Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.20531. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The Department of Justice Response Center at 1-800-421-6770or 202-307-1480. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Overview of Title V-Drug Courts Federal discretionary grants are being made available underthe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, TitleV, Public Law 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (September 13, 1994), 42U.S.C. 3796ii-3796ii-8 [hereinafter the "Act"] toStates, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, andstate and local courts for assistance with drug court programs.The Act gives the Attorney General, and through statutoryauthority contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe StreetsAct, an authorized designee (in this case the Assistant AttorneyGeneral for the Office of Justice Programs), the authority tomake grants to the above-mentioned entities for drug courtprograms that involve continuing judicial supervision overnon-violent offenders with substance abuse problems and theintegrated administration of sanctions and services including:(1) mandatory periodic testing for, the use of controlledsubstances or other addictive substances during any period ofsupervised release or probation for each participant; (2)substance abuse treatment for each participant; (3) diversion,probation, or other supervised release involving the possibilityof prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based onnoncompliance with program requirements or failure to showsatisfactory progress; and (4) programmatic, offender management,and aftercare services such as relapse prevention, health care,education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,and,child care or other family support services for eachparticipant requiring such services. Section 50001 of Title V of the Act requires that regulationsbe issued to ensure exclusion of violent offenders from thesefunded programs. This proposed rule responds to that requirement.To more fully develop and define the grant program and to providedirection and guidance to potential applicants, programguidelines, will be issued subsequent to the publication of thisproposed rule. This Supplementary Information section isintended, in part, to elicit comment on a broad range of issuesrelevant to the development and implementation of those programguidelines. Statement of the Problem More than half of all individuals brought into the criminaljustice system have substance abuse problems. Many of theseindividuals are non-violent offenders who repeatedly cyclethrough the court, corrections, and probation systems withouthelp to change their behavior. The underlying problem of suchnon-violent substance abusing offenders frustrates and inhibitsjudicial effectiveness. All too often, the non-violent drugoffender faces little certainty of punishment and represents along-term, recurring problem for both the criminal justice systemand society. In too many cases, the criminal justice system fails tosubject non-violent, drug abusing offenders to interventionmeasures that provide the mix of services and sanctions necessaryto change their behavior, or if necessary, coerce abstinence.Some courts and prosecutors, however, have cost-effcctivelyaddressed the problem through the use of treatment drug courts.Their results suggest that "drug courts" cansignificantly enhance the offender's opportunity to break thecycle of substance abuse and crime. Those who are coming intocontact with the criminal justice system for the first time maybe particularly susceptible to effective early intervention. Indeed, research and evaluation demonstrate that the"drug court" approach is effective in reducing bothdrug abuse and drug-related crime. The Drug Court discretionarygrant program of Title V seeks to support the development ofinnovative measures that provide courts additional resources toassure certainty of punishment for drug abusing offenders throughthe integrated administration of services and sanctions,including close supervision and coerced abstinence. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 The Department of Justice (Department) recognizes that nosingle model exists for an effective drug court. To the contrary,the Department believes there may be a variety of validapproaches that deal effectively with non-violent offenders withsubstance abuse problems. Consequently, the Drug Court grantprogram will maintain flexibility in providing funds to supportthe development of a variety of initiatives that coordinatetreatment and coerced abstinence. The Department also recognizes the great diversity in thestructure and operation of state and local courts and criminaljustice systems. Hence, the Department is committed to a flexibleapproach that allows jurisdictions to tailor local initiatives tobest suit their needs and local conditions. Program flexibility,however, is necessarily balanced by statutory requirementsconcerning the design and administration of the funded programs.Accordingly, Drug Court programs that receive grant awards must: exclude violent offenders from program participation; include a long-term strategy and detailed implementation.plan; explain the applicant's inability to fund the program adequately without Federal assistance; use Federal support to supplement, and not supplant, State, Indian tribal, and local sources of funding that would otherwise be available; identify related governmental or community initiatives which complement or will be coordinated with the proposal; consult with all affected agencies and insure that there will be appropriate coordination with all, affected agencies in the implementation of the program; certify, that participating offenders will receive continuing judicial supervision by one or more designated judges with responsibility for the drug court program; specify plans for obtaining necessary support and continuing the proposed program following the conclusion of Federal support; and describe the methodology that will be used in evaluating the program. Consistent with Congressional intent, program evaluation willbe crucial. Grant recipients will be required to cooperate with anational evaluation team throughout their involvement with theprogram. Recipients will also be required to provide forindependent evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of theirfunded programs. The following issues will be especiallyimportant in determining whether programs receiving grants underthis initiative are effective: (1) reduction in recidivism ratesof program participants, (2) maintenance of acceptable substanceabuse treatment completion rates among program participants, (3)decreased drug use by program participants, and (4) maintenanceof a cost effective program in relation to the overall criminaljustice system. FY 1995 Drug Court Initiative The Fiscal Year 1995 Department of Justice AppropriationsAct, Public Law 103-317, has allocated $29 million for the DrugCourt grant programs. Eligibility of applicants to receive grantswill be based on requirements of the statute and theseregulations, as well as assurances and certifications specifiedin detailed program guidelines and application materials thatwill be available in early 1995 for the Fiscal Year 1995 DrugCourt initiative. While detailed program guidelines will follow the publicationof this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department has madesome broad programmatic decisions upon which it welcomes comment.Three types of funding will be available under this programduring Fiscal Year 1995. First, planning funding will beavailable for those jurisdictions that express interest ininitiating a drug court but have not engaged in the comprehensiveplanning necessary to make such a program successful. Second,jurisdictions currently operating drug court programs may seekfunding to expand enhalace, or augment these ongoing efforts.Finally, for those jurisdictions that have engaged (or arecurrently engaged) in a comprehensive drug court planningprocess, funding may be available to implement the plans theirefforts have produced. Call For Comments Concerning The Drug Court Initiative Substance abuse-related offender case management is primarilya state and local issue; thus, the Drug Court grant programcontemplates collaboration between federal and state and localagencies. State and local government officials were involved inCongressional hearings and meetings that guided the developmentof this legislation and will continue to be involved as theDepartment moves forward in developing this regulation,establishing policy guidance, and implementing programguidelines. At this time, comments are welcome regarding thebasic program design requirements described in Section 93.4 ofthe proposed rule and to the entire scope of the program.

EDT BJS WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1995 202/307-0784 WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's state and federal prisonshad to find room for 83,294 more inmates last year--the secondlargest annual increase in history and just 1,470 fewer than the84,764 increase recorded in 1989. The total number of men andwomen in prison last December 31 was 1,053,738--a new record.Overall, almost 1.5 million people were incarcerated in theUnited States in 1994. State and federal prisons, which primarilyhold convicted felons serving longer sentences, contained abouttwo-thirds of the total. Locally operated jails, which primarilyhold people awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year orless, held the other third. At the end of 1994 state prisons held 958,704 men and womenand federal prisons held 95,034 inmates. California (125,605) andTexas (118,195) together held more than one in every five inmatesin the nation. Seventeen states, each holding fewer than 5,000inmates, accounted for 4 percent of all prisoners. Prison populations increased by at least 10 percent in 16states last year. Texas reported the largest growth (28 percent),followed by Georgia (20 percent). Alaska and Connecticut reported fewer prisoners who had been sentencedto more than a year. The average sentence length and time served for stateprisoners has remained stable in recent years. Between 1985 and1992, the years for which comparable data are available, half ofthe state prisoners served at least 48 months. In the federal system, however, the "truth insentencing" provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984have contributed to increasing the median time served in prisonfrom 15 months in 1986 to 24 months in 1992. The incarceration rate for prisoners sentenced to more than ayear reached a record 387 per 100,000 U.S. residents lastDecember 31. States with the highest incarceration rates wereTexas (636 inmates per 100,000 residents), Louisiana (530) andOklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had the lowest, followed byMinnesota (100) and West Virginia (106). Since 1980 per capita incarceration rates rose the most inthe South (from 188 to 451) and West (from 105 to 333). The ratein the Northeast rose from 87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwestfrom 109 to 297. In absolute numbers, violent offenders were the greatestcontributors to state prison inmate growth. Between 1980 and1993, the number of violent offenders grew by an estimated221,300, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimated using1993 data. More than a quarter of the state and federal inmates were inprison for drug offenses (234,600 prisoners) in 1993. Prisonersserving a drug sentence increased from 8 percent of the state andfederal prison population in 1980 to 26 percent in 1993. Infederal prisons, inmates sentenced for drug law violations werethe single largest group--60 percent in 1993, up from 25 percentin 1980. At the end of the year, states reported they were operatingbetween 17 percent and 29 percent over capacity, while thefederal system was operating at 25 percent over capacity. Because of prison construction and the creation of new prisonbeds, the ratio of the inmate population to the capacity of stateprisons has remained almost the same since 1990. The average growth in the number of state and federalprisoners sentenced to at least a year's incarceration was equalto the need for 1,542 more beds per week in 1994. During 1994 almost 5 percent of all state prisoners--48,949inmates in 21 jurisdictions--were held in local jails or otherfacilities because of prison crowding. The number of female inmates grew 10.6 percent last year,compared to an 8.5 percent increase among male inmates. OnDecember 31, 1994, there were 64,403 women in state and federalprisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The rate of incarcerationfor inmates serving a sentence of more than a year is 746 malesper 100,000 U.S. male residents, vs. 45 females per 100,000female population. Between 1980 and 1993, the number of white and black femaleinmates grew at a faster pace than the number of male inmates ineither racial group. During this period the number of white malesgrew 163 percent, the number of black males grew 217 percent, thenumber of white females 327 percent, and the number of blackfemales 343 percent. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 blackresidents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents wereincarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31, 1993.

At the end of June, 1,012,851 men and women wereincarcerated in state and federal prisons. State prisons held919,143 inmates and federal prisons held 93,708 inmates.California (124,813) and Texas (100,136) together accounted formore than one in five inmates in the country. The prison population grew by almost 40,000 inmates duringthe first half of 1994, the equivalent of more than 1,500 aweek--or three additional 500-bed prisons. During the last 12 months the prison population expanded bymore than 71,000, the second largest annual increase everrecorded. This growth was slightly greater than the annual growthin the preceding 12 months (69,525) and exceeds by 11 percent theaverage annual growth (63,793) during the previous five years,that is from July 1988 to June 1993. The incarceration rate of state and federal prisonerssentenced to more than a year reached a record 373 prisoners per100,000 U.S. residents last June. The states with the highestincarceration rates were Texas (545 per 100,000), Louisiana(514), South Carolina (504) and Oklahoma (501). During the 12 months preceding June 30, 1994, eleven statesrecorded prisoner growth rates of 10 percent or more, led byConnecticut (20 percent), Texas (18 percent), and Tennessee (15percent). In the last decade the U.S. prison population doubled on aper capita basis. During this 10-year period, the incarcerationrate doubled both for white inmates and black inmates. At the endof last year (the latest available data) there were 1,432 blackinmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents and 203 white inmatesper 100,000 white residents. During the first six months of 1994, the number of femaleinmates grew 6.2 percent, compared to a 3.9 percent increaseamong male inmates. On June 30, 1994, there were 61,872 women in state andfederal prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The maleincarceration rate, 719 per 100,000 male residents, was more than16 times higher than the female incarceration rate--43 per100,000 female residents. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects state andfederal prisoner data twice a year--on June 30 and December 31.These counts are designed to provide regular updates to thepublic on the number of people confined by state and federalauthority. The data have been published since 1926. The report was prepared by Allen J. Beck and Thomas P.Bonczar, statisticians in the Department's Bureau of JusticeStatistics (BJS).

EDT BJS SUNDAY, AUGUST 27, 1995 202/307-0784 WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 5.1 million Americans-or almost2.7 percent of the adult population--were under some form ofcorrectional supervision last year, the Department of Justicereported today. Almost three-quarters of these men and women werebeing supervised in the community on probation or parole. Theothers were confined in jail or prison. The number of adults incarcerated or under supervision in thecommunity increased 3.9 percent during 1994. Since 1980 thenumber has almost tripled, growing at an average annual rate of7.6 percent. At the end of last year, 2,962,000 adults were on probationunder community supervision rather than incarceration. Anadditional 690,000 adults were on parole--conditional supervisedrelease after serving a prison term but subject to being returnedto incarceration for rule violations or other offenses.Three-quarters of probationers and parolees were required tomaintain regular contact with a supervising agency. The otheroffenders were not required to have regular contact (9 percent)or had failed to report and could not be located (9 percent). Texas had the largest number of adults on probation andparole with more than 503,000 under such supervision, followed byCalifornia with 370,000. At the end of 1994, more than 3.8percent of all adults in Texas were on probation or parole. Thirteen states reported that fewer than 1 percent of theiradult populations were on probation or parole. North Dakota hadthe lowest probation and parole supervision rate (450 offendersper 100,000 adults), followed by West Virginia (517), Mississippi(552) and Kentucky (553). Overall, the state and federal probation and parolepopulations rose by 2.0 percent during 1994. Six states reportedincreases of at least 10 percent in their probation populations,and 11 reported similar increases in their parole populations.Alabama, with a 14.5 percent rise in their probation population,and Iowa, with a 27.1 percent rise in the parole population, ledthe nation. Twelve states and the Federal probation system reported adecrease in the number of adults on probation, led by SouthDakota (down 6.2 percent), California (down 5.8 percent) and theFederal system (down 6.8 percent). Half of all offenders on probation in 1994 were on probationfor a felony. A quarter were on probation for a misdemeanor. Oneof every seven probationers had been convicted of driving whileintoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Almost all of theoffenders on parole (95 percent) had served a felony sentence injail or prison. Approximately, 21 percent of the nation's probationers werewomen, as were 10 percent of the parolees. About 58 percent of the adults on probation were white, and45 percent were black. Ninety percent of adults on parole weremen. Fifty-one percent of adults on parole were white, 45 percentwere black.

This report is drawn from the second triennial surveyconducted by the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics program.The survey included new questions about drugs seized, drug enforcementtechniques, and testing of arrestees and employees. State and local lawenforcement agencies have provided a national understanding of theinnovations in the fight against drugs-special drug enforcement units,interagency task forces, and drug asset forfeiture programs. We salute thedepartments in their cooperation with LEMAS and trust that this profile willprove valuable in their assessments and planning. Steven D. Dillingham, Ph.D. Director Drug Enforcement by Police and Sheriffs' Department, 1990: A LEMAS Report By Brian A. Reaves, Ph.D. BJS Statistician In 1990, about 9,300 local police departments and 2,500sheriffs' departments had primary responsibility for the enforcement ofdrug laws. Collectively, these agencies employed 466,000 full-timeofficers, 92% of all local police and sheriffs' officers nationwide. Inaddition, 34 State police departments, employing 43,000 officers, had primarydrug enforcement responsibilities. This report presents information collected from State andlocal law enforcement agencies with primary drug enforcementresponsibilities. It includes information on types of illegal drugs seized,operation of special drug units, multi-agency task force participation, andreceipts from drug asset forfeiture programs. For all agencies the report also summarizes how drug testingpolicies apply to arrestees, applicants for sworn positions, and employees. Major findings include the following: *Among agencies with primary drug enforcementresponsibilities that served 50,000 or more residents, over 90% of the police departmentsand over 80% of the sheriffs' departments operated special drugenforcement units. *Nationwide, more than 16,000 local police and sheriffs'officers, and over 2,000 State police officers were assigned full time tospecial drug units. *Half of local police and sheriffs' departments with primarydrug enforcement responsibilities were participating in amulti-agency drug enforcement task force. These 6,500 agencies had assignednearly 10,000 officers full time to such task forces. *Among departments with primary drug enforcementresponsibilities, over 90% of the police departments serving a population of 50,000 ormore, and over 90% of the sheriffs' departments serving 250,000 or moreresidents, received money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program. *Among the State police departments with primary drugenforcement responsibilities, 85% operated a special drug unit, 91%participated in a multi-agency drug enforcement task force, and 94% receivedmoney or goods from drug asset forfeitures. *About 2 in 3 State police departments and 2 in 5 localpolice and sheriffs' departments reported that at least some of thepersons they arrested were required to take a test for illegal drugs. *A majority of State police departments and local policedepartments serving a population of 25,000 or more required that allapplicants for sworn positions take a test for illegal drugs. *About 3% of local law enforcement officers worked foragencies that had a mandatory drug testing program for regular field officers;17% were employed by agencies that had a random selection testingprogram for officers. *Nonprobationary officers could be dismissed after onepositive test in about two-thirds of local police and sheriffs' departmentsand in about three-fourths of State police departments. Nearly alldepartments had a policy specifying dismissal for two positive drug tests. *Treatment alternatives were a part of the drug testingpolicy for employees in about half of State and local police departmentsand two- fifths of sheriffs' departments. Such alternatives weregenerally limited to the first positive test results only. THE LEMAS SURVEY The 1990 Law Enforcement Management and AdministrativeStatistics (LEMAS) survey questionnaire was mailed to all 780 State and locallaw enforcement agencies with 100 or more sworn officers and to a sample of2,338 agencies with fewer than 100 officers. Of the 3,118 agencies receivingthe LEMAS questionnaire, 2,945 (94.5%) responded. The survey used asampling frame based on personnel data from the 1986 Directory Survey of LawEnforcement Agencies. (See Methodology for further discussion ofsampling.) The local police departments included in this report aregeneral purpose agencies operated by municipal or county governments. TheState police departments included in this report are the primary generalpurpose agencies in all States except Hawaii, which does not have aState police department. This report presents only data collected on drug-relatedpolicies. The BJS Bulletins State and Local Police Departments, 1990(NCJ-133284) and Sheriffs' Departments, 1990 (NCJ-133283) present other datacollected in the LEMAS survey. The first section of this report, on drug enforcementactivities, includes only agencies with primary drug enforcement responsibilities.Agencies involved in drug enforcement only in a backup capacity, orthose whose responsibilities are limited to traffic enforcement, jailoperation, court operations or other such duties are not included. The secondsection, on drug testing policies, includes all local police, sheriffs',and State police departments. Drug enforcement activities State and local law enforcement agencies made an estimated1.1 million arrests for drug law violations during 1990, according to theUniform Crime Reports (UCR) of the FBI. Excluding traffic violations, 1 inevery 13 arrests made during the year was for a drug-related offense. Local police and sheriffs' departments During 1990, 77% of the Nation's local police and sheriffs'departments reported they had primary responsibility for the enforcementof drug laws in areas under their jurisdiction. These 11,800 agenciesemployed 466,000 full-time officers, 92% of all local officers nationwide. Over 9,000 local police departments, employing 96% of alllocal police officers, reported they had primary drug enforcementresponsibilities. Nearly all of the police departments in jurisdictions of10,000 or more in population had such responsibilities. These 2,800 departmentsemployed approximately 300,000 full-time officers. Departments intowns with a population of 2,500 to 9,999 (83%), or a population less than2,500 (60%), were less likely to have primary drug enforcementresponsibilities. These 6,500 departments in smaller communities employed about46,000 officers. About 2,500 (81%) of the sheriffs' departments nationwidereported having primary drug enforcement responsibilities in 1990. Sheriffs'departments located in jurisdictions with a population of under 100,000were somewhat more likely to have drug enforcement responsibilities thanthose in larger jurisdictions (83% versus 65%); however, the departmentsserving a population of 100,000 or more employed more officers thanthose in smaller jurisdictions (77,000 versus 42,000). Local police and sheriffs' departments with primary drugenforcement responsibilities seized numerous types of illegal drugsduring the 12-month period ending on June 30, 1990. Across all categories,departments in larger jurisdictions were more likely to have seized eachtype of drug than those in smaller jurisdictions. Most of the police and sheriffs' departments serving apopulation of 50,000 or more seized nearly all of the types of drugs asked aboutin the survey. In the smallest jurisdictions, marijuana and cocaine were theonly drugs seized by more than a third of all departments, and onlymarijuana was seized by more than half. Eighty-six percent of local police depart-ments and 94% ofsheriffs' departments made seizures of marijuana--higher percentagesthan for any other drug. The percentage of departments making marijuanaseizures was 94% or higher for departments in all population categories,except for sheriffs' departments serving a population of 10,000 or less(88%) and police departments serving a population of 2,500 or less(70%). According to UCR data for 1990, 30% of all arrests for druglaw violations were marijuana-related. About 4 in 5 marijuana arrests werefor possession, and the remainder, for offenses related totrafficking. Cocaine was seized by 72% of local police and sheriffs'departments, the second highest total percentage for any drug type. All policedepartments serving a population of 100,000 or more, and over 90% ofthose serving 10,000 to 99,999 residents, reported making seizures ofcocaine. Over 95% of the sheriffs' departments serving 50,000 or more residentsreported making seizures of cocaine. Only among police departmentsserving under 2,500 residents (39%), and sheriffs' departments servingunder 10,000 residents (50%) did less than 75% of the departments in apopulation category report making cocaine seizures. Among police andsheriffs' departments that did seize cocaine, nearly all of themreported seizing the powdered form of the drug, and a majority of them also seizedcrack cocaine. A majority of the police departments serving a population of25,000 or more made heroin seizures, including all of those serving 500,000or more residents. More than two-thirds of the sheriffs' departmentsin jurisdictions with a population of 250,000 or more alsoreported seizing heroin. Amphetamine seizures were made by 40% of all police andsheriffs' departments, including more than 70% of those serving apopulation of 50,000 or more. More than half of the departments serving apopulation of 50,000 or more also reported making seizures of barbiturates,methampheta- mines, and LSD. PCP was seized by most of the policedepartments serving a population of 250,000 or more and the sheriffs' departmentsserving 500,000 or more. An aspect of the drug enforcement effort in manyjurisdictions involves the operation of special drug enforcement units.Where they exist, such units are an integral part of the law enforcementresponse to drug trafficking and use. Since they focus directly onconducting sophisticated investigations of drug traffickers, thesespecial units accumulate substantial knowledge about drugs in general andabout drug- related activity in the community. Nationwide, an estimated 3,270 local police and sheriffs'departments were operating a special drug unit during the 12-month periodending on June 30, 1990 (table 3). Overall, these agencies had over 16,000officers assigned to special drug units on a full-time basis. Included in thistotal were an estimated 12,715 police officers and 3,805 sheriffs'officers. Over 90% of local police departments serving 50,000 or moreresidents were operating a special drug unit, and 75% of all local policeofficers assigned to a drug unit nationwide were in one of thesedepartments. Police departments serving 1 million or more residents hadthe largest special drug units, an average of 240 full-time officerseach. These 13 departments accounted for a fourth of the local policeofficers assigned to drug units nationwide. A majority (62%) of the police departments in jurisdictionswith 25,000 to 49,999 residents also operated a special drug unit. Localpolice departments in small towns were the least likely to operate aspecial drug unit. About 19% of those serving a population of 2,500 to9,999 and 5% of those serving a population of under 2,500 had such a unit. Among sheriffs' departments, over 90% of those serving apopulation of 500,000 or more and over 75% of those serving a population of50,000 to 499,999 operated a special drug unit. About 44% of thesheriffs' departments serving a population of 25,000 to 49,999 operateda drug unit. In the smallest jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), 11%of the sheriffs' departments had a drug unit. The average size of special drug units in sheriffs'departments ranged from 34 full-time officers in departments serving a population of1 million or more to 1 officer in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000residents. Many local police and sheriffs' departments operated othertypes of special units that were important to their drug control effort. Over90% of large police and sheriffs' departments (100 or more officers) withprimary drug enforcement responsibilities operated a special unit for drugeducation in schools during 1990, and nearly 60% were operating a specialunit on gangs. Law enforcement agencies recognize the value of coordinatingtheir efforts to reduce drug abuse. For many police and sheriffs'departments, this coordination involves participating in a multiagency drugenforcement task force. Organizationally, such task forces often involve thecooperation of law enforcement agencies across jurisdictional boundaries andgovernmental levels. The police and sheriffs' departments in multiagency taskforces develop coordinated enforcement strategies aimed at accumulating theevidence needed to arrest, prosecute, and convict known drugdistributors. Typically, these strategies involve the use of informants,surveillance, and undercover operations. They may also include complexfinancial investigations designed to trace drug distribution networks.The resources of special drug units often play an important role inimplementing task force strategies. Multiagency drug task forces may alsoattempt to reduce problems associated with the illegal drug trade by includingnot only law enforcement agencies but also other types of governmentagencies, nonprofit organizations, business firms, and community groups. Bycoordinating education and health initiatives these task forces attempt toreduce the harm that illegal drugs do to the community. Among agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities, abouthalf of the local police departments and two-thirds of the sheriffs'departments participated in a task force during the 12-month periodending on June 30, 1990. Overall, an estimated 6,500 local police and sheriffs'departments participated in multiagency drug enforcement task forcesduring this time period. Over 85% of the police and sheriffs' departments in eachpopulation category of 100,000 or more participated in a task force,including over 95% of the departments serving a population of 500,000 ormore. Approximately 80% of the police and sheriffs' departmentsserving a population of 25,000 to 99,999, 65% of those serving apopulation of 10,000 to 24,999, and over 40% of those serving fewer than 10,000residents participated in a task force. During the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990,approximately 6,100 local police officers were assigned to a multiagency drug taskforce full time. Although police departments serving a million or moreresidents had the most officers assigned to a task force on average (29), overhalf of all local police officers assigned to task forces nationwide wereemployed by departments serving a population of under 25,000. Sheriffs' departments had about 3,500 officers assigned fulltime to drug task forces, ranging from an average of 10 officers perdepartment in jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents, to an averageof 1 officer per department in jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000residents. In addition to multiagency task forces, another innovationfor drug enforcement in many jurisdictions is the use of drug assetforfeiture sanctions. Most States have laws that allow the government toseize convicted drug traffickers' cash, bank accounts, planes,boats, cars, homes, and other items purchased with proceeds from theillicit drug trade. State laws vary regarding the disposition of forfeitedassets. Most State statutes require that outstanding liens be paid first, andmany States require that all forfeited drug assets go to the State and/orlocal treasury. In some States, law enforcement agencies may keepproperty such as cars, planes, and boats for official use. In other States,the agencies can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of whatis forfeited. About 4,700 local police and sheriffs' departments reportedthe receipt of money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program duringfiscal 1990. This represented 41% of all local law enforcement agencieswith primary drug enforcement responsibilities. A higher percentage ofsheriffs' departments (51%) than police departments (38%) had suchreceipts. The percentage of local police departments with assetforfeiture receipts was over 95% in jurisdictions with 50,000 to 999,999residents. Among departments serving 1 million or more residents and thoseserving 25,000 to 49,999 residents, about 85% received money or goods from anasset forfeiture program. Receiving money or goods from an assetforfeiture program was least likely for police departments serving apopulation of under 2,500 (11%). About 95% of sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with250,000 or more residents, and about 85% of those serving 50,000 to 249,999residents had asset forfeiture pro-gram receipts during fiscal 1990. In thesmallest jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), an estimated 27% ofthe sheriffs' departments received money or goods from an asset forfeitureprogram. State police departments Thirty-four State police departments, employing approximately43,000 full- time officers, reported they had primary responsibility forthe enforcement of drug laws. Number of Full-time State police sworn officers departments employed Total 49 52,372 Departments with primary responsibility for drug enforcement 34 43,118 All 34 of these departments reported they made marijuana andcocaine seizures during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990(table 6). A large majority of them also seized amphetamines (94%), heroin(91%), LSD (88%), methamphetamines (88%), barbiturates (85%), and PCP(74%). Like those of local law enforcement agencies, State policedrug enforcement strategies often involve the operation of special units,participation in multiagency drug enforcement task forces, and participationin a drug asset forfeiture program. Twenty-nine (85%) of the State police departments that hadresponsibility for enforcing drug laws were operating special drugenforcement units. These 29 departments had assigned a total of 2,138 officersto these units on a full-time basis--an average of 74 officers perdepartment. Most of these departments (82%) also operated special unitsfor drug education in schools, and 29% of them had special units forgangs. Thirty-one of the departments (91%) participated in amultiagency drug enforcement task force during fiscal 1990. These departmentshad 900 officers assigned to drug task forces, an average of 29 perdepartment. All but two of the departments (94%) responsible for drugenforcement reported they received money or goods from a drug assetforfeiture program during the year. Drug testing policies Local police and sheriffs' departments Nearly 40% of local police and sheriffs' departments reportedthat at least some of their arrestees were tested for illegal drugs. Drugtesting of arrestees was most likely to exist in police departmentsserving a population of 500,000 or more (56%) and in sheriffs'departments serving a population of 1 million or more (60%). Among local police departments that reported testing ofarrestees, about 1 in 8 were responsible for operation of the testing program.In sheriffs' departments with arrestee testing, about 1 in 4 operated thetesting program. About a fourth of both local police and sheriffs' departmentsrequired all applicants for sworn positions to submit to a drug test. Theprevalence of drug testing of applicants increased with the size of thepopulation served. Among local police departments, 80% of those servinga population of 250,000 or more required all applicants for swornpositions to be tested for illegal drugs. About 70% of those serving a population of50,000 to 249,999 and just under 50% of those serving a population of10,000 to 49,999 had such a requirement. The percentage of policedepartments with a mandatory drug testing policy for applicants was smallestamong those serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents (25%) and those servingfewer than 2,500 residents (14%). Slightly more than 40% of sheriffs' departments serving apopulation of 100,000 or more had a policy requiring drug testing of allapplicants for sworn positions. About 30% of departments serving from 25,000to 100,000 residents had such a policy. Sheriffs' departments serving apopulation of less than 25,000 (15%) were the least likely to require allapplicants for sworn positions to undergo tests for illegal drugs. Small percentages of all local police and sheriffs'departments had a mandatory drug testing requirement for probationary officers,regular field officers, candidates for promotion, officers in drug-relatedpositions, or civilian personnel. In every population category, less than25% of the police and sheriffs' departments had mandatory drug testingfor the above personnel types, except the following: Probationary officersand officers in drug-related positions in police departments serving apopulation of 500,000 or more. Small percentages of local police and sheriff's departmentswere also using random selection to test applicants or employees for illegaldrugs. An estimated 2% of all departments tested applicants throughthis method, and the percentage of departments with random drug testing was nomore than 5% for any personnel position. Random selection testing was mostcommon for officers in drug-related positions employed by policedepartments serving a population of 1 million or more (36%). About 10% of all local police and sheriffs' departmentsrequired regular field officers suspected of using illegal drugs to take adrug test. The percentage of departments with suspicion-based testing wassimilar for other types of employees. About 2% of the departments hadsuch a policy for applicants. Departments in larger jurisdictions were more likely thanthose in smaller jurisdictions to have a suspicion-based drug testing program.For example, among local police departments, about two-thirds of localpolice departments serving 250,000 or more residents authorizedtesting of regular field officers suspected of drug use, compared to about halfof those serving a population of 50,000 to 249,999, about a third ofthose serving a population of 25,000 to 49,999, and a ninth of those servingpopulation of 2,500 to 9,999. In police departments serving a population ofunder 2,500, roughly 1 in 30 authorized testing of regular field officerssuspected of illegal drug use. About 40% of the sheriffs' departments serving a populationof 1 million or more had a policy authorizing testing of regular fieldofficers suspected of illegal drug use. About 30% of the departments serving apopulation of 500,000 to 999,999, and 20% of those serving a population of100,000 to 499,999 had such a policy. Less than 10% of the sheriffs'departments located in jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residentshad a policy that authorized drug testing of officers suspected of druguse. Nationwide, the local police departments that had asuspicion-based drug testing program for regular field officers employed 50% ofall local police officers. The sheriffs' departments with such a testingprogram employed 31% of all sheriff's officers. An estimated 17% of all localpolice officers and 12% of sheriffs' officers worked for departmentsthat had a random selection program for regular field officers. About 3%of local police officers and 4% of sheriffs' officers were employed bydepartments that had a mandatory drug testing requirement for fieldofficers. Local police departments that tested civilian employeessuspected of drug use employed 45% of all such employees nationwide. About 30%of civilian employees in sheriffs' departments worked in department witha suspicion- based testing program for civilians. Civilian employees in sheriffs' departments were more likelyto be a part of a random selection drug testing program than theircounterparts in local police departments (9% versus 3%). About 5% of the civilianemployees in local police and sheriffs' departments were subject to amandatory drug testing requirement. For comparison, the results of a 1988 survey conducted by theDepartment of Labor showed that 3% of private nonagricultural businesseshad a drug testing program of some type, including 43% of those with1,000 or more employees. Overall, about 20% of private sector employeesworked for a company with a drug testing program. (Bureau of LaborStatistics, Survey of Employer Anti-drug Programs, Report 760, January 1990.) Among local law enforcement agencies with an employee drugtesting program, an estimated 61% of the police departments and 69% of thesheriffs' departments specified dismissal as a possible disciplinarysanction against nonprobationary officers after one positive drug test. Local police officers testing positive for the first timewere most likely to face dismissal as a possible sanction in largerjurisdictions. All police departments serving a population of 1 million or morehad a policy specifying dismissal as a possible sanction after onepositive drug test, and 83% of those serving a population of 250,000 to 999,999had such a policy. Suspension was the most serious disciplinary sanctionspecified for an initial positive drug test in 14% of the police and sheriffs'departments that tested employees for illegal drugs. After a second positive drug test by a nonprobationaryofficer, the percentage of local law enforcement agencies specifyingdismissal as the most serious disciplinary sanction increased to 93% forpolice departments and to 98% for sheriffs' departments. Treatment was specified as a possible alternative fornonprobationary officers with positive drug test results in almost half ofthe local police and sheriffs' departments with a testing program. The drugtesting policies of local police departments specified treatmentalternatives more often than those of sheriffs' departments (49% versus 39%).Treatment alternatives were generally limited to the first offense. Among police departments, treatment alternatives were mostlikely to exist in jurisdictions with a population of 50,000 to 249,999,where two-thirds of them had such a policy. Among sheriffs' departments, thoseserving 500,000 to 999,999 residents (62%) were the most likely tohave treatment alternatives specified in their drug testing policy. Police departments serving a population of 1 million or more(20%) were the least likely of all local law enforcement agencies to specifytreatment as a possible alternative for officers who test positive fordrugs. State police departments Thirty-three (67%) of the 49 primary State police departmentsreported that at least some of the persons they arrested were being testedfor illegal drugs. Four (8%) of the departments reported that they hadprimary responsibility for operation of the testing program. Percent of departments in which at least some arrestees are tested Total 67% Agency-operated program 8 Not agency-operated 59 Just over half (55%) of State police departments reportedthey required drug tests of all applicants for sworn positions. Two (4%) ofthe departments reported they required all regular field officersto undergo tests for illegal drugs, and five (10%) tested all officersworking in drug-related positions. None of the State police departmentsreported having a mandatory drug testing policy for civilianpersonnel. Some State police departments used a random selection processto test probationary officers (12%), regular field officers (8%),candidates for promotion (8%), and officers working in drug-relatedpositions (10%). One department (2%) had a random selection drug testing programfor applicants, and two departments (4%) required civilian personnel to beincluded in a random selection drug testing program. Although no State police departments had a mandatory drugtesting requirement for civilian employees, nearly half (45%) of allcivilian State police employees worked in departments that tested civilianemployees suspected of using illegal drugs. A similar proportion ofsworn State police employees (53%) were subject to suspicion-based drugtesting. About 7% of State police officers were employed by departments withrandom selection testing for regular field officers and an equalpercentage worked in departments with a mandatory drug testing requirement forsuch officers. About three-fourths (77%) of the State police departmentswith a drug testing program specified dismissal as a possible sanctionagainst probationary officers after one positive drug test. After asecond offense, dismissal was a possible sanction specified by 91%of the departments. Half of the departments with employee drug testing specifiedtreatment as a possible alternative after the first offense. As in local lawenforcement agencies, treatment alternatives were generally not availableto State police officers who tested positive for drugs a second time. Methodology The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics(LEMAS) survey collects data from a nationally representative sample of thenearly 17,000 publicly funded State and local law enforcement agencies inthe United States. All 780 State and local law enforcement agencies in theUnited States with 100 or more sworn officers (as reported in the 1986 DirectorySurvey of Law Enforcement Agencies) received the full-length LEMASquestionnaire. The 780 self-representing (SR) agencies were supplemented by anationally representative sample of all agencies with fewer than 100sworn officers. These nonself-representing (NSR) agencies were chosen using astratified random sample with cells based on the type of agency (localpolice, sheriff, or special police), size of population served, andnumber of sworn officers. The 2,338 NSR agencies received a slightlyabbreviated LEMAS questionnaire, which did not contain items about jobclassifications, residency requirements, special pay, collective bargaining,police membership organizations, special units, or written policydirectives. The initial mailing of the survey questionnaire was conductedin July 1990. The pay period containing June 15, 1990, was used as thereference date for personnel-related questions and June 30, 1990, for otherquestions. The data were collected by the Bureau of the Census for theBureau of Justice Statistics. After two followup mailings and additional telephone calls asneeded, a final total of 2,945 agencies responded to the LEMASquestionnaire, including 738 SR agencies and 2,207 NSR agencies. The overallresponse rate was 94.5%. The final data-base includes responses from1,830 local police departments, 840 sheriffs' departments, 226 specialpolice departments, and the 49 primary State police departments. The base weight for all SR agencies is 1. For NSR local andspecial police departments, the base weight is 8.128, and for NSR sheriffs'departments it is 4.09857. The final weight associated with every agency,both SR and NSR, is the product of the base weight and a factor thatadjusted for any nonresponding agencies in each sample cell. This agencynonresponse factor was based on number of sworn officers for SR agencies and onnumber of agencies for NSR agencies. Some responding agencies did not completely answer the LEMASquestionnaire. When an agency did not supply a response to an item, a donoragency was randomly selected from responding agencies in the same samplecell. The donor agency's value for the item was placed into thenonresponding agency's response field with an indicator that the value hadbeen imputed. Complete documentation regarding sampling procedures andnon-response adjustments is available upon request. Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100 swornpersonnel were collected from a sample, the results are subject to samplingerror. All statements of comparison in this report have been tested toensure that observed differences between values are significant at 2standard errors (the 95-percent confidence level) or higher.

A 1983 National Institute of Justicesurvey of more than 1,400 criminal justice officials from allparts of the country identified jail and prison crowding as themost serious problem facing criminal justice systems.(1) The reality of more prisoners than available beds creates adilemma for local justice officials. Crowded jails may compromisepublic safety through a lack of space to confine those who poseserious threats to the community. Lawsuits challenging crowdedconditions may constrain a community's ability to incarcerate, A recent Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin notesthat 22 percent (134) of the Nation's 621 largest jails (thosewith a capacity of more than 100) were under court order in 1984to expand capacity or reduce the number of inmates housed, and 24percent (150) were under court order to improve one ormore conditions of confinement. (2) Building or expanding facilities is often necessary to housethose who must be incarcerated. The time and costs ofconstruction and operation of new institutions, however, arguethat other options should not be overlooked. (3) For the local sheriff or jail administrator, jail crowdingcreates increased prisoner and staff tensions, increased wear andtear of facility and equipment, budgetary problems from overtimestaffing, and an inability to meet program and service standards.Less frequently recognized are the problems crowding creates forother justice system officials: Judges, prosecutors, probation and parole, and other officials often find crowding a severe constraint in cases where jailing offenders appears necessary but space is unavailable. Prosecutors, public defenders, and pretrial services officers find their functions impaired by delayed access to inmates caused by difficulty in processing large numbers of offenders. Court functions overall may suffer when crowding affects the movement of inmates to and from scheduled appearances. Too often, however, agencies outside jail management are notfully involved in efforts to cope with the problem. Many jurisdictions address the symptoms of jail crowding butleave the underlying causes unaddressed. Other jurisdictions,however, view jail crowding as a problem that demands thecooperative involvement of all key figures in the local justicesystem. Given the success of this systemwide approach in anumber of locations, the National Institute of Justice sponsoreddevelopment of Alleviating Jail Crowding: A SystemsPerspective (NCJ 99462, 1985), based on a survey of justicesystem officials and programs throughout the United States. Thereport stresses that while construction of new facilities may bepart of a community's solution to crowding, emphasis must also beplaced on ensuring that existing bed space is used effectively.Accordingly, the report highlights the role of each localcriminal justice agency in ensuring the effective use of jail bedspace to prevent crime and maintain public safety. This Researchin Brief summarizes the full report. Looking at the local justice system Virtually every decisionmaker in the local justice systemexercises discretion that can affect the jail population.Jurisdictions using a systemwide approach to jail crowding seethe local justice system as a screening mechanism that can bemodified to enhance the use of scarce jail space. These jurisdictions develop case-processing flowcharts tounderstand the details of their case-handling process from theinitial contact to final disposition. Flowchart, illustrate thestages of the legal process, specify the points at whichdecisionmaker actions affect the jail population, and identifyopportunities to alleviate crowding. Understanding the local flow of cases can help policymakersidentify program and process changes to reduce crowding. Programchanges frequently involve eliminating the jailing of personswhom a community deems inappropriate for criminal justiceprocessing, such as the mentally ill. Process changes improve system efficiency, eliminatingcase-handling "catch points" that unnecessarily prolongthe confinement of persons who might eventually be releasedthrough bail, probation, or transfer to the State prison. Reducing length of confinement often becomes the first focusof population reduction, because efficiency measures aregenerally less costly and more readily implemented than newprograms. Local analysis often reveals that the primaryunderlying cause of crowding is excessive length of confinementdue to inefficient case processing. How system decisionmakers can affect jail crowding System studies in a number of jurisdictions have suggested,as one judge said, "a lot of little ways" to halt orreverse jail population increases without releasing seriousoffenders. The following discussion highlights just a few of the"little ways" available at different parts of thesystem. Law enforcement - Decision, surrounding local arrestpractices whether to arrest, transport to jail or stationhouse, book or detain for bail setting - are criticaldeterminants of jail population size. Law enforcement practicesboth before and after arrest can be modified to reduce jailadmissions. Jurisdictions such as San Diego County, California,and Frederick County (Winchester), Virginia, use perhaps the mostcommon form of prearrest diversion through short-term"sobering up" facilities for public inebriates. San Diego has been successful in reducing crowding throughthe use of a privately operated detoxification reception programwhere inebriates must remain for a minimum 4-hour period. Thoughin a largely rural area, the Winchester, Virginia, detoxificationprogram, operated by the Division of Court Services, has alsodiverted a large number of persons from jail. Similar prearrest diversion programs are in effect forpersons involved in family disputes(4) and for homeless personsin a number of jurisdictions throughout the United States. Law enforcement officials in Galveston County, Texas, haveinstituted practices to divert the mentally ill-a population thatfrequently makes up 10 to 20 percent of a jail's population. Ateam of deputies receives special training to assist in meetingthe emergency needs of the mentally ill, thereby allowing theagency to take them directly to a mental health facility. Many agencies also use a number of postarrest practices suchas station-house release before booking, field citations, andcourt-delegated authority to release suspects according to a bailschedule to eliminate unnecessary confinement. Jail administrators - Elected sheriffs or appointed jailexecutives are often viewed as the managers most affected butleast powerful in dealing with jail crowding. While having littledirect control over admissions and length of confinement, jailadministrators nevertheless can help reduce crowding by assuringready access for pretrial release screening and bail review. Quick access to detainees tends to be a common characteristicof successful programs to reduce jail crowding. For example, thesheriff in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte), North Carolina, allowspretrial services staff to be present during the jail admissionsprocess, which gives them access to defendants and speedsdecisionmaking. Individual judges often lack feedback regarding prisoners injail awaiting or following adjudication. Yet such information isof interest to the court and critical to jail populationreduction. The Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas, administratorprovides data to help judges monitor the court status ofprisoners and prevent length of confinement from being extendedthrough oversight or inattention. In some other jurisdictions, jail administrators aredelegated authority to release defendants pretrial or divertdrunk drivers to treatment centers. Other administrators helpdevelop nonjail pretrial-release and sentencing options orcooperate with other jurisdictions to alleviate crowding on amulticounty basis. Prosecutors - Prosecutors act at more case-handlingdecision points than any other officials. This gives them anespecially important role in containing jail population growth. Early case screening by prosecutors reduces unnecessarylength of confinement by eliminating or downgrading weak cases assoon as possible. Assistant prosecutors in Milwaukee County,Wisconsin, review arrests around the clock by examining policerecords and conducting meetings between complainants andsuspects. This practice enables Milwaukee prosecutors to decideon the appropriate charge within 24 to 36 hours after arrest. Prosecutors in Milwaukee also use "vertical caseprocessing" - assigning the same attorney or team ofattorneys to prosecute a case from start to finish. Though notnecessarily the case in all jurisdictions, reassigning cases fromone assistant prosecutor to another while the matter is beforethe court "horizontal case processing" - may causestagnation in caseflow, increased requests for continuances, andlengthened time to trial. Prosecutor cooperation is essential for alternatives inarrest, pretrial confinement, and sentencing. Prosecutorparticipation and leadership are essential to the effectivenessof task forces dealing with jail crowding. Since the prosecutor"owns" cases on behalf of the State, others are rarelywilling to propose case-handling changes without the prosecutor'ssupport. Recognizing that a lack of space to confine dangerous personsis a threat to public safety, prosecutors in a number ofjurisdictions have taken an active role in reducing jail crowdingby serving on "key court officials" groups or chairingjail population reduction boards. Pretrial services - Providing background informationon defendants, release recommendations, and other pretrialassistance can be an important component of solutions tocrowding. Pretrial services can often help merely by adjustingstaff schedules to ensure timely screening and interviews for amaximum number of defendants. In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for example, pretrialservices and magistrate bail setting are available 24 hours, 7days a week. In Kentucky, pretrial staff are on call 24 hours aday to interview persons at rested, notify judges by phone of theprisoner's qualifications for release, and supervise the releaseprocess if nonfinancial bail is authorized. Limited release authority is delegated to pretrial servicesstaff in an increasing number of jurisdictions. In San MateoCounty (Redwood City), California, pretrial staff are authorizedto release misdemeanor suspects prior to their first courtappearance. Seattle, Washington, is experimenting with delegatedrelease on certain felony charges. Many pretrial programs respond to jail population pressuresby expanding the range of release options (conditional andsupervised release, third-party custody, unsecured bail, depositbail) and by conducting regular bail reviews for those detainedfor trial. A National Institute of Justice study found that supervisedrelease programs in Miami, Florida; Portland, Oregon; andMilwaukee, Wisconsin, significantly reduced the bail-heldpopulation without significantly increasing the risk to publicsafety. Judiciary - Judges make more decisions affecting jailpopulation than anyone else; this often makes them leaders inseeking jail-crowding solutions. Judges can issue summonsesinstead of arrest warrants; provide guidelines authorizing directrelease by police, jail, and pretrial staff; and provide bailsetting outside normal court hours. Evaluators of the 4-year JailOvercrowding Reduction Project of the former Law EnforcementAssistance Administration found that the project's mostsuccessful sites were those with strong judicial leadership. Many courts provide 24-hour bail-setting magistrates. TheKing County (Seattle), Washington, District Court has a"three-tier" release policy that reduces court time,jail admissions, and length of confinement. The court establishedguidelines specify the charges for which pretrial services staffmay (1) release without consulting the court, (2) release afterphoning a duty judge, or (3) make recommendations to the court inthe most serious felony cases. Reducing court delay is crucial to effective use of jailspace. Bexar County, Texas, seeks to eliminate "deadtime" by having the court administrator work with a jailcase coordinator to identify cases in need of special attentionand processing steps that can be shortened. Each judge receivesweekly a list of prisoners awaiting indictment, trial,sentencing, or revocation in his or her court. One result is a 50-percent time saving in disposing ofmisdemeanor charges and thus a significant cut in overall lengthof confinement. Many judges have worked to extend the range of nonjailsentencing options, using probation supervision, suspended sentences, fines, community service andrestitution, halfway house placements, and specialized treatmentfacilities as true alternatives to incarceration. A growing number of courts now defer service of jailsentences, when the jail is at capacity, in cases in which jailis believed an appropriate sentence but immediate jailing is notessential for the community's safety. Defense - The National Institute's field test on EarlyRepresentation by Defense Counsel found that early screening forindigency, defender appointment, and defendant contact candecrease length of confinement and thus yield substantial savingsof jail space.(6) Vertical case processing in defense officesalso helps cut length of confinement. In Mecklenburg County, pretrial conferences between defenseand prosecution help identify, eliminate, or downgrade marginalcases and facilitate plea negotiation. Both offices can thusbudget staff time efficiently and lessen pretrial confinement. In St. Louis, Missouri, efforts to reduce staggering defendercaseloads by appointing private attorneys in felony cases havealso reduced case disposition time, stimulated bail review, andresulted in shorter pretrial confinement. Probation and parole - Not only do probation andparole agencies provide nonjail alternatives for sentencing, theycan enhance case- processing efficiency by streamliningpresentence investigation (PSI) procedures and expeditingrevocation decisions. All this helps cut length of confinement. In Brevard County, Florida, the jail population oversightcommittee spotlighted PSI delays and worked with probation andparole officers to cut PSI preparation time from 90 days to 30 or35 days for jail cases. The county also cut to 24 hours the timerequired for decisions on probation revocation, thus decreasingthe use of jail beds for persons on probation "hold"orders. Outside the local level - State legislation, courtrules, executive orders, and other "external factors"can affect jail populations - Guidelines on diversion, bailpolicy, appointment of legal counsel, sentencing practices, andjail operation all can affect the range of solutions available. Other outside factors that need to be considered in localplanning for jail use include local -demographics, availabilityof State and Federal resources, public opinion and media coverageof criminal justice issues, activities of local civic groupsand community organizations, and political campaigns andreferendums. Outside the system-Organizations outside the justicesystem can be instrumental in alleviating shortages of jail space by providing emergency shelter, detoxification,and treatment facilities for the mentally disturbed, publicinebriates, and drunk drivers. Many jurisdictions use localmental health centers to provide prompt mental healthassessments, diversion, and outpatient treatment. Privateagencies in several jurisdictions provide temporary shelter forjuveniles, pretrial supervision, and community serviceplacements. Formulating solutions While individual parts of the system can help through suchpractices as those highlighted above, one or two agencies in thelocal justice system are not enough to bring about comprehensivesolutions to crowding. Jail crowding results from the actions ofmany, with their decisions interacting to determine jailadmissions and length of confinement. Effectively combatingcrowding requires taking into account the interactive nature ofthe problem. Jurisdictions that successfully implemented a systemwideapproach to jail crowding have identified as critical needs (1)the participation of key decisionmakers in formulating solutionsand (2) detailed information on case processing and on the actualcharacteristics of the jail population. Key decisionmaker participation - Whether it is a"jail population management board" or some other body,experience in many jurisdictions argues for a forum thatencourages communication and participation by judges,prosecutors, sheriffs, police, probation officials, and otherpolicymakers in developing solutions to crowding. Collective involvement provides increased awareness of theimpact of one agency's actions on another and of the otheragency's procedures. Also, recommendations of a broadlyconstituted planning group are more likely to gain systemwidesupport. Finally, the political pragmatism that may accompanycommittee action may permit some participants to support moreimaginative policies. Information - A systemwide approach to jailcrowding requires improved information about jail use. Inaddition to the detailed flowcharts that help assess thetimeliness of case-processing decisions and the availability ofnonjail options, planners need information on precisely who orwhat type of person is in jail and why and how long they stay.This permits administrators to learn the frequency of admissionsand the size and variation of distinct segments of the jailpopulation, as well as indicating sluggish case processing. Statistical analysis of the population identifies symptoms ofjail crowding, greatly enhancing the ability to identify andtreat the causes. But while jail population data are valuable,they should not overshadow case-processing information. Analysis of data on the jail population might show, forexample, that persons detained before trial are released onlyafter 7 to 10 days. Alone, this finding could indicate theneed for a special pretrial services program to expeditescreening and bail review. Information on caseflow, however,might reveal the actual cause to be inefficient case processing. Evaluation information is also critical to developingeffective strategies. Evaluation data should be collected andanalyzed to determine if planned modifications in decisionmakingare being made and the resulting positive or negativeimplications for crowding and public safety. Implementing strategies and conclusions Localities that take a systemwide approach to jail crowdinggenerally follow some important steps: Involve all key system decisionmakers; Collect all necessary data on jail population and caseprocessing; Identify, implement, and evaluate appropriate changesin programs or processes; and Inform the public of system changes when initiated andsuccessful strategies when confirmed. While many communities have taken great steps, experience hasalso confirmed the complexity of the jail crowding problem andthe futility of seeking a panacea through one or two changes.Long-term success requires a variety of solutions and, mostimportant, the time, patience, and attention of the entirecriminal justice community.

Andy Hall is an associate of the Pre-Trial ServicesResource Center, Washington, D.C., and principal author of theNIJ publications Alleviating Jail Crowding: A SystemsPerspective and Pretrial Release Program Options (NCJ94612). From theDirector Communities throughout the Nation face the problem of jailcrowding: Having more prisoners than space to house them. Despiteconstruction innovations that may help cities or counties expandtheir confinement capacity both more quickly and at less expense,a host of problems, including fiscal pressures sometimes, mayindicate solutions other than construction. Some consequences of jail crowding are well known: Increasedvictimization and fear, decreased public confidence thatdangerous persons can be locked up, lawsuits, court-imposedlimits on the number of prisoners, damage to facilities andequipment. Crowding increases both tension in the institution andthe strain on correctional budgets. Less obvious but equally worrisome are delays in caseprocessing due to cumbersome access to prisoners and the limitsput on such necessary judicial options as pretrial release andsentencing. National Institute of Justice surveys have shown thatofficials in law enforcement, courts, corrections, and otherparts of the justice system were virtually unanimous in namingprison and jail crowding their number one concern. Recognition of the gravity of jail crowding, however, offersa glimmer of hope. Officials in a growing number of jurisdictionshave concluded that if each part of the local justice system doeswhat it can to ease crowding, the sum of all these smallsolutions has a notable cumulative effect. The separate decisions of law enforcement, judicialprosecution, defense, pretrial services, probation, corrections,and other officials can interact to influence the number of jailadmissions and length of confinement. Jurisdictions taking thissystemwide approach find that seemingly minor modifications incase processing can both reduce crowding and, more important,improve the overall administration of justice. Jail crowding is a local problem that must be dealt withlocally. The National Institute of Justice hopes to contribute tosuch endeavors, however, by assessing and synthesizinginformation on the program and process changes that localjurisdictions may want to consider. Without information on theexperience of other jurisdictions, informed policy decisions arehard to come by. At the Institute, our role is one articulated byPresident Reagan and Attorney General Meese: To support, not todirect, local responsibilities. Experience demonstrates that wehave many useful tools to deal with jail crowding. ThisResearch in Brief offers local jurisdictions their choiceamong such options. James K.

EST BJS SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1993 202-307-0784 20 YEARS OF MEASURING CRIME SHOWS FEWER OFFENSES OVERALLBUT INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES AND THE YOUNG WASHINGTON, D.C. -- After 20 years of asking Americans whattheir actual experiences with crime have been, the JusticeDepartment's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) today identifiedseveral long-term trends: --Overall, the number of criminal victimizations dropped 6percent since the annual National Crime Victimization Surveybegan in 1973. --The steepest declines are in household burglary and theft.--Blacks are substantially more likely to be violent crimevictims than are whites. --Young minority males in central cities are violent crimevictims at the highest rates the survey ever recorded. The dataare from the survey's 20th anniversary report, which noted thatmore than 4.4 million interviews were conducted from 1973 throughlast year. "While the overall trends are positive, somegroups of Americans are disproportionately the victims ofincreasing crime," observed Lawrence A. Greenfeld, theacting BJS director. "For example, last year blacksexperienced the highest per capita rates of violent crime in thesurvey's history." "The survey also documented thegrowing ratio of violent crime," Greenfeld pointed out."In 1973 about 15 percent of all crimes were violentcompared to 20 percent in 1992. Moreover, about a third of allvictims of violence report an injury." During the last twodecades an estimated 37 million victims were injured, and morethan one-third of those injured had no health insurance or werenot eligible for public health benefits. Among other reporthighlights: --Handguns are used in about 10 percent of all violentcrimes. Handgun crime rates are above the 1986 low but have notreturned to the highest rate reached in 1982. --During 1991 an estimated $19.1 billion were lost directlyfrom personal and household crimes. --Males are much more likely to be victims of violenceinflicted by strangers than by family members or other closeassociates, whereas females are as likely to be hurt by familymembers and close associates as by strangers. --About 30 percent of all violent crimes and 25 percent ofhome burglaries occur when the victim or victims are away fromhome on a leisure activity. --In approximately half of all female rapes the victim knewthe offender. Strangers used some type of weapon in 29 percent ofthe offenses, compared to 17 percent by non-stranger rapists. --In robberies during which the offender threatened thevictim before the attack, those victims who defended themselvesin some way were less likely to lose property but were morelikely to be injured than were victims who took no action. Whenthe offender had a handgun, the victim was seriously injured in 1percent of the incidents in which self- protective measures werenot taken, compared to 7 percent when such action was taken. --Households earning more than $30,000 annually are generallymore likely than are households in most other income categoriesto experience theft of a motor vehicle, but as household incomerises, burglary rates fall. --Black male teenagers (that is boys and young men from 12through 19 years old) are more likely to be violent crime victimsthan any other group of people. Their average annual rate is 113victimizations per 1,000 residents--or almost one in nine blackteenagers. For white male teenagers the rate was 90 per 1,000--orabout one in 11. --For adult black males (35 through 64 years) the violentvictimization rate was 35 per 1,000. For adult white males, 18per 1,000; adult white females, 15; adult black females 13;elderly (65 years or more) black males 12; elderly black females,10; elderly white males, 6 and elderly white females, 3 per1,000. The rate of criminal victimizations for all U.S. residentscompared to other life experiences is as follows: Occurrences Yearly rate per 1,000 adults Accidental injury, all circumstances 220 Accidental injury at home 66 Personal theft 61 Accidental injury at work 47 Violent victimization 31 Assault (aggravated and simple) 25 Motor vehicle accident injury 22 Death, all causes 11 Victimization with injury 11 Aggravated assault 8 Robbery 6 Death from heart disease 5 Death from cancer 3 Rape (women only) 1 Accidental death, all circumstances 0.4 Death from pneumonia or influenza 0.4 Death in motor vehicle accident 0.2 Suicide 0.2 Death from HIV infection 0.1 Homicide and capital punishment executions 0.1 The survey measures rape, robbery, assault, burglary,personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. It doesnot measure murder, kidnapping or commercial crimes. Last year 39 percent of all these crimes were reported topolice--the highest since 1973, when it was 32 percent. Theincreased reporting rate was consistent with the fact thatviolent crime and motor vehicle theft have made up an increasingproportion of total crime during the last two decades. Thehighest reporting rate last year was for completed motor vehicletheft--92 percent. The lowest was for personal larceny withoutcontact--15 percent.

DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS AT THE TIME OF OFFENSE The BJS National Crime Victimization Survey asks victims ofthe violent crimes of rape, robbery, and assault about theirperceptions of the offender's use of alcohol and drugs. In 30% ofviolent crime victimizations in 1992, victims reported that theybelieved their assailants were under the influence of drugs oralcohol. In half of violent crime victimizations, the victim didnot know whether the offender was under the influence.

Data from BJS corrections surveys show that a quarter ofconvicted jail inmates, a third of State prisoners, andtwo-fifths of youths in long-term, State-operated facilitiesadmit that they were under the influence of an illegal drug atthe time of their offense. Among jail inmates in 1989-- * 44% used drugs in the month before the offense * 30% used drugs daily in the month before the offense * 27% used drugs at the time of the offense. Jail inmates convicted of drug offenses most frequentlyreported having been under the influence of drugs at the time oftheir offense (39%), followed by convicted burglars (38%) androbbers (36%). Jail inmates convicted of driving whileintoxicated (DWI) (12%), assault (14%), and homicide (18%) werethe least likely to report having been under the influence ofdrugs at the time of the offense.

Survey of State prisoninmates, 1991. In 1991, 49% of all State prison inmates reported that theywere under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both at the timethey committed the offense for which they were currentlysentenced: 17% were under the influence of drugs only, and 14%were under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Half of the State prisoners said they had taken illegal drugsduring the month before committing the crime. Among violent offenders in State prisons-- * 61% said that they or their victims were under theinfluence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offense * 50% reported being under the influence of alcohol or drugsat the time of the offense * 30% said their victims were under the influence of alcoholor drugs. Nearly 40% of the youth incarcerated in long-term,State-operated facilities in 1987 said they were under theinfluence of drugs at the time of their offense. Data from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Drug UseForecasting (DUF) program revealed that of a sample of adultmales arrested in 23 U.S. cities in 1993, the percent testingpositive for any drug ranged from 54% in Omaha and San Jose to81% in Chicago. Among the 20 cities reporting data on femalearrestees, the percent of females testing positive for any drugranged from 42% in San Antonio to 83% in Manhattan.

PRIOR DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS Data from BJS surveys show that 78% of jail inmates in 1989,79% of State prisoners in 1991, 60% of Federal prisoners in 1991,and 83% of youth in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987had used drugs at some point in their lives. Although drug use by State prison inmates in the month beforethe offense fell between 1986 and 1991, a higher proportion ofinmates reported use of cocaine or crack in 1991 than 1986. Onein three inmates who ever used drugs in the past used a needle toinject drugs. Fifteen percent of inmates who had ever used drugshad shared a needle at least once.

Sixty percent of jail inmates who ever used any drug reportedthey had done so more than a year before their first arrest. Ofinmates who reported using a major drug regularly, 55% had notdone so until after their first arrest. Almost 83% of youth in long-term, State-operated juvenilefacilities in 1987 reported use of an illegal drug in the past,and 63% had used an illegal drug on a regular basis. The mostcommonly mentioned drugs were marijuana, cocaine, andamphetamines. Among drug-using youth in long-term, State- operated juvenilefacilities, 19% said they first used drugs before age 10; 38%reported their first use was before age 12.

DRUG-RELATED CRIME Overall, 10% of Federal prison inmates in 1991, 17% of Stateprison inmates in 1991, and 13% of convicted jail inmates in 1989said they committed their offense to obtain money for drugs.Twenty percent of Hispanic State prison inmates said theycommitted their offense to get money for drugs, compared to 15%of white inmates and 17% of black inmates. Twenty-four percent offemale inmates said they committed their offense to get money tobuy drugs, compared to 16% of male inmates. Inmates incarcerated for robbery, burglary, larceny, and drugtrafficking most often committed their crime to obtain money fordrugs.

DRUG ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS As reported in Federal law enforcement officers, 1993, as ofDecember 1993, Federal agencies employed about 69,000 full-timepersonnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms. The DEAemployed 2,813 full-time agents. These officers investigate majornarcotics violators, enforce regulations governing themanufacture and dispensing of controlled substances, and performa variety of other functions in support of drug traffickingprevention and control. The FBI employed 10,075 full-time agents. These agentsinvestigate more than 250 types of Federal crimes. The FBI hasconcurrent jurisdiction with the DEA over drug offenses under theControlled Substances Act. According to the BJS Law Enforcement Management andAdministrative Statistics (LEMAS) program, in 1990, about 9,300local police departments, 2,500 sheriffs' departments, and 34State police departments, employing over 500,000 full-timeofficers, had primary responsibility for drug law enforcement. Drug-related law enforcement activities include makingarrests and seizing drugs as well as laboratory testing of drugs,drug education, and drug testing of arrestees and agencyemployees. Most agencies serving 50,000 or more residentsoperated a special drug enforcement unit, participated in amultiagency task force, and received money or goods from an assetforfeiture program: * Special drug units focus on conducting investigations ondrug traffickers and drug-related activities in the community. * To coordinate efforts with other law enforcement agenciesto accumulate evidence, most large agencies participate in amultiagency task force. These task forces develop enforcementstrategies such as the use of informants, surveillance, andundercover operations. * Most States have laws that allow the government to seizeconvicted drug traffickers' assets, such as cash, bank accounts,planes, boats, cars, and homes. Many State laws require that allforfeited assets go to the State and/or local treasury uponpayment of outstanding loans. In some States, law enforcementagencies can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales ofwhat is forfeited.

The number of defendants convicted of drug possessionoffenses increased from 498 in 1981 to 1,163 in 1991 -- a 134%increase. Drug possession convictions were 7% of all drugconvictions in 1991. Drug offenses accounted for 19% of all defendants convictedin 1981 and 35% of all defendants convicted in 1991. Drugtrafficking offenses alone accounted for 33% of all defendantsconvicted in 1991. The conviction rate for drug defendantsincreased from 76% in 1981 to 84% in 1991. The percentage of offenders convicted of drug offensessentenced to prison rose from 73% in 1981 to 87% in 1991.

The average percent ofsentence served until first release increased from 60% in 1985 to68% in 1990. Contributing to these increases are the sentencingguidelines that went into effect in 1987 and the 1986 and 1988anti-drug abuse laws which prescribed stiffer sentences andmandatory minimum incarceration terms for Federal offenders.

Self-reports of drug use among high school seniors mayunderrepresent drug use among youth of that age because highschool dropouts and truants are not included, and these groupsmay have more involvement with drugs than those who stay inschool. The 1993 high school seniors were asked, "How much doyou think people risk harming themselves?" Those students answering "great risk" in regularuse accounted for the following percentages-- * marijuana, 72.5%, up from a low of 34.9% in 1978, but downfrom 76.5% in 1992 * cocaine, 90%, up from a low of 68.2% in 1977 and 1978 * heroin, 88.3%, virtually stable since 1975 * LSD, 79.4%, following a low of 79.1% in 1977 and a high of84.5% in 1990. Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey School Crime Supplement show that in the first half of 1989,2 out of 3 students ages 12 to 19 reported availability of drugsat their school. Availability of drugs was reported more often by-- * public school students (70%) than by private schoolstudents (52%) * students in grades 9 to 12, compared to students in grades6 to 8. Similar rates of drug availability were reported by-- * white students (69%) and black students (67%) * students residing in cities (66%), suburban areas (67%),and nonmetropolitan areas (71%). The survey also showed that most drugs, while available, weredifficult to obtain. As reported in the 1991 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justicestatistics, a 1990 national survey of fifth and sixth gradersfound that-- * 15% knew adults or older kids who tried or who usemarijuana; 5% knew kids their own age who tried or who usemarijuana * 10% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use cocaine;2% knew kids their own age who use cocaine or crack * 90% agreed with the statement "drugs bought on thestreet are not safe to use" * 7% said they will probably have tried drugs by the timethey enter high school.

PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT DRUGS As reported in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justicestatistics, the percentage of Gallup Poll respondents describingdrug abuse as the single most important problem facing ourcountry peaked in 1989: Drug abuse most serious Date of poll problem January 1985 2% July 1986 8 April 1987 11 September 1988 11 May 1989 27 November 1989 38 April 1990 30 July 1990 18 March 1991 11 March 1992 8 January 1993 6 January 1994 9 Among Gallup Poll respondents, the use of drugs was mostoften mentioned as one of the biggest problems for schools intheir communities. Giving that response in 1993 were-- * 14% of public school parents * 9% of nonpublic school parents * 17% of those with no children in school * 16% of all surveyed. When asked about spending for various social problems, 60% ofthe respondents to a 1993 National Opinion Research Center (NORC)Poll said this country is spending too little to deal with drugaddiction. In 1990 Gallup Poll respondents were asked how best thegovernment should allocate its resources in its fight againstdrugs: * 40% said "teaching young people about the dangers ofdrugs" * 28% said "working with foreign governments to stop theexport of drugs to this country" * 19% said "arresting people in this country who selldrugs" * 5% said "helping drug users to overcome theiraddiction to drugs" * 4% said "arresting the people who use drugs." Gallup Poll respondents were asked, "What is the mostimportant thing that can be done to help reduce crime?" In1989, the most frequent response was to cut the drug supply(25%), followed by harsher punishment (24%). In 1981, 3% ofrespondents mentioned cutting the drug supply, while harsherpunishment was mentioned by 38% of respondents. NORC has asked adults (age 18 or older) about legalization ofmarijuana since 1973. In 1993, 22% believed that marijuana shouldbe made legal, down from a peak of 30% in 1978. College freshmen have been surveyed by NORC since 1968.

The 1990 increase of nearly 59,000 prisonersequals a demand for approximately 1,100 new prison beds per weeknationwide. Prisons were estimated to be operating from 18% to29% above their capacities at yearend. Strong evidence exists that during the 1980's there was anincreasing probability that a convicted offender would go toprison. The ratio of prison admissions to reported serious crimesand arrests for serious crimes increased to levels unequalled inalmost 30 years of reporting. The Bureau of Justice Statistics expresses its appreciationto the departments of corrections in the 50 States, the Districtof Columbia, and the Federal Prison System, that make it possiblefor us to gather and report data on the Nation's prisoners. Steven D. Dillingham, Ph.D. Director ----------------------------------------------------------------- PRISONERS IN 1990 By Robyn L. Cohen BJS Statistician The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal orState correctional authorities at yearend 1990 reached a recordhigh of 771,243. The States and the District of Columbia added52,331 prisoners; the Federal system, 6,355. The increase for1990 brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to441,422 - an increase of about 134% in the 10-year period. The 1990 growth rate (8.2%) was less than the percentageincrease recorded during 1989 (13.5%), and the number of newprisoners added during 1990 was 26,271 less than the number addedduring the preceding year (84,957). The 1990 increase translatesinto a nationwide need for approximately 1,100 prison bedspacesper week, compared to 1,600 prison bedspaces per week needed in1989. Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as"sentenced prisoners") accounted for 96% of the totalprison population at the end of 1990, growing by 8.6% during theyear. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less orwere unsentenced (like those, for example, awaiting trial inStates with combined prison-jail systems). The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at afaster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during theyear (10.7% versus 8.5%). For States, the rate of increase in thenumber of sentenced prisoners was lower than in 1989 (13%). Among the 13,318 Federal prisoners with no sentences orsentences of a year or less were 1,910 under the jurisdiction ofthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, a decrease of 45 fromthe number held at the end of 1989 (1,955). The number of Federalprisoners with no sentences or sentences of less than a yearincreased by 1,315 during 1990 (from 12,003 to 13,318), while thenumber of sentenced prisoners increased by 5,040. Total prison populations in Alaska, the District of Columbia,Oregon, Rhode Island, and Tennessee altogether decreased by 1,675inmates during 1990. The District of Columbia accounted for morethan half of this decline. The percentage of growth was thehighest during 1990 in Vermont (15.9%), Washington (15.4%), andNew Hampshire (15.1%). Thirteen States reported total prisonerincreases of 10% or more since yearend 1989. California'sincrease of more than 10,000 prisoners during the year was thelargest gain in the number of prisoners for any singlejurisdiction. At the end of 1990, about 1 in 8 prisonersnationwide were confined in a California institution. Californiaaccounted for more than 17% of the increase nationwide during theyear. Rates of Incarceration Increase On December 31, 1990, the number of sentenced prisoners per100,000 residents was 293, also setting a new record. Ten of the16 jurisdictions with rates equal to or greater than the rate forthe Nation were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 1 wasin the Midwest, and 1 was in the Northeast. Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000residents has risen nearly 111%, from 139 to 293. During thisperiod, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly inthe Northeast, increasing by 167% (from 87 to 232) and the West,up by nearly 163% (from 105 to 276). The per capita number ofsentenced prisoners in the Midwest climbed 119% (from 109 to239), and the rate rose 68% in the South (from 188 to 315). Thenumber of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residentshas increased 133% (from 9 to 21) over the same period. Prison Populations in Western States Grow the Fastest Regionally, during 1990 the percentage increase in the numberof sentenced prisoners was highest in the Western States, with again of 9.2%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 8.8% inthe Northeast, 8.8% in the South, and 6.9% in the MidwesternStates. The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 10.7%. In 13 States the percentage change in the number of sentencedprisoners during 1990 was equal to or higher than that of 1989.Among these jurisdictions, four had increases of at least 10%,led by New Hampshire (15.1%), Texas (13.7%), Alabama (13.2%), andGeorgia (10.1%). From the end of 1985 to December 31, 1990, net gains in thenumber of sentenced prisoners have averaged about 1,000 prisonersper week - a weekly gain of about 922 State prisoners and 75Federal prisoners per week over the period. The largest net gainshave occurred in the South (306 inmates per week) followed by theWest (243), the Midwest (194), and the Northeast (179). During1990 average growth in the number of sentenced State and Federalprisoners was equal to a demand for 1,131 additional bed- spacesper week, about 354 fewer than the average weekly growth in 1989. The sentenced prisoner population had increased in fourStates by 90% or more since 1985: California (94%), Colorado(107%), Michigan (93%), and New Hampshire (97%). California'sincrease of 45,796 sentenced prisoners since 1985 accounts for72% of the increase for the West and 19% of the increase amongall States over the period. In 1985, 10.8% of the Nation'ssentenced State prisoners were in California; in 1990, 13.7%. Male Prisoner Population Growth Outpaces that of Females The number of male inmates (727,398) increased at a fasterrate during 1990 (8.3%) than the number of female inmates (7.9%).This is the first year since 1981 that the number of male inmateshas increased at a faster rate than the number of female inmates.The rate of incarceration for sentenced males (566 per 100,000males in the resident population) was about 18 times higher thanfor sentenced females (31 per 100,000 females in the residentpopulation). At the end of 1990, women accounted for 5.7% ofprisoners nationwide. The 1990 growth rate (7.9%) for female inmates was less thanthe percentage increase recorded during 1989 (24.4%). As shownbelow, the percentage change was lower in 1990 across all theregions and at the Federal level. Percent Increase in Female Inmate Population 1989-90 1988-89 Total 7.9% 24.4% Federal 13.0 36.8 State 7.2 23.1 Northeast 9.2 29.8 Midwest 7.1 19.5 South 7.2 23.6 West 6.3 22.3 In 1990, 22 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federalsystem had more than 500 female inmates. Among thesejurisdictions, 10 had increases of at least 10%, led by NewJersey's increase of 17.5% (from 886 in 1989 to 1,041 in 1990).California's increase during 1990, 502 inmates, accounted for15.7% of the nationwide increase of 3,199. Local Jails Held More than 18,000 Because of State PrisonCrowding At the end of 1990, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of18,380 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilitiesbecause of crowding in State facilities. The number of Stateprisoners held locally decreased by 3.6% over that of yearend1989. Three States - Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia -accounted for more than half of the prisoners sentenced to prisonbut incarcerated locally. Five States - Arkansas, Louisiana, NewJersey, Tennessee, and Virginia - held more than 10% of theirState- sentenced prisoners in local jails because of Statefacility crowding. Overall, 2.4% of the State prison populationwas confined in local jails on December 31, 1990, because ofprison crowding. Prison Capacity Estimates are Difficult to Compare The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficultto determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measuresfor defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is inuse among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity mayreflect both available space to house inmates and the ability tostaff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of theNation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to threemeasures for yearend 1990 - rated, operational, and designcapacities. These measures were defined as follows: - Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned bya rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. - Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can beaccommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, andservices. - Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners orarchitects intended for the facility. Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 32 supplied ratedcapacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 38 submitteddesign capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity andmeasures of the relationship to population are based on thehighest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-sixjurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figurefor each capacity measure they reported.) Most Jurisdictions are Operating Above Capacity Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operateefficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintainedand repaired periodically, special housing is needed forprotective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may beneeded to cope with emergencies. At the end of 1990, nine Statesreported they were operating below 95% of their highest capacity. Forty-two jurisdictions and the Federal prison systemreported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity; 34of these held populations that met or exceeded their highestreported capacities. Overall, at the end of 1990 State prisons were estimated tobe operating at 115% of their highest capacities and 127% oftheir lowest capacities. Prisons in Southern States were found tobe operating closest to their reported capacity on each measure. The Federal system was estimated to be operating at 51% overcapacity. Between 1989 and 1990, State and Federal prisoncapacities were estimated to have increased by approximately20,000-50,000 beds. At the end of 1990, prisons nationwide wereestimated to be from 18% to 29% over their capacities. Prison Population Growth may Reflect Increasing Certainty ofPunishment There is some evidence that during the period 1980-89 changesin criminal justice policies have increased a criminal'sprobability of being incarcerated from levels existing in prioryears. Murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravatedassault, and burglary are among the most serious crimes andaccount for approximately half of prison commitments from courts.In 1960 there were 62 prison commitments for every 1,000 of thesecrimes reported to law enforcement agencies. During the rest ofthe decade this ratio steadily declined reaching 23 in 1970 andwas relatively stable during the 1970's. Between 1980 and 1989the ratio increased from 25 commitments per 1,000 reported crimesto 62. Similarly, between 1960 and 1970 the ratio of prisoncommitments to adult arrests for the selected crimes declinedfrom 299 per 1,000 to 170. This ratio was relatively stableduring the 1970's, but it increased between 1980 and 1989, from196 commitments per 1,000 adult arrests to 332. (SeeMethodological note for more detail on these data.) Prison-admissions-to-crime ratios for individual Statesprovide an alternative measure of prison use to population-basedrates. Population-based incarceration rates take into account thenumber of sentenced prisoners and the size of the residentpopulation in a jurisdiction. The crime-based rate measures entryinto prison relative to the number of crimes reported to lawenforcement agencies during a year. Between 1980 and 1989 the ratio of court commitments toprison and reported crimes increased 148%, from 25 commitmentsper 1,000 crimes to 62. Over the same period the number of prisoncommitments per 100,000 adult residents went up 115%, from 80 to172. The Northeast had the largest percentage increase in thenumber of commitments relative to reported crime and experiencedthe largest gain in prison commitments relative to population.However, in both 1980 and 1989 the South had the largest numberof court commitments to prison relative to reported crime and topopulation. Besides the increased use of prison relative to reportedcrime, arrests, and resident population, prison population hasalso been affected by changes in the extent of the illegal drugproblem. An estimated two-thirds of those in State prisons for a drugoffense were convicted of trafficking or manufacturing illegaldrugs. (For additional information on drug offenders in Stateprisons, see Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986, BJS SpecialReport, NCJ-109926, January 1988 and Drug Use and Crime, BJSSpecial Report, NCJ-111940, July 1988.) Since 1985 the number ofadult arrests for drug violations has increased by 74%, and thenumber of arrests for sales or manufacturing of illegal drugs hasgrown by 137%.

Gilliard BJS Statistician The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal orState correctional authorities at yearend 1992 reached a recordhigh of 883,593. The States and the District of Columbia added50,809 prisoners; the Federal system, 8,651. The increase for1992brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to553,772, an increase of about 168% in the 12-year period. The 1992 growth rate (7.2%) was greater than the percentageincrease recorded during 1991 (6.6%), and the number of newprisoners added during 1992 was 8,451 more than the number addedduring the preceding year (51,009). The 1992 increase translatesinto nationwide need for approximately 1,143 prison bedspaces perweek, compared to the nearly 981 prison bedspaces per week neededin 1991. Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as"sentenced prisoners") accounted for 96% of the totalprison population at the end of 1992, growing by 7.3% during theyear. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less orwere unsenenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States withcombined prison-jail systems). The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at afaster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during 1992(15.9% versus 6.8%). These annual rates of increase were higherthan in 1991 when the Federal system grew 12.5%, and Statesystems, 6.4. The number of Federal prisoners with no sentences orsentences of less than a year decreased during 1992 (from 14,912to 14,553), while the number of sentenced prisoners increased by9,010. Prison populations in Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota,Oregon, and Wyoming decreased during 1992. The decrease in these5 States totaled 1,135 inmates. The highest percentages of growthduring 1992 were reported in Texas (18.4%), West Virginia(16.2%), Nw Hampshire (15.9%), Idaho (15.5%), and Wisconsin(15.4%). Eight States reported total prisoner populationincreases of 10% or more since yearend 1991. Texas' increase of 9,501 prisoners during the year was thelargest gain in the number of prisoners for any singlejurisdiction, followed by California (7,688), New York (3,874),and Michigan (2,596). Texas accounted for about 16% of theincrease in prisonpopulation nationwide. Rates of incarceration increase On December 31, 1992, the number of sentenced prisoners per100,000 residents was 329, a new record. Twelve of the 19jurisdictions with rates greater than the rate for the Nationwere located in the South, 4 were in the West, 2 were in theMidwest, and 1was in the Northeast. Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000residents has risen nearly 137%, from 139 to 329. During thisperiod, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly inthe Northeast, increasing by 198% (from 87 to 259), and the West,up by184% (from 105 to 298). The per capita number of sentencedprisoners in the Midwest climbed 149% (from 109 to 271), and therate rose 89% in the South (from 188 to 355). The number ofsentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents hasincreased 18% (from 9 to 26) over the same period. Prison populations in Southern States grow the fastest Regionally, during 1992 the percentage increase in the numberof sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, with again of 7.8% (table 3). The number of sentenced prisoners grew by6.7% in the Midwest, 5.9% in the West, and 4.6% in the Northest.The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 15.9%. In 22States and the District of Columbia the percentage change in thenumber of sentenced prisoners during 1992 was higher than that of1991. Among these jurisdictions, eight had increases of a least10%, led by Texas (18.4%), Vermont (18.3%), West Virginia(16.2%), New Hampshire (15.9%), Wisconsin (15.5%), and Idaho(15.5%). Since December 31, 1986, net gains in the number of sentencedprisoners have averaged about 1,039 prisoners per week -- aweekly gain of about 946 State prisoners and 94 Federal prisonersper week over the period. The largest net gains have occurred inte South (344 inmates per week) followed by the West (223), theMidwest (202), and the Northeast (176). During 1992, the averagegrowth in the number of sentenced State and Federal prisoners wasequal to a demand for 1,103 additional bedspaces per week, abut139 more than the average weekly growth in 1991. In 1992 the 10 States with the largest prison populationsaccounted for 52% of the total prison population nationwide --California, New York, and Texas accounting for over 25%.Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate with 478 prisonersper 100,000 esidents. Male prisoner population grows at a faster pace The number of male inmates (833,184) increased at a fasterrate during 1992 (7.3%) than the number of female inmates(50,409, 5.9%). The rate of incarceration for sentenced males(636 per 100,000 males in the resident population) was over 18times higher han for sentenced females (35 per 100,000 females inthe resident population). At the end of 1992, women accounted for5.7% of all prisoners nationwide. Overall, the 1992 growth rate (5.9%) for female inmates wasless than the 1991 growth rate (8.4%). The growth rate declinedin the Northeast, from 14.6% in 1991 to 1.7% in 1992, and in theSouth, from 10.0% to 3.6%. These declines in 1992 offset thehighr growth rates in the Midwest and West. Percent increase in female inmate population 1991-92 1990-91 U.S. total 5.9% 8.4% Federal 13.2% 12.8% State 5.0% 7.8% Northeast 1.7 14.6 Midwest 8.2 7.6 South 3.6 10.0 West 7.0 .4 In 1992, 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federalsystem had more than 500 female inmates. Among thesejurisdictions, 8 had increases of at least 10%, led by Colorado'sincrease of 16.3% (from 453 in 1991 to 527 in 1992). The Federalprison sstem's increase during 1992, 745 inmates, accounted for26.4% of the nationwide increase of 2,826. Local jails held more than 18,000 because of State prisoncrowding At the end of 1992, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of18,191 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilitiesbecause of crowding in State facilities (table 7). Four States,Louisiana, New Jersey, Virginia, and Tennessee, accounted foralmost 60 of the prisoners sentenced to prison but incarceratedlocally. Four States, Louisiana, West Virginia, New Jersey, andMississippi, held more than 10% of their prison populationlocally. Overall, 2.1% of the State prison population wasconfined in local ails on December 31, 1992, because of prisoncrowding. Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficultto determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measuresfor defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is inuse among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity mayrflect both available space to house inmates and the ability tostaff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of theNation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to threemeasures for yearend -- rated, operational, and design capaciies.These measures were defined as follows: Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by arating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can beaccommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, andservices. Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners orarchitects intended for the facility. Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied ratedcapacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 35 submitteddesign capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity andmeasures of the relationship to population are based on thehighest and lwest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-fourjurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figurefor each capacity measure they reported.) Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operateefficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintainedand repaired periodically, special housing is needed forprotective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may beneeded to cope with mergencies. At the end of 1992, 11 Statesreported they were operating at 95% or below their highestcapacity. Forty-three jurisdictions and the Federal prison systemreported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity. At the end of 1992, the Federal system was estimated to beoperating at 52% over capacity. State prisons were estimated tobe operating at 118% of their highest capacities and 131% oftheir lowest capacities. Rise in prison population linked to changes in prisonadmissions Underlying the dramatic growth in the State prison populationduring the 1980's were changes in the composition of prisonadmissions. Since 1977 the relative sizes of the two principalsources of admissions to prison, court commitments and returnedconditonal release violators, have changed. Court commitmentsaccount for a decreasing share of all prison admissions: 68.0% in1991, down from 84.3% in 1977 (table 10). As a percentage of alladmissions, those returning to prison after a conditional releasemre than doubled, from 14.5% to 30.5%. These conditional releaseviolators had originally left prison as parolees, mandatoryreleases, and other types of releases involving communtysupervision. The absolute number of conditional release violators returnedto prison grew 7-fold, from 19,617 in 1977 to 142,100 in 1991,while the number of new court commitments nearly tripled, from114,230 to 317,237. Overall, the increase in the number ofconditioal release violators accounted for more than a third ofthe growth in the total admissions to State prisons. An increasing percentage of court commitments sentenced fordrug offenses In 1990, the latest year for which data are available, thenumber of new court commitments for drug offenses reached arecord high, an estimated 103,800. For the first time, the numberof persons admitted for drug offenses was greater than the numberadmited for property offenses (102,400), violent offenses(87,200), or public-order offenses (26,200). An estimated 32.1%of all new court commitments in 1990 were drug offenders, up from11.5% in 1977 (figure 2). In 1990 an estimated 31.7% wereproperty offnders; 27.0%, violent offenders; and 8.1%,public-order offenders. The increase in drug offenders admittedto prison accounted for more than 40% of the total growth in newcourt commitments since 1977. Growth in the number of persons arrested for drug lawviolations and an increase in the rate of incarceration for drugoffenses account for the change in the prison offensedistribution. Between 1977 and 1990, the estimated number ofadult arrests for dru law violations increased by 104.4%, from493,300 to 1,008,300 (table 11). Compounding the impact of moredrug arrests, the rate of drug offenders sent to State prisonrose from 27 per 1,000 adult arrests for drug violations in 1977to 103 admissions per ,000 in 1990. An increasing number of arrests and a rise in the probabilityof incarceration for serious crimes Growth in the prison population was not solely the result ofmore commitments of drug offenders. Between 1977 and 1990 thenumber of persons admitted to prison for selected seriousoffenses, such as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, sexualassault, robbey, aggravated assault, and burglary, also rose bymore than 50,000. Regardless of the type of offense, the number of adultsarrested and the ratio of prison admissions to arrests increasedbetween 1977 and 1990. The total number of arrests for seriouscrimes rose by 48.8%, from 592,400 to 881,300, while the ratio ofpriso admissions to adult arrests for these crimes increased from121 commitments per 1,000 arrests to 143. Although the prisoncommitment ratio was higher in 1990 than in 1977, it changed fromyear-to-year: increasing from 1978 to 1984, fluctuating between195 and 1988, and then increasing after 1988. Although the number of persons admitted to prison grew foreach of the five selected serious offenses, increases in thenumber arrested for aggravated assault and in the probability ofincarceration for burglary accounted for much of the totalgrowth. Growth in the number of arrests for aggravated assaultaccounted for more than two-thirds of the total increase inarrests for serious crimes. In 1990 an estimated 410,800 adultswere arrested for aggravated assault, up from 209,300 in 1977.When combine with an increase in the probability of going toprison from 32 per 1,000 arrests to 56 per 1,000, aggravatedassault accounted for nearly a third of the total increase inprison admissions for serious offenses. A rise in the prison admissions to arrest ratio for burglaryaccounted for an additional 24% of the total increase in prisonadmissions for serious offenses. While the annual number ofadults arrested for burglary grew by 42,000 between 1977 and1990, thenumber of admissions to prison per 1,000 arrestsincreased from 115 to 160. At least 13,000 more admissions toprison for burglary occurred in 1990 than in 1977 because of thehigher rate of imprisonment.

The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for the survey. Lawrence A. Greenfeld Acting Director By Allen J. Beck, Ph.D. Thomas P. Bonczar and Darrell K. Gilliard BJS Statisticians At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity. The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a third of all jails. Local officials administer these facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 hours but usually for less than 1 year. Other survey findings include: *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on June 30, 1992. *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic inmates of other races, 1%. *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the year was 2,527. *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the country. One-day counts On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were juveniles. As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, see Methodology, page 5.) Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + times, from 160,863 to 444,584. The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year for which data are available, the incarceration rate for blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. Average daily population The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the number in 1991; during the same period, the female average daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. Adult conviction status At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail because they had violated the conditions of their probation or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. Demographic characteristics Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women residing in the United States were in a local jail on June 30, 1992. White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. Daily population movements On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting practices, see Methodology.) Occupancy The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. Facilities with the largest average daily populations reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20 inmates.

Jurisdictions with large jail populations Characteristics In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time of the 1988 Census of Jails. Population of large Number jail jurisdictions of large June 30, Daily average jurisdictions 1992 1991-92 Region All 503 362,217 356,471 Northeast 85 68,026 68,384 Midwest 91 44,514 43,329 South 229 152,061 147,644 West 98 97,616 97,114 Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814 separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number of inmates in large jurisdictions. Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total average daily population in large jurisdictions. 25 largest jail jurisdictions Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a decrease of 2,136 inmates. On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 inmates, 9% of the national total. Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. Inmates held for other authorities Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, 1992. Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down from 135 in 1991. Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy rate, from 104% to 105%. Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under court order to limit population or to correct a specific condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or more conditions of confinement: Number of Large jurisdictions conditions with a facility cited by a court under court order 1 63 2-3 33 4-5 11 6 or more 50 Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility under court order in 1992 were cited for six or more conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities or services (57), and staffing (53). Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they operated. Within some counties other agencies may have operated similar types of programs). These programs are defined as follows: boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and personal appearance. Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the day and return to jail at night. Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail facility by use of an electronic signalling device or programmed contact device attached to a telephone. House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in their own residence except for medical reasons and employment but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a correctional official one or more times daily. On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were participating in the program. Among inmates in all large jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot camp. Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates to be included in the midyear count because they are not in physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility but would if not for these programs. Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic monitoring was the most widely available and had the most participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types of alternative programs, such as community service and weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other alternatives. About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions combined. Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the largest number of jail inmates in daily work release programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 work release participants. Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) participating in some type of alternative program. Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an alternative-to-incarceration program. Drug testing The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. Selected jail programs In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of programs. Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these jurisdictions were participating in an education program at the time of the survey. Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate participation rate was lower than 10%. Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 jail inmates were participating in these programs. Inmate deaths A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or undetermined causes, 7%. Methodology The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under contract for local governments. The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional authority that administers one or more local jails. The jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the survey because the average daily inmate population in these jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June 30, 1992. The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. The response rate was 99% for all jails. For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and conviction status and for the average daily population during the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail populations provided counts of inmates held for other authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. Sampling error National estimates have an associated sampling error because jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples that could have been selected using the same sample design could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an estimate from a particular sample approximates the average result of all possible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine whether statistical significance could be associated with observed differences between values. Differences were tested to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. Measures of population Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate population balances out any extraordinary events that may render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an annual basis. Population movement In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers within jail systems have been removed from counts of admissions and discharges and included with a combined estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of this movement. Juveniles State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years, and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority even if tried as adults in criminal court. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 requires sight and sound separation from adults for those juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in accordance with these guidelines is not available. This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared under the general direction of Lawrence A. Greenfeld. James Stephan reviewed the statistics. Tom Hester edited the report.

Jail Inmates 1992 August 1993 NCJ-143284 Full text with tables available from: Bureau of Justice Statistics Clearinghouse 800-732-3277 Box 179 Annapolis Junction, MD. 20701-0179 In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual Survey of Jails collected information from the large jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug testing. The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for the survey. Lawrence A. Greenfeld Acting Director By Allen J. Beck, Ph.D. Thomas P. Bonczar and Darrell K. Gilliard BJS Statisticians At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity. The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a third of all jails. Local officials administer these facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 hours but usually for less than 1 year. Other survey findings include: *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on June 30, 1992. *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic inmates of other races, 1%. *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the year was 2,527. *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the country. One-day counts On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were juveniles. As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, see Methodology, page 5.) Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + times, from 160,863 to 444,584. The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year for which data are available, the incarceration rate for blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. Average daily population The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the number in 1991; during the same period, the female average daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. Adult conviction status At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail because they had violated the conditions of their probation or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. Demographic characteristics Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women residing in the United States were in a local jail on June 30, 1992. White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. Daily population movements On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting practices, see Methodology.) Occupancy The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. Facilities with the largest average daily populations reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20 inmates.

Jurisdictions with large jail populations Characteristics In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time of the 1988 Census of Jails. Population of large Number jail jurisdictions of large June 30, Daily average jurisdictions 1992 1991-92 Region All 503 362,217 356,471 Northeast 85 68,026 68,384 Midwest 91 44,514 43,329 South 229 152,061 147,644 West 98 97,616 97,114 Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814 separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number of inmates in large jurisdictions. Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total average daily population in large jurisdictions. 25 largest jail jurisdictions Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a decrease of 2,136 inmates. On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 inmates, 9% of the national total. Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. Inmates held for other authorities Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, 1992. Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down from 135 in 1991. Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy rate, from 104% to 105%. Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under court order to limit population or to correct a specific condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or more conditions of confinement: Number of Large jurisdictions conditions with a facility cited by a court under court order 1 63 2-3 33 4-5 11 6 or more 50 Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility under court order in 1992 were cited for six or more conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities or services (57), and staffing (53). Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they operated. Within some counties other agencies may have operated similar types of programs). These programs are defined as follows: boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and personal appearance. Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the day and return to jail at night. Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail facility by use of an electronic signalling device or programmed contact device attached to a telephone. House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in their own residence except for medical reasons and employment but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a correctional official one or more times daily. On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were participating in the program. Among inmates in all large jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot camp. Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates to be included in the midyear count because they are not in physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility but would if not for these programs. Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic monitoring was the most widely available and had the most participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types of alternative programs, such as community service and weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other alternatives. About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions combined. Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the largest number of jail inmates in daily work release programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 work release participants. Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) participating in some type of alternative program. Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an alternative-to-incarceration program. Drug testing The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. Selected jail programs In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of programs. Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these jurisdictions were participating in an education program at the time of the survey. Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate participation rate was lower than 10%. Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 jail inmates were participating in these programs. Inmate deaths A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or undetermined causes, 7%. Methodology The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under contract for local governments. The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional authority that administers one or more local jails. The jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the survey because the average daily inmate population in these jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June 30, 1992. The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. The response rate was 99% for all jails. For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and conviction status and for the average daily population during the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail populations provided counts of inmates held for other authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. Sampling error National estimates have an associated sampling error because jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples that could have been selected using the same sample design could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an estimate from a particular sample approximates the average result of all possible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine whether statistical significance could be associated with observed differences between values. Differences were tested to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. Measures of population Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate population balances out any extraordinary events that may render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an annual basis. Population movement In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers within jail systems have been removed from counts of admissions and discharges and included with a combined estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of this movement. Juveniles State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years, and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority even if tried as adults in criminal court. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 requires sight and sound separation from adults for those juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in accordance with these guidelines is not available. This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, and Darrell K. Gilliard.
