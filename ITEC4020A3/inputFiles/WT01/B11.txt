It wasn't until 1892 that it got the name NSU. Motorcycles werefirst produced in 1901. Cars and trucks were produced from 1905 throughthe end of the 1920s. In 1955 it was the largest motorcyclemanufacturer in the world. Early Research In 1951 contacts were established with Felix Wankel. Dr-Ing. Walter Froede was thefirst to visit. He was director of NSU's motorcycle racing program. Itwas his recommendation that led to NSU's collaboration with Wankel. Wankel's first work was on rotary valves and rotary superchargers.One of his designs was attached to a 50cc NSU motorcycle, boosting theair pressure 45psi to increase the horsepower to 13.5 bhp. This cycleset a world speed record for its class of 120 mph at the Bonneville saltflats. By 1953 Froede had become head of research and development. NSU'shead engineer was against rotary engine development, but a year laterWankel and Froede persuaded the board to allow engine research if Wankelwould share the patents and not receive any increase in consulting fees.Wankel was able to hire his long time associate, Ernst Höppner.After discarding a four-lobed design the three-lobed rotor in a twolobed epitrochoid [gloss] wasborn as the DKM 54. Early Success Testing began in January 1957. Unfortunately management hadpersonality conflicts with Wankel so he was not invited on February 1,1957 when the DKM 54 was fired up for the first time on the third try.The fuel was based on methanol. Gasoline was first used in April,yielding 15 bhp at 9000 rpm. The engine ran for two hours by theend of May at 21 bhp. By June 1958 it had survived a 100 hour test. Froede had the insight to perform a design inversion on the engine,resulting in the KKM category, which quicklycompletely dominated the field. Wankel did not like this variationbecause it was less smooth, and had more sealing problems since the apexseals experienced greater forces because the rotor orbited thestationary gear. However it had other advantages, not the least ofwhich was the engine did not have to be disassembled to change the sparkplugs (though the first KKM did have plugs in the rotor). Licensing Supports NSU The motorcycle industry was changing as incomes increased and carsbecame more affordable. NSU began adapting by introducing a twocylinder car in 1958. However, Wankel RCE licensing fees were animportant means of staying afloat. Curtiss-Wright became the firstlicensor on Oct. 21, 1958 and made a large commitment to the RCE. NSU was very astute in requiring license holders to share researchresults with all others (although GMobtained an exemption). This was important because there were onlyseven years between the first firing and the first productionautomobile. Plucky NSU and its licensors had to compete with about ahundred years of development of the reciprocating engine. Early on NSUwas shocked by how quickly Toyo Kogyo (Mazda)was developing engines. This spurred NSU on because Mazda did not haveto pay any fees until NSU offered a car for sale that could reliably run50,000 kilometres. NSU Spider 1964-1967 NSU road tested the Wankel in 1960 for the first time. Later thatyear they showed a preliminary version of the Spider, a descendant ofthe Sport Prinz at a Munich meeting of German engineers. Wankel spoketo the conference and won over the many skeptics in the audience. Displacement      1 x 497 ccHorsepower        50 bhp at 5000 rpm, 54 bhp at 6000 rpmTorque            52 lb-ft at 2500 rpm, 54 at 3000, 57 at 3500 rpmTop Speed         95 mph The Spider competed with the Austin Healey Sprite, which had 5 morehorses, but the same top speed. It was about 4 % more expensive thanthe Austin and 16 % more expensive than the Fiat 850 Spider. About 2375were produced, although figures of 3000 and 5000 have been reported. NSU Ro80 1968-1977 Development began in August 1961 and it was officially shown at the1967 Frankfurt Auto Show. Originally it was to have a two rotor enginewith 2 x 300 cc capacity. The design of the Ro80 was quite advanced for its time. It wasfront wheel drive. Suspension was fully independent. It had four-wheeldisk brakes with dual circuits as a safety feature. Aerodynamic dragcoefficient was 0.35, amazingly low for its time, though this wasultimately 0.39 with larger tires and cooling openings. Though weightdistribution was 63/37 front/rear it handled very well. Chief stylistwas Claus Luthe. About 33,900 were produced. A three rotor successor was beingreadied in 1969, but about this time NSU was swallowed by Volkwagen /Audi. Peter Hofbauer made a five chamber KKM which later became acompressor. His design is said to be the only RCE without a lowpressure stage to function as a diesel engine. Political intrigue,financial pressures and conservatism at VW snuffed out rotarydevelopment.

Felix Heinrich Wankel (1902-1988) Felix Wankel was born August 13, 1902 in Lahr in the Black Forest inGermany, an only child of Rudolf Wankel(1867-?), a senior forestry official (Grossh. Bad. Oberfoerster)subsequently killed by schrapnel at Dornach (Elsass (Alsace?)) in WorldWar I as an Oberleutnant, and Martha GertrudHeidlauff (1879-?). Dr. Wankel passed away on October 9, 1988,Lindau, W. Germany, where he did much of his research and whereWankel R&D is located. Wankel left school at the age of 19, but he gained academicrecognition within his own time when he was awarded an honorarydoctorate degree from Technische Universität München in 1969.His first job was apprenticing in sales for a publisher in Heidelberg,but he devoted his energy to tinkering, especially after losing thesales job in 1924. Wankel's first attempt to receive a patent was in 1926 for a "greaseturbine", but it was predated by an Enke design from 1886. In 1933 heapplied for a patent for a DKM engine, whichhe received in 1936. In the following years, Wankel mostly made his way by ingenious workon rotary valves and sealing technology for BMW, DVL, Junker, andDaimler-Benz. During this time he developed various DKM prototypes andalso rotary pumps and compressors. After the end of the war in 1945 his development was interrupted,but by 1951 he interested NSU in development. This lead tocollaboration with Walter Froede, head of the motorcycle racing program,who would ultimately make the decision to adopt the KKM type. The first truly functional Wankel rotary engine was a DKM type thatran in February 1957. By May a prototype was able to run for two hoursand produce 21 bhp. The first KKM engine ran on July 7, 1958. There are Felix-Wankel-Strasse streets in Heilbronn, Dachau, andNeckarsulm, all in Germany. Dr. Wankel had a strong impulse towards animal welfare. What is the Felix Wankel TierschutzForschungspreis? I think this an Animal Protection Research Prizeawarded in 1995, 10/95,and 1996. An "Encyclopedia" entry.

The RCE Eccentric Shaft [gloss] supercedes the piston engine'scrankshaft and connecting rods. The RCE Peripheral Housing [gloss] supercedes the piston engine'scylinder. Intake and exhaust ports [gloss]in the housings eliminate valves, camshafts, and timing belts. The Housing shape is an epitrochoid [gloss] curve (more properly,peritrochoid) [gloss]. It isgenerated by rolling a circle around another circle. The rolling circleis half the size of the generating circle. Drexel provides an extendeddiscussion of the mathematicsof the epitrochoid curve and the rotor shape. Java Demonstration of Generating anEpitrochoid (about 44 KB) The Wankel RC Engine is an Otto Cycle Engine (Four "Stroke") Java Demonstration of RC EngineCycles (about 104 KB) There are two main types of RCE KKM Kreiskolbenmotor orplanetary rotation motor (PLM), distinguished by one stationaryperipheral housing. The rotor moves in an orbit and propels aneccentric shaft. This is easier to manufacture, cool, and maintain thanDKM. Intake and exhaust passages are better. Better cooling isachievable. It is more compact. Modern rotaries are KKM types. DKM Drehkolben Maschine orsingle-rotation engine (SIM), the first RCE, has the distinctive featureof an inner rotating housing and rotor moving in circular motion arounda fixed central shaft. This requires disassembling the motor to changespark plugs, perhaps the main reason it was discarded. However, DKM isthe smoothest of the two, and high rates beyond 25,000 rpm are possible.Bearing loads are lighter. The rotary combustion engine must not be confused with "rotary"aircraft engines which are piston cylinders arranged in a circle. Thewhole engine rotates. Advantages Light weight and compact. Smooth: no reciprocating motion. Extended power "stroke" rotation of the output shaft: 270 degreesvs. the 180 degrees of a piston. Fewer moving parts: no valves, connecting rods, cams, timingchains. Intake and exhaust timing are accomplished directly by themotion of the rotor. Flat torque curve because no valves are used. Cooler combustion means fewer oxides of nitrogen. Catalyticconverters lessen this advantage. Separation of combustion region from intake region is good forhydrogen fuel. Disadvantages High surface to volume ratio in combustion chamber is less thermodynamically efficient. The Wankel's long and narrow chambermakes for long flame travel, but this is countered by the Mazda'stwo spark plugs (three on some racing engines). Higher fuel consumption. Thus Mazda hasbeen successful with the RX-7 sports car, a marketwhere fuel consumption is less of an issue. Only 16 years after thefirst engine ran, the 1973 oil crisis devastated the RCE before it hadsufficiently developed to become more economical. History of Rotary Machines Designs for rotary engines were proposed as early as 1588 byRamelli, though it took the development of the Otto cycle engine in 1876and the advent of the automobile in 1896 to set the stage for a properrotary combustion engine. Other early designs were made by Huygens in 1673 and Kepler. JamesWatt made a rotary piston steam engine in 1759. Wankel engines use cycloidal gearing, an old and unusual form ofgearing used in watches, Roots blowers, screw compressors, and pumps. Wankel Home | => Recent Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr.

A fibreglass model is approved in June 1971 by GMPres. Ed Cole [4]. On Jan. 14, 1972, a chassis was shipped to Pininfarina, Turin, Italyso that the body could be constructed by the famed design studio [4].In June of the same year, a 2 rotor Corvette with a steel body wasviewed by GM management [4, 5]. The same year GM commissioned atwo-rotor version of the XP-882 and built it as the XP-987GT [2]. In January 1973, a Corvette body was built for an experimentfour-rotor car [4]. By April, the GALCIT wind tunnel in California wasused to test the aerodynamic qualities of the 4-rotor Corvette [4]. InSeptember 13, 1973 a 266 ci two-rotor Corvette was shown in Frankfurt,Germany [1, 3]. The four-rotor 390 ci Corvette was shown at Paris,France on Oct. 4, 1973, as well as the two-rotor [1]. On September 24, 1974, GM Pres. Ed Cole postponed the introductionof the Wankel engine, ostensibly due to emissions difficulties [6]. Heretired the same month. The 74 Chevy Vega was originally planned for a rotary engine. Thiswas delayed to 1975, but this was dropped in 1974. The engine was a tworotor water cooled with oil cooling of the rotors. There was a singlespark plug per rotor. The housings were all iron. A GM rotary was going to be used for theAmerican Motors Pacer. This allowed a flattened hood and radicalstyling.

His father died when he was three years old. Atthe age of 13 he got a job in a blacksmith shop in Osaka. At the age of20, in 1894 he started his own shop and employed 50 workers, but arecession drove him out of business. He tried again eleven years laterin converted cow shed. His eldest son, Tsuneji (1897?-1971), pumped airfor the furnace. Jujiro Matsuda invented and patented a pump. It sold well, so heformed the Matsuda Pump Partnership. He was edged out a few years laterwhen the company was taken over. In 1912 Jujiro formed Matsuda Works. In one year it employed 4000workers to produce four million artillery fuses for the Russian Czar'sgovernment. Then it became Japan Armament Manufacturing Company.Later he left to create a new Matsuda Works in Hiroshima. Nihon SteelManufacuring Co. took this over. Toyo Kogyo 1920, 1927 A group of investors including Matsuda took over a failing Abemakitree cork company in January 1920, naming it Toyo Cork Kogyo CompanyLimited. Toyo means Orient and Kogyo means industry. Jujiro becamepresident the next year. In September 1927, Matsuda reformed the company as Toyo Kogyo Kaisha(Company) Limited to grow out of Cork and into industrial production. Atest run of 30 motorcycles were manufactured in 1930 or earlier, sinceone of them won a race that year. Mazda Type DA Motorized Tricycle Truck 1931 Ahura Mazda is the Zoroastran lord of light, creator of theuniverse. The name is also very close to Matsuda. Toyo Kogyosuccessfully produced these 500cc three wheelers with differentialtransmissions beginning in 1931. A small passenger sedan protoype wasmade in 1940, but this had to be abandoned. Recovery after Atom Bomb The atom bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, but the company wasfortunate that less than half of the plant was destroyed. In 1950 ToyoKogyo produced the Type CT three-wheeler with 1157 cc V twin (32 bhp).This was very successful. In May 1960 the R360 air cooled coupe wasintroduced with a 356 cc two cylinder rear mounted engine. In 1962there was the 358 cc four cylinder Carol sedan. 1963 saw the model800 and Familia four with front engines and rear drive. Jujiro's son Tenuji became President of the Company in 1951. Jujiropassed away in March 1952. Tsuneji succumbed to a lung inflammation in1971. His son Kohei succeeded him until he stepped down in 1977. In 1984 the company name was changed to Mazda MotorCorporation. Mazda has assembly plants in 21 countries and exports to120 countries.

In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previousyear's total. More than 92 percent had rotary engines. The next year,after the gas crisis had made its impact felt, Mazda sold only 61,192cars in the US. Addresses Greeting Mazda is the nameof the pages from Mazda Motor Corporation itself in Japan.

One of the biggest remainingquestions is when to start. Mazda says timing of the launch hinges on agovernment program to develop a hydrogen fuel distributionnetwork. Japan's MITI reportedly aims to have infrastructure in place tosupport widespread use of hydrogen as a transport fuel by 2010. Mazdaclaims its hydrogen vehicle - based on a Wankel rotary engine - has arange of 230 km and a top speed of 150 km/hr. By comparison, theautomaker says, electric vehicles typically can travel no more than 180km without recharging and achieve top speeds of 130 km/hr, whilegasoline fueled cars have ranges as high as 590 km and top speeds of 183km/hr. Oil and Gas Journal, Jan. 8,1996 Newsletter. The Search for Low-pollution Vehicles Continues Mazda has begun a two year trial period for its experimentallow-pollution hydrogen rotary engine (RE) vehicle. The Cappella Cargovan model vehicle will burn a hydrogen fuel that when burned will notemit carbon dioxide. Mazda will lend thevehicle to the Hirohata Steel Mill for use as their company van anddriven for at least 20,000 kilometers. Asian Business Daily August 22, 1995. Fuel of the Future To: [rx7@world.std.com]Date: Sat, 12 Nov 1994 11:19:08 -0800From: monito@ (Alan Marr)Subject: Hydrogen Rotaries: the facts Mazda Hydrogen fueled cars have all been rotaries: HR-X1  not hydride, 2 seat, spacy commuter look.HR-X2  metal hydride, 4 seat, dowdy.MX-5   metal hydride, Miata body, front twin rotor, rear drive. Hydrogen has a low ignition temperature so the standard four strokeengine is prone to pre-detonation and backfiring through the intakeports. The rotary engine separates the intakeports from the combustion area so there are no hot spots in the intakephase. The hydrogen Miata is 400 kg (880 lb) heavier than the standard car.This is partly because a 300 kg (660 lb) H2 fuel tank replaces thestandard 50 kg (110 lb) for a full gasoline tank.Thus it is encouraging that it performs as well as it does.Intriguingly, the prototype has a left side driver (US). Mazda alsohas an electric prototype using fuel cells, also with a 400 kgincrease in weight. MX-5 is the international designation of Miata.

The view from the driver's seat: Inside the hydrogen car, everything is standard apart from a small pressure instrument - the fuel gauge... Starting the hydrogen car is no different from starting the petrol model, and engine noise sounds familiar too. ... the intake system combines a pre-mix air/fuel system for light load driving... There is also a direct-injection system through a dedicated hydrogen port which opens when the air intake port is closed. This is effective in increasing available power for higher speed driving... When the fuel pressure gets low, the power drops noticeably and the car slows dramatically. Changing down the gears makes little or no appreciable difference and even with 20 percent pressure available, the car is effectively unable to carry on. Refuelling these prototypes takes about 15 minutes from start to finish. The electric car is completely different... There is very little engine braking so you have to start using the brakes much earlier than normal. And the engine is virtually silent, which make tire and wind noise much more apparent. Battery technology is holding up the whole electric car movement: development has failed to produce a satisfactory alternative to nickel cadmium batteries (like those in the Mazda) or the standard lead acid type which cause so many of the problems. They make electric cars heavy, expensive, and poor performers, with very few miles possible between each lengthy charge-up. Mazda is investing much more heavily in hydrogen research thanelectricity. Seiji Tanaka, head of Mazda R&D, says Our first objective is to use available fuels more efficiently by producing better engines. At present we are researching the Miller cycle and developing lean-burn technology. Our second objective is to investigate alternative fuels such as natural gas and methanol and electric cars. But this will not cut pollution. Hydrogen offers many advantages over all these, especially electric cars, and with the rotary fuelled by hydrogen, performance is very close to the petrol engine. Japan's MITI is sponsoring the New Sunshine Project. The goal is touse hydrogen power "to replace 3 percent of electrical power, 10percent of city gas use and 5 percent of transportation energy supplyby 2010". Mazda is trying to convince the California Air Resources Board toadmit the hydrogen rotary as a Zero Emission vehicle. The issue isthe tiny amounts of hydrocarbon output because of the enginelubricant. Hydrogen faces infrastructure hurdles and public concern over safety.Metal hydrides are a safe mobile storage method. Hydrogen is in someways safer than gasoline since the vapour rises into the atmosphereand doesn't collect on the ground. Reference: "Fuel of the Future" Complete Car, August 1994, p. 72-75. HRX-2 at 30th Tokyo Motor Show Mazda's HRX-2 "is powered by a hydrogen burning rotary engine andhas a virutally 100% recyclable body structure. It's been developedwith the potential to use liquid-crystal polymer fibre-reinforcedplastic. This plastic is in the process of further research forpractical use. The plastic-made upper-body can be easily detached fromthe metal chassis. The electrical and control systems are integratedinto one area. Therefore, this structure makes it easier to disassemblethe body and to sort, by material make-up. The HRX-2 is an updatedversion of the HR-X which was exhibited at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show.it has improvements in driving performance and cruising range." Quoted from the page on MazdaMotor Corporation. Mazda Motor Corp is already bench-testing a Miata equipped with ahydrogen-powered rotary engine as part of its bid to be the firstautomobile manufacturer to market a hydrogen-powered vehicle. Mazdaexpects the vehicle to have a one-tank range of 248 miles, which istwice as long as that of the HR-X concept car shown at the 1991 TokyoMotor Show. The hydrogen-powered rotary engine is also being tested inMazda's Capella Cargo wagon. Automotive News, Sept 13, 1993 n5517 p14(1). Cited byrnavarro@mcgraw-hill.com, 23 Jun 1995.

WVU's NAFTP-Hydrogen Review This reviewprovides a good overview of hydrogen as it can be applied to internalcombustion engines, but makes no specific mention of the RCE. The two following items are from Hydrogen Today, Vol. 4, No. 1,1993, official publication of the American HydrogenAssociation. Mazda Advances Environmentally-Correct HR-X: Powered by Hydrogen The refined Mazda HR-X shown above is a concept car that runs onpure, renewable hydrogen, and emits primarily only water vapor. It hasbeen improved since its original debut in 1991 by Mazda engineers toimprove its performance and increase its fuel efficiency. The Mazdavehicle shows that hydrogen can be safely used as a fuel. The metal hydride tank is shown being fueled below, with onehydrogen fuel line, and two lines which run cooling water through thetank. During refueling, the metal hydride in the tank warms as itabsorbs hydrogen, and the water cools it to allow more to beabsorbed. When the engine is running, the warm engine coolant water iscirculated through the tank to warm the metal hydride, causing thehydrogen fuel to be released. Unlike piston-engines, the rotary engine has separate intake andcombustion chambers. This allows the rotary engine to avoid thebackfiring and preignition problems that other engines have experienced.The rotor draws the air and hydrogen in as it passes the top of thecycle, then moves the mixture to the lower right and compresses it,where it is ignited to drive the engine. The HR-X hydrogen car's rotary engine delivers 100 horsepower, whichis nearly the same as the original RX-7. Thisconcept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, and auto shows in New Yorkand Los Angeles, has generated much excitement and public awareness ofhydrogen as a fuel with today's technology. Mazda's break ahead of theother auto companies is truly an advancement to the solar hydrogenindustry. Remarks at Solar Hydrogen Industrial Workshop at UCLA, Ca, Feb. 8,1993 Vahe Kluejian, Manager of Research, Mazda Motor Company: Mazda developed the hydrogen fueled rotary engine as an option tomeet new emission standards. The rotary engine is more difficult toreduce emissions in, except with hydrogen. With the oncoming ZEV,hydrogen is the future fuel. Mazda plans to use metal hydrides or anynonliquid for safety. Their main problem has been convincing regulatorsthat hydrogen is viable. Mazda has built three test vehicles, and moreare being built for real-world standards for fleet testing anddemonstration. Mazda's hydrogen car can be made commercial in 1998-2000per the ZEV specification. Research in New Zealand Interesting research has been conducted at the MechanicalEngineering Department at the University ofCanterbury, New Zealand in the Fuels andCombustion Research Group: "Hydrogen fuelling of a rotary engine. Designed to overcome fuellingrelated problems in the reciprocating engine, and combustion relatedproblems in the fossil fuel firing of rotary engines." Rotary Engine that Uses Hydrogen and Steam (Water) Wolf Brinsbury reports by way of Gary Hawkins on a proposed rotaryengine from New Zealand that burns a little hydrogen and injectswater which gets converted to steam with a great increase in pressure. An astounding number of articles and reports (2,651) are abstractedat the Center forAlternative Transportation Fuels. An interesting article was written Brett Pirie in 1994 at BoulderValley School District. Wankel Home | => Mazda Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedApril 5, 1996.

The first prototype was completed in1977. It was introduced to America as a 79 model on April 24, 1978since production began in March (brochure (heavygraphics)). A slogan Mazda used was "It's the real thing. A sports carwith all the traditional virtues and then some." One magazine'sheadline was "The Rotary Revolution has begun". Thus began Mazda'spassion for pure sport cars that has continued through three generationsand includes the Miata and RX-01. The 12A engine (2 x 573 = 1146 cc) had two side intake ports and oneperipheral exhaust port per rotor. There was a thermal reactor.Transmissions were four and five speed manual and three speed auto. American models were two seaters only, though a 2+2 was offered inJapan due to relaxed crash standards. A good rundown ofmodels from the first generation is available from the Bay Area RX-7club. Copyright Dave Rock S Model (Base) GS Model P642 The P designates "production". Upgraded interior materials.Production changed October, 1979. P815 It appeared in August 1980. The rear and tail lights were redesignedeliminating the "Baroque depression". Front bumper, air dam changed.The Japanese variant had rotor inspired aluminum wheels. GSL Model This began in 1980 (part of P815 run) as the "Leather Sport", 2500units, and became the GSL in 1981. Series II In 1981 they were restyled, most visibly in the rear. P130 An stop-gap version appeared in July 1982, the P130, with an improvedengine for better fuel economy. A high output audio system was an option.It was called "Black Dynamite". P132 or GSL-SE Model 84-85 The SE saw the re-introduction of the 13B engine, last seen in the 1978RX-4, but now rated at 135 bhp because of Dynamic Effect Intake (DEI),six port induction (2 by 3), and electronic fuel injection. In Japan,there was a P132 with a 12A turbocharged engine. Power steering wasoffered for the first time. The interior was upgraded, but this didnot appear in the Japanese turbo version. Second Generation 1986-1991 First Half 86-88 The 13B engine was the only size offered. Power was increased to146 bhp. The Turbo II engine had 182 bhp. Turbo II courtesy Ben Burton Second Half 89-91 These are distinguishable by a return to round tail lights. Underthe hood, horsepower was increased by 10 %. Third Generation 1993 to Present The RX-7 was Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year. Theengine comes in one version only, sequential twin turbo. The 93 RX-7 easily sustained 112-135 mph on the German Autobahn forover 200 miles, getting 11.6 mpg. When speed was lowered below 113 mph,economy was raised to 14 mpg. Much has been written about the RX-7 and there are many RX-7 pages.I have annotated some of them. Wankel Home | => RX-4 Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updated May16, 1996.

NSU and Citroën formed a companycalled Comobil in 1964 or 65. In 1967 they set up Comotor S.A. inLuxembourg. In 1970 some Citroën M35s were made which used an NSUKKM 500 engine in modified Ami 8s. They have hydraulic suspension likethe GS and 49 hp for a top speed of 144 kmh (89 mph) (compare this withthe Ami 8's 123 kmh or the 1973 Ami Super's 140 kmh). 212 were made in1970 and 49 in 1971. GS Birotor: Citroën GS Birotor with a KKM 622 (107 bhp). Thiswas first shown at the 1973 Frankfurt automobile show. I think this mayhave had the Berline body style. They had a top speed of 175 kmh from107 DIN hp (vs. 151 kmh, 60 hp for GS). 834 were built in 1974, 31 in1975. A Van Veen OCR 1000 used a 100 bhp Comotor engine, probably theKKM 622, in 1974. It had a top speed of 150 mph. A net correspondent wrote: There was a review in one of the car magazines last year[1991] of a Citroën GS Rotary. Citroën bought most of themback to avoid having to carry spares (they'd made about 600) but a fewescaped. The test was against an NSU Ro80and involved driving to Reims and back [to England presumably]. Thereare rumours of a three-rotor CX. If anyone has information about this rumour please email wankel@monito.com. Citroën fans will enjoy Bo Peterson'spage and the Citroen Linkspage. They are well supplied with references to many Citroën sites,including BlairAnderson's and J. Cats'Citroën galleries. The Citroën Quarterly v10 n3 p17 has some informationon the M35. In the Sixties, Renault was working on designs ofits own, in order to avoid NSU licensing fees. The rotors had fourlobes in a five chambered housing. In a departure from the simplicityof the Wankel rotary, they used tenpoppet valves. Wankel Home | => Corvette Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedApril 5, 1996.

It's a wonderful book with allsorts of interesting data and tons of great pictures. If you want tolearn more about your car and about the RX-7family and how exactly the rotary engine came about, you might wantto grab this book. It's interesting how the [first] Wankel engine wasdesigned to run smoothly at 25,000 rpm's but wasn't practical becausethe engine had to be disassembled to change thespark plugs. Anyway, The book covers everything from July 1, 1958when the first rotary engine ran [KKM], to the GM rotary, all the way thru to the 1994 RX-7 R2.

The drivers were Terada, Downing, and Freon. The car was haltedfor five hours in a pit stop at the 13th hour (the results indicate"refuelling", but that doesn't make sense). Results can be viewed at the official web site in French, English, and Japanese. Mazda Wins 59th Le Mans, 1991 The Mazda 787B won overall the 59th 24 Hours of Le Mans (24 Heuresde Le Mans) on June 22-23, 1991, at the Sarthe circuit, Le Mans, France.Mazda was the first Japanese winner of therace, and the only winner with a rotary engine. The winners (JohnnyHerbert, Bertrand Gachot, and Volker Weidler) drove 362 laps and 4923.2km (3059.1 miles), 27.2 km ahead of the second place car. The averagespeed was 205.3 kph. They lead from lap 320 to the end (the last threehours). In 1990, FISA decided that starting in 1992 no RCE engines would beallowed. The R 26B engine that won was normally aspirated and had four rotorsand three sequential spark plugs per rotor. It produced 700 bhp at 9000rpm and 62 mkg torque at 6500 rpm (448 lb-ft). Fuel was electronicallyinjected and consumption was 51.881 liters per 100 km at an averagespeed of 213.58 kph (excluding pit stops). The air intakes hadcontinuously variable geometry controlled by the engine electronics.The transmission had 5 speeds (full synchromesh) from a Porsche designgearbox and a limited slip differential.The Mazda 787B car weighed 830 kg (1831 lb). The chassis was designedby Nigel Stroud and the body was carbon fibre. Wheelbase was 2.66 m by1.53/1.50 m and overall size 4.78 by 1.99 m. It had 18 in wheels,ventilated carbon fibre brakes.

Daimler-Benz made several Rotary CombustionEngine (RCE) prototypes from1962 into the early 70s. Some were developed for small sedans, but theone of most spectacular vehicles ever to flaunt a rotary was thetwo-seat C111, complete with gull-wing doors. The engine was placedmid-ship. Sixteen prototypes were built. The C111 had three- and four-rotor engines, first shown in 1969 and1970, respectively. The three-rotor could generate 280 bhp and move thecar 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds. The latter developed as much as 400horsepower, though it was usually tuned for the street at 305horsepower. There were interesting innovations such as a variablelength intake and an anti-lock braking system (ABS). The car was aheavy 2900 pounds, but was capable of 185 mph and 0-60 mph in less than5 seconds. The project was headed by Dr Hans Liebold. It ultimately fellvictim to the oil crisis and a timid board with a "not-invented-here"attitude. This was a shame because the cars were unfailingly reliable. As of 1990, Daimler-Benz was the main supporter of TES, Wankel's research institute. Wankel Home | => Aircraft Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedApril 24, 1996.

Motorcycles were built as early as 1907 and winningraces. By 1913 it had become Norton Motors Ltd and was makingmotorcycles in Birmingham, England. Norton's involvement with rotary combustionengines began with the amalgamation of Norton-Villiers andBSA-Triumph to form Norton-Villiers-Triumph (NVT) in 1973. TheBirmingham Small Arms Co., Ltd., (BSA) had obtained an NSU license in July 1972 a Wankel project codenamed P41.They had built a Fichtels &Sachs motor into a Victor frame for testing. In 1974 through 1976 financial troubles almost scuttled NVT. TheP41 project was then located at the Shenstone, Lichfield, Staffordshirefacilities. Around 1977 work was moved to Birmingham to an experimentallaboratory. Norton Interpol II Motorcycle Norton Motors (1978) Ltd was formed in 1978 as a motorcycle division. Anumber of RCE prototypes had been shown to the press and receivedfavourably. 25 Mark I prototypes were built in 1979. In 1981 a Mark IIappeared, which eventually went into production as the Interpol II. 130machines were purchased by police forces in 1983. Additional units werebought by the British armed forces and the Royal Automobile Club.

In 1990 he won the MCN TT Superbike championship. Steve Spray first raced a Norton rotary in Oct. 1988. He won theFormula One race at Brands Hatch on a Saturday and the PowerbikeInternational on the Sunday. This was after riding it for the veryfirst time on the Friday. He also won the 1988 ACU 1300cc championship. The F1R was to be produced for race privateers. Initially 12 wereto be produced. Specs included racing callipers and discs, six gears,and magnesium alloy wheels. Price complete only £27,000. British Motorcycle Land Speed Record The record had been set in 1978 at 191 mph by Roy Daniels riding aTriumph with two engines and supercharging. In the autumn of 1990 an F1 race engine was installed in AlexMacfadzean's Penetrator streamlined motorcycle. Mike Booys rode it to191.89 mph for a new 750cc record. Unofficial runs were at 200 mph. Norton Aircraft and Target Drone Engines NR642: 90 bhp from 60 kg total weight with integrated reductiongearbox. Twin rotor by 294 cc gives 588 cc. At cruise, Specific fuelconsumption (SFC) of 0.51 lb / bhp per hour. Uses leaded or unleaded,Avgas or Mogas fuels. In field trials, 1989, when it was chosen by thejoint McDonnell Douglas / Development Sciences Corporation team as thebest engine for short range Remote Piloted Vehicles (RPV). This enginewas approved by the CAA for civilian passenger aircraft in December1990. During testing, the engine is run for 150 hours at 8000 rpm,disassembled, reassembled and run again for 150 hours. This is likedriving at a constant speed of 120 miles per hour for 35,000 miles withonly one stop. In 1990 Norton contracted Rogers Aviation in Cranfield, England, toinstall a Cessna 152 with an NR642 for testing. One was powering aSeabird Sentinel pusher prop light aircraft in 1989. Two were in anIvan Shaw TwinEze, cruising speed 175 knots, two pusher props of 53 indiameter. Ivan Shaw was GM of Aviation Composites Ltd, a former branchof the Lotus car company. NR622: similar to NR642, but has a lower prop line and a lightergearbox. 82 bhp. The latest model is the P62 which increases itsoutput to 90 bhp by using an exhaust ejector system of rotor cooling. NR731: 38 bhp from 10 kg (23 lb) constant speed engine. LowSpecific fuel consumption: 0.52 lb/bhp per hour at cruise. Air cooled.In production, 1989. Formerly P73. Was fitted into Banshee 300 RPVmilitary target drone. NR801: Ultra light and compact liquid cooled RPV engine. 294cc byone rotor. 40 bhp at 6000 rpm or 50 bhp at 75000 rpm, 23 kg includingintegrated 1.5 kw alternator. Was in pre-production in 1989. Norton Hovercraft. Bill Yates put a P60 engine for thrust and an NR731 for list into ahomebuilt one man hovercraft. The vehicle finished second in theBritish National Formula One championship, winning two more races thanthe champion. Norton's Demise In 1987 a group of investors headed by Philippe Le Roux took over,forming Norton Group PLC, mainly for the value of its properties. Whenthese turned out to be less than anticipated it was realized that theNorton name was irrevocably tied to motorcycles. Thus RCE motorcycleproduction was funded. In October 1989 Brian Crighton left Norton to formthe Roton Company which planned to produce motorcycles in Australia.They won 6th and 7th in their first race in March 1991 at Caldwell Park.Grant Hodson rode the Roton to win the Australian F1 Championship twopart race at Oron Park that year. Steve Spray was also riding. In 1990 Le Roux said "The Norton F1 is the Porsche of the motorcycleworld. It is a superb example of British innovation and technology andwill take the Norton name into the 1990s as one of the most prestigiousnames in motorcycling." Combining this with the engine business and theCommando spare parts business, prospects appeared to be looking up.Then Le Roux departed as chief executive officer in 1991. A Department of Trade and Industry investigation was launched in1991 to look into the activities of all the members of the Norton group,including Pro-fit (American pipe), Minty (furniture), and FUS (Germanfastenings). The outcome is not known to this writer. A motorcyclemagazine claimed that Norton was looted financially in the early 90s. The story continues on the Mid-Westpage. Christian Paukovits has made shareware for somesort of computer game to emulate the Norton Commander. <= <= Motorcycles | Wankel Home | => => NSU (Deutsche) | => => NSU (English) Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr.

Der NSU Spider, das erste Serienauto der Welt mit dem NSUWankel-Kreiskolbenmotor Die Idee eines Motors ohne oszillierende Bewegungen um einekomplizierte Kurbelwelle und die notwendige Steuerung von Ein- undAuslaßventilen wurde in den 50er Jahren in einer Zusammenarbeitvon dem Erfinder Felix Wankel und den NSU Motorenwerken verwirklicht. Nach vielen Spekulationen undgezielt gestreuten Indiskretionen über den neuen Motor mußte man im Januar 1960 auf einereigens einberufenen VDI-Tagung im Deutschen Museum an dieÖffentlichkeit gehen. Auf einer improvisierten Bühne wurde aufeiner LKW- Pritsche der erste Kreiskolbenmotor der Öffentlichkeitvorgeführt. Zahlreiche Börsenspekulationen um dieMöglichkeiten des neuen "Wundermotors" undAbschlüsse mit Lizenznehmern in aller Welt zwangen NSUkurzfristig ein serienmäßiges Fahrzeug mit dem neuen Motorvorzustellen und dessen Gebrauchstüchtigkeit unter Beweis zustellen. Auf der IAA 1963 wurde nach langem Zögern des erste Serienautomit Wankel-Kreiskolbenmotor vorgestellt. Es handelte sich um ein kleinesCabrio, dessen Verwandtschaft zu dem seit 1959 produziertem Sport-Prinz,einem Prinzen mit 600 ccm Viertakt-Twin-Motor und 30 PS mitCoupé-Karosserie vom italienischen Designer Nuccio Bertone nichtzu übersehen war. Doch es sollte noch fast ein Jahr dauern bis die Serienfertigung desNSU Wankel-Spiders anlief. Zahlreiche Detailprobleme an dem neuenMotorkonzept erforderten intensive Nachbesserungen, bevor das kleineAuto mit nur 500 ccm Kammervolumen, aber einer Leistung von 50 PS denersten Kunden überlassen werden konnte. Etliche von ihnen waren alsenthusiastische Tester für das Betriebsverhalten des neuenTriebwerkes im rauhen Alltagsbetrieb herangezogen worden. So wurde vomWerk auch eine großzügige Kulanzregelung bei Motorproblemengeboten, meistens fielen zur damaligen Zeit nicht mehr Kosten als dieeiner großen Inspektion für die mutigen Kunden an. PerExpreß wurde ein Ersatzaggregat herangeschafft und gegen daswaidwunde ausgetauscht. Die ausgebauten Motoren wurden im Werk auf ihreSchwächen untersucht, die häufigsten Ausfallursachenlokalisiert und sofort behoben und flossen als Verbesserungen in dielaufende Kleinserienfertigung ein. Um die Leistungsfähigkeit des neuen Triebwerkes eindrucksvollzu beweisen, nahmen die Fahrzeuge an zahlreichen motorsportlichenWettbewerben erfolgreich teil. Im Jahre 1966 wurde Karlheinz PannowitzDeutscher Gran-Tourisme-Rallye Meister und 1967 wurde SiegfriedSpieß auf dem NSU Wankel-Spider Deutscher Automobilbergmeisteraller Hubraumklassen und Kategorien. Der bei Sportveranstaltungen als GTmit 1000 ccm eingestufte Spider, also 2/3 seines theoretischmöglichen Gesamthubraums. Noch heute werden Autos mit Wankelmotorin Deutschland nicht nach Hubraum, da es diesen ja eigentlich gar nichtgibt, sondern nach dem zulässigen Gesamtgewicht versteuert. Nachdem erste sportliche Erfolge von Werksfahrzeugen gesammeltworden waren, entschloß man sich zu Anfang des Jahres 1966für interessierte Sportfahrer eine Sonderserie mit einem getuntenMotor, der jetzt 65 PS bei 7500 min-1 leistete, ein verbessertesFahrwerk mit verstärkten Bremsen und geändertem Fahrwerkanzubieten. Diese Fahrzeuge wurden direkt vom Werk aus beim TÜV inHeilbronn im Einzelabnahme für den Straßenverkehrzugelassen. Da der Wankelmotor keine Nockenwelle und Ventile besitzt,war es ein leichtes den Motor durch Änderung des Einlaßkanalsund die Verwendung einer optimal abgestimmten Abgasanlage an die neuenBedingungen anzupassen. Da der Motor bei hohen Drehzahlen sich nichtselbst abregelt sind Drehzahlorgien bis in vierstellige Regionenmöglich gewesen, was allerdings den zahlreichen filigranenDichtelementen im Dauerbetrieb nicht besonders gut bekommenist. Leistungssteigerungen bis zu 100 PS sind im reinen Rennbetriebrealisiert worden. Zum Fahren eines normalen Spiders im Alltagsbetrieb benötigtman keine besondere Eingewöhnungsphase, empfehlenswert ist doch derBlick auf den serienmäßigen elektronischen Drehzahlmesser, umden roten Bereich jenseits von 7500 min-1 nicht allzu oft zu ignorieren,da keinerlei mechanische Geräusche hier Einhalt gebieten. Mitwachsenden Drehzahlen gibt sich das kleine Kraftpaket, das fastunscheinbar ans Getriebe angeflanscht ist, mit turbinenartigenLaufeigenschaften wesentlich zufriedener als im etwas rauhen Leerlauf,wo es an einen Zweitaktmotor erinnert. Im Wankelmotor läuft ein echter Viertaktprozeß ab, beijeder Umdrehung der Exzenterwelle wird ein 270 Grad Arbeitstaktausgeführt, dabei dreht sich der Läufer mit einem Drittel derabgegebenen Drehzahl in einer kreisenden Bewegung um die zentraleExzenterwelle. Doch trotz des wackeren Erscheinungsbildes und der hervorragendenFahreigenschaften des kleinen Sportwagens kam er während seinerBauzeit von 1964 bis 1967 nicht über eine Produktionszahl von 2375Einheiten hinaus. Heute sind beim Kraftfahrtbundesamt in Flensburg noch100 Fahrzeuge registriert. Sie verkörpern auch heute noch mit vielAufwand in Betrieb gehalten, den Pioniergeist der NSU Konstrukteure undder Bereitschaft sich neuen Aufgaben zu stellen. Der NSU Wankel-Spider lieferte für das Werk wertvolleErkenntnisse über den neuen Motor und die Problematik des unstetenFahrzeugbetriebes, die wertvolle Hilfen bei dem bereits in derEntwicklung befindlichen großen Wankel-Wagen, dem Ro80 lieferten, der in seinem Vorstellungsjahrals revolutionärstes Auto mit flüsterndem Wankelmotor undrevolutionärem aerodynamischem Karosseriedesign neueavantgardistische Maßstäbe setzte und dafür zu Auto desJahres 1967 gekürt wurde.

Hamlet passed aPorsche on the last lap to take third. They might have placed higherbut not for a gearbox rebuild in the 21st hour. Here is what two of thedrivers had to say: Jim Downing: We were in third place in WSC in the secondhour, at least briefly. Then we managed to shoot ourselves in the foot afew times. We had a long stop when a gear tooth broke, we had a newA-arm break, but nothing real big, other than the gearbox. I'mthrilled. For a new car to make this distance is about all you can hopefor. Barry Waddell: This was my first 24-hour race. The Downingteam has done this race a lot and they made my first stint at this verycomfortable. The car was very comfortable every stint I did,particularly at the end, which was just as fast as at the beginning. Thecar got better as the driver got better, and I enjoyed it a lot.

The Hercules (Herkules) works have existed for more than 100 yearsand are one of the oldest motorbike works. They belong to the Sachsgroup who produce automotive products like clutches, shock absorbers andsmall engines for severall purposes. Sachs was one of the firstlicensees of the new NSU / Wankel rotary engine in 1960. They developed andbuilt more than 35,000 Wankel engines mostly for stationary purposes.Characteristic was the air-cooling and the charge-cooled rotor. Thebiggest one was the 294 cc "KM 914" for generators and snowmobiles.This KM 914 was the basis of all Hercules and BSA (later Norton) motorbikes. The first Hercules W 2000 was shown at the German IFMA motorbikeshow in 1970 to see the public's reaction on a rotary bike. It had theSachs KM 914 engine and a BMW gearbox and driveshaft. Only one prototypewas produced. In 1973 Hercules built 50 W 2000 in a "pre-series" and sold themonly to Hercules dealers. It had the KC 24 engine, which was based onthe KM 914 but was fitted for use in motorbikes. A six-speed gearboxwith chain-drive was now installed. Characteristic for the pre-seriesbikes was the yellow fuel tank. Production began in 1974 with the KC 27 engine. The Bike was sold inEngland as DKW because that name was more popular in England and Sachsowned the rights of that name, too. Special motorbikes based on the W2000 have been driven in long-distance races and were very succesful inoff-road sports. A 50,000 km endurance test at the Nürburgring in1975 showed very low wear. Hercules made prototype studies with awater-cooled engine in a BMW/5 frame and a more conventional lookingengine on a 7 speed gearbox of the Hercules GS Two-stroke. For the lastyear of production the W 2000 got an oil-injector to avoid the mixing offuel and oil. Overall 1800 Hercules W 2000 have been built. Afterstopping the production of rotary engines Sachs sold the toolingmachines to Norton. There is a IG Hercules W 2000 in germany, a DKWowners club in England and a "Rotary Recycle" in USA.

Tokyo, April 12, 1996 (Reuter) Mazda Motor Corp said on Friday it and Ford Motor Co had agreed on acloser tie-up aimed at creating the world's strongest automobile groupin the future. "Mazda and Ford have agreed to boost the existing strategiccooperation on a global basis," Mazda said in a statement issued inTokyo. "The strengthening of the ties means a continuation of thebusiness relationship between the two companies which started in the1960s and a steady expansion of the relationship which followed anequity tie-up in 1979. With this move we aim to become the world'sstrongest group in the future," it said. Ford will boost its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent from 22.54percent and install a seconded Ford executive as Mazda's president, thestatement said. Analysts say the one-third stake will give the U.S. cargiant a greater say in the running of Mazda, Japan's fifth-largestvehicle manufacturer. Under the deal, Mazda will also make an allocation of 144.1 millionshares to Ford worth 52.3083 billion yen ($484 million). Mazda said thisneeded governmental approval. Mazda said its president Yoshihiro Wada would become chairman and bereplaced by Henry Wallace, a Ford official already seconded to Mazda andcurrently serving as Mazda's executive vice president. Through the agreement, Mazda and Ford would aim to increase theirrespective profits, Mazda said, adding that the agreement would notinvolve any sacrifice by either firm. Mazda said it would maintain a clear, separate identity and continueits own distribution of Mazda-developed products. It also said it wouldmaintain its own distribution network. The agreement would allow bothcompanies to fully utilise their resources in order to boost efficiencyand competitiveness, Mazda said. "We will each become a source ofproducts to the other in order to increase efficiency and gain from themerits of scale to further boost competitiveness," it said. Mazda said Sumitomo Bank Ltd, a key shareholder, positivelysupported its agreement with Ford. It did not elaborate. 01:17 04-12-96 Ford takes wheel at Mazda with new president, ups stake From: bclark@ccmailpc.ctron.com TOKYO - Ford Motor Co. is taking the wheel at Mazda Motor Corp., amove that could give the U.S. company a foothold in Asia and provide amuch-needed boost for the ailing Japanese automaker. The two companies said in a joint statement Friday that Ford wouldincrease its share in Mazda to 33.4%, and that Mazda's president wouldstep aside, ceding management control to a former Ford executive. The increased share alone does not give Ford control, but analystssaid that coupled with the management shakeup, it effectively puts theU.S. company in the driver's seat. "Ford and Mazda believe that closercoordination of our cooperative strategies and plans, particularly inthe areas of product development, manufacturing and distribution ofvehicles, will enable both companies to improve competitiveness and toachieve improved economies of scale and efficiencies," Wayne Booker,executive vice president of Ford, said in a statement. Analysts saw benefits for both companies. "This means that Mazda has decided that it would be very difficultto accomplish financial recovery on its own," said Masahiro Kushida, anauto analyst at Daiwa Research Institute, a private researchorganization. "It's a big relief for Mazda that it can expect firmbacking from Ford." Ford, for its part, can benefit from Mazda'stechnology know-how in compact cars, while raising its profile in Asia,Kushida said. In recent years, Ford has been pouring cash and management expertiseinto Mazda, which has seen its sales sag significantly since the decadebegan. Ford bought about 25% of Mazda in 1979, and had maintained thelevel of its stake until now. Under the shakeup, Mazda's president, Yoshihiro Wada, will take thelargely ceremonial post of chairman. Wada is a banker who had been sentin from Sumitomo Bank, the second-largest shareholder in Mazda afterFord. Replacing him is former Ford Venezuela president Henry Wallace,who became executive vice president of the Japanese company in 1994. Mazda said in a statement that it would maintain a "distinctidentity" and would continue to offer its own products through its owndistribution channels. In recent years, Mazda's high domestic production ratio anddependence on exports have made it vulnerable to the strong yen, whichmakes Japanese products more expensive overseas. Mazda's performance inthe U.S. market has been dismal. Its U.S. sales in 1995 fell 24% fromthe previous year. So far in 1996, its sales have been down 18% from ayear ago. And the automaker lost $380 million in the fiscal year thatended in March 1995. It was in the midst of a restructuring program totrim its payrolls to 26,000 workers by March this year, for a totalreduction of 4,000 jobs over three years. Larger Japanese automakerslike Toyota and Honda have had better success in shielding themselvesfrom currency fluctuations by aggressively moving production offshore. Ford and Mazda jointly manufacture vehicles in Michigan and NewZealand, and they have announced a venture to build pickup trucks inThailand. They also have collaborated on the development of vehicles,the latest being the 1997 versions of the Ford Escort and MercuryTracer.

That year ports were shrunk for better fuel economy.When both lines were discontinued in 1978, the engine went intohibernation until 1984 when it appeared in the RX-7 GSL-SE. Rotor tips came with cast-iron sealsand the design was changed to two pieces. There were now only threeside seals (from six). Engine cooling was improved by increasingthe size of the passages. Rotor recesses were deepened. Seats were either vinyl or crushed velour. The speedometer read upto 130 mph, the tach up to 8000 rpm. The dash and the center consolewere integrated. RX-4 Sedan The bumpers on the sedan and wagon had full length barrier strips,unlike the coupe. The sedan was overdecorated compared to the coupe andwagon since it had an odd adornment of the C pillar (rear pillar). RX-4 Wagon Road and Track praised the wagon's power, smoothness, andresponsiveness. They rated it best of six wagons for "all-around fun". 1974 RX-4 wagon Huygens, courtesy of SteveStaton.

The RCE Eccentric Shaft [gloss] supercedes the piston engine'scrankshaft and connecting rods. The RCE Peripheral Housing [gloss] supercedes the piston engine'scylinder. Intake and exhaust ports [gloss]in the housings eliminate valves, camshafts, and timing belts. The Housing shape is an epitrochoid [gloss] curve (more properly,peritrochoid) [gloss]. It isgenerated by rolling a circle around another circle. The rolling circleis half the size of the generating circle. Drexel provides an extendeddiscussion of the mathematicsof the epitrochoid curve and the rotor shape. Java Demonstration of Generating anEpitrochoid (about 44 KB) The Wankel RC Engine is an Otto Cycle Engine (Four "Stroke") Java Demonstration of RC EngineCycles (about 104 KB) There are two main types of RCE KKM Kreiskolbenmotor orplanetary rotation motor (PLM), distinguished by one stationaryperipheral housing. The rotor moves in an orbit and propels aneccentric shaft. This is easier to manufacture, cool, and maintain thanDKM. Intake and exhaust passages are better. Better cooling isachievable. It is more compact. Modern rotaries are KKM types. DKM Drehkolben Maschine orsingle-rotation engine (SIM), the first RCE, has the distinctive featureof an inner rotating housing and rotor moving in circular motion arounda fixed central shaft. This requires disassembling the motor to changespark plugs, perhaps the main reason it was discarded. However, DKM isthe smoothest of the two, and high rates beyond 25,000 rpm are possible.Bearing loads are lighter. The rotary combustion engine must not be confused with "rotary"aircraft engines which are piston cylinders arranged in a circle. Thewhole engine rotates. Advantages Light weight and compact. Smooth: no reciprocating motion. Extended power "stroke" rotation of the output shaft: 270 degreesvs. the 180 degrees of a piston. Fewer moving parts: no valves, connecting rods, cams, timingchains. Intake and exhaust timing are accomplished directly by themotion of the rotor. Flat torque curve because no valves are used. Cooler combustion means fewer oxides of nitrogen. Catalyticconverters lessen this advantage. Separation of combustion region from intake region is good forhydrogen fuel. Disadvantages High surface to volume ratio in combustion chamber is less thermodynamically efficient. The Wankel's long and narrow chambermakes for long flame travel, but this is countered by the Mazda'stwo spark plugs (three on some racing engines). Higher fuel consumption. Thus Mazda hasbeen successful with the RX-7 sports car, a marketwhere fuel consumption is less of an issue. Only 16 years after thefirst engine ran, the 1973 oil crisis devastated the RCE before it hadsufficiently developed to become more economical. History of Rotary Machines Designs for rotary engines were proposed as early as 1588 byRamelli, though it took the development of the Otto cycle engine in 1876and the advent of the automobile in 1896 to set the stage for a properrotary combustion engine. Other early designs were made by Huygens in 1673 and Kepler. JamesWatt made a rotary piston steam engine in 1759. Wankel engines use cycloidal gearing, an old and unusual form ofgearing used in watches, Roots blowers, screw compressors, and pumps. Wankel Home | => Recent Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr.

One of the biggest remainingquestions is when to start. Mazda says timing of the launch hinges on agovernment program to develop a hydrogen fuel distributionnetwork. Japan's MITI reportedly aims to have infrastructure in place tosupport widespread use of hydrogen as a transport fuel by 2010. Mazdaclaims its hydrogen vehicle - based on a Wankel rotary engine - has arange of 230 km and a top speed of 150 km/hr. By comparison, theautomaker says, electric vehicles typically can travel no more than 180km without recharging and achieve top speeds of 130 km/hr, whilegasoline fueled cars have ranges as high as 590 km and top speeds of 183km/hr. Oil and Gas Journal, Jan. 8,1996 Newsletter. The Search for Low-pollution Vehicles Continues Mazda has begun a two year trial period for its experimentallow-pollution hydrogen rotary engine (RE) vehicle. The Cappella Cargovan model vehicle will burn a hydrogen fuel that when burned will notemit carbon dioxide.

Fuel of the Future To: [rx7@world.std.com]Date: Sat, 12 Nov 1994 11:19:08 -0800From: monito@ (Alan Marr)Subject: Hydrogen Rotaries: the facts Mazda Hydrogen fueled cars have all been rotaries: HR-X1  not hydride, 2 seat, spacy commuter look.HR-X2  metal hydride, 4 seat, dowdy.MX-5   metal hydride, Miata body, front twin rotor, rear drive. Hydrogen has a low ignition temperature so the standard four strokeengine is prone to pre-detonation and backfiring through the intakeports. The rotary engine separates the intakeports from the combustion area so there are no hot spots in the intakephase. The hydrogen Miata is 400 kg (880 lb) heavier than the standard car.This is partly because a 300 kg (660 lb) H2 fuel tank replaces thestandard 50 kg (110 lb) for a full gasoline tank.Thus it is encouraging that it performs as well as it does.Intriguingly, the prototype has a left side driver (US). Mazda alsohas an electric prototype using fuel cells, also with a 400 kgincrease in weight. MX-5 is the international designation of Miata.

The view from the driver's seat: Inside the hydrogen car, everything is standard apart from a small pressure instrument - the fuel gauge... Starting the hydrogen car is no different from starting the petrol model, and engine noise sounds familiar too. ... the intake system combines a pre-mix air/fuel system for light load driving... There is also a direct-injection system through a dedicated hydrogen port which opens when the air intake port is closed. This is effective in increasing available power for higher speed driving... When the fuel pressure gets low, the power drops noticeably and the car slows dramatically. Changing down the gears makes little or no appreciable difference and even with 20 percent pressure available, the car is effectively unable to carry on. Refuelling these prototypes takes about 15 minutes from start to finish. The electric car is completely different... There is very little engine braking so you have to start using the brakes much earlier than normal. And the engine is virtually silent, which make tire and wind noise much more apparent. Battery technology is holding up the whole electric car movement: development has failed to produce a satisfactory alternative to nickel cadmium batteries (like those in the Mazda) or the standard lead acid type which cause so many of the problems. They make electric cars heavy, expensive, and poor performers, with very few miles possible between each lengthy charge-up. Mazda is investing much more heavily in hydrogen research thanelectricity. Seiji Tanaka, head of Mazda R&D, says Our first objective is to use available fuels more efficiently by producing better engines. At present we are researching the Miller cycle and developing lean-burn technology. Our second objective is to investigate alternative fuels such as natural gas and methanol and electric cars. But this will not cut pollution. Hydrogen offers many advantages over all these, especially electric cars, and with the rotary fuelled by hydrogen, performance is very close to the petrol engine. Japan's MITI is sponsoring the New Sunshine Project. The goal is touse hydrogen power "to replace 3 percent of electrical power, 10percent of city gas use and 5 percent of transportation energy supplyby 2010". Mazda is trying to convince the California Air Resources Board toadmit the hydrogen rotary as a Zero Emission vehicle. The issue isthe tiny amounts of hydrocarbon output because of the enginelubricant. Hydrogen faces infrastructure hurdles and public concern over safety.Metal hydrides are a safe mobile storage method. Hydrogen is in someways safer than gasoline since the vapour rises into the atmosphereand doesn't collect on the ground. Reference: "Fuel of the Future" Complete Car, August 1994, p. 72-75. HRX-2 at 30th Tokyo Motor Show Mazda's HRX-2 "is powered by a hydrogen burning rotary engine andhas a virutally 100% recyclable body structure. It's been developedwith the potential to use liquid-crystal polymer fibre-reinforcedplastic. This plastic is in the process of further research forpractical use. The plastic-made upper-body can be easily detached fromthe metal chassis. The electrical and control systems are integratedinto one area. Therefore, this structure makes it easier to disassemblethe body and to sort, by material make-up. The HRX-2 is an updatedversion of the HR-X which was exhibited at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show.it has improvements in driving performance and cruising range." Quoted from the page on MazdaMotor Corporation. Mazda Motor Corp is already bench-testing a Miata equipped with ahydrogen-powered rotary engine as part of its bid to be the firstautomobile manufacturer to market a hydrogen-powered vehicle. Mazdaexpects the vehicle to have a one-tank range of 248 miles, which istwice as long as that of the HR-X concept car shown at the 1991 TokyoMotor Show. The hydrogen-powered rotary engine is also being tested inMazda's Capella Cargo wagon. Automotive News, Sept 13, 1993 n5517 p14(1). Cited byrnavarro@mcgraw-hill.com, 23 Jun 1995.

WVU's NAFTP-Hydrogen Review This reviewprovides a good overview of hydrogen as it can be applied to internalcombustion engines, but makes no specific mention of the RCE. The two following items are from Hydrogen Today, Vol. 4, No. 1,1993, official publication of the American HydrogenAssociation. Mazda Advances Environmentally-Correct HR-X: Powered by Hydrogen The refined Mazda HR-X shown above is a concept car that runs onpure, renewable hydrogen, and emits primarily only water vapor. It hasbeen improved since its original debut in 1991 by Mazda engineers toimprove its performance and increase its fuel efficiency. The Mazdavehicle shows that hydrogen can be safely used as a fuel. The metal hydride tank is shown being fueled below, with onehydrogen fuel line, and two lines which run cooling water through thetank. During refueling, the metal hydride in the tank warms as itabsorbs hydrogen, and the water cools it to allow more to beabsorbed. When the engine is running, the warm engine coolant water iscirculated through the tank to warm the metal hydride, causing thehydrogen fuel to be released. Unlike piston-engines, the rotary engine has separate intake andcombustion chambers. This allows the rotary engine to avoid thebackfiring and preignition problems that other engines have experienced.The rotor draws the air and hydrogen in as it passes the top of thecycle, then moves the mixture to the lower right and compresses it,where it is ignited to drive the engine. The HR-X hydrogen car's rotary engine delivers 100 horsepower, whichis nearly the same as the original RX-7. Thisconcept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, and auto shows in New Yorkand Los Angeles, has generated much excitement and public awareness ofhydrogen as a fuel with today's technology. Mazda's break ahead of theother auto companies is truly an advancement to the solar hydrogenindustry. Remarks at Solar Hydrogen Industrial Workshop at UCLA, Ca, Feb. 8,1993 Vahe Kluejian, Manager of Research, Mazda Motor Company: Mazda developed the hydrogen fueled rotary engine as an option tomeet new emission standards. The rotary engine is more difficult toreduce emissions in, except with hydrogen. With the oncoming ZEV,hydrogen is the future fuel. Mazda plans to use metal hydrides or anynonliquid for safety. Their main problem has been convincing regulatorsthat hydrogen is viable. Mazda has built three test vehicles, and moreare being built for real-world standards for fleet testing anddemonstration. Mazda's hydrogen car can be made commercial in 1998-2000per the ZEV specification. Research in New Zealand Interesting research has been conducted at the MechanicalEngineering Department at the University ofCanterbury, New Zealand in the Fuels andCombustion Research Group: "Hydrogen fuelling of a rotary engine. Designed to overcome fuellingrelated problems in the reciprocating engine, and combustion relatedproblems in the fossil fuel firing of rotary engines." Rotary Engine that Uses Hydrogen and Steam (Water) Wolf Brinsbury reports by way of Gary Hawkins on a proposed rotaryengine from New Zealand that burns a little hydrogen and injectswater which gets converted to steam with a great increase in pressure. An astounding number of articles and reports (2,651) are abstractedat the Center forAlternative Transportation Fuels. An interesting article was written Brett Pirie in 1994 at BoulderValley School District. Wankel Home | => Mazda Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedApril 5, 1996.

His father died when he was three years old. Atthe age of 13 he got a job in a blacksmith shop in Osaka. At the age of20, in 1894 he started his own shop and employed 50 workers, but arecession drove him out of business. He tried again eleven years laterin converted cow shed. His eldest son, Tsuneji (1897?-1971), pumped airfor the furnace. Jujiro Matsuda invented and patented a pump. It sold well, so heformed the Matsuda Pump Partnership. He was edged out a few years laterwhen the company was taken over. In 1912 Jujiro formed Matsuda Works. In one year it employed 4000workers to produce four million artillery fuses for the Russian Czar'sgovernment. Then it became Japan Armament Manufacturing Company.Later he left to create a new Matsuda Works in Hiroshima. Nihon SteelManufacuring Co. took this over. Toyo Kogyo 1920, 1927 A group of investors including Matsuda took over a failing Abemakitree cork company in January 1920, naming it Toyo Cork Kogyo CompanyLimited. Toyo means Orient and Kogyo means industry. Jujiro becamepresident the next year. In September 1927, Matsuda reformed the company as Toyo Kogyo Kaisha(Company) Limited to grow out of Cork and into industrial production. Atest run of 30 motorcycles were manufactured in 1930 or earlier, sinceone of them won a race that year. Mazda Type DA Motorized Tricycle Truck 1931 Ahura Mazda is the Zoroastran lord of light, creator of theuniverse. The name is also very close to Matsuda. Toyo Kogyosuccessfully produced these 500cc three wheelers with differentialtransmissions beginning in 1931. A small passenger sedan protoype wasmade in 1940, but this had to be abandoned. Recovery after Atom Bomb The atom bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, but the company wasfortunate that less than half of the plant was destroyed. In 1950 ToyoKogyo produced the Type CT three-wheeler with 1157 cc V twin (32 bhp).This was very successful. In May 1960 the R360 air cooled coupe wasintroduced with a 356 cc two cylinder rear mounted engine. In 1962there was the 358 cc four cylinder Carol sedan. 1963 saw the model800 and Familia four with front engines and rear drive. Jujiro's son Tenuji became President of the Company in 1951. Jujiropassed away in March 1952. Tsuneji succumbed to a lung inflammation in1971. His son Kohei succeeded him until he stepped down in 1977. In 1984 the company name was changed to Mazda MotorCorporation. Mazda has assembly plants in 21 countries and exports to120 countries. RCE Events at Mazda May 1960 Dr. Haas, German ambassador visits Mazda. Jun 1960 NSU ready to negotiate agreement. Sep 1960 Pres. Tsuneji Matsuda visits Germany. Tentative agreement. Jul 1961 Japanese gov't approves agreement. Aug 1962 Kenichi Yamamoto visits NSU. Apr 1963 Rotary Engine Research Division formed. 1963 Rotary engine tested, shown at Tokyo show. 1969 RCE wins Japan Society for the Promotion of Machine Industry Prize 1978 Millionth Mazda Rotary Engine produced. 1984 RCE with Electronic Injection wins Japan SPMI Prize. 1990 Cumulative production of 1 million RX-7s was achieved. In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previousyear's total. More than 92 percent had rotary engines. The next year,after the gas crisis had made its impact felt, Mazda sold only 61,192cars in the US. Addresses Greeting Mazda is the nameof the pages from Mazda Motor Corporation itself in Japan.

The first prototype was completed in1977. It was introduced to America as a 79 model on April 24, 1978since production began in March (brochure (heavygraphics)). A slogan Mazda used was "It's the real thing. A sports carwith all the traditional virtues and then some." One magazine'sheadline was "The Rotary Revolution has begun". Thus began Mazda'spassion for pure sport cars that has continued through three generationsand includes the Miata and RX-01. The 12A engine (2 x 573 = 1146 cc) had two side intake ports and oneperipheral exhaust port per rotor. There was a thermal reactor.Transmissions were four and five speed manual and three speed auto. American models were two seaters only, though a 2+2 was offered inJapan due to relaxed crash standards. A good rundown ofmodels from the first generation is available from the Bay Area RX-7club. Copyright Dave Rock S Model (Base) GS Model P642 The P designates "production". Upgraded interior materials.Production changed October, 1979. P815 It appeared in August 1980. The rear and tail lights were redesignedeliminating the "Baroque depression". Front bumper, air dam changed.The Japanese variant had rotor inspired aluminum wheels. GSL Model This began in 1980 (part of P815 run) as the "Leather Sport", 2500units, and became the GSL in 1981. Series II In 1981 they were restyled, most visibly in the rear. P130 An stop-gap version appeared in July 1982, the P130, with an improvedengine for better fuel economy. A high output audio system was an option.It was called "Black Dynamite". P132 or GSL-SE Model 84-85 The SE saw the re-introduction of the 13B engine, last seen in the 1978RX-4, but now rated at 135 bhp because of Dynamic Effect Intake (DEI),six port induction (2 by 3), and electronic fuel injection. In Japan,there was a P132 with a 12A turbocharged engine. Power steering wasoffered for the first time. The interior was upgraded, but this didnot appear in the Japanese turbo version. Second Generation 1986-1991 First Half 86-88 The 13B engine was the only size offered. Power was increased to146 bhp. The Turbo II engine had 182 bhp. Turbo II courtesy Ben Burton Second Half 89-91 These are distinguishable by a return to round tail lights. Underthe hood, horsepower was increased by 10 %. Third Generation 1993 to Present The RX-7 was Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year. Theengine comes in one version only, sequential twin turbo. The 93 RX-7 easily sustained 112-135 mph on the German Autobahn forover 200 miles, getting 11.6 mpg. When speed was lowered below 113 mph,economy was raised to 14 mpg.

Snow Fury (Swedish) The 71 Lynx Wankel was 296 pounds (dry?). They have littlesuspension travel, perhaps 3 inches. David Wood wrote 11 Mar 1996 to rec.sport.snowmobiles: Arctic Cat had at least two different rotary engines inseveral different models. First there was the 303. This engine wasused until '74, I believe, and after that they used the 295. Bothengines were made by Sachs. The rotaries could be found in Panthers(naturally, what engine couldn't?) and Cheetahs and probably others suchas the Puma. I had a 75 Cheetah with the 295 and there were a fewthings to look out for. One, the recoil needed to be well greased atall times. There was a zerk fitting on the top for this purpose. If itwasn't lubricated the recoil had a tendency to self destruct. Since thefuel pump is *mechanical* on the 295 and driven by an eccentric on theend of the crankshaft which sticks through the recoil the recoils aredifficult to find. Two, the fuel pump. If the eccentric bearing wentbad the end of the fuel pump push rod would get worn away and soon therewould be no fuel getting pumped. Both of these problems are easy toavoid with a little maintenance but would definitely be something tolook for if you were to buy one of these machines. My Cheetah had aboatload of torque and was great for a work sled. Oh yeah, belts can bekind of hard to find, too, because no one has the correct one listed forthat application and if you do have to replace a recoil or fuel pumpthey were about $70 used 7 or 8 years ago. OMC put 500cc rotaries in both Johnson and Evinrudesnowmobiles. They were very large sleds, but had electric start andreverse to make them a little easier to live with. These engines camein two flavors, 35 and 45 horsepower. I haven't heard much about the35s but the 45s had some trouble with the shaft of the secondarythrottle plate breaking and allowing the plate into the engine thusdestroying the rotor housing. I know two people that seem to have amorbid fascination with these things and have at least half a dozen ofthem between the two. Most of them are just used for parts, however, asonly two of the 6 or so sleds are in running shape, so that sayssomething about the OMCs I would say.

That year ports were shrunk for better fuel economy.When both lines were discontinued in 1978, the engine went intohibernation until 1984 when it appeared in the RX-7 GSL-SE. Rotor tips came with cast-iron sealsand the design was changed to two pieces. There were now only threeside seals (from six). Engine cooling was improved by increasingthe size of the passages. Rotor recesses were deepened. Seats were either vinyl or crushed velour. The speedometer read upto 130 mph, the tach up to 8000 rpm. The dash and the center consolewere integrated. RX-4 Sedan The bumpers on the sedan and wagon had full length barrier strips,unlike the coupe. The sedan was overdecorated compared to the coupe andwagon since it had an odd adornment of the C pillar (rear pillar). RX-4 Wagon Road and Track praised the wagon's power, smoothness, andresponsiveness. They rated it best of six wagons for "all-around fun". 1974 RX-4 wagon Huygens, courtesy of SteveStaton.

In the late 20's and early 30's he mademany experiments. His research in this field allowed him to makeseveral advances. These led to contracts with BMW and other companies. There are two kinds of areas on the rotor that need sealing: theapices (plural of apex) and the sides. The peripheral housings areactually slightly larger than a true epitrochoid. This is done toimprove sealing by preventing unnecessary seal movement. Before 1986, the apex seals had two pieces, one of which is a smalltriangle. Since 1986, the long piece was split along its lengthhorizontally so now the apex seal is composed of three pieces. Thethickness was reduced from 3 mm to 2 mm. These seals are backed with asingle spring bar before 1986 and two spring bars from 1986 on. The material is cast iron alloy. The top rubbing surface ischill hardened by an electron beam. The side seals are 1.0 mm before 1986 and 0.7 mm there-after. Theyare made of sintered iron. This provides some self-lubrication as itrubs against the nitrided iron surface of the side housing. Water seals are used between the peripheral and side housings [gloss]. In 1986 the grooves in whichthey fit were moved from the peripheral to the side housing.

The Wankel engine differs greatly fromconventional engines. It retains the familiar intake, compression,power, and exhaust cycle but uses, instead of a piston, cylinder, andmechanical valves, a triangular rotor that revolves around the eccentric[shaft]. The three apexes, or tips, of this rotor remain in constant,snug contact with the combustion-chamber walls. The only other movingpart is the crankshaft. The Wankel engine has 40 percent fewer partsand roughly one-third the bulk and weight of a comparable reciprocatingengine. In addition to the simplicity of design, there is little or novibration in the Wankel. There are no problems with heat dissipation,hot spots, or detonation, all of which are considerations in theconventional reciprocating engine. Wankel engines, most of which areliquid-cooled, are capable of running at unusually high speeds for longperiods of time. The motor exhibits a high power-to-weight ratio and anexceptionally good torque curve at all engine speeds. Within the Wankel, three chambers are formed by the sides of therotor and the wall of the housing. The shape, size, and position ofthese chambers are constantly altered by the rotor's clockwise rotationand the faster rotation of the eccentric [shaft]. The usual four-strokecycle occurs with the simple valving and power-stroke frequency of thetwo-stroke engine. The rotor opens the intake port and the fuel and airenter as in the conventional engine. The rotor continues, closing theintake port by passing beyond it; then compression begins, followed byignition, combustion, and expansion for the power stroke until the apexseal at the tip of the triangle opens the exhaust port. The exhaustcycle then takes place, again with no speed-restricting valve mechanism.The engine is unique in that the power impulse is spread overapproximately 270 degrees of crankshaft rotation, as compared to 180degrees for the conventional reciprocating two-stroke engine. Althoughit is still an experimental engine for most manufacturers, the Japaneseauto maker Mazda has used the Wankel to powersome of its sports models. The major problemswith Wankels -- or rotary engines, as they are often called -- has beentheir low fuel efficiency and the difficulty of designing engines oflarger than two-rotor capacity. In the late 1980s, however, athree-rotor engine was introduced [to production]. Joseph W. Duffy The above encyclopedia entry was posted, apparently as arepost, to the RX-7 Net mailgroup (put "subscribeyour-email-address rx7-digest" in the body). Date: Fri, 09 Dec 1994 04:35:16 -0600 (CST)From: Z_COBBRE@TITAN.SFASU.EDU There is a reference to OthmarBaier, a Professor of Geometry at Technische UniversitätMünchen, 1960-71 who worked with NSU and Wankel on eineRotationskolbenmaschine. Wankel had arrived at the peripheral housingshape by practical means. In 1954 Baier identified the mathematicalclassification of the shape as epitrochoidal [gloss]. He wrote VDI report No. 45 in1960 which gives some mathematical treatment of the RCE. He assistedthe preparation of the Wankel's 1964 classification of rotary machines. <= Theory and Design | Wankel Home Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedApril 5, 1996.

I was principally interested in MazdaRotarys as a potential replacement for an io-360-a1a.  Below aremy notes of Crooks's Forum.  He has taken a conservativeapproach, and come up with a 160Hp engine which looks likely tobe highly reliable.  Please understand that these are my notesof his talk and may contain errors, and even if I took accuratenotes, I can't vouch for Crook's claims.His engine is installed in an RV-4.  It is 934 lbs empty and hasa top speed of 200+.  The airframe is stock, including cowling.The weak spot in the Mazda wankel basic design is the apexsealing.  Mazda has had an acceptable solution to sealing since1972.Crook's goal was to match the power to weight ratio of aLycoming o-320, beat its cost and produce a solution in 6 months.An o-320 has a published weight of 276lbs + accessories.An o-320 weighs 355-385lbs all up minus the prop.Crooks' Mazda weighs 340lbs all up minus the prop.Note that published aircraft engine weights do not include manysystems and accessories and do not represent the all up weightof the installed engine.A overhauled o-320 goes for $8,000.00.  Crook built his enginefor $5,2200.00 and could easily best that price if he did itagain.His engine is basically stock.  He made changes principally toeliminate features that are obviously for automotive purposes. Principally to reduce emissions or to increase low end torque. Neither of which is needed for the aircraft application.He made no changes that would increase BMEP since BMEP scaleswith internal stress and high relyability was his goal ratherthan high performance.You should ask for coils and cooling parts for your engine atthe salvage yard [or better yet arrange to remove the engineyourself].  These are not mounted to the engine and you save alot by having them included in the price of a salvaged engine.He looked at a wide variety of engines and developed a shortlist of o-320 replacements as follows:  Honda Prelude, Subaru2.2l Legacy, and Mazda 13B.The 13B has a higher fuel burn.  Crook vigured the increasedcost of auto fuel over the life of the engine was acceptable.He burns 8.2 gph at 192 mph or at 75% power.He usually cruises at 150 mph and burns 5.2 gph.The crank (eccentric) shaft of the 13B is STOUT.  Crook hasheard of no failures of this part, even in auto racing.  Therotors are also heavily built and are not prone to fail.Redrives:  Powersport and Ross were discussed.  Crook mentionedthe problem that there are a lot of redrives marketed, but onlysome vendors have actual stock developed and waiting to ship. Some are really still in the development phase. Crook used aRoss unit.  The Ross unit uses a torsional isolating plate likein an auto clutch.  The Ross unit uses the Ford C-6 planetarygearset.  Powersport strives to eliminate gear lash [EverittHatch in a seperate forum described their approach to torsionalresonance issues as one based on increasing the stiffness of thesystem and thereby driving the harmonics up out of theopperating range].  The Powersport costs 3 times as much as theRoss unit.  The Ross installation guide calls for turning theengine 90 degrees about the crank axis.  They probably did thisin order to stick the distributor out the side and keep it inthe cowl.  If you use an electronic fuel injection systemthere's no reason to rotate the engine.  Crook mounted hisengine upright and beleives that this will help cooling since1/3 of engine heat leaves via the oil cooler and the oil wasment to drain down by Mazda.Fuel System:  The stock fuel injection system is bulkey, andunneseccarily complex for an aircraft application.  It isdesigned to reduce emissions and to increase low end torque. Crook disregarded this and instead used three motorcycle carbs. In selecting the carbs he observed the following rules.  1) allcarbs mix fuel in the same ratio 2) in general you need 1 squareinch of carb throat for each 50Hp.  You might need more area onan engine with especially short sharp intake breaths, but theMazda makes a long smooth inhale.  He used three carbs for thesimple reason that he had three sets of holes on the block tocover.By using three carbs he gains the added benifit of inductionredundancy.  Ehe engine will run at reduced Hp on the centercarb alone, or on the outside carbs together without the centercarb.Ignition:  On a 1985 or earlier engine, the stock distributorwill work even if the engine had electronic ignition.  The Mazdacomes stock with two plugs per combustion chamber so it seems ashame to abandon the opportunity to have completely redundantignition.  Having discarded the stock EFI the stock electronicignition went with it, so a new ignition system was called for. Crook is an electronics guy by trade so he developed his ownignition modules. ( he will sell them at close to cost)Cooling:  Center of Gravity considerations precluded adding abelly scoop for radiators.  Crook used the empty space in theRV-4s cheek cowls for his radiators.  He used automotiveairconditioning evaporator colers as radiators "they're not thebest radiators you can buy, but they're the best $5.00 radiatorsyou can buy."  The rotors are oil cooled and 1/3 of total engineheat leaves by way of the oil.  It is essential to keep oil tempbelow 210 degrees (measured after the oil cooler).  Otherwiseyou will degrade the rubber oil seals on the sides of therotors.  Crook used the standard Mazda oil cooler.  Laterengines have an electric cooling oil bypass valve for the rotorcooling.  This is to warm the engine up faster to reduceemissions.  Failure of this valve could lead to grief.  Removeit.Exhaust:  The exhaust temp is about 200 degrees hotter than in apiston engine.  Crook used 1-3/4 inch 321 stainless steel forhis exhaust.  He fiddled with tuning the exhaust, but at the Hphe will be operating he found no significant advantage andinstalled an untuned exhaust.  For 1986 engines or later anengine installed in the car with a turbo can be run without theturbo.  Crook recomends 1986 or later engines.  The engine isLOUD without a muffler, but is quite quiet with a mufflerinstalled.Intake:  Many Mazda's will tune intake.  Crook didn't.  Hisintake runners are less than an inch.  The stock Mazda enginehas a valve within the block in the intakes that will restrictflow under certain conditions to accelerate flow and improve lowend torque.  This is not needed in the aircraft and a failedvalve could cause engine damage.   Crook glued these open withhigh temp epoxy.The gasket in the rebuild kit is thicker than the one from thefactory.  The oil sealing o-ring isn't.  This spaces the facesfarther apart and leads to failure of the o-ring.  Crook says todisregard the gasket and use standard gasket glop instead.Crook now published a newsletter on Mazda conversion, and also amanual on his conversion.  He will also sell ignition modules.His planes's number is N84TC.Mazda Rotary Aviation Newsletter1936 Nugget Dr. Clearwater, FL 34615-1671813-447-695671175.606@compuserve.comOne year's subscription (6 issues) $12.00 US Payable to TracyCrook.Aviator's Guide to Mazda Rotary Conversion $35.00I plan to buy the book and subscribe to the newsletter.-- Dave Munday  -  mundayde@miavx1.acs.muohio.edu  -  munday@nku.eduPP-ASEL  -  Tandem Flybaby Builder  -  EAA-284 (Waynesville, OH)Those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who do not. <= Aircraft | Wankel Home | => Mazda Conversion Refs. | => => Mid-West Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr.

Those pagesshould be consulted before proceeding with the rest of this page, whichmostly consists of diverse related information. In 1994 a Mid-West Aero engine was mentionedinstalled in a Cessna 150 general aviation plane. A Mid-Westwater-cooled Wankel rotary in an 18m ASH-26E has now completed itscertification in Germany. An engine has also been used by Glaser Dirks in a motorglider. A net correspondent reported that it was announced in SportAviation that a Mid West 100 lb 90-100 hp engine has beencertified under JAR. Price might be around $10,000. The University of Birmingham School of Manufacturing and MechanicalEngineering Power TransmissionLaboratory (PTL) is investigating rotary engines, beginning with "aseal-less Wankel engine, which has developed into an Advanced WankelEngine Concept project" (AWEC) in cooperation with Mid-West "to developan adiabatic engine of greater performance" over the period 1994-97. The AWEC project seeks to attack the apex and side seal problems ofthe Wankel engine by finding a way of eliminating them. For aircraftapplications, the PTL is also conducting research into combining thecounterbalance weight into the shaft speed reduction gearbox to achievean overall reduction in weight. PTL is looking into multi-rotored andbanked Wankel engines. Mid-West is headquartered in Staverton, England, about 50 km ESE ofBirmingham.

Mid West Engines Ltd. located at Gloucestershire Airport, Staverton,near Gloucester, has just confirmed satisfactory completion of thedevelopment of its GAE100R rotary engine for light aircraft. This wasrecognized on February 1st, 1996, by the official presentation to theCompany by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the engine'sCertification to JAR-E for Full Public Transport Category. The Mid West rotary engine is based on a design conceived by Felix Wankel in the 1930's although the firstfunctional prototype was not completed until the 1950's. Many companieshave investigated the potential of the Wankel rotary engine but only theJapanese automobile company Mazda has it inseries production by fitting it to the high-performance RX-7 sports car. Mid West, attracted by the low vibration / high specific output ofthe rotary engine, continued a development programme in 1994 to adaptthe basics of the Norton rotary motorcycleengine for manned-flight applications. The rotary engine has only three maincomponents; the main housing is machined internally to an algebraicformula conceived by Wankel, referred to as an epitrochoid, and bearinga resemblance to a fat figure-of-eight. The rotor is triangular in shapewith convex flanks and runs on an eccentric portion of the outputshaft. An internal gear on one end of the rotor engages with a fixedtiming gear on an end housing, ensuring the correct orbital motion ofthe rotor. Due to the reduction ratio of this gearing, the rotor spinsat only one third of the speed of the output shaft. Spring-loaded seals at each of the threecorners of the rotor rub on the surface of the epitrochoid and separatethe individual phases of combustion occurring on each flank of therotor. As the rotor sweeps around inside the housing, each flank sees avarying volume between itself and the housing and creating theconventional phases of the four-stroke cycle: Induction : Compression :Expansion : Exhaust. This sequence of events is occurring on each flank of the rotor andresults in a total of three power impulses for each complete revolutionof the rotor or one power impulse for every complete revolution of theoutput shaft. In this respect, power delivery is similar to that of atwo-stroke engine. In a sequence similar to an axial-flow turbine engine, gases in therotary engine flow in one direction only; inducted gases following thedirection of rotor rotation through compression and then expansion toexhaust. Thus the induction / compression section of the rotor housingremains relatively cool whereas the expansion / exhaust section is muchhotter and requires careful management of cooling. Early automobileengines suffered excessive rotor seal wear due in part to differentialexpansion caused by this variation distorting the ideal machinedprofiles. New and improved materials are now available, and solutionsdeveloped by MWE using the latest technology have overcome the problemsresulting in a power unit lighter than a conventional reciprocatingengine, giving a long life between overhauls, and of particular interestfor aircraft applications. An almost unique feature of the Mid West rotary engine is that thetorque curve is flat over a very wide speed range. As horsepower iseffectively torque multiplied by speed, greater speed produces morepower, although as speed increases, internal losses (friction etc.) alsoincrease. However, the results of speed increases on reciprocatingengines can result in dramatic failures as stress levels multiply. Purerotary motion and near perfect dynamic balance of the Mid West engineensure that increasing speed does not cause significantly increasedstress levels. In practice, limiting speeds of Mid West engines areestablished as a satisfactory balance between power output and an enginelife with a high margin of safety. Reduction gearboxes fitted as an integral part of Mid West rotaryengines and incorporating torsional dampers, allow the propeller to turn relatively slowly. The reduction ratio of the twin-rotor GAE100R unit,for example, allows the propeller to experience six power impulses perrevolution. That sort of power from a conventional direct-drive wouldrequire a twelve cylinder four-stroke engine to achieve the samesmoothness of delivery. Similarly the single rotor GAE50R can be equatedto a six cylinder, direct-drive engine. Any vibration which may be feltfrom a Mid West engine can almost certainly be attributed to imbalancein the propeller. The GAE50R single rotor engine produced by Mid West carriescertification to JAR-22 and is being purchased by Alexander Schleicherfor the ASH 26 powered sailplane; to date, more than 120 units have beendelivered. The engine delivers 50 BHP at 7,500 rpm and is also suitablefor microlights, ultra-lights, etc. Liquid cooling of the main engine castings, patented forced-aircooling of the rotor internals, precisely metered oil flow to thebearings, and a sophisticated high energy duplicated ignition system allcontribute to the quality and reliability of the engines. Mid West,drawing on experience of many thousands of hours of development testingand on experience from their customers, are confident that their rotaryengines, designed, developed, and built by a small team at Staverton andaccredited by the CAA, are the best in the market. Technical specifications are available for two engines: Type GAE 100 R Certification to JAR - Eand Type AE 50 R Certificationto JAR - E. Mid-West is headquartered in Staverton, England, about 50 km ESE ofBirmingham.

As far as I know, it has been manufacturedcontinuously since 1971 or earlier, though it was some time later thatthey could be imported into the US because a license needed to benegotiated with Curtiss-Wright. Clarence Lee wrote in RC Modeler magazine at that time "to say I wasvery surprised and impressed with the performance of the engine would bean understatement. ...this one really hauls!" (RC Modeler Magazine). Rotor and housings are steel. Power is remarkable, evocative of engines in the range of .35 to.45, which is good because it weighs more than the average .30.Operation of the engine is very smooth. The engine responds well tomuffling and is very quiet. The engine starts more easily if it is"quite wet", which make sense for sealing.

The University of Birmingham School of Manufacturing and MechanicalEngineering Power TransmissionLaboratory is investigating rotary engines, beginning with "aseal-less Wankel engine, which has developed into an Advanced WankelEngine Concept project" in cooperation with Mid-West "to develop an adiabatic engine of greaterperformance." They are also working on an oscillatory rotary engine(ORE) (cat-and-mouse principle). The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is a large research facilitythat has numerous automotive projects. At the end of its 1995 AnnualReport section on Engines, Fuels, Lubricants,and Vehicle Systems they remark about their contribution to ARPAresearch in hybrid electric vehicles using natural gas: "Rotary andturbine engines are [also] being investigated because they are able togenerate even higher power for a given engine density, and they canprovide significant reductions in scale and emissions." On another pagethey show an image of a hybridelectric bus which apparently has a rotary engine. It was reported in 1992 that research is continuing at Wankel R&D inLindau, Germany, under Dinkwort Eiermann. This may be funded to someextent by Daimler Benz.

Dave Klingler reports remembering that "Duncan Aviation used toproduce a single rotor version of a [Mazda] 12A, essentially a 12A cutin half". The weight may have been around 160 lbs, and power about90-100 hp with tuned exhaust. Duncan is a controversial figure.Klingler continues "I knew him [Dan Duncan] for a short time, and aroundme he was an extremely honest man and a wealth of information aboutaviation rotaries." MichaelKraus lists many aircraft engines. 111 piston engines have powerand weight figures. The power to weight ratios (hp to lb) vary from0.33 to 0.86, and the average is 0.604.

May 25, 1996 We find ourselves at a flexion point in the path of the RotaryCombustion Engine (RCE). The 1996 RX-7 hasbeen canceled in North America, but not necessarily the line, thoughrecent word is grim. The RX-01 concept caris an excellent continuation of Mazda's aggressive and purist approachto the sports car. Consider what has been accomplished. The RCE powered the firstJapanese car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.It has set a world land speed record for its class at 384 kph or 238mph. A model RCE has been in production for over 25 years. The enginehas been adapted to hydrogen fuel andDiesel operation. Over one million RX-7sports cars have been produced with rotary combustion engines. These milestones have been achieved in about one third of thedevelopment time of five major propulsion systems, three of which areinternal combustion piston engines (Figure). The history is even moresevere since development has mostly been driven by two companies: NSU and Mazda, while the dozens of other companieshave almost exclusively focused on piston engines. Furthermore, theRCE has been excluded or penalized by most if not all racing bodies,strangling research and development. Four manufacturers currently produce engines (Mazda, Moller, MidWest, and OS/Graupner) that are beinginstalled in cars, boats, planes, powered lift craft, and toys. The 5cc OS/Graupner Wankel model engine holds two distinctions: the smallest,and the longest in production. Unfortunately, the first three are intransient positions. Mid West is the result of several corporateresuscitations and reorganizations. Moller is newly manufacturingengines. Mazda is losing money and has to answer more and more to Ford. What of the future? The Mazda RX-01 with MSPRE engine is an obviouscandidate to turn into a sports car that I believe would sell well ifthe price were reasonable. Mid West and Moller engines have thepotential to perform well in aircraft applications. One of the more interesting potentials is the Ultra Low EmissionsHydrogen RCE. It provides the best combination of high performanceand low emissions. Alan Marr. Wankel Home | => Mazda RX-01 Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedMay 25, 1996.

Alternatives to the Alternative Engine The Wankel rotary combustion engine can be considered as thealternative four phase engine. Here are some rotary engines other thanWankels that can be grouped as the Rand Cam andmiscellaneous. Rand Cam The Rand Cam RotaryDiesel engine is perhaps the main alternative to the Wankel typeRCE. It uses sliding vanes, but manages to avoid valves. Testing beginsin April. Evaluation and improvements have been contributed by CIRA, W. VirginiaUniversity. A technical article is referenced through one of the EREN search pages. Lockheed Martin is developing a rotary powered Unmanned AerialVehicle for tactical reconnaisance. The page linked in the nextparagraph indicates this might be a Rand-Cam. The engine will have tworotors, "large displacement", stratified charge, oil cooling, and willtake heavy fuel (JPG-5 and 8). The advantages needed are high power toweight ratio, low vibration at 6000 rpm, and low parts count forlogistic simplicity. Rand-Cam and Alliant TechSystems propose to power a UAV with this engine. Miscellaneous (alternatives tothe alternative to the alternative engine) The site for Thalo is an example of what allalternative technology sites should be: clear and informative. They do notattempt to be mysterious like so many other sites. There are cleardiagrams, detailed explanations, and an animation showing the principleof operation. The design uses a four-stroke cycle to drive five pairsof opposed pistons in an air-cooled frame that rotates. As of June 1996they have yet to produce an engine. The design is also to be appliedto pumps. The Cir-Com Goodman Circular Rotary Engine was invented by William A. Goodmanwho was awarded patent 5,036,809 on Aug. 6, 1991, which he assigned toCir-Com Development Corporation. It seems there is a full scale modelin existence to simulate the engine, and several proposed designs. Thesite does not explain the principles of operation but has severalinteresting pictures. It appears to be a multi-bladed design. You areinvited to send them money to find out the specifications. They areseeking investors. Oldrich Nos mentions his ContinuousCombustion Rotary Engine invention. Stefan Bakos has invented what he calls the CompulsoryRotary Engine. It has US Patent 3,863,611. He claims it is freefrom pollution, its filtered output being water, air and oxygen.Neither the page nor the image give a clear explanation, so it can't bedetermined how it relates to the Wankel engine. There appear to be fourrotors with three lobes, but the apexes are greatly rounded. Thepicture shows an air intake system reminiscent of the RX-7 Turbo IIintercooler. It has writing that appears to say 1782 cc. The RVICE Rotary VaneInternal Combustion Engine (RVICE) does not have a working model inexistence, nor even a name of a person on the page to take credit forthe design, though the keywords "Dana Michael Inman" do appear in veryfine print. By the anonymous inventor's own evaluation it appears to besimilar to an earlier Bancroft design, who did build some prototypes. PerlexInc. Rotary Power Engine. This is not a Wankel rotary engine but isinstead a variation, rooted in the Ramelli device from Italy, 1588.This page is simply text, probably a press release about a test onNov. 1, 1985. The Newbold powerplant is said to be a turbo reciprocatingrotating-block engine. I found out by starting at one of the EREN search pages. Koichi Hirata has invented a Rotary DisplacerStirling Engine. Pangman has invented a rotating vane engine. I found a reference atone of the ERENsearch pages. The "something for nothing" folks are at it again. Hartmann hasresuscitated an article from Popular Mechanics June 1979 that describesa mis-named "magneticwankel motor". The inspiration for the wankel designation is thestator that has an air gap that varies from 0.1 mm to 5 mm away from thecircular rotor. It is claimed to use less current than conventionalmotors. It has no connection to Wankel shapes or principles. Marginal or Related Interest William Chui has written a few pages about FranzReuleaux which are mildly interesting to those with a geometricalbent, though there is a slight confusion about what constitutes a Wankelrotary engine (RVICE creeps in). Also, according to my reading ofAnsdale, the Wankel rotor is not a Reuleaux triangle. "Calculus Projects Using Mathematica", Revised Edition. Just the tableof contents. Apparently has a chapter on the Wankel Rotary Engine. Broken Links There was a good rotary power page from Australia.

May 25, 1996 We find ourselves at a flexion point in the path of the RotaryCombustion Engine (RCE). The 1996 RX-7 hasbeen canceled in North America, but not necessarily the line, thoughrecent word is grim. The RX-01 concept caris an excellent continuation of Mazda's aggressive and purist approachto the sports car. Consider what has been accomplished. The RCE powered the firstJapanese car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.It has set a world land speed record for its class at 384 kph or 238mph. A model RCE has been in production for over 25 years. The enginehas been adapted to hydrogen fuel andDiesel operation. Over one million RX-7sports cars have been produced with rotary combustion engines. These milestones have been achieved in about one third of thedevelopment time of five major propulsion systems, three of which areinternal combustion piston engines (Figure). The history is even moresevere since development has mostly been driven by two companies: NSU and Mazda, while the dozens of other companieshave almost exclusively focused on piston engines. Furthermore, theRCE has been excluded or penalized by most if not all racing bodies,strangling research and development. Four manufacturers currently produce engines (Mazda, Moller, MidWest, and OS/Graupner) that are beinginstalled in cars, boats, planes, powered lift craft, and toys. The 5cc OS/Graupner Wankel model engine holds two distinctions: the smallest,and the longest in production. Unfortunately, the first three are intransient positions. Mid West is the result of several corporateresuscitations and reorganizations. Moller is newly manufacturingengines. Mazda is losing money and has to answer more and more to Ford. What of the future? The Mazda RX-01 with MSPRE engine is an obviouscandidate to turn into a sports car that I believe would sell well ifthe price were reasonable. Mid West and Moller engines have thepotential to perform well in aircraft applications. One of the more interesting potentials is the Ultra Low EmissionsHydrogen RCE. It provides the best combination of high performanceand low emissions. Alan Marr. Wankel Home | => Mazda RX-01 Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedMay 25, 1996.

Felix Heinrich Wankel (1902-1988) Felix Wankel was born August 13, 1902 in Lahr in the Black Forest inGermany, an only child of Rudolf Wankel(1867-?), a senior forestry official (Grossh. Bad. Oberfoerster)subsequently killed by schrapnel at Dornach (Elsass (Alsace?)) in WorldWar I as an Oberleutnant, and Martha GertrudHeidlauff (1879-?). Dr. Wankel passed away on October 9, 1988,Lindau, W. Germany, where he did much of his research and whereWankel R&D is located. Wankel left school at the age of 19, but he gained academicrecognition within his own time when he was awarded an honorarydoctorate degree from Technische Universität München in 1969.His first job was apprenticing in sales for a publisher in Heidelberg,but he devoted his energy to tinkering, especially after losing thesales job in 1924. Wankel's first attempt to receive a patent was in 1926 for a "greaseturbine", but it was predated by an Enke design from 1886. In 1933 heapplied for a patent for a DKM engine, whichhe received in 1936. In the following years, Wankel mostly made his way by ingenious workon rotary valves and sealing technology for BMW, DVL, Junker, andDaimler-Benz. During this time he developed various DKM prototypes andalso rotary pumps and compressors. After the end of the war in 1945 his development was interrupted,but by 1951 he interested NSU in development. This lead tocollaboration with Walter Froede, head of the motorcycle racing program,who would ultimately make the decision to adopt the KKM type. The first truly functional Wankel rotary engine was a DKM type thatran in February 1957. By May a prototype was able to run for two hoursand produce 21 bhp. The first KKM engine ran on July 7, 1958. There are Felix-Wankel-Strasse streets in Heilbronn, Dachau, andNeckarsulm, all in Germany. Dr. Wankel had a strong impulse towards animal welfare. What is the Felix Wankel TierschutzForschungspreis? I think this an Animal Protection Research Prizeawarded in 1995, 10/95,and 1996. An "Encyclopedia" entry. Also born on August 13 are: John Logie Baird (1888-1946), the Scottish engineer who was thefirst to televise pictures of objects in motion. Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980), the film director.

Hiroshima-basedMazda is the only automaker in the world tomass-produce rotary engines, which are more compact and high-poweredthan piston engines but have high fuel consumption. Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Mazda is studying the possibilityof halting production of the engine, quoting remarks by Ronald Leicht,Mazda's senior managing director, who said the engine's fate will dependon customer needs. Leicht came from Ford Motor Co. of the United States,which owns 24 percent of Mazda and is pushing for restructuring of theJapanese automaker. Mazda denied the report as "totally groundless." A Mazda spokesmansaid the firm has exhibited a new model, the RX-01, carrying a rotary engine at the Tokyo MotorShow in October. Mazda is considering putting the RX-01 on sale in thefuture and is also developing a new rotary engine using hydrogen fuel. The complete story is inThe Japan Times, Feb. 20, 1996. Source of Rumour Mazda May Stop Making Rotary Engines Nikkei News Service 02/20/96 01:30 JST Mazda Motor Corp. may stop producing rotary engines, Vice PresidentRonald Leicht, who is responsible for domestic sales, has told The NihonKeizai Shimbun. Mazda is the only automaker in the world to make rotaryengines. Leicht implied that Mazda will stop production unlessprospects improve for sales of the RX-7 sports car, which is equippedwith rotary engines. However, only consumers can decide the fate of the engines, Leichtsaid. Stopping production is expected to reduce annual expenses by severalbillion yen, with over 50 workers engaged in development and designreassigned elsewhere. Mazda, which set up a marketing headquarters in January, will make afinal decision this year following the reconsolidation of its sports carbusiness with Ford Motor Co., a top Mazda shareholder. Mazda assembled 5,000 rotary engines in 1995, against a peak of240,000 in 1973. <= <= Recent and Current | Wankel Home Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr. This update notice was last updatedApril 20, 1996.

The Ford executive, who will takeover as Mazda's presidentnext month, said Ford was not aiming to swallow up the Japanesefirm and wanted to maintain Mazda's separate identity. The twofirms have a long-standing relationship. ``It is not a strategy (to let Mazda disappear). It is astrategy to build Mazda,'' Wallace, who was brought in by Fordtwo years ago to help run financially troubled Mazda, told anews conference. Hiroshima-based Mazda has been struggling to overcome slow exportsdue to the strong yen and poor domestic sales. Ford announced last monththat it would increase its equity investment in Mazda in a deal underwhich Wallace, currently executive vice president at Mazda, will takethe helm of Japan's fifth largest carmaker in June. The equity dealgave Mazda a 52.31 billion yen ($498 million) capital infusion andraised Ford's stake to one-third from one-quarter. Mazda has forecastnil net profit for the year that ended March 31 after reporting parentnet losses of almost 80 billion yen ($761 million) in the two yearsbefore that. Wallace said earnings details and the forecast for the current yearwould be released next week, when the company issues its financialstatement. He said Mazda was making progress toward profitability bycost-cutting and restructuring, but that it still had a long way to gobefore achieving its profit goals. "I think we are making progress,"he said, but added: "We are at a threshold ... We have a long time togo before we would be at a (profit) level I would be comfortable with." Wallace said both Mazda and Ford could benefit from varioussynergies, such as in sales and distribution or in eliminatingduplication. ``But frankly, we haven't sat down with Ford to talk withthem,'' he added. He said there would be a quarterly meeting at the endof this month, but added that he did not expect any major decisions onthe synergies. Wallace said Mazda would focus on building up its Japanese businessand put more of an emphasis on production overseas. The company alsowould continue to strengthen its business in North America, Europe, Asiaand Latin America. Wankel Home | => Ford Tightens Embrace (April 12) Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr.

LaRX-7 de 1996 pour Amérique du Nord a été cancelé.Le reportage n'est pas optimiste. Le véhicule conceptuelle RX-01 continué l'approach pure et aggressif deMazda au voiture sportif. Réfléchissons sur les accomplissements. Le MRC agagné le 24 Heures Du Mans. Il afaites un record mondiale de 384 kph. Un modèle MRC aété fabriqué pour plus que 25 années. Le moteur aété adapté au gaz hydrogène et la mode Diesel. Plus qu' unmillion de voitures sportif RX-7 aété manufacture avec les moteurs rotatoire à combustion. Ces accomplissements a été accompli en circa un troisiemede temps de développement des systemes majeur de propulsion (troissont moteurs à combustion internal avec piston). Régardez lafigure. L' histoire est même plus sévère parce que ladéveloppement a été faites par deux companies pour laplus part: NSU et Mazda, quand les douzens d'autres companies a concentré exclusivement sur les moteurs piston.De plus, les moteurs rotatoire a être exclué ou penalisé.Ca a l'effet d' étranglé la récherche etdéveloppement. Quatre companies faites moteurs maintenant: Mazda, Moller, MidWest, and OS/Graupner. Ils sontinstallée en voitures, bateaux, avions, et jouets. The 5 ccOS/Graupner Wankel moteur modèle est la plus petits et la plus longde production. Malheureusement, les trois premiers se trovent danssituations transitoire. Mid West est nouvellement revenir à lavie. Moller a commencée fabriquer moteurs. Mazda perd monnaie etdois repondre plus en plus à Ford. Quelle avenir? La Mazda RX-01 avec MSPRE moteur est un candidatefort pour tourné à voiture sportif que je crois veux vendebien si la prix etais raisonable. Mid West et Moller a la potential deperformer bien en avions. Un des plus interessant potentials est le MRC Hydrogen pourExtremêment Bas Émissions. Ils faits la plus bellescombinaison de haute performance et bas émissions. Alan Marr. Je souhait quelqu'un peut perfectionne mon traduction. Wankel Home | => Mazda RX-01 Copyright © 1996 Alan Marr.

The school gives these children and their parents a beneficial option -- the gifts of speech and a mainstream education which the auditory/oral method offers. Enrollment is open to children in Missouri, Kansas and surrounding states without regard to race, religion, gender or financial means. Parent-Child Early Intervention Nursery Class Preschool Cochlear Implant Rehabilitation Support Services: Evaluations, Advocacy & Audiology Staff Admissions Parent Handbook Academic Calendar Monthly Newsletters Kansas City related links Parent-Child Early Intervention The diagnosis of an infant's deafness is a most painful time for parents, but also the time of greatest hope. The earlier a child's residual hearing is stimulated by speech, the faster and further language will progress. This is why St. Joseph's offers a specialized early intervention Parent-Child program. As we support and counsel parents in coping with their child's diagnosis, we also guide them in their role as the child's first and most important teachers of language. For toddlers up to approximately age 2 1/2, parents and child together attend individual one-hour sessions one or more times a week. Through social, motor and cognitive activities, parents learn to assist in developing their child's auditory/verbal skills in the home. Nursery Class A three morning a week nursery class offers children ages 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 a fun and effective combination of activities to stimulate their development. In small classes, they develop group interaction experiences while enjoying age appropriate activities. Part of the day includes individual speech and listening therapy for each child. Preschool Academic , language and developmental class activities of an age-appropriate level are conducted in a full-day, five day a week preschool program. The preschool generally enrolls children between the ages of 3 1/2 and 5. Inclusion of children slightly younger or older is considered, based upon individual evaluations. As socialization, motor and cognitive skills continue to develop, the children advance into a more concentrated academic and speech program. The curriculum is designed to prepare them for kindergarten and primary classrooms, either in the mainstream or in a dedicated deaf-education setting. Cochlear Implant Rehabilitation Educational and speech rehabilitation therapy is offered on an individual basis for cochlear implanted children of all grade school ages. As a pioneer in the development of post-implant language therapy, St. Joseph's program offers a level of expertise and experience unsurpassed in the nation. Through phonetic discrimination and auditory comprehension drills, therapists teach implanted students how to decode newly available sounds and translate them into improved speech and language. Private therapy sessions of one-half hour to an hour are offered by appointment during regular hours or after school. Support Services: Evaluations, Advocacy & Audiology St. Joseph's offers educational and psychological support services through its staff and adjunct professionals within the Kansas City area. Full academic, speech and psychological evaluations are available as part of the school's admissions process. St. Joseph's educators can also serve as advocates on behalf of hearing impaired children. We will help develop IEP's and/or offer our attendance and advocacy at IEP hearings. Complete audiological services for our students are available through Midwest Ear Institute and other associated providers. Staff The distinctive, child-centered spirit that has been the hallmark of St. Joseph's for more than 150 years - familial warmth and assured professionalism - is embodied in the staff of St. Joseph's - Kansas City. The school's full-time faculty are degreed educators of the deaf and speech, listening and language therapists. They are experienced in and committed to auditory/oral education. Highly qualified in their own right, these professionals team up with one of the most renowned faculties and centers of auditory/oral leadership at St. Joseph Institute's St. Louis campus.

We -- as faculty, board management and support personnel -- work together to give the gift of spoken language to those who would otherwise not know it. The Institute's teaching resources are first applied in the earliest stages of language development, always in a teaching partnership with parents. Preschool and primary programs combine general education with an intensive program for language development. A residential option attracts students from communities across the nation where no age-appropriate auditory/oral programs exist. Since we seek to have our students effectively mainstreamed into society, our formal curriculum concludes at the end of the eighth grade. Continuing educational guidance and family and child support programs extend through the high school and college years. St. Joseph Institute's 158 year history and international reputation impose obligations of continued leadership: an involvement in educational research, the prudent incorporation of biomedical and technical advances and the professional development of educators of the deaf. The Institute's environment combines familial warmth with assured professionalism. While our work is ecumenical, we bring to it a distinctive Catholic spirit, reflecting the values and traditions of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. These values are evident in our commitment "to serve those who would otherwise be unserved." To this mission we dedicate our energies and those resources which our benefactors generously provide.

The Schools success is just as remarkable -- 97% of its graduates go on to mainstream high schools and 93% attend college. Many earn graduate and professional degrees. One is on the White House staff. Yet, numbers alone cannot measure the help, the hope and the happiness that St. Joseph's has given to generations of children and their parents. There is a singular, proud theme to St. Joseph 's 150-year history: doing one thing uncommonly well, with dedication and love. In 1837, two Sisters of St. Joseph came to frontier St. Louis from Lyon, France at the request of Bishop Joseph Rosati. They came to open a log cabin school for "the education of mutes." It became the first school for deaf children west of the Mississippi. The Sisters devoted their lives to this work without fully realizing that St. Joseph's would achieve the international recognition the School enjoys today. They responded to a call to serve, that hearing impaired children might be able to hear and answer their own calls to happiness. In 1934, St. Joseph's took a bold step, forsaking the manual communication of the day to embrace the auditory/oral philosophy it has championed to this day. Today, St. Joseph's faculty is a diverse, highly trained and broadly experienced group of educators. But they are no less committed to the Institute's historic mission. St. Joseph's is one of only three auditory/oral schools in the U.S. offering a residency option. The School has attracted students from over 40 states and many foreign countries. Dozens of families move to St. Louis to enroll children in the School. In addition to the superb education, there is the home-like setting of a 10-acre suburban campus and the personal concern of the Institute's faculty and staff. A private, non-profit school, St. Joseph's is open to all children without regard to race, religion, sex or the family's ability to pay. Financial aid is available to all who evidence need. St. Joseph's continues to break new ground in the advancement of deaf education. In the early 1980's it became a pioneer in early intervention of hearing impaired infants with the opening of a formative speech center that teaches parents how to be their child's first teachers of language. In 1983, the Institute came to the forefront again with its cochlear implant rehabilitation program, now the nation's largest. Over the past decade, St. Joseph's has responded to this biotechnical breakthrough with educational services designed specifically for implanted students. The School is actively involved in educational research. It was selected as the primary participant in a multi-year Indiana University study of speech improvement in cochlear implanted children. St. Joseph's is a teacher of teachers. The Institute serves as a practicum center for up to 50 undergraduate teachers of the deaf, speech pathology and audiology students each year. Professional educators from such countries as Italy, Argentina, Canada, and Australia regularly visit the School to study its methods. Although proud of these contributions to research and training, St. Joseph's is, first and foremost, a school that teaches deaf children. It is not, however, a school for deafness. Its model programs exist to help hearing impaired children become self-determining adults who will have a voice in their future.

Often, medical science cannot identify the cause of deafness, let alone prevent or cure it. The diagnosis of a child's deafness is a most painful time for parents, but also the time of greatest hope. The earlier a child's residual hearing is stimulated by speech, the faster and further language skills progress. That is why, in 1981, St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf established its Molloy Parent-Child Center. The Center works exclusively with young children from birth to five years of age, offering formative language therapy in the auditory/oral philosophy. The Center also helps hearing children who have delayed speech and language. But this is truly a parent-child program. Parents are supported and counseled as they cope with the normal range of emotions and demands accompanying their child's diagnosis. The Center's staff instructs parents in their role as the child's first and most important teachers of language. For toddlers up to age three, parents and children attend weekly one-hour sessions together in the Molloy Center. Parents learn to assist the child in developing auditory-verbal communication skills through social, motor and cognitive activities which the parents can continue at home. Additional sessions are conducted with the child and therapist to reinforce and expand the language growth. Children ages two to three attend the Center's Nursery program in very small groups or private sessions to receive age-appropriate therapy. SJI's pediatric audiological services are available to all Molly Center children. Molly's setting is distinct and purposeful. In a quaint stone cottage on the wooded campus of St. Joseph's, the Center is a small replica of a home, featuring a kitchen, bedroom and family room. This warm, home-like setting is comforting to children and parents alike. But it also serves an important learning function by allowing the infants to associate concepts and sounds with the object and environment of their homes. The Molloy Center has helped more than 500 children and their parents lay the early, critical foundation for future listening and speaking skills. How important can this type of program be to a child? In 1993, the National Institutes of Health determined that early detection of a hearing loss and immediate language therapy such as that offered by the Molloy Center can: increase the child's high school reading level by four grades, and increase the student's lifetime earning power by as much as $800,000. The Molloy Parent-Child Center was founded by Sr. Arline Eveld, M.Ed., P.Dipl., who, in developing this model program, drew upon her 30 years of training and experience in deaf education and the Institute's 150 years of success in helping deaf children. The Molloy Center annually provides evaluation and referral services to hundreds of parents throughout the nation, assisting them in identifying the professional and educational options available for their children. Those wishing to contact the Molloy Center by telephone can do so through St. Joseph's or by calling the Center directly at (314)991-3773.

The academic goal of the School is to move students into mainstream schools at the earliest appropriate age. However, instilling the gifts of listening and spoken language, which give our students an opportunity to reach their full academic, social and personal potential, is the true hallmark of St. Joseph's. Strong moral development is another component of this education. Proper judgment, conduct and appearance, and the values which guide them, are taught to the children and reflected in the staff. The "culture" at St. Joseph's is a balance of hard challenges and soft hearts. The School sets high expectations for its students and does everything it can to help each child achieve them. St. Joseph's is not content for its graduates to cope. They are encouraged to excel. These students meet any measure of success including, most importantly, their own. These accomplishments come gradually. The auditory/oral approach requires intense work over a long period. Students are given curricula designed to their individual needs. They are also given a lot of personal attention: the student/teacher ration is 3:1. The teaching of listening and speech never stops at St. Joseph's, regardless of time, place or situation. All faculty and staff encourage the children to constantly use oral communication. Formal speech therapy is conducted daily in one-on-one sessions, in reading class, in cochlear rehabilitation for implanted students, and in all general education courses. The academic program is organized into three departments: primary, middle and upper schools, which are equivalent to a mainstream school's grades K-1, 2-4 and 5-8 respectively. Middle and upper school operate on the departmental schedule. All students take a full complement of mainstream courses taught by trained educators of the deaf with specialties in these academic subjects. This well-rounded curriculum includes computer class, science lab, art, cognitive development, library/media center periods, physical education and field trips. A complete pediatric audiology department on-site ensures that the children have the highest quality technical assistance. The audiology department conducts diagnostic testing of each child's hearing level on a regular basis and calibrates the students' personal hearing devices as well as the School's FM systems to maintain their optimum operation levels. SJI's education offers deaf children what other children have, with one nice exception. Our students don't get in trouble when talking in class.

A dedicated program, under the direction of therapy specialists, has attracted more implanted students to SJI than any other school in America. The cochlear implant is the most advanced technology designed to transmit sound for profoundly hearing impaired persons. But without post-implant therapy, a child reaps only partial benefit from the device because it merely makes new sounds available. The child must be taught how to decode these new sounds and translate them into improved speech and language. A cochlear implant bypasses the damaged inner ear by means of a multi-channel electrode that provides auditory information directly to the brain. Not all hearing impaired children would benefit from an implant. St. Joseph's speech therapists and audiologists play a critical role in evaluating a child's candidacy for one. For those students who are candidates, a cochlear implant, along with therapy, offers the potential to significantly advance their language ability, and with it, their quality of life. Having counseled an increasing number of implanted students during the 1980's. the institute committed its resources to a formal rehabilitation program in 1987. At that time, it enrolled four implanted students. This number doubled each of the next several years until currently one-third of SJI's student body has cochlear implants. All implanted students meet individually with the director of the rehabilitation program for one half hour, every day of the school year, for up to three years. Through phonetic discrimination and auditory comprehension drills, the students learn to decode the new sounds and use them in speech formation. This is in addition to the speech and auditory training they receive in their other classes. The audiology department closely monitors the mapping of the implant as the child first gets used to new sounds and then becomes increasingly capable of processing them. The Institute maintains a strong professional relationship with a number of the nation's leading cochlear implant surgical teams. It is committed to remaining at the fore front of new technology benefiting hearing impaired children WT01-B11-83IA026-000286-B012-428http://stjosephinstitute.org:80/Mainstream.htm 207.86.133.50 19970113233347 text/html 5065HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 23:34:46 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4894Last-modified: Tue, 17 Sep 1996 07:32:30 GMT Students Entering the Mainstream Information Students Entering the Mainstream The Institute's primary academic goal is to develop in students the auditory/oral skills that will enable them to successfully continue their education in a mainstream school. The Institute not only maintains a 97% rate of success in achieving this goal, it is doing it quicker. Eighth grade graduations which featured 20 or more students in the past, have more recently been held for single-digit graduating classes. This is a result of more students mainstreaming at earlier ages. While individual students still reach this goal at different stages, ranging from kindergarten to eighth grade, all of them do it with the help of the mainstream program. To prepare a student for this climb up the educational ladder, the mainstream program provides a transitional period, helping to ensure that the eventual move is a successful one. Students enter the program when they are judged by their parents, teachers, principal and staff psychologist to be one to two years away from full-time inclusion. Over this one- to two- year period, the student spends half of the day at SJI, then is accompanied by the program coordinator to and from the mainstream school for a half day of classes. The coordinator meets with each student's mainstream teacher in advance to review the child's profile, abilities, interests and academic record. The student's individual curriculum is divided between the schools to avoid subject duplication while assuring a fully-rounded education. Course work at St. Joseph's continues to include speech therapy. The experience at the new school becomes the student's first formal use of auditory/oral training outside the environs of St. Joseph's. This experience involves a balance of academic and social inclusion since the student participates fully in all activities at the mainstream school. The program coordinator, psychologist, teachers and principal regularly evaluate each child's adjustment, academic and social. These evaluations, which include input from the mainstream teacher and the students themselves, are shared with the parents. All factors are weighed in determining the pace toward eventual full mainstreaming. Their success in this mainstream transition provides students the foundation to relate to a broader world in which they will meet their challenges and achievements.

St. Joseph's is one of only three schools of its type in the United States offering an on-campus residency program for its students, making it possible for them to receive the quality of auditory/oral education that isn't available in their home communities. While the decision to board a youngster is a difficult one, more than 30 children from 15 states and several foreign countries are enrolled at SJI as resident students by their parents. The auditory/oral education is seen as that important, and that good. The residency program can't replace a child's real home, but it has earned the confidence of these parents. Four dormitory wings spread across the 10-acre tree-shaded campus in the suburbs of St. Louis. Separate units house younger children, older boys, and older girls, along with the full- and part-time staff who care for them. These living units are connected with the rest of the School to improve ease of movement, supervision and safety. Normally, two children share a room which is brightly, comfortably, but not completely furnished. The children add the finishing touches and put their own "posterized" stamp of identity on their rooms. The children have use of TV and rec. rooms, a gymnasium, two playgrounds, a soccer field and room to run. All meals are prepared and served in a dining room that echoes with the sound of children's voices at every meal (and snack time). Child care staff must have, as prerequisites, strong character and sensitivity to the children's needs. Upon these personal traits, St. Joseph's develops its staff through daily in-service training in child care, child development, first aid, speech and language development, and supervisory procedures. This staff, along with a nurse, provides round the clock supervision. Resident life at SJI includes study time and tutoring, balanced by plenty of organized and unstructured leisure time. At all times, the children are encouraged by house parents to practice auditory/oral skills. This continuity of communication reinforces what is learned in the classroom. There is other informal teaching which the staff imparts. Good grooming, table manners, proper public behavior and other qualities children need to be taught are addressed in an ordered but loving environment. The staff uses individual care plans to address each child's special needs. These plans are written with input from parents and teachers. They note the child's strengths, weaknesses, special interests, medical or dietary needs, personality, study habits and more. The residence program is a reflection of the Sisters of St. Joseph's call "to serve those who would otherwise be unserved." It also demonstrates the national distinction which the Institute long ago earned and so consistently maintains.

To deaf children, they can mean much more. For deaf children to prosper in the broader world, they need more than the academic and communication skills described thus far. Developing other interests and talents, important to any child, particularly helps with a deaf child's transition to the mainstream. St. Joseph's broadens its students' lives with a diverse co-curricular program of after school activities. These activities offer youngsters exercise, develop new interests, stimulate creativity and provide an important release from an intense day at school. The program is open to all students, providing an extra opportunity for day and resident students to interact outside of class. It also offers a quality after-care option to working parents. The activities contained in the program include clubs, sports, and hobbies. Clubs Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs for all ages are conducted throughout the school year. They offer the traditional Scouting activities, in meetings and off campus events. In the Mission Club, upper school students gain awareness of the needs of others in the community, and they plan activities and fund-raisers to reach out and help their neighbors. The Drama Club offers creative expression in mime, make up, acting, improvisation and monologues, all culminating in a Spring performance. Sports Youngsters have the opportunity to play a variety of sports on organized teams and/or in their own backyard or gym. SJI students participate in soccer, volleyball, basketball and track leagues. In many cases, they play on or against teams which have both hearing and deaf children. Individual sports such as golf, tennis, swimming and ice skating are also part of the program. Hobbies Trained volunteers and staff lead or teach activities such as dance, music, art, magic, aerobics, gardening, collecting and martial arts.

Tens of thousands of healthy children have been born worldwide as a result of IVF. Nevertheless, it is important for all couples considering IVF to fully understand the process as well as its limitations. This document is meant to provide the relevantinformation concerning our In Vitro Fertilization(IVF) Program. We hope the pamphlet willanswer most of your questions. If you requirefurther clarification please contact the GOALProgram staff (telephone (613) 761-4100, Fax (613)724-4942, email pclaman@civich.otttawa.on.ca). BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT OVERVIEW OF IVF: In order for a pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm. Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube, an organ which joins the uterus (womb) to the ovary. However, during the process of IVF this union occurs in a laboratory after both eggs and sperm have been collected. The fertilized eggs are then transferred to the uterus to continue growth. There are six major steps in the in vitro fertilization process. All of these are done on an out-patient basis: Stimulation and monitoring of the development of ripening egg(s) in the woman's ovaries. Collection of the eggs. Collection and preparation of the sperm sample (ejaculate). Incubation of the egg(s) and sperm together inthe laboratory, to allow for fertilization and earlyembryo growth. If the sperm are of poor quality,fertilization is facilitated by injection of sperminto egg using micro manipulation techniques(ICSI). Transfer of the embryo(s) into the uterus. A two-week wait for a pregnancy or menstruation. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT IVF STAGES IN DETAIL: Stimulation of Egg Development: Fertility drugs are given to control the timing of egg ripening and to increase the chance of collecting more than one egg. At the GOAL Program, we will generally employ a combination of drugs to induce the growth of multiple egg follicles. This process is called "super-ovulation". The drugs most commonly used, GnRH agonists and menotropins are taken by daily injection. GnRH agonists are a medication used to "switch off" the patient's own hormone signals in order to prevent them from interfering with the super-ovulation process. Menotropins are a medication which consists of the natural follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) that stimulate the ovary to produce egg containing follicles. IVF nurses will teach you to administer some of the medication yourself by injection or nasally spray. Soon after menotropins treatment has started, the growth of these follicles must be monitored carefully by daily blood hormone levels and ultrasound testing. The daily blood tests will be used to monitor Estrogen levels (a hormone produced by the follicle) and commence at menotropins Day 4 or 5. Ultrasound (a diagnostic procedure which uses sound waves to produce pictures of the ovaries) will be used to assess the growth of follicles by observing their increase in size. The ultrasound technique used for this process at the GOAL Program will involve the gentle placement of a round probe into the vagina for a short ultrasound scan. (see fig. 1.) Results of these tests will allow the physicians to make the necessary medication adjustments in order to get the best follicle development. Occasionally treatment may have to be cancelled during this process if the ovary does not respond. If this occurs, a different protocol and/or starting dose of menotropins will be employed for the next IVF attempt. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Egg Retrieval: After at least 3 follicles have reached a diameter of 17 mm size on ultrasound, another hormone called HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) will be administered. This hormone initiates the final maturation of the eggs. HCG is given late in the evening with the egg retrieval (OPU) scheduled about 34 hours later. Example: April 14, HCG at 11:00 pm, April 16, OPU at 9:00 am. Patients are asked to come to the GOAL Program one hour prior to the scheduled egg retrieval. The woman is asked to change into as hospital gown and an intravenous line will be started by one of the IVF nurses. A tranquillizer will be given into the intravenous line prior to the procedure. This will make you relaxed and drowsy but will not put you to sleep. An intravenous antibiotic is also given to prevent infection. The cervix is frozen with a local anesthetic and you will be given medications to reduce the pain of the procedure. The procedure used for egg retrieval at the GOAL Program employs the same vaginal ultrasound probe that was used for follicle monitoring. An aspiration needle attached to the ultrasound probe will be advanced through the vagina and into the follicles of the ovary. The follicle fluid and eggs will be aspirated into a test tube (figure 2). The fluids are then handed off to laboratory personnel who will look at the fluid and search for an egg. After egg retrieval, the woman goes to a recovery area and may leave 2 hours later after the effects of the sedatives have worn off. As eggs are found they will be examined under a microscope. Each egg is then cultured for another 4 to 6 hours, until fully mature in its own plastic dish containing a special growth fluid (media). BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Sperm Collection: When applicable the male partner will be askedto produce a semen sample by masturbationshortly after the egg retrieval. In men who do notproduce sperm in their ejaculate, sperm willhave to be retrieved from them (MESA or TESA)which can be arranged at the Goal Program. Menwho have poor sperm quality or low numbers ofsperm may have their sperm injected into theeggs using micro manipulation techniques (ICSI).Donor sperm may be used as an option to bediscussed and arranged by one of the IVFphysicians prior to starting the IVF treatment. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT In Vitro Fertilization: After a process, in which the sperm are separatedfrom the semen, each mature egg is mixed with aproper number of sperm (usually about 50,000).If the sperm are of poor quality, fertilization isfacilitated by injection of sperm into egg usingmicro manipulation techniques (ICSI). On the following morning, eggs are examinedunder the microscope. Fertilization will beevident by the entry of sperm whose geneticmaterial will be seen as a small area in the egg,termed the male pronucleus. Similarly, the egg'sgenetic material forms a female pronucleus.These two pronuclei fuse and the fertilized eggthen begins to divide becoming what is nowcalled a preimplantation embryo (pre-embryo). BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Embryo Transfer: If fertilization is successful the pre-embryos will then be transferred into the woman's uterine cavity. A maximum of three embryos will be transferred for women less than 35 years of age and four embryos for women 35 years or older. This transfer technique is accomplished by placing the pre-embryos (in a small droplet of culture medium) inside a fine plastic tube (transfer catheter) which is then inserted into the uterus through the cervix during a vaginal examination (figure 3). The process lasts only a few minutes. Afterwards we will ask the patient to rest for two hours following which she can return home and is requested to take it easy for 1 or 2 days. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Embryo freezing and Cryopreservation: Couples who have more good embryos than they can use may have the "extras" or "surplus" frozen for their future use, provided they have signed appropriate consents PRIOR to starting their IVF therapy and have paid the necessary fees for the procedure. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Follow-up: If there is no menstrual bleeding 17 days after the embryo transfer, a blood test for pregnancy will be arranged. If the test is positive, an ultrasound examination will be arranged within the next two weeks. Once ultrasound confirms the presence of a healthy pregnancy, the IVF physician will discuss plans for pregnancy care with you. For those who live at a distance from Ottawa,telephone follow-up visits may be arranged. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT SUCCESS RATES: Normal Human Reproduction: Many people are surprised to realize that normal human reproduction is a relatively inefficient process. In a healthy couple, the probability of fertilization for any particular exposure of egg to sperm may be as high as 80%, but by the time of the first expected menstrual period after ovulation approximately one-half have miscarried. The menstrual period may not even be delayed and the couple not even realize that an early pregnancy has been lost. If a menstrual period is actually missed, as many as one-fourth of these pregnancies end in miscarriage. Thus, the probability of a live birth after properly timed intercourse through one menstrual cycle in a normally fertile couple is thought to be no higher than 20%. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT IVF Cycle: It must be acknowledged that problems can anddo arise at any point during the In VitroFertilization process. To date the rate of livebirths (per treatment started) following IVF inwell established and reputable clinics are about20% per treatment cycle. Success rates at the GoalProgram have been better than reported by theaverage IVF clinic. With these data, it must be emphasized thatsuccessful conception and childbirth cannot beguaranteed by an IVF Program, even if thecouple undergoes multiple attempts. Theprobability of success depends on many factorsincluding: the woman's age (success rates aremuch lower when over 38 years old), addictions(alcohol, smoking) and ovarian response to thestimulating medications. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Problems during IVF: Problems which may arise during IVF treatment include: A poor hormone response to the medication. If this happens treatment will be terminated before follicular aspirationcan take place. This causes IVF to be delayed to a later cycle (up to 3-6 months). The inability to obtain eggs due to the poor quality of the follicles or difficulties in egg retrieval. The retrieval of poor-quality eggs, which are not suitable for fertilization. Poor quality sperm the day it was collected, even if the samples taken previously were satisfactory. In order for the sperm to be of optimal quality, the man should not ejaculate in the 2 days prior to the retrieval. Collection of sperm must be as clean as possible, hand and penis must be carefully washed and rinsed with water before collection. Fertilization may not result in the development of an embryo, in which case no transfer will take place. Implantation may not occur. In such a case, you will have your period 12-15 days after embryo transfer. Miscarriage may occur after pregnancy has been confirmed. A tubal pregnancy may occur which may require medical and/or surgical treatment. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT POSSIBLE RISKS OF IVF TREATMENT: There are some risks and discomforts associated with the procedure. Injections: Medication injections can cause some local irritation and repeated blood testing can be associated with mild discomfort and bruising of the arm. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Medications: The "fertility drugs" may over stimulate theovary and cause some pelvic discomfort due tothe formation of ovarian cysts. Rarely, (in 2 - 3%of women) these drugs can cause so muchovarian over-stimulation that hospitalization andmedical therapy is needed. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Egg Retrieval: The ultrasound egg retrieval procedure presentsa rare possibility of infection or injury toabdominal organs or blood vessels. Althoughpain medicine (intravenous narcotics and localanesthetic) is given, some discomfort will beexperienced during the egg retrieval process. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Embryo Transfer: The transfer of 3-4 embryos not only increases thechances of a pregnancy but also increases thechance of multiple pregnancy (e.g., twins, ortriplets). For this reason not all your embryoswill be returned to you if there are more than 3 or4 of them. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT Fetal and Newborn Malformations: IVF-ET does not increase the chance of anabnormal child being born. Hundreds ofthousands of normal healthy children have beenborn worldwide form this treatment. Similar tonormal conception, two to three percent of infantsborn from IVF have some malformation orabnormality. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT TEAM APPROACH: IVF is a complicated procedure involving physicians, nurses, scientists, laboratory technologists, sonographers and counsellors. We are proud of the excellent team we have assembled to assist you throughout this process. If you experience any problems or have concerns, please let us know. BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT PSYCHOSOCIAL COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAM: The process of In Vitro Fertilization is associated with a certain degree of emotional strain. For the majority of couples, IVF represents the final hope for pregnancy after a long and difficult course of investigation and infertility treatment. The IVF process is demanding, outside your control, occurs in an unfamiliar environment, and has no guarantee of a successful outcome, all of which contribute to stress. While most couples find their way to cope with the stresses of the IVF procedure, all couples will be aware of the pressures which it places upon them. The GOAL program personnel want to ensure that your decision to enrol in the program is well informed and carefully considered. They are ready to share in your concerns. If needed, a psychologist is available to counsel or help you with stress management (no charge). BACK TO THE TOP OF DOCUMENT APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION: A.)

It has been researched over the last ten years, but its effectiveness has been demonstrated only in late 1993 in Brussels, Belgium. ICSI allows infertile couples with a severe male factor to have genetically related offspring. For more detailed information on the history and technique of ICSI click here Who is ICSI for? Severe male infertility Severe oligospermia (<1,000,000 sperm/mL) Severe asthenospermia (low motility) Absence or less than 5% fertilization rate after conventional in vitro fertilization (ordinarily associated with undetected male infertility in the semen analysis or with light to moderate infertility) In vitro fertilization after epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA: removal of sperm from the testicles using microscopic surgery). Polyspermia (more than one sperm entering the egg) in conventional in vitro fertilization. What is ICSI? This new technique facilitates laboratory fertilization via the microinjection of one sperm inside the egg. Sperm with a low motility can thus be helped to penetrate the shell around the egg (zona pellucida), and achieve sperm-egg fusion. A single living sperm, even with poor motility, can fertilize the egg. Only the microinjection aspect of this technique, done in the laboratory, differs from conventional IVF. In ICSI, the woman must follow the same procedure as for IVF with ovarian stimulation and ovum pick-up, followed by laboratory fertilization and embryo transfer after 48 hours. The micropipette containing a single spermatozoon is pushed through the zona pellucida and the oolemma into the ooplasm at 3 o'clock. Results of fertilization with ICSI Less than 15% ova damage 71% of microinjection ova will produce embryos 90% of attempts result in embryo transfer Clinical pregnancy rates: 20% per trial 25% per embryo transfer Fetal abnormality rate is the same as in the general population. Impact The wonder of ICSI lies in the fact that the pregnancy rate with this technique, for severe male infertility, is the same as with conventional IVF for tubal factor infertility. ICSI allows many infertile couples, whose only choices had been insemination with donor sperm or adoption, to become parents of their own genetically related children, thereby reducing the indications for TDI (Therapeutic Donor Insemination) and adoption.

GENERAL RESEARCH INTEREST: My general interest is on the biochemistry/physiology of spermand male reproductive cells. Three mainlines of research I have been focusing on in the last 11 years are: 1. The cell biology/biochemistry of sperm capacitation and sperm-egg interaction. This line of research has been performed since 1985 when I first joined the human In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program at Beth Israel Hospital,Boston. The information obtained from this study is pertinent to the IVF process. The present focus on this research studies is an characterization and discerning the role of sulfogalactosylglycerolipid (SGG) and its binding protein (sulfolipidimmobilizing protein 1-SLIP1) as sperm capacitation and sperm-egg interaction. See details for research support below. 2. Male contraception. I started to be interested in this line of research since I was in Thailand, my homeland country, as it is one of the most populated countries in the world. This interest was carried on when I moved to Harvard Medical School in 1981. Specifically, I was studying the molecular mechanisms of gossypol, a male contraceptive used in China, on Sertoli cells. From 1981-1987, I received a number of operating grants for this study including four from the Rockefeller Foundation and one from World Health Organization as well as one subcontract from NIH through H.G. Pars Company. I held one grant (1989-1992) on the effects of gossypol on kidney cells from the Rockefeller Foundation. In addition, it is expected that the obtained information from the study described in 1) would lead to development of immunocontraceptives and vaginal contraceptives based on molecules specific to gametes. 3. Reproductive biotechnology related to the IVF. I have developed interest in alleviating male infertility problems using laboratory procedures. This line of my research interest was funded by NSERC as well as operating fund from the human IVF program (GOAL) at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. I was in Thailand from 1975 to 1981 as a faculty member and an independent investigator in the Departmentof Biochemistry, Mahidol University. My research interest, additional to the male contraception field (as describedabove), lied in the fields of the structure of sperm chromatin (as evidenced by publications #9-11, 14-16), spermmaturation and sperm motility (as evidenced by publications #6-7, 10). These research activities were supportedby the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, World Health Organization, International Planned ParenthoodFoundation (IPPF), and the NRC of Thailand.

Relevant Experience to the Thai Canadian HRD Project: I am a Thai citizen who understands the Thai culture andlanguage very well. I have experience as a faculty member and a research scientist in Thai, American and Canadianacademic institutes. Although I have lived in North America for the past 12 years, I still keep in touch with Thai colleaguesby yearly visit, which includes seminar presentation at various universities. In addition, I had several Thai scientistsworking in my laboratory. I keep in touch with other Thai professionals in North America and serve as a task forcemember to the Association of Thai Professionals in America and Canada. Furthermore, I regularly attend internationalmeetings and conferences and have numerous connections with scientists around the world. My research activitieshave been funded both by international organizations as well as MRC Canada. My research and expertise in reproductivetechnology has allowed me to work closely with clinicians in the human In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo TransferPrograms and in clinically-oriented research projects. The clinical treatment, applied science and technology are importantfor generating revenues for sustaining the proposed Thai-Canadian HRD Project. A number of Thai scientists and clinicians have been trained in my laboratory at the Loeb Research Institute,these include Drs. Sopit Wongkham and Malivalaya Namking (participants in this Linkage Program) and clinician,Dr. Pansak Sugkraroek, Praram 9 Hospital, (a collaborative Partner Institute in this Linkage Program) Recently, I have written a Planning Mission and Visit Proposal to CIDA which was awarded to support Drs.Sopit Wongkham and Kamoltip Brown to visit the University of Ottawa (March 30, 1994 to April 12, 1994). Aftermeetings and discussions with a number of the Canadian faculty members, we have prepared this CIDA Linkage Project. Presentations at Meetings & Workshops 1.

"MNR's proposed red tape changes will ensure that $11 million in forest renewal money continues to be dedicated to our forests," said Mr. Hodgson. "Another key red tape change will improve MNR's planning on Crown land. We will maintain our ability to manage natural resources sustainably." MNR will protect forest renewal funds by amending the Crown Forest Sustainability Act to clarify that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust fund are Crown assets for forest renewal. This amendment avoids the risk of these funds being subject to federal taxation. All the money in the renewal trust fund will be available for forest renewal. This is consistent with the original intent of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act. "MNR's Red Tape changes will affect 17 pieces of legislation and eliminate unnecessary regulations. The changes are part of the government's commitment to reduce the costs of government while improving public services," Mr. Hodgson said. Changes to the Public Lands Act will improve MNR's land-use planning process for Crown land. MNR will set clear rules for appropriate, environmentally sensitive development and give industries working on Crown land more certainty about making business decisions. Changes to Ontario Parks legislation will increase the maximum fine for damaging park natural and cultural heritage and other offences to $25,000, from $5,000. Changes will also allow MNR to enforce clean-up and repair orders. Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act changes emphasize public safety, increase the level of fines, streamline the approval process for construction and repair of dams, and add the ability to issue a stop-work order consistent with protecting public health and safety. MNR will streamline forestry legislation by reducing 11 Acts to five and by repealing outdated legislation. Key elements of five Acts will be consolidated into a proposed new Forestry Act that will cover MNR's commitment to assisting forestry on private land. To help protect valuable private forests, fines are being increased for improper cutting of trees. Changes to the Forest Fires Prevention Act remove red tape from declaring Restricted Fire Zones during serious periods of forest fires. Restricted Fire Zones are a tool MNR uses to help protect public safety during forest fire emergencies. MNR proposes changes to the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act to follow up on the province's earlier introduction of changes that clearly identify flood control and the protection of provincially significant conservation lands as the provincial interest in CA matters. Participating municipalities will determine the other work of CAs. New changes to the CA Act remove the province from unnecessary intrusion into local decision-making. Changes in surveying legislation will transfer the responsibility for developing standards for monumentation to the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, whose members have the expertise and experience to administer the activity. Changes to the Mining Act will allow for the consolidation of three regulations covering the disposition of Crown-owned oil and gas into one regulation. MNR will post all its proposed Red Tape amendments on the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) registry for 45 days for public review and comment. The names of people to contact are included with each posted amendment. MNR will consider comments it receives before finalizing proposed amendments.

Many of the changes will improve the delivery of government services; others update aspects of legislation, consolidate a number of Acts into simpler, more-focused legislation and remove unnecessary regulation. In some cases, MNR used Red Tape changes as an opportunity to improve government by strengthening fines and the ability to control activities related to natural resources management. The changes will also create new opportunities for business and industry involved in resource management activities. MNR will maintain its ability to manage natural resources sustainably. This fact sheet outlines the intent of the changes to various pieces of legislation. Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA): MNR will add a clause to the CFSA to resolve tax issues between the forest industry in Ontario and the federal government. The change will clarify that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust Fund are Crown assets for forest renewal. This amendment protects forest renewal funds by clarifying that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust Fund are Crown assets for forest renewal. This will avoid the risk of these funds being subject to taxation. All the money in the renewal trust fund will be available for forest renewal. This is consistent with the original intent of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act. Forestry legislation: MNR will reduce the number of Acts related to forestry to 5 from 11. MNR will consolidate key elements of five Acts into a proposed new Forestry Act which will: incorporate parts of the Woodlands Improvement Act (WIA) covering MNR's commitment to assisting forestry on private land. MNR will repeal the WIA include parts of the Trees Act that authorize municipal governments to enact bylaws that cover what can be done with trees in a municipality. MNR will repeal the Trees Act increase fines for improper cutting of trees to help protect important forest resources on private land and increase other fines include parts of the Forest Tree Pest Control Act to provide authority for dealing with serious insect infestations on Crown or private land. MNR will repeal the Pest Control Act MNR will also repeal the Spruce Pulpwood Exportation Act and the Settler's Pulpwood Protection Act because the CFSA covers these Acts and will repeal the Forestry Workers Employment Act because current labor legislation addresses this Act. Forest Fires Prevention Act: Changes remove Red Tape from declaring Restricted Fires Zones during serious periods of forest fires. Restricted Fire Zones are a tool MNR uses to help protect public safety during forest fire emergencies. Public Lands Act: Changes clarify MNR's ability to conduct land use planning. The ministry will improve its land use planning process, set clear rules for appropriate, environmentally sensitive development and give industries working on Crown land more certainty about making business decisions. Other changes: shorten the time to sell a piece of Crown land larger than five hectares making the time frame consistent with the treatment of small lots simplify the sale of waterlots under the Act simplify the process for transferring administrative control of public land to other provincial ministries, to Crown agencies or to the federal government establish the province's ability to remove conditions on patents that restrict the right of landowners to develop natural resources on their land allow MNR to develop management agreements to use public land with government and non-government organizations simplify the setting of fees for using public land Ontario Parks legislation: Changes increase the maximum fine for damaging park natural and cultural heritage and other offences to $25,000, from $5,000, consistent with fines by other agencies. Other changes: allow MNR to enforce clean-up and repair orders define the authority of Park Wardens simplify and consolidate regulations covering activities in parks Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act: Some changes emphasize public safety and increase the level of fines. Other changes: streamline the approval process for construction and repair of dams add the ability to issue a stop-work order consistent with protecting public health and safety and with protecting natural resources allow the development of management agreements repeal sections of the Act that relate to log drives (using lakes and rivers to move timber), because the activity has not been undertaken for years use the municipal tax system to collect debts from private landowners to reimburse MNR for work it does to deal with unsafe structures around water that pose a public risk Conservation Authorities (CA) Act: Changes will follow up on the province's earlier introduction of changes that clearly identify flood control and protection of provincially significant conservation lands as the provincial interest in CA matters. The latest changes: will clarify the CA role in hazard management consistent with the provincial interest in provincial policy statements. will revise regulations on fill and construction to focus on important wetlands, shorelines and other natural hazard areas will streamline approval of CA regulations will provide municipalities in a CA watershed with at least 30 days notice of proposed budgets and levies will remove the province from involvement in CA business that is not related to the provincial interest. This includes grouping municipalities for appointment of members to a CA, enlarging a CA, amalgamating CAs, and a number of housekeeping changes. Surveying legislation: Complementary changes to the Surveys Act and the Surveyors Act will transfer the responsibility for developing standards for monumentation to the self-governing Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, whose members have the expertise and experience to administer these standards. Any proposals made by the association require government approval before implementation. Monumentation refers to physical reference points placed during the surveying of land. Mining Act: Changes will allow for the consolidation of three regulations covering the disposition of Crown-owned oil and gas into one regulation. Public Review of MNR's proposed red tape changes: MNR will post all its proposed Red Tape amendments on the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) registry for 45 days for public review and comment. The names of people to contact are included with each posted amendment. MNR will consider comments it receives before finalizing proposed amendments.

OBJECTIFS DU MRN Assurer des écosystèmes sains à long terme par la protection de nos précieuses ressources en terres, en eaux, en forêts et en faune, ainsi que de leurs fondements biologiques; Assurer la disponibilité continue et à long terme de nos ressources naturelles au profit des Ontariens et Ontariennes; soit, pouvoir léguer aux générations futures les richesses naturelles dont nous jouissons aujourd'hui encore; Protéger le patrimoine naturel et les caractéristiques biologiques d'importance provinciale; Protéger les vies humaines, les ressources et les propriétés contre les incendies de forêt, les inondations et l'érosion. Ces objectifs nécessitent l'adoption d'une démarche écosystémique pour la gestion des ressources naturelles de l'Ontario, la notion d'écosystème englobant autant les activités socio-économiques humaines que l'évolution du milieu naturel. Étant donné que la propriété essentielle d'un écosystème sain est sa durabilité, on peut aussi décrire le but du MRN comme étant d'assurer la vitalité des écosystèmes en équilibrant les exigences environnementales, économiques et sociales. Contraintes fiscales et changements rapides forcent les gouvernements à concentrer leurs efforts sur les résultats. Pour un ministère, la portée de ses responsabilités se trouvera plus clairement définie et pourra être systématiquement évaluée si les résultats attendus sont définis clairement, les priorités déterminées avec précision et les contributions de diverses activités, fonctions et stratégies évaluées avec plus de rigueur. AVANTAGES La réalisation des quatre objectifs avancés ci-dessus se traduit par des avantages considérables pour la province : écosystèmes sains milieu naturel sain et sans dangers pour les humains emplois basés sur l'exploitation des ressources stabilité des collectivités vitalité concurrentielle des industries des ressources naturelles revenus pour la province loisirs de plein air La part que contribue le MRN à chaque avantage varie d'une région de la province à l'autre. D'autres organismes gouvernementaux et d'autres secteurs de la société y contribuent également.

This includes red and white pine in protected areas, conservation reserves and areas available for logging. Forest areas where red and white pine are the dominant species (40 per cent or more of all species present on any given stand), cover 723,658 ha. In forest areas where red and white pine dominate, more than 124,000 ha are classified as old red and white pine. In these areas, MNR policy on the conservation of old growth pine will ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems, including old growth stands, are present on the landscape now and in the future. To qualify as red and white pine old growth, a forest must meet certain criteria including the presence of old trees, associated trees and other plants, and little or no traces of activities such as logging. MNR has protected 66,000 ha of old growth red and white pine - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management areas. The following table shows the total area of red and white pine forests older than 120 years that are protected in Ontario: Region Parks Conservation Reserves Total Protected Area Northwest 17,900 ha + 3,200 ha = 21,100 ha Northeast 3,500 ha + 19,000 ha = 22,500 ha South-Centre 2,400 ha = 2,400 ha No-cut Reserves = 20,000 ha Total = 66,000 ha This protection of red and white pine across its range includes 16,345 ha of old growth red and white pine forest in Quetico Wilderness Park in Northwestern Ontario, and in the Southcentral Region, 955 ha as part of 11,250 ha of protected red and white pine 81 years and older in Algonquin Park. Of the total 66,000 ha area, nearly 11,000 ha is old growth red and white pine that is protected in the Temagami area. A citizens committee, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), recommended that the government protect 12 old growth red and white pine sites in Temagami. The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on old growth. Protection and Regeneration MNR has adopted a Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red and White Pine Ecosystems in Ontario. It commits MNR to protecting representative areas of old growth red and white pine forests to allow those areas to evolve through natural ecological processes. A key feature of MNR's conservation strategy is to leave healthy old trees (120 years and older), snags (standing dead trees), dying and rotting trees on red and white pine sites after logging. MNR's goal is to ensure that a range of ages from young to old red and white pine trees are left in areas across the forested landscape. Where possible, protected areas will be surrounded by young red and white pine forest, so that the full range of ages is maintained to replace old growth in protected areas that change as a result of successional pressures such as wildfire and individual tree mortality. To ensure genetic conservation, natural regeneration, and wildlife habitat protection in red and white pine forests, MNR will leave healthy, mature seed trees in the harvested area, including some of the straightest and oldest, as well as dead and dying trees. In addition, tree tops and limbs of harvested trees are left on the forest floor to provide wildlife habitat. In addition to protection and regeneration, the conservation strategy identifies other goals: Ensuring that in a stand where it is the dominant species, red and white pine will be maintained. Ensuring that red and white pine areas are not reduced to less than current levels. Restoring red and white pine areas, guided by historical records, within the bounds of silvicultural funding at the management unit level. Ensuring an age distribution that maintains old red and white pine stands in areas across the forested landscape. Providing a sustainable supply of red and white pine to the forest industry.

This 321-ha harvest area is part of a larger, mature forest containing stands of red, white and jack pine. The Owain Lake Block is being partially logged. Significant portions of the Owain Lake Block were harvested before. It is likely that the area was harvested before the turn of the century. In addition, aerial photographs taken in 1946 show conclusively that approximately half of the block was harvested sometime between the late 1930s and the early 1940s. The Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), a citizens committee, considered Owain Lake when it reviewed sites to be protected as old growth. The government accepted the CPC's recommendations that the Owain Lake Block did not qualify as a representative old growth site that should be protected from harvest. Following extensive public consultation, the CPC recommended a land-use strategy for Temagami that included recommendations on protecting old growth red and white pine areas. The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on protecting old growth. Conservation Strategy In planning for harvesting in the Owain Lake Block, MNR has applied its Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red And White Pine Forest Ecosystems. This means that many old trees in the Owain Lake Block will not be logged in 1996 and after any future shelterwood harvests; snags, dying and rotting trees will be left standing; and tree tops and limbs will be left on the forest floor. In addition, the plan leaves 93 ha in no-cut reserves where no logging will take place. The plan permits partial logging in 228 ha of the block. Species to be harvested include jack pine, spruce, poplar and white birch, as well as red and white pine. The "shelterwood system" used in the Owain Lake Block is a widely recognized harvesting method that encourages natural regeneration by leaving healthy mature trees standing, as well as snags, tree tops and limbs on the forest floor. Temagami Old Growth Red And White Pine MNR has protected nearly 11,000 ha old growth red and white pine in the Temagami area. This includes all 12 old growth red and white pine sites that the CPC recommended for protection. Old Growth in Ontario Protected areas in Ontario where old growth red and white pine is the dominant species (40 per cent or more), cover 66,000 ha - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management units. As the dominant species on any given stand, old red and white pine cover more than 124,000 ha in Ontario. Forests containing a component of red and white pine cover almost 4 million ha in Ontario, in an area that covers much of Southern Ontario, north to Lake Temiskaming and west to an area just south of Wawa. The red and white pine range also covers an area around Thunder Bay, Dryden, Fort Frances and Kenora. Both species are common in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region.

"Our government has promised fair and common-sense principles for meeting the objectives of environmental protection in Temagami," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This land-use strategy sets up a framework that will protect the environment, improve community stability and, after years of uncertainty, get on with the job of enhancing the quality of life in the Temagami area." Through the land-use strategy, MNR will create Protected Areas that prohibit resource extraction and Special Management Areas that require careful management of resource extraction. In both areas MNR will allow and encourage recreation and tourism. These areas will provide additional protection around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Together these areas total 300,000 hectares, an area about three times the size of the 100,000 hectares of forests and waters protected in seven provincial parks in the Temagami area. The province developed its comprehensive strategy from the 39 recommendations the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) presented to the government in April.. "The CPC and predecessors spent nearly a decade undertaking extensive consultation with the public and studying land-use issues before recommending locally developed solutions," Mr. Hodgson said. The province's strategy adopts 22 of the CPC recommendations without change and adopts the other 17 recommendations with minor changes. As part of the strategy, the province will protect an additional 2,628 hectares of old growth red and white pine and will also protect the 3,520 hectare North Obabika site, which includes 939 hectares of old growth red and white pine. Protected old growth red and white pine sites will cover 10,800 hectares in provincial parks, the Lake Temagami skyline reserve and a new protection zone. "This government recognizes the importance of old growth forests. That_s why we_ve increased the area of protected old growth red and white pine," Mr. Hodgson said. "We also recognize the importance of protecting headwaters in the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater park area and through the strategy we have added the necessary safeguards." The province has also acknowledged the need to resolve outstanding issues with local aboriginal communities. To provide the opportunity for resolution, the province has set aside lands that could form part of a land claim settlement. The Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat will pursue a resolution over the next two years. "We want to improve the quality of life for all communities in the Temagami area and that is why we have included in this strategy significant measures that allow us to work out agreements with local aboriginal communities," Mr. Hodgson said.. Through the new strategy, MNR will establish four new land use zones in the Temagami area. These zones were recommended by the CPC. They are: Protected Areas where logging, mineral and aggregate extraction are not permitted Special Management Areas where resource extraction will be allowed under special prescriptions to ensure protection of significant resource values Integrated Management Areas where resource extraction and development will be carefully managed and public access will be less restricted than in the Protected and Special Management areas Developed Areas where resource management will be permitted and controlled to ensure it is compatible with other uses. MNR will also spend until September 30 working with local interests to examine a new governance structure for Temagami as part of the ministry's acceptance of the CPC recommendation on this issue. As a result of the implementation of the new comprehensive strategy, staking of new mining claims will be allowed to resume in areas identified for resource development. Following a notice period, staking will begin September 17. The notice period will be longer than the usual 60-day period to notify claim holders of the re-opening and to produce new, up-to-date maps for use by claim seekers.

Partnership to be a part of the implementation of Recommendations #28 and #32. RECOMMENDATION #13 Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources facilitate the establishment of a partnership to address parking problems and other issues at the Baie Jeanne access point to Lake Temagami. RESPONSE:Accept in principle. May be subject to meeting requirements of Class Environmental Assessment for Small Scale Projects in the future if new development is proposed. Partnership to be a part of the implementation of Recommendations #28 and #32. RECOMMENDATION #14 Council recommends that: (i) the middle of the three existing and past points of unauthorized access located on the western shore of Cross Lake be authorized for walk-in purposes; (ii) parking for up to five motor vehicles be permitted on a day-use basis at a site back from the water's edge from which it is possible to prevent vehicle access to the lake; and (iii) the Ministry of Natural Resources facilitate the establishment of a partnership of the organizations having an interest in this access to consider further options for access. RESPONSE:Accept in principle. May be subject to meeting requirements of Class Environmental Assessment for Small Scale Projects in the future if new development is proposed. Partnership to be a part of the implementation of Recommendations #28 and #32. RECOMMENDATION #15 Council recommends that an agreement be entered into between the owner of Lake Obabika Lodge and interested parties in regard to the manner in which motorized access to Lake Obabika via the lodge will be maintained in the future, and that discussions leading to this agreement be facilitated by the Ministry of Natural Resources. Council also recommends that if access to Lake Obabika via the lodge is permanently refused to the general public in the future, a planning process be initiated to assess the merits of establishing a public access point on the lake. RESPONSE:Accept. RECOMMENDATION #16 Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources increase its enforcement and restrictions on motorized public access behind the gate on the Goulard Road. Council further recommends that the lock on this gate be replaced and a security strategy by developed by the Ministry of Natural Resources. RESPONSE:Accept in principle. Issues and future access options to be reviewed during forest management planning process, as it would be in any other part of Ontario. RECOMMENDATION #17 Notwithstanding the land use classes described in the supporting documentation, Council recommends that, for the purposes of forest management, the Maximum Allowable Depletion land base be defined to include all Crown land in the management areas comprising Developed Areas, Integrated Management Areas and Special Management Areas, except for Crown land in Management Area #39, as depicted in Figure 1. RESPONSE:Accept in principle. (see attached map and legend for land uses in Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area) RECOMMENDATION #18 Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources, as part of the preparation of the forest management plan, give consideration to ways of directing a portion of the benefits from the harvesting of timber resources in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area to communities in the planning area. RESPONSE:Accept in principle; MNR to consider during the preparation of the forest management plan. RECOMMENDATION #19 Council recommends that, following timber harvesting, and in conjunction with renewal operations, treatable areas, including appropriate roads and landings associated with the cut-over area, be regenerated. RESPONSE:Accept. RECOMMENDATION #20 Notwithstanding the permitted land uses described in the supporting documentation, and the application of the Mining Act to private lands in the planning area where mineral rights have not previously been disposed of, Council recommends that the land base for mineral management include all Crown land in Developed Areas, Integrated Management Areas and Special Management Areas, as depicted on Figure 1. RESPONSE:Accept in principle (see attached Map of land use in Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area). RECOMMENDATION #21 Council recommends that work permits under the Public Lands Act continue to have application to mineral exploration and development activities initiated under the Mining Act in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area. However, in the event that regulations passed under Bill 26 limit or eliminate the application of the work permit program to these activities, Council recommends that the Minister establish an alternative regulatory instrument having equal legal force and effect that would apply to the planning area. RESPONSE:Accept. Regulations under the Public Lands Act will be developed to recognize the uniqueness of the Temagami area. In addition, any activities initiated under the Mining Act will be strictly controlled, reflecting protection that is the toughest Mining regulation in North America. RECOMMENDATION #22 Council recommends that the special management area prescription prepared for Management Area #39, which appears in the supporting documentation, be adopted. Council also recommends that the Ministries of Natural Resources and Northern Development and Mines work to identify additional significant tourism and recreation values, and develop appropriate mitigating measures for mining-related activities in relation to these values. RESPONSE:Accept. RECOMMENDATION #23 Upon approval of a land use plan, Council recommends that the Ministries of Natural Resources and Northern Development and Mines approach the holders of mining patents and Crown leases located in the planning area to seek their willingness to conform to the plan, particularly with regard to the protection of values as identified in Recommendation #22. RESPONSE:Accept. RECOMMENDATION #24 Notwithstanding the permitted land uses described in the supporting documentation, in recognition of the headwaters limits of the key rivers and lakes of the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, Council recommends that these headwater areas be Protected Areas. Council further recommends that headwaters located to the north and east of the park which are outside of the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area and in the Ministry of Natural Resources Kirkland Lake District be examined for the same protection by the Minister of Natural Resources. RESPONSE:Accept in principle (see attached map of land use in Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area). The North Lady Evelyn River headwater to the north of the Planning Area will be protected in a similar manner as Management Area #57a. The Anvil Lake/Willow Island Creek headwater to the east of the wilderness park will allow forestry and mining, subject to special conditions protecting headwaters values, to be addressed by MNR in the forest management planning process and by MNDM prior to the area being re-opened to staking. RECOMMENDATION #25 Council recommends that Protected Areas be designated as conservation reserves under the Public Lands Act. RESPONSE:Accept in principle. Designation to be reviewed as part of the Land Use Plan. RECOMMENDATION #26 Council supports the Ministry of Natural Resources' representative approach to protecting old-growth Red and White Pine and recommends accordingly that a total of 12 representative old-growth sites in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area be protected. RESPONSE:Accept. The CPC recommended protection for 44% of the old growth red and white pine area in the Temagami planning area. Preliminary work by the Ministry of Natural Resources in identifying areas of concern and additional protection has raised that number to 52% of the old growth red and white pine area. The track record of MNR is to achieve a protection level of 65% province-wide in old growth protection through forest management and other land use planning activities. Using this as a guideline, it is expected that the old growth red and white pine forested areas in the Temagami Planning Area will achieve this rate of protection. RECOMMENDATION #27 Council recommends that, following the finalization of the land use plan, a public education/communications plan be prepared to explain the approach that will be used by the Ministry of Natural Resources to manage old-growth Red and White Pine in the forest management plan identified in Recommendation #2. The public education/communications plan would provide detailed statistics and information on: the amount of old-growth in Temagami the amounts that are protected and available for management the amount available for management the amount that is eligible for timber harvesting the amount proposed for allocation in the first five-year segment of a 20-year forest management plan the amount of old-growth that would additionally be protected through the identification of areas-of-concern and inoperable areas the anticipated increase in abundance of Red and White Pine Working Groups as a result of regeneration efforts RESPONSE:Accept. The Ministry of Natural Resources recognizes the need for a public education/communications plan. RECOMMENDATION #28 Council recommends that the area described in the supporting documentation as the Temagami recreation area be identified as a basis for the marketing of tourism and recreation opportunities. RESPONSE:Accept. The province recognizes the tourism values in the Temagami area and will highlight them where appropriate. RECOMMENDATION #29 Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources facilitate the establishment of partnerships to develop and maintain the recreational values of the Temagami Recreation Area. To assist in the process of operationalizing these partnerships, Council recommends that consideration be given to developing mechanisms for revenue retention for the area. RESPONSE:Accept in principle. Revenue retention and establishment of partnerships to be considered during implementation of Recommendations #28 and 32. The province has implemented the revenue retention principle in Provincial Parks. RECOMMENDATION #30 Notwithstanding Recommendation #3, Council recommends that the Red and White Pine component contained in the viewscape of the provincial highways which pass through the planning area, be renewed and maintained, and that points of interest along the highway be signed with parking facilities. RESPONSE:Accept. The province recognizes the value of red and white pine forests in the importance of tourism values. RECOMMENDATION #31 Notwithstanding Recommendation #32, Council recommends that the exercise of Aboriginal and treaty rights by the area's aboriginal peoples explicitly be taken into consideration by the Comprehensive Planning Team as part of the formulation and implementation of the resource management plans described in Recommendation #2. RESPONSE:Accept. Resource Management Planning to be undertaken by MNR. A portion of the land base has been removed from land-use designation from which future Aboriginal land claim settlement lands will be secured. In the interim, economic development opportunities will be subject to recommendation by the Chief and Council of the Temagami First Nation and Teme-Augama Anishnabai to the Ministry of Natural Resources and/or the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines. RECOMMENDATION #32 Council recommends that a governance board be established to facilitate the implementation of the land use and resource management plans. The board would have greater authority than a local citizens committee and have representation from within and surrounding the planning area, including from the area's Aboriginal peoples. RESPONSE:Accept principle of local input. MNR staff will consult with local interests and make recommendations to Minister of Natural Resources by September 30, 1996, on resolution of governance issues. RECOMMENDATION #33 Council recommends that responsibility for land use in Management Areas #1S, #2S and #3S be transferred to the Ministry of Natural Resources - Temagami District. Council also recommends that consideration be given to adjusting the management units boundaries to be consistent with such an administrative change. RESPONSE:Accept. MNR's administrative boundaries have been adjusted to accommodate CPC concept. RECOMMENDATION #34 Council recommends that the land use classes in Management Areas #54 to #59 be adopted through their incorporation in the Ministry of Natural Resources' Kirkland Lake District Land Use Guidelines. RESPONSE:Accept. In addition, amendments to accommodate headwaters area identified in Recommendation #24. RECOMMENDATION #35 Notwithstanding Recommendations #2 and #3, Council recommends that future resource managers be required to consider all public input that relates to resource management which has been collected as part of the Temagami Area Comprehensive Planning Program. Council further recommends that the Ontario government continue to solicit the involvement of the local aboriginal community in the development and implementation of all future resource management plans. RESPONSE:Accept. The material collected by the CPC remains an important resource to the ministry. As noted in response to recommendation #31, the government has recognized Aboriginal interests in its Response. RECOMMENDATION #36 Council recommends that, in consideration of the wide range of ecological and resource values in the Temagami area, a socio-economic analysis should be conducted. RESPONSE:Accept in principle; to be undertaken in the future when budgetary resources permit. RECOMMENDATION #37 Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources, in concert with various partners, undertake steps to create greater public awareness about ecological sustainability and resource stewardship in the Temagami area, and the need to prevent the over-exploitation of the area's resources and values. RESPONSE:Accept. MNR's front-line focus is on ensuring that Ontario's natural resources are used wisely and that ecosystems are managed sustainably. The MNR business plan helps meet those goals by enabling it to better set priorities, deliver core activities, and then measure results and outcomes.MNR is focussing its core business activity on five key areas -- natural resource management; Crown land management; emergency response/enforcement; provincial parks management; and geographic information -- as part of a government-wide effort to eliminate the deficit, balance the provincial budget and create an improved economic climate that will stimulate and attract investment and create jobs. RECOMMENDATION #38 Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources, in concert with various partners, prepare materials on various issues such as ecological sustainability, resource management, conservation ethics, conflict resolution, etc., as they relate to the Temagami area. Such material should be made available to educators for use in course curricula and other settings for broad public distribution. RESPONSE:Accept. RECOMMENDATION #39 Council recommends that the land use plan be reviewed every 10 years, with provision for full public consultation, and that an amendment procedure be established. RESPONSE:Accept. Land use plans will be reviewed consistent with MNR's Land Use Planning Policy.

This fact sheet offers a chronology of those public consultation efforts, including the significant groups and decisions involved, from 1987 to the present. December 1987: The Temagami Area Working Group (TAWG) is established by then Natural Resources Minister Vincent Kerrio to review and recommend solutions to land and resource use conflicts on the Crown land area around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. January to March 1988: TAWG hosts public meetings, receives submissions from interested groups and delivers its report to the Minister. Its recommendations include making Temagami a model district in the management of its forestry, recreation, tourism and earth and life science features. It also recommended the creation of a citizens' committee to advise the government on Temagami land use and resource management issues. July 1988: The Temagami Advisory Council (TAC) is established to advise the government on land and resource management matters in the area, including advice on the construction of an extension to the Red Squirrel Road. August 1989: Then Natural Resources Minister Lyn McLeod announces the Temagami Area Comprehensive Planning Program (CPP), and sets a completion date of March 31, 1992. TAC is asked to seek public participation and develop recommendations for a comprehensive land use and resource management plan. January 1990: TAC meets with more than 25 organizations to gather comments on draft objectives it has designed to guide the comprehensive planning program. August toSeptember 1990: TAC holds open houses in seven communities to discuss the background information that will be used to prepare its comprehensive land use and resource management plan, and invites comments on a revised set of planning objectives. May 1991: Then Natural Resources Minister Bud Wildman replaces TAC with the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) to strengthen the role of local communities in the management of natural resources in the Temagami area, and extends the deadline for the comprehensive plan to March 31, 1994. The Ontario government and the Teme-Augama Anishnabai jointly establish the Wendaban Stewardship Authority (WSA) to develop a Forest Stewardship Plan for four townships at the centre of the Temagami area. July 1992: The WSA hosts a meeting with local individuals and interested groups to discuss methods for public participation in the development of its Forest Stewardship Plan. September 1992to September 1993: The CPC conducts public consultations on behalf of the province and the Teme-Augama Anishnabai as part of the negotiations for a Treaty of Co-existence. As a result of the negotiations, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai join the CPC on an interim basis. The deadline for the comprehensive plan is again extended, to March 31, 1996. October 1993: After two more public meetings to identify problems and outstanding issues, and receive comments on goals and objectives, the WSA hosts a final public review and critique of the planning options and zoning decisions in its Forest Stewardship Plan. May toAugust 1994: The CPC releases three alternative scenarios for the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area (excluding the area covered by the WSA's Forest Stewardship Plan). The scenarios reflect a range of potential land use alternatives, degrees of commercial development and resource protection. The CPC seeks public reaction by holding open houses and workshops in four communities, and through 14 meetings with interested organizations. February 1995: Then Natural Resources Minister Howard Hampton announces Ontario's intention to protect the Obabika Lake North old-growth site, a significant provincial example of old-growth pine forest. At the same time, the province removes all or parts of nine townships located northeast of Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park from the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area. The WSA officially submits its Forest Stewardship Plan, and the government directs the CPC to incorporate it into the comprehensive plan. The Teme-Augama Anishnabai withdraw from the CPC, pending the resolution of outstanding concerns with the government. June 1995: The CPC releases an update on its comprehensive plan, and circulates a single, comprehensive land use map that attempts to show how the many competing demands on the Temagami-area resources can be accommodated. November 1995: Chris Hodgson, Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Northern Development and Mines, directs the CPC to complete and submit recommendations on land use in Temagami by March 1, 1996. December 1995to January 1996: The CPC releases a draft land use proposal, hosts two open houses in Temagami, and four issue-resolution sessions with representatives of local, regional and provincial organizations. April 1996: After a delay due to the public service strike, the CPC submits its report on land use to Minister Hodgson. June 1996: Minister Hodgson announces the province's decision on land use in the Temagami area.

These four zones, together with provincial parks, form the basis for future land-use in the Temagami area. The land-use zones reflect seven years of public consultation on appropriate land-use in the Temagami area, and are designed to ensure that the needs of all resource users -- both recreational and commercial -- can be accommodated, while ensuring that significant ecological and other natural resource values are protected and managed. This fact sheet describes the four land-use planning zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area, as well as the seven provincial parks in the area. It also outlines the purpose, allowable activities and access for each zone. 1. Protected Areas Description Protected Areas are land-use zones that include important ecological features such as representative old-growth red and white pine sites; the headwaters of rivers flowing through Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park; significant wetlands; provincially significant ecological and geological features; and significant recreational areas. Purpose Protected Areas are designed to support the ecological integrity of the Temagami area's existing parks, and to recognize and protect areas that have natural heritage and remote recreation values. Commercial activities such as timber harvesting and mining and aggregate extraction will not be allowed to take place in Protected Areas, and management plans will be developed to provide over-all direction and specific details on the use and management of each of the Protected Areas. Allowable Activities/Access Commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction are not permitted in Protected Areas. The allowable land-uses in these zones focus on low-intensity, non-consumptive recreation and tourism -- to provide opportunities for activities such as fishing, hunting, trapping, snowmobiling, canoeing, hiking and cross-country skiing -- and on the protection of significant ecological values. Prescribed fire will be considered as a method for managing habitat and maintaining natural ecosystems. Protected Areas will not generally be accessible by motorized vehicles, although crossings may be allowed. Aircraft landings and snowmobile access will generally be permitted, but new commercial land-use permits or cottages will not be allowed. 2. Special Management Areas Description Special Management Areas are land-use zones that have value for resource extraction, as well as existing and potential tourism and recreation opportunities. Controlling access to these zones will ensure that these values are protected and managed appropriately. Purpose Special Management Areas will be subject to carefully planned access, to accommodate a variety of land-uses, and to reduce the potential for resource user conflicts. These zones will provide the public with access to remote hunting, fishing and tourism opportunities, such as remote, "back-country" hiking or canoeing. In addition, the zones will allow companies to undertake resource extraction and other commercial activities, under carefully planned conditions of access. Special Management Areas will protect existing tourism infrastructure, while also providing new economic development opportunities -- such as the creation of new trails for snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and hikers, packaged fly-in "eco-tours," and other forms of low-impact, "back-country" recreation. Special Management Areas will also enable resource managers to identify and protect significant values that need to be managed by special prescriptions, such as the Lake Temagami Skyline Reserve, the North Lady Evelyn River headwaters, the Makobe River headwaters and the Montreal River wetlands. Planned access to these zones will also facilitate the protection of self-sustaining fisheries and indigenous wildlife populations. Allowable Activities/Access Special Management Areas are designed to allow and encourage remote recreation and tourism opportunities. Resource extraction and development will also be permitted in these zones, but will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area. This will be accomplished through access controls and area-of-concern planning done as part of the Forest Management Planning process. Access to Special Management Areas will be carefully planned to provide users with a variety of remote and "back-country" recreational opportunities. The public will have access to Special Management Areas by motorboat, canoe, trail (snowmobile, cross-country ski or hiking), aircraft, mountain bike, horse and ATV in existing locations, where resource features and values are not threatened. Locations allowing the use of ATVs will be identified and designated as "Special Management Areas -- ATV Use." In some Special Management Areas -- such as the Lake Temagami Skyline Reserve and the Montreal River wetlands -- mineral exploration will be allowed, but commercial timber harvesting will not be permitted. By contrast, in other zones -- such as the North Lady Evelyn River headwaters area -- commercial forestry will be permitted, subject to an approved management plan, but mining-related activities will not be allowed. Special operating conditions will need to be developed for timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction operations in the Makobe River and the Anvil Lake-Willow Island Creek headwaters. Personal use permits for harvesting trees and using wood (e.g., fuel wood, dock-building material) will be considered in Special Management Areas, subject to the access planning for each area. Mining-related activities in these zones will be controlled by existing provincial legislation, regulations and policy. 3. Integrated Management Areas Description Integrated Management Areas are land-use zones in which resource management and development and recreational activities will be integrated, allowing commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction to take place alongside recreational uses. In Integrated Management Areas, resource extraction and development will be carefully managed, to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area. While some access controls may apply in these zones, there will likely be moderate to frequent contact between resource users. Purpose Integrated Management Areas are designed to promote access to both tourism-related and resource extraction activities, while ensuring that these activities occur with a minimum of conflict between resource users. These zones will allow a range of uses by a variety of resource users -- offering opportunities for both recreational and commercial activities, while facilitating the protection of significant ecological and other natural resource values. Allowable Activities/Access Integrated Management Areas will provide access to "front-country" tourism and recreation activities, such as bear management areas, main-base lodges, canoe routes, portages and trails. Where timber harvesting occurs in an Integrated Management Area, there will be a need for aesthetic management on important roads, along lake shores, trails and near tourism establishments. Appropriate measures will be described in the forest management plans. Mining-related activities in these zones will be controlled by existing legislation, regulations and policy. Access to Integrated Management Areas will be less restrictive than in Protected Areas and Special Management Areas. There will be few, if any, restrictions on road use, but no new or unplanned motorized public access to lakes will be permitted. All access to Integrated Management Areas will be planned, and specific road use strategies will be developed to minimize user conflicts and protect resource values in each zone. Integrated Management Areas are designed to accommodate a higher intensity of fish and wildlife use and management. For example, most easy-access, "put-and-take" fisheries will be located in these zones. However, fisheries management and habitat protection will be emphasized through controls and/or access restrictions and regulations. Fire management agreements may also be negotiated in Integrated Management Areas. 4. Developed Areas Description Developed Areas are land-use zones that contain mainly privately-owned land, including agricultural land, but also include some Crown land. While some privately-owned and developed land exists in other zones, Developed Areas are zones in which most of the land is developed, and where the natural and/or human environments have been significantly modified. Purpose Developed Areas reflect the fact that land-use in some parts of the Temagami area -- particularly in and around towns and villages -- is subject to municipal control. These zones recognize existing development, and will permit additional development to occur, while ensuring the protection of significant ecological and other values, and the sustainable management of natural resources on Crown land. Allowable Activities/Access Developed Areas can sustain a mix of development activities, including commercial timber harvesting, mining and aggregate extraction, as well as "front-country" tourism and recreation facilities and related activities. Where demand warrants, Developed Areas can also provide greater opportunities for utilizing Crown land for tourism-related activities, such as building new trail networks. Although mining-related hazards may exist in Developed Areas, provisions under the Mining Act ensure that rehabilitation takes place. Resource extraction and development in Developed Areas will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area. Mining-related activities will be controlled by existing legislation, regulations and policy. In general, local municipalities are responsible for planning appropriate land-uses on patent lands within Developed Areas. Some municipalities, for example, have restrictions that apply to hunting and fishing activities, and/or access controls on municipally-owned land. Cultural heritage protection, conservation and natural heritage protection are municipal responsibilities on municipally-owned land. As well, the Planning Act requires municipalities to have regard for a range of provincial interests when they undertake local planning, including significant Crown resources. The Crown Forest Sustainability Act also provides authority to harvest Crown timber on private lands, and an interim policy provides direction on licensing, scaling, work permits and Crown charges. In Developed Areas, fire suppression will be the immediate response to the occurrence of fire, and fire management agreements will be negotiated with individual municipalities. Prescribed fire may also be considered and used for specific resource management purposes. Rehabilitation of fish and wildlife habitat will occur in Developed Areas, and access to Crown land in these zones will be planned. Road use strategies will be developed to minimize conflicts between resource users and to ensure the protection of significant resource values. 5. Provincial Parks Description There are seven provincial parks within the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area -- one wilderness class park, four waterway class parks, and two recreation class parks: Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park is a 72,400-hectare wilderness class park whose significant features include the highest known point of land in Ontario. Obabika River Provincial Park was created as a 17,000-hectare waterway class park containing a diverse range of water-based recreation settings, with extensive shoreline concentrations of old-growth red and white pine forests. In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding a 3,520-hectare area to the park to protect the Obabika River North old-growth red and white pine forest, bringing the park's total area to 20,520 hectares. Makobe-Grays Provincial Park is a 1,427-hectare waterway class park encompassing the Makobe River at its point of departure from Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, north to the Town of Elk Lake. Solace Provincial Park is a 5,943-hectare waterway class park consisting of several small lake environments connected by small portages. Sturgeon River Provincial Park is a 3,350-hectare waterway class park consisting of a riverine system typical of many in the Canadian Shield. Finlayson Point Provincial Park is a 37-hectare recreation class park on the shore of Lake Temagami, one kilometre south of the Village of Temagami. W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park is a 465-hectare recreation class park site (currently undeveloped) on the south shore of Bay Lake, two kilometres south of the Town of Latchford. Purpose The goal of Ontario Parks is to provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, and to protect provincially significant natural, cultural and recreational environments in a system of parks. This goal is supported by the four objectives of protection, heritage appreciation, recreation and tourism. Allowable Activities/Access The activities allowed in provincial parks are governed by the Provincial Parks Act, appropriate provincial park policies established by the Ministry of Natural Resources, and by existing and future management plans developed for each park.

Today's old-growth red and white pine forests occur within a relatively narrow band that runs across central Ontario, from the Temagami area in the east to the shores of Lake Superior, as well as in some parts of northwestern Ontario. In its report to the government, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) expressed support for MNR's approach to protect and conserve old-growth red and white pine forest resources. The council also proposed a strategy for managing Temagami's red and white pine stands for old-growth characteristics. The Minister of Natural Resources has accepted the CPC's recommendation that more must be done to inform and educate the public about old-growth forests, and that this should be done during the forest management planning process. Protecting Temagami's Old-growth Forests During the late 1980s, much of the focus on old-growth forests in Temagami was on the Obabika Lake North Old-growth site. In 1996, the Government of Ontario has protected this site by expanding the boundaries of Obabika River Provincial Park. (For further information, please see the fact sheet on the Obabika Lake North Old-Growth Red and White Pine Forest.) The CPC recommended protection for 44 per cent of the old-growth red and white pine area in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area. Preliminary work by the Ministry of Natural Resources in identifying areas of concern for additional protection has raised the old-growth red and white pine area being protected in Temagami to 52 per cent. Through its forest management and other land use planning activities, MNR has a provincewide track record of a 65-per-cent level of protection for old-growth red and white pine forests. Using this as a guideline, the ministry expects that Temagami's old-growth red and white pine forest areas will ultimately achieve this rate of protection. The Ministry of Natural Resources is implementing a provincewide conservation strategy designed to conserve Ontario's old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems. Fundamental to this strategy is the principle that representative ecosystems in the natural range of Ontario's old-growth pine forests constitute a valuable part of the province's natural heritage, and must be protected for future generations. MNR's old-growth conservation strategy was developed from recommendations of the Old Growth Forests Policy Advisory Committee. The goal of the strategy is to ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems -- including old-growth -- continue to be present now and in the future. The strategy also includes forest protection and landscape management objectives. Under the strategy, old-growth pine forests are identified as representative and protected for future generations. MNR uses a complex range of factors -- including the age of the trees, species associations, diversity, lack of disturbance, stocking, size and integrity -- to assess each old-growth site and determine the methods for protecting or managing the resources. Around each old-growth site identified as representative, the ministry establishes ecological unit boundaries that take into account the site's natural and cultural heritage, tourism and recreation values. The Crown Forest Sustainability Act requires that all forest resources in Ontario be managed sustainably, under the provisions of specific forest management plans developed with broad public consultation. Forest management in Ontario is also subject to the provisions of Environmental Assessment Act. Restoring Nature's Balance Ontario's strategy for conserving old-growth pine forest ecosystems ensures that this important resource will exist into the future. Modern silvicultural approaches, such as the shelterwood and seed tree systems, ensure that sufficient seed and good seed beds are available for red and white pine to regenerate after harvesting. Clear-cutting is not an allowable harvesting approach in old-growth red and white pine forests in the Temagami area. The shelterwood approach guides commercial operators in adopting special techniques during the harvest and site preparation of old-growth pine forests. In part, these techniques are designed to re-create the conditions in a forest after a major fire -- conditions which red and white pine trees find ideal for natural regeneration. A number of techniques are used to ensure that many of the special characteristics of old-growth forests -- including the presence of "super canopy trees," and older, declining and dead trees -- remain present on the site after harvesting. The techniques allow areas of old-growth forest to be harvested, while providing many of the habitat requirements for the development of another old-growth forest in the future. In some areas, efforts to encourage natural pine regeneration are supplemented by planting. When available, cones from felled old-growth red and white pines are collected and the seeds used to produce new pine seedlings. The seedlings are planted in areas that originally supported old-growth stands -- giving the young trees a head start on a long and healthy life, and increasing the likelihood that they will one day form part of a thriving Crown pine forest.

In June 1996, the Minister of Natural Resources confirmed that the government is adding a 3,520-hectare area to Obabika River Provincial Park, to protect the old-growth forest red and white pine site. Protection of the Lake Obabika North old-growth site is part of a provincial conservation strategy for old-growth red and white pine forest ecosystems being implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). This conservation strategy will ensure that all generations continue to enjoy these important resources. The province will accomplish its conservation goals by setting aside selected old-growth red and white pine areas for protection, and by managing others to enable them to retain their old-growth characteristics during sustainable forest management. A Valuable Resource The Lake Obabika North old-growth red and white pine forest is located on an upland, broken-sandy-till plain landform. The site is the best representative old-growth red and white pine-dominated conifer and mixed forest on this landform in the Temagami area. The forest was first identified in the Iles report of 1990, which detailed the results of a study designed to provide an inventory of old-growth red and white pine stands in the area. The Lake Obabika North old-growth site contains trees that are 130 to 300 years old. Tree height and diameter varies over the site, with a maximum height of 30 metres and diameter of 75 centimetres. Typical characteristics of old-growth forests include large live trees, standing dead tree snags and fallen logs on the forest floor. Other notable features include large live trees with old fire scars, and younger seedlings and sapling pine that indicate the ecological role of recurring forest fires in maintaining conditions for the regeneration of the forest. Much of the Lake Obabika North pine forest shows no sign of having ever been disturbed. The Lake Obabika North old-growth red and white pine forest supports a healthy mix of other tree species -- as well as the Temagami area's highest concentration of old-growth red and white pine -- and is important to the Aboriginal people living in the area. The forest landscape is quite distinctive, with extensive cliff and talus slopes, cold seepage springs and bogs. The high relief associated with the area and the undisturbed old pine landscape of the ridges and hillsides contribute to its aesthetic quality. Much of the area selected for protection has been identified as a provincially significant Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI). Size and Location Obabika River Provincial Park's original area was about 17,000 hectares. In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding 3,520 hectares to the park, specifically to protect the Lake Obabika North old-growth site, which occupies parts of Shelburne and Delhi Townships, at the north end of Obabika Lake, and extends west from the lake along the Obabika River, north to Wakimika Lake, and east to Bob Lake. Allowable Activities/Access A range of recreation- and tourism-oriented activities will be allowed in this provincially protected old-growth area. Such activities can include wildlife viewing, fishing, hunting and camping, as well as other forms of low-impact recreation. Scientific research, environmental monitoring and outdoor education will also be encouraged. To ensure that the area's natural values are protected, commercial timber harvesting, mining and mineral exploration, hydroelectric development, new road construction and other industrial activities will not be allowed. Access to the site, which is on one of Ontario's most popular canoe routes, will generally be by canoe or boat. Detailed planning for the Lake Obabika North old-growth area will be done as part of the development of the provincial park management plan.

This goal is supported by the four objectives of protection, heritage appreciation, recreation and tourism. Provincial parks offer a high level of protection for natural resources and other significant ecological and heritage values. Access to parks is carefully controlled, and management plans are developed for each park with public input to set the park's overall direction and appropriate activities that can take place within it. Mining, mineral exploration and commercial timber harvesting are not allowed in provincial parks. There are seven provincial parks in the Temagami area: Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park is a 72,400-hectare wilderness class park. The park was created in 1983 and, as a wilderness class park, offers the highest available level of resource protection within the provincial park system. Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater's significant features include the highest known point of land in Ontario, and the park supports a diverse mix of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems -- including the original habitat of the endangered Aurora Trout, and several Brook Trout and Lake Trout communities. Wetlands, upland meadows, rock lands and forest and plant species typical of the transition zone between the Boreal and the Great Lakes Forest Regions are found across the park. Although Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater was created as a wilderness class park, several non-conforming activities -- such as hunting, trapping and mineral exploration and development -- were initially allowed to continue. For several years after the park was created, the Liskeard Lumber Road continued to be used for both timber hauling and recreational access. However, in May 1988, the Government of Ontario decided to eliminate these non-conforming uses from all provincial parks. The Liskeard Lumber Road was closed to timber hauling by the end of 1991. Motorized use of the road for recreational access is still permitted, but a gate closure is enforced for the core of the park between June 15 and September 15. All current activities and uses in the park will be reviewed during the development of the park's management plan, which is currently being prepared. This process will determine the extent to which non-conforming uses will be permitted in the future through consultation with affected stakeholders and communities. Obabika River Provincial Park is a waterway class park with an original area of about 17,000 hectares. The park contains a diverse range of water-based recreation settings, with extensive shoreline concentrations of old-growth red and white pine forests. In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding 3,520 hectares to the park to protect the Lake Obabika North old-growth forest stand, bring the total park area to 20,520 hectares. (For further information on old-growth forest stand protection, please refer to the following fact sheets: Conserving Old-Growth Red and White Pine Forest Ecosystems in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area; and Lake Obabika North Old Growth Red and White Pine Forest.) Makobe-Grays Provincial Park is a 1,427-hectare waterway class park encompassing the Makobe River at its point of departure from Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park north to the Town of Elk Lake. Regulated as a provincial park in 1985, the Makobe River is swift in the spring, when the water flow is controlled by the surrounding geology, but becomes a small-stream waterway by the summer. Solace Provincial Park is a 5,943-hectare waterway class park consisting of several small lake environments connected by small portages. Jack pine and white birch are the park's dominant forest species, and some of its lakes support self-sustaining Lake Trout populations. Sturgeon River Provincial Park is a 3,350-hectare waterway class park, and is a river system typical of many found in the Canadian Shield. The free-flowing system consists of rapids that pass over bedrock sills and narrows that separate small-lake widenings. Finlayson Point Provincial Park is a 37-hectare recreation class park on the shore of Lake Temagami, one kilometre south of the Village of Temagami. The oldest provincial park in the Temagami area, Finlayson Point was created in 1963, and serves the demand for car camping from regional travellers on Highway 11. The park contains 114 campsites nestled in a distinctive forest setting of large-diameter, old-growth red and white pine trees. W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park is a 465-hectare recreation class park on the south shore of Bay Lake, two kilometres south of the Town of Latchford. The park was regulated in 1986, and protects early successional white birch forest, scattered stands of white and red pine, and stands of sugar maple and yellow birch. Although existing demand from car-based campers is currently well served along Highway 11, the park may be suitable for the future development of trails and boat-in camping to promote increased tourism and recreation in the Temagami area. Resource Protection The four waterway class parks in the Temagami area -- Makobe-Grays, Obabika, Solace and Sturgeon River -- interconnect with Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Collectively, they protect a network of outstanding natural and cultural heritage features, including: 90 kilometres of cold water streams; seven major self-sustaining Lake Trout lakes and other lakes that sustain Brook Trout populations; the most northerly sugar maple forest in the eastern part of the 4E Site-Region; some of the best examples of old-growth forest stands in the Temagami area, including red and white pine-dominated communities; ancient Aboriginal travel routes, including portages, campsites and sacred sites, such as Maple Mountain; a network of historic fire towers; and remote camping in highly attractive settings. Economic Impact Back-country recreation, commercial fly-in operations and guided wilderness travel through Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and the connecting waterway class parks make a strong contribution to tourism in the Temagami area. A recent study estimates total back-country recreation use of the area's parks and Crown land at 60,000 user-days per annum. Management Status The operation of provincial parks is subject to individual park management plans, which are developed with public consultation. The Ministry of Natural Resources approved a management plan for Finlayson Point Provincial Park in 1985, and the park plan is currently under review. Management plans are currently being prepared for the six other provincial parks in the Temagami area, and these should be completed by the spring of 1998.

The area surveyed comprised 65 square miles. However, the provincial government of the day did not agree to the creation of the proposed reserve, and the Austin Bay Tract remains provincially owned Crown land today. In 1971, an official Reserve was established for the Temagami First Nation on Bear Island in Lake Temagami. The area of the reserve is one square mile. However, the Aboriginal people living in the area continue to claim a much larger area. In 1973, in order to advance a claim to ownership of their traditional territory, comprising 4,000 square miles, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai -- or TAA, which represents the Temagami First Nation and other Aboriginal people in the area -- filed formal land cautions with the Registrar of Titles on the 4,000 square-mile area, involving 110 geographic townships in and around the Temagami area. The land caution did not affect commercial forestry operations, but prevented the staking of new mining claims and new tourism-related economic development. In 1993, the Government of Ontario and the Teme-Augama-Anishnabai negotiated an Agreement-in-Principle designed to settle the outstanding land claim. However, the Agreement-in-Principle was not ratified by the local Aboriginal people. During the negotiations for the Agreement-in-Principle, two categories of land were proposed: land that would be under the sole jurisdiction and management of the Aboriginal people; and land that would be managed under joint stewardship of the Aboriginal people and the provincial government. Working through the courts, the provincial government succeeded in 1995 in having the land caution removed on the 110 townships in and around the Temagami area. The government will open most of the Crown land in the former caution area to staking under the Mining Act. Within the former caution area, there are a number of long-standing mining claims and mining leases, but the land caution prevented the owners of the claims and/or leases from actively working on the site. Ontario's Approach The Government of Ontario is setting aside a significant area of land in the Temagami area to provide new economic development opportunities for local Aboriginal people, and to facilitate the settlement of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai land claim. The area being set aside contains the land in the Austin Bay Tract, and other lands that would have been under the sole jurisdiction of Aboriginal people under the non-ratified Agreement-in-Principle of 1993. The government anticipates that some or all of the set-aside land could figure in the settlement of the outstanding land claim. The set-aside lands, while remaining Crown land, will not be opened to staking under the Mining Act, and the provincial government will make no new development or resource commitments on this land without the consent of the Temagami First Nation or the TAA. Any of the land that does not figure in the settlement of the TAA's land claim will revert to the Crown's administrative jurisdiction, and will be managed according to the land-use recommendations for the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area as put forward by the Comprehensive Planning Council, and as they may be amended by Ontario. Implementation Existing mining claims and leases on Crown land in the former caution area -- except for those lands within the area to be set aside for settlement of the Aboriginal land claim -- will be honored, and the province will uphold the legal right of the claim owners and leaseholders to explore and develop their mining rights. The set-aside area will not be included in the land base used to calculate the Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD) for the Temagami Management Unit forest management plan. Economic development opportunities on the set-aside land -- such as forestry, mining or land disposition -- will be subject to recommendations from the Chief and Council of the Temagami First Nation, and the Chief and Executive Council of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai. The Crown's representatives for receiving such recommendations will be the ministries of Natural Resources and Northern Development and Mines. Any development that ultimately occurs on the set-aside lands will be governed by applicable provincial laws, policies and regulations. For example, any new forestry activities would require an amendment to the existing Temagami Management Unit Forest Management Plan. In determining appropriate recommendations for the set-aside lands, the Ontario government will encourage Aboriginal representatives to consider maximizing the economic benefits to the members of their communities. The government has proposed setting aside these lands in the Temagami area for a two-year period, to facilitate the resolution of the Aboriginal land claim. If a land claim settlement has not been reached by the end of this period, the government will review the status of the lands.

Summary of Land Use Zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area There are four land use zones in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area. These four zones, together with provincial parks, form the basis for future land use in the Temagami area. This fact sheet summarizes the rationale and purpose of the four land use zones and provincial parks in the area, and lists common planning elements that apply to all zones. Temagami-area Land Use Zones Protected Areas. In Protected Areas, no commercial timber harvesting, mining or aggregate extraction will be permitted. Land use will focus on low-intensity, non-consumptive recreation and tourism, and on the protection of significant ecological values, with allowable activities such as fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, canoeing, hiking and cross-country skiing. Special Management Areas. In Special Management Areas, access will be carefully planned, and resources will be managed to ensure that significant values are protected. Remote recreation and tourism will continue to be allowed and encouraged. Resource extraction and related development will also be permitted, but will be carefully managed to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area. This will be accomplished through access controls and area-of-concern planning done as part of the Forest Management Planning process. Within Special Management Areas, sub-zones have been created to permit access by all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Some Special Management Areas may allow timber harvesting but not mining, while others may permit mineral exploration but not timber harvesting. Integrated Management Areas. In Integrated Management Areas, there will be fewer restrictions on public access for recreation and resource management/extraction activities, and both types of activities will be permitted. Resource extraction and related development will be carefully managed in Integrated Management Areas to ensure that the activities are compatible with other significant uses and values within the area. Developed Areas. Developed Areas contain mainly privately-owned land, including agricultural land, but also include Crown land. Resource extraction and related development will be permitted on Crown land within Developed Areas, but the activities will be carefully managed to ensure that they are compatible with other significant uses and values in the area. Mining activity on privately-owned land is subject to the provisions of the Mining Act, and other relevant legislation. Provincial Parks There are seven provincial parks within the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area - one wilderness class park, four waterway class parks, and two recreation class parks. Wilderness parks offer the highest level of protection of resources and other ecological values, and have more restrictions on access and use. The activities allowed in provincial parks are governed by the Provincial Parks Act, by appropriate provincial park policies established by the Ministry of Natural Resources, and by existing and future management plans developed for each park.

It is a strain of rabies spread mainly by raccoons, and is carried in the animal's saliva. Humans and other animals can become infected through a cut or scratch from an animal with rabies, or if the rabies virus comes in contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes.. At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario. Although Ontario raccoons have occasionally been infected with rabies, it has been with the arctic fox strain. This type of rabies has been present in Ontario since the 1950s. Before the Ministry of Natural Resources initiated rabies control in 1989, about 2,000 rabid animals were confirmed in Southern Ontario each year. On average, fewer than 20 of them were raccoons. To date, no raccoon in Ontario has ever been detected as having the raccoon strain of rabies. Where is raccoon rabies and why should we care about it? Raccoon rabies was first noted in Florida in the 1940s. It has been travelling slowly northward toward Ontario since then. It is well established on the New York side of the Niagara River and cases have been reported close to the St. Lawrence River near Gananoque. Ontario has a large raccoon population, especially in urban areas. This is why it is important for Ontarians living in urban areas to understand raccoon rabies and how to protect themselves and their families against the disease. Is raccoon rabies different from other strains of rabies? No. Raccoon rabies kills raccoons, other animals and humans in the same way as other strains of rabies do. The only difference is that it is spread primarily by raccoons What can people do to prevent exposure to raccoon rabies? People can protect themselves and their pets from raccoon rabies in the same way they protect themselves from other strains. You should vaccinate your pets, avoid stray or wild animals, and call your doctor if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal. There are precautions and protective measures that have been succesful in Ontario for many years. Please see other fact sheets in this series for more information. What treatment is available against rabies? All people who are knowingly exposed to rabies must be treated immediately. This treatment usually consists of a series of five injections given over a one-month period. The treatment is safe and effective. No human death has been directly linked to raccoon rabies. The last reported death in Ontario from any strain of rabies was in 1967.

At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario. However, it is just like any other rabies strain. You can protect your family and your pets from any rabies strain by observing the following rules: Have your pets vaccinated according to instructions from your veterinarian. Warn your children to stay away from wild or stray animals. Raccoon-proof your home. You may want to contact a professional for advice, or raccoon-proof your home yourself. Take measures to discourage wild animals from taking up residence in your home or on your property. For example, cover up potential entrances, such as uncapped chimneys, loose shingles and openings in attics, roofs and eaves. (See Fact Sheet "Discourage Raccoons From Moving In.") Do not attempt to trap raccoons which are causing damage to your property. Instead, contact a professional animal control officer to remove nuisance raccoons. Do not trap and transport nuisance raccoons to a new location. You could help spread the disease. Do not keep wildlife, including raccoons, as pets. It is against the law. Report any animals behaving strangely to your local animal control office. Don't touch dead or sick animals. If you think any member of your family has been in contact with a rabid animal, immediately call your doctor or go to your local emergency care centre.

It is a strain of rabies spread primarily by raccoons. At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario. Raccoon rabies, like all strains of rabies, is a viral disease carried in an animal's saliva. Humans and other animals can be infected by a rabid animal through a cut or scratch, or through contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes. What are the symptoms of rabies? Rabies can manifest itself as "dumb" or "furious" rabies. In dumb rabies: some animals may become depressed and retreat to isolated places wild animals, especially skunks, may lose their fear of humans animals may show signs of paralysis such as abnormal facial expressions, drooping head, sagging jaw, or paralyzed hind limbs In furious rabies: animals may show extreme excitement and aggression animals may gnaw and bite their own limbs animals may attack stationary things or other animals bouts of furious rabies usually alternate with periods of depression How long does it take for an animal to get rabies after it is infected? The time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms can range from about two weeks to many months. Can animals have rabies without showing any symptoms? Yes. The rabies virus can be found in animal saliva days before any obvious symptoms develop. However, all animals that have the virus will develop symptoms and eventually die of the disease.

For their protection and your own, they should not be allowed to take up residence inside or near your home. Although some mammals are more susceptible to some strains of rabies, any animal can be infected by any strain of rabies. A strain not found Ontario and which is spread by raccoons, is approaching the province. Those areas where Ontario is linked to New York State, such as the Niagara Region or at international bridges along the St. Lawrence are the most vulnerable. Keep raccoons away Do not provide food or shelter for raccoons or other wild animals. It is against the law to keep wildlife, including raccoons, as pets. If your pet's food is usually left outside, bring it in at the end of the day. Raccoon-proof your home You may want to contact a professional for advice, or raccoon-proof your home yourself: Cover up potential entrances, such as uncapped chimneys, loose shingles and openings in attics, roofs and eaves. If you're not sure where raccoons are getting in, sprinkle flour around potential entrances and check for footprints later. You can also stuff a rag or ball of paper in a suspect hole and check later to see if it has been removed. Make a raccoon den unlivable. Sprinkle naphtha flakes around the area or hang ammonia-soaked cotton rags near the entrance and keep the area brightly lit. Raccoons dislike loud noises, bright lights and strong smells. Use the same methods in your garden or in the area where you keep your garbage or composter. Always cover composters and garbage cans. Use a bungie cord or a heavy weight to keep the lid in place. Make sure that all raccoons or other animals have left before sealing up holes in any part of a building. This is especially important between May and July when there may be young. Block the entrances to a raccoon den once you're sure all the animals have left. You can use sheet metal. Repair siding and holes in buildings, and use heavy rustproof screening to cover open air vents or chimneys. Trim all overhanging tree branches or any other structure that animals might use to get on to the roof of a residence or detached building.

The TVR program is a preventive measure to protect raccoons in certain areas of the province against the spread of the raccoon strain of rabies. The program is active in the Niagara Peninsula between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal and in the vicinity of bridge border crossings along the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Iroquois, Prescott and Gananoque. Why is it necessary? It is necessary because of the approach of raccoon rabies from the United States. Raccoon rabies is a strain of rabies carried primarily by raccoons. At present, this strain is not found in Ontario but has been confirmed in raccoons, on the New York state side of the Niagara River and close to the St. Lawrence River near Gananoque. How does the program work? With the assistance of local trappers hired for their expertise, Ministry of Natural Resources staff set out live-trap cages to catch raccoons without harming them. The raccoons are then vaccinated against rabies, marked with ear-tags that will identify them as vaccinated, and released unharmed at the site where they were captured. In 1995, the program vaccinated 72.5 per cent of the raccoon population in the buffer zones in the Niagara Region and along the St. Lawrence River. Trapping will continue this year, from June to November. Vaccinating a large number of raccoons in these areas against rabies will contain or slow the spread of the disease, should it move into Ontario along natural routes. Where are traps placed? The traps are placed by Ministry of Natural Resources staff in any area that raccoons are known to inhabit, including private land. The public can expect to see wildlife technicians setting cages and checking them within 24 hours for raccoons. What happens if other animals, such as pets, are caught in the traps? Although other animals may inadvertently be caught, they cannot be harmed by the traps. The cages are checked within 24 hours and any other animals will be released. The public should not attempt to release any animal from these cages.

If a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed in Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources staff will implement a point-control program near the point of discovery, in an effort to contain the disease and prevent it from spreading to the rest of Ontario's raccoons and other mammals. This would be necessary only if a case occurs outside of treated areas in the Niagara Region and around the bridge border crossings along the St. Lawrence River where raccoons have been vaccinated against raccoon rabies. How does a point-control program work? In urban areas, the program involves humanely euthanizing the raccoon and skunk population within a two-kilometre radius of the confirmed case. Within a further two-kilometre area raccoons and skunks will be vaccinated in order to create a buffer zone of inoculated animals. In rural areas, all raccoons within a radius of four kilometres will be euthanized, and those within a further four-kilometre radius will be vaccinated. The difference in area relates to how far the raccoons are likely to travel within a given period. Urban raccoons inhabit a much smaller territory than raccoons living in less populated areas. Why is it necessary to euthanize some animals? Rabies takes some time to incubate. Infected animals may not show symptoms of the disease for weeks. By the time a case of raccoon rabies is confirmed, the disease likely has taken hold in the area and vaccination may no longer be an effective control in the immediate area. By humanely euthanizing raccoons in the area where a case is confirmed - as they are likely to be infected - and by vaccinating the surrounding raccoon population, the chances of eliminating the disease and preventing it from spreading are increased. How does the vaccination program work? With the assistance of local trappers hired for their expertise, the Ministry of Natural Resources will set out live-trap cages to catch raccoons without harming them. Cages are checked within 24 hours and trapped raccoons are vaccinated. They are also marked with ear-tags so they can be identified as vaccinated and are released at the point of capture. What role will the public play in this process? The public can follow the same preventive measures that are successful against any strain of rabies. Vaccinate pets, warn children to stay away from wild or stray animals, and report any animal that behaves strangely to your local humane society, or police department. If you travel across the region, raccoons are known to "hitch a ride" on trucks and other vehicles. There is a risk that rabies could be spread far into the province this way. Before you begin your trip, or after a road-side stop, make sure that you have not "picked up" or are carrying raccoons in your vehicle.

It may enter Ontario in 1996 unless widely co-ordinated protective actions are taken. The Ontario Raccoon Rabies Task Force has put in place a strategic plan for countering this threat. This includes leading a program of preventive action involving local organizations, the provincial government and the federal government. The result of this preventive action are a series of raccoon rabies community contingency plans. What is a community contingency plan? It is an action plan at the local level that will: help keep raccoon rabies out of Ontario help contain an outbreak if it should occur help people to protect themselves and their communities. Using a model developed in the Niagara Region, the plan outlines where raccoon rabies might enter a community, who would be affected, who should be alerted first, what needs to be done quickly, who does what needs to be done and, finally, how the citizens are kept informed. Who creates community contingency plans? Local representatives from government and non-government agencies, companies and individuals that have an interest in raccoon rabies. These may include: the local health unit, police department, clerk's office, animal control agency, humane society, wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife control companies (or local trappers' council) and the local offices of the ministries of Natural Resources; Health; Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

Local agencies are encouraged to promote this month so that people will be better able to protect themselves, their children and their pets. Southern Ontario once held the unhappy title of "Rabies Capital of North America." In 1967, the Ontario and federal governments combined resources to ensure that research into the cause and spread of the disease went hand-in-hand with measures to protect the public. Using an oral vaccine dropped from airplanes, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has been immunizing red foxes, the main carrier of rabies to livestock and pets, who may then pass on the disease to humans. Is the threat of rabies disappearing? Not yet. Although Ontario is making progress in eliminating fox rabies, a variant of rabies spread by raccoons is moving quickly through the northeastern United States. Unless it can be stopped, this type of rabies will spread into Ontario. To create a protective barrier, MNR has inoculated raccoons against rabies in areas where diseased animals are most likely to enter Ontario. Researchers are working to develop an oral vaccine for raccoons so that aerial vaccination could be used to eliminate the disease over large areas, if it were to reach Ontario. It is important that people know what to expect so that they can take precautions against spreading the disease by unwittingly transporting racoons from outside Ontario into the province, or moving them around inside the province. How can people protect themselves? Being aware of how you can protect yourself from rabies is your number-one defence. You should vaccinate your pets, avoid stray or wild animals, and call your doctor and your local health unit if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal. Various government departments and the veterinary profession are working together in the fight against rabies. They are members of a Raccoon Rabies Task Force which is helping communities throughout Ontario develop a local action plan for managing any localized raccoon rabies outbreak and to prevent it from spreading. Several communities already have such a plan in place. "Raccoon Rabies Approaches Southern Ontario", is an educational package on rabies available from Ontario school board offices for use by teachers and students at the intermediate level.

If current trends continue, they expect that by the year 2001 they will have eliminated fox rabies from Ontario by air-dropping from one to two million vaccine-baits a year over southern Ontario. Why should Ontario worry about rabies? The Arctic strain of fox rabies has been a serious and persistent problem in Ontario since 1959. Until recently, southern Ontario had more reported cases of animal rabies than any other province or state in North America. In the past, this has cost governments more than $6 million a year in diagnosis; investigation of reports of animal bites to see if rabies was involved; treatment of humans contacting rabid animals; compensation to farmers for loss of livestock; cost of quarantine and research. Pet owners spend an additional $50 million a year having their pets vaccinated. The last human death in Ontario due to fox rabies was in 1967. How have we approached the problem? The Ministry of Natural Resources Rabies Unit, in conjunction with scientists from Connaught Laboratories and Queen's and McMaster universities and the universities of Toronto and Guelph, attacked rabies at its source: the red fox. Research has centered on immunizing wild foxes. Scientists now believe that if they are able to immunize a large enough percentage of the "carrier species" population that spreads rabies, the disease will die out completely. Moving towards a solution Vaccinating wildlife on a large scale poses many challenges. Several existing rabies vaccines work well when injected, but injecting wild foxes was out of the question. An alternative was to deliver the vaccine orally, in a bait. The rabies vaccine is a living virus and, therefore, quite delicate. It has to be absorbed in the mouth, for if it were released in the stomach it would be destroyed. Current baits contain 1.8 millilitres of rabies vaccine sealed in a small plastic blister-pack embedded in each one. Finding a vaccine bait that wouldn't be ignored by foxes was another challenge. Not only must the bait be attractive for foxes to eat, it must be easy to mass produce, and easy to store, handle and distribute over large areas. Most of all, researchers needed to ensure the blister pack of vaccine would be chewed along with the bait. The successful bait is a mixture of fats, wax and flavoring. Testing some answers In 1989, after many years of small-scale studies, MNR researchers began a five-year trial in rabies control. They started in a 30,000-square-kilometre area in rural eastern Ontario. They chose an area large enough to prove that it was the bait program, and not simply a natural cycle, that would change the level of rabies. Every October, specially equipped ministry aircraft have dropped baits for the wild foxes at a density of 20 baits per square kilometre along flight lines spaced from 1.3 to 2 kilometres apart. Three Twin Otters are outfitted with special bait-dispensing machines. Navigation is done using the latest satellite and computer technology so that millions of baits are spread uniformly and at a predetermined density. The number of baits delivered is computer controlled and carefully recorded. This helps ensure a minimal number of baits are wasted. How are we doing? A rabid fox has not been found in the region since September 1993. From 1970 to 1989, the treated region had been averaging 385 cases of animal rabies a year. By 1993, that had dropped to 16. Of those 16, seven were bats, and one a fox infected with a bat strain of rabies. Bats carry their own forms of rabies, and since bats in Ontario are small and insect-eating, they are not affected by the rabies vaccination program. In 1993, the experimental program was expanded to the rest of the rabies zone in southern Ontario. Rabies dropped to its lowest level in Ontario since 1961. In 1995, three aircraft took 10 days to distribute 1.8 million baits over 84,000 square kilometres, thereby covering all of the rabies-affected area in southern Ontario. Whereas Ontario had averaged 2000 cases of rabies per year during the 1980s, at the end of 1995, there were only 323. Rabies in the city In Metropolitan Toronto (pop. 2.4 million), a city with extensive ravines, parklands, large red fox populations, and a history of rabies problems, rabies vaccine-baits are distributed by hand in the spring and in the fall. Skunks can spread rabies too Since 1987, the ministry has undertaken an experimental program to vaccinate skunks in a sector of the city (Scarborough) which had been experiencing a consistently, high incidence of skunk rabies. Since the oral vaccine in a bait does not work for skunks, scientists developed a system (TVR) to live-trap, vaccinate by injection, and release the animals. Only three cases have been diagnosed to date in that area since 1987, and none since 1990. Raccoons and Rabies The raccoon strain of rabies has been moving northward in the United States for several years. It is now established on the New York side of the Niagara River and within 10 kilometres of Gananoque on the St. Lawrence River. Since raccoons were often attracted to the live traps set out for the skunk population in the Scarborough study, information was collected on raccoons captured in the traps for use at a later date. This knowledge has been pivotal in the current strategy for keeping raccoon rabies out of Ontario. In 1994, MNR immunized about 64 per cent of the raccoon population in the Niagara Region in an area between the Welland Canal and the Niagara River, with the intention of creating a buffer zone of protected raccoons at the point where the potential for a rabid raccoon to stray into Ontario is very high. In 1995, scientists added new buffer zones along the St. Lawrence River to this program. They also cooperated with a New York State experiment to airdrop an American-made vaccine against rabies for raccoons. Ontario supported these efforts to stop raccoon rabies before it reaches the province. MNR will continue to maintain Ontario's buffer zones of vaccinated raccoons in 1996. Using what we are learning about rabies in foxes on raccoon rabies As part of the long-term strategy for wildlife rabies control, MNR's Rabies Research Unit has also tested and confirmed how many baits are needed to airdrop rabies vaccine to immunize a raccoon population. They have found the flavor that raccoons prefer and expect to be able to use this method in about two to four years when a cost-effective oral rabies vaccine for raccoons becomes available.

While both foxes and raccoons are the primary carriers for those strains of rabies, cats provide a link for the transmission of rabies from foxes and raccoons to people. May is Rabies Awareness Month in Ontario and the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and its partners want to increase public knowledge of how to avoid rabies. The ministry's Rabies Research Unit has been working since 1989 to eliminate the fox strain through an aerial baiting program. MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies in Ontario by the year 2001. Although there are no reported cases of the raccoon strain in Canada, it has slowly been working its way north through the United States and has now been found close to Ontario at the New York State border. It could be a problem if it reaches Ontario, because the province has a large raccoon population. The Trap-Vaccinate-Release Program Three of the most likely transmission routes by which infected racoons might enter the province are across the Niagara River, across the St. Lawrence River, or by accidental transport on trucks, trains, recreational vehicles or boats. The Rabies Research Unit has been working over the past few years to create a buffer zone against raccoon rabies between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal by immunizing raccoons through a trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program. In 1995, the ministry created additional zones at bridges along the St. Lawrence River, where infected raccoons could easily cross from New York State. The TVR program uses humane live-traps to catch raccoons. The animals are vaccinated, then marked with an ear-tag and released. The ministry hopes that by doing this, the spread of raccoon rabies can be contained or slowed if it comes into the province. Protect your pets If raccoon rabies reaches Ontario, cats in the outbreak area present a potential risk to public safety because of their close association with both raccoons and people. Pet owners, and anyone who comes into contact with cats, should take steps to protect their pets and family. Many people keep their cats indoors during the day, but let them outside at night. This is when they are most likely to come into contact with raccoons, who also prowl at night. Both often frequent the same areas. Rabies experts encourage people to keep their cats confined or on a leash, especially during the evening. In many municipalities, this is already mandatory. It is very important that pet owners make sure their cats (or dogs) have been vaccinated so they do not catch and pass on rabies. Most pet cats in Ontario are vaccinated. However, there is also a problem with barn cats and feral cats (unowned cats who live in the wild). Barn cats are usually very hard to catch, and therefore are not often vaccinated. Wild cats present a special problem because they don't have owners who can have them vaccinated. The exact number of feral cats is unknown, but there are many who live throughout the province in rural areas, on farms and in cities. To make sure your pet cat is not mistaken for a feral cat, get it a collar so it can be identified as having had a vaccination. A collar, or other means of identification should also have your telephone number on it. Protect Yourself The best way to protect yourself, your family and your pets from all strains of rabies is to have your pets vaccinated, keep away from stray or wild animals, and call your doctor if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal. Humans and animals can become infected with rabies by saliva from a rabid animal coming into contact with a cut or scratch, or in contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes. Any direct contact with a wild animal needs to be taken seriously even if an animal appears to be healthy. Rabies incubate in a raccoon for some time before symptoms appear. If you think you or a member of your family has been in contact with a rabid animal, wash the affected skin thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap and hot water and contact your doctor or local health department immediately. .Anyone who is exposed to rabies must be treated immediately. Rabies is fatal if untreated. The treatment which is safe and effective is usually a series of five injections given over a one-month period. Detecting Rabies in Animals Rabid animals may become depressed and retreat to isolated places. Wild animals, especially skunks, lose their fear of humans. The animals may show signs of paralysis such as abnormal facial expressions, drooping heads, sagging jaws or paralysed hind limbs. Some animals may show extreme excitement and aggression. They may gnaw and bite their own limbs, and may attack stationary objects or other animals. Bouts of aggressive, rabies-induced behaviour often alternate with periods of exhaustion and depression. If you see an animal that is acting strangely, you should report it to your municipal animal control agency, humane society or the police.

The arctic fox strain of rabies (spread mainly by red foxes and skunks) has been present in Ontario for decades. A strain new to Ontario, spread mainly by raccoons, could enter the province in the near future. If you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal: wash the affected skin area thoroughly with soap and water, immediately contact your doctor or local health department, and if you think your clothing has been in contact with fresh saliva from a rabid animal, wash it in detergent and hot water. If you see a sick or dead animal: Do not approach or touch the animal. Report it immediately to your local humane society or police department. Do not report animals found killed on the road (road kill) -- unless you know there is contact with humans or animals -- as they are not included in the rabies monitoring program. To protect your pets against exposure: Have your pets vaccinated according to instructions from your veterinarian. Keep your pets under control at night. Keep pets on a leash when walking them during the day. Remember: You should inform your local humane society of any animal you believe to be rabid. You must contact your doctor or local medical officer of health if there is any human contact. It is against the law to keep a raccoon as a pet.

A good way to avoid rabies is to avoid direct contact with all wild animals and with unfamiliar domestic animals. Answer hereTRUE Rabies virus is in the saliva of a rabid animal. If the saliva enters your body by a bite or a scratch, or if it comes into contact with the moist tissues of your eyes, nose or mouth, you could probably get rabies. (ref. If You or a Family Member Has Been Exposed to Rabies) 2. My cat can get rabies from a raccoon. Answer hereTRUE A rabid raccoon can give rabies to any mammal, including cats, dogs and people. Even though cats are household pets, we sometimes forget to have them vaccinated against rabies. They can then pass rabies on to us. (ref. Cats - A Link With Rabies) 3. We can be sure that only if an animal is foaming at the mouth and attacks people it is rabid. Answer hereFALSE Even if rabies virus is already in the animal it takes time for damage to the brain to cause outward signs, such as the aggressive behaviour of "furious" rabies. Some other symptoms of rabies might also be paralyzed hind legs which cause the animal to stagger or its head may droop (ref. Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies). Some rabid animals have no visibal symptoms at all. 4.Raccoon rabies is not more dangerous than other kinds of rabies. Answer hereTRUE All types of rabies are very dangerous and you must get treatment if you suspect you or your pet have been in contact with a rabid animal. Vaccination protects against all types of rabies. (ref. Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts) 5. I can help protect myself against rabies by having my pet vaccinated regularly. Answer hereTRUE You should also avoid wild animals or strays and be sure to get medical help immediately if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal. Unless cats or dogs have been identified as vaccinated against rabies, we can't be sure they're not rabid without special testing. (ref. Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts and If You Suspect Your Family Pet Has Been Exposed To Rabies) 6. An animal that has rabies can be saved by rabies vaccines. Answer hereFALSE An unvaccinated animal that has contracted rabies can't be saved. (ref. Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies) 7. A person who has been exposed to rabies has to get very painful treatment to survive. Answer hereFALSE A person who has contacted rabies is given five almost painless shots in the arm to counteract the rabies virus. It is important, however, to get treatment and to begin as soon as possible. Wash the wound carefully and get medical help. (ref. Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts and If You or a Family Member Has Been Exposed to Rabies) 8. Ontario once held the title as Rabies Capital of North America. Answer hereTRUE Until recently, Ontario had more cases of rabies every year than any Canadian province or U.S. state. Ontario's program to eliminate arctic fox rabies from the province has reduced the number of cases dramatically so that Ontario's rabies rate is no longer the highest in North America. The goal is to eliminate fox rabies by the year 2001 (end of the century). (ref. Controlling Fox Rabies in Ontario) 9. There is nothing we can do to stop raccoon rabies. Answer hereFALSE The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources is capturing and vaccinating raccoons and skunks against rabies in areas where raccoon rabies could spread from New York State into Ontario. People can help by preventing "hitchhiking" raccoons from getting into their boats or trucks or cars in the eastern USA before they leave for Ontario. Also, Ontario and U.S. scientists are experimenting with a vaccine in a bait that raccoons could eat to immunize themselves against rabies. (ref. Trap-Vaccinate-Release Program and Controlling Fox Rabies in Ontario and If Raccoon Rabies is Confirmed in Ontario and Contingency Planning In Ontario -- A Community Response to the Threat of Raccoon Rabies) 10. Only people living in rural areas need to worry about rabies. Answer hereFALSE Wildlife in cities encounter our pets and could pass rabies to them. Unless our pets are vaccinated they could pass rabies on to us. (ref. Rabies -- Protecting Your Family and Your Pets; If You Suspect Your Family Pet Has Been Exposed to Rabies; Discourage Raccoons From Moving In) Back to Rabies Menu Modified 3-May-96 (c) Queen's Printer for Ontario, 1996WT01-B11-151IA083-000587-B026-218http://nrserv.mnr.gov.on.ca:80/MNR/csb/news/jan2197.html 192.75.156.251 19970216011142 text/html 3705HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Communications/1.1Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 01:21:14 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 14-Feb-97 13:50:07 GMTContent-length: 3517Content-type: text/html MNR News January 21, 1997 Hodgson Announces Measures to Restore Elk Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that the government will restore elk populations in Ontario. "We want to bring elk back to Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson. "This is a beautiful animal that was once native to much of the province. We are working with two committees to get elk restoration under way." . The two committees responsible for implementing the project are made up of representatives from interested groups and from government. The elk restoration technical committee includes professional staff from the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, Parks Canada and MNR. This committee is coordinating the technical aspects of the project, including identification of potential release sites, animal care and post-release assessment. The elk restoration advisory committee includes representatives from Cambrian College, Safari Club International, the Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, the Ontario Fur Managers Federation, a French River tourist outfitter and MNR. This committee is responsible for raising the almost $200,000 needed for research, project implementation, communications and community consultation. "I am really pleased to see this wide variety of interested groups pulling together for the betterment of wildlife in Ontario," Mr. Hodgson said. Elk disappeared from Ontario in the late 1800s because of overharvesting and changes in habitat. In the 1930s, in an effort to restore populations, elk from western Canada were introduced to several parts of the province. Two small herds originating from that reintroduction effort still exist in the French River area south of Sudbury. Cambrian College and Laurentian University have been leading research on these herds to determine why they have not expanded over the years. "This research will be extremely important in determining how best to proceed with the restoration program," said Mr. Hodgson. A short list of potential release sites will be finalized early this winter. Consultation with local communities and interested groups will then take place. Plans are being developed for a pilot release of 50 animals at one site during the early winter of 1998. Tentative arrangements have been made to obtain these animals from Elk Island National Park in Alberta. The elks' ability to adapt to their new environment will be carefully monitored. Future releases will be based on the outcome of this assessment program. "This restoration project is an important part of the government's commitment to rehabilitating the Ontario landscape by restoring populations of wildlife native to the province," Mr. Hodgson said.

"I am very pleased that MNR has been able to continue supporting this valuable wildlife program and I want to thank all the volunteers who donated their time and energy," said Hodgson. "CWIP projects are grass-root efforts and they demonstrate the substantial contributions that dedicated individuals and groups are prepared to make to Ontario's wildlife." Examples of some projects undertaken in 1996 are the erection of osprey platforms by the Friends of Charleston Lake and wild turkey trapping and relocations performed by the South-Central Big Game Association. Other types of CWIP projects undertaken this year include habitat rehabilitation, tree planting, nesting box construction, clover seeding and wild rice planting. Under the CWIP program, MNR provides start-up money and technical expertise to organized volunteers after their wildlife project is approved by the ministry. This start-up money is primarily used for purchasing materials and supplies while a group or individual provides all the labour to complete the project. To qualify for CWIP funding, a project must meet one or more of the following objectives: increased variety, abundance and distribution of Ontario's wildlife and wildlife habitat increased knowledge of Ontario's wildlife resources stronger relations between landowners, outdoor recreationists and interest groups. Funding for CWIP projects now comes from the special account established last year by MNR to support fish and wildlife management activities using revenue collected from fish and wildlife licence fees, royalties and fines. Interested groups or individuals should contact their local MNR District Office for further information on the program or projects in their area.

"These changes fulfil our promise to improve the property-tax system to promote better management of private woodlands and the protection of Ontario's natural heritage," said Hodgson. "Property taxes will be reformed so that there is a long-term commitment to support landowners who protect and conserve their woodlands and significant natural heritage areas." "These reforms will lead to better stewardship of Ontario's forests, which the international marketplace demands," said Hodgson. "Through these reforms, Ontario can keep its markets open, which is good for the economy and creating jobs." These measures follow Hodgson's announcement last year of the reinstatement of the Managed Forest Tax Rebate, an interim measure that was first created in 1975 but terminated in 1993 by the former NDP government, which had other spending priorities. The changes today are part of the government's response to the tax recommendations of the Who Does What committee. The changes are consistent with both the government's commitment to replace interim property-tax rebates with long-term tax reforms that recognize the importance of environmental protection and the proposals contained in the report of the Mike Harris Task Force on Rural Economic Development. The changes will go into effect in the 1998 tax year. Under the changes, the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program and the Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program will be replaced by a system that reduces the tax rate on eligible lands through the regular property-tax process. These changes will also reduce the tax assessment on most of these lands. The tax rate for eligible managed forest land will be set at 25 per cent of the local residential tax rate while there will be no tax on eligible conservation lands. Landowners will need to apply to have eligible land covered by the changes, and management plans will still be required for managed forests. The minimum size of eligible land is four hectares (about 10 acres) for forests and 0.2 hectares (about half an acre) for conservation lands. The elimination of the rebate programs also means the elimination of any rebate cap. Rick Monzon, Executive Director of the Ontario Forestry Association, called the changes "Terrific. I like the idea of reducing the acreage and I am happy that the rebate is being replaced by a more realistic assessment and mill rate." Lynn McIntyre, Secretary of the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators Association, said that the association agrees with the government move. "We view this as a positive step in sustaining private land forestry in Ontario." Protection of private woodlands benefits snowmobile clubs. Landowners who have participated in the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program are often more receptive to allowing recreational access to private woodlots. "The Province of Ontario has been a big partner in the development of snowmobiling in Ontario," said Tim West, Manager of External Relations for the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. "Any changes that have a positive impact on landowners are also a big plus for us." This tax change for managed forest and conservation lands will also apply to eligible lands owned by Conservation Authorities, which are ineligible under the existing rebate programs. "These changes will reduce red tape for private landowners and may affect tax revenues for some municipalities," Mr. Hodgson said. "The government is working to address any impact the changes have." Mr Hodgson also indicated that there would be no effect on the existing provincial funding program for the operation and maintenance of flood control works.

The program offered a 75-per-cent rebate on property taxes for the managed forest portion of a qualifying property. The program was cancelled by the previous NDP government in 1993, which had other spending priorities. The current government reinstated the program in February, 1996 in keeping with a commitment made in the report of the Mike Harris Task Force on Rural Economic Development released in 1994. The Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program was introduced for the 1987 tax year and has been offered without interruption since then. The program aims to ease the property-tax burden that threatens the preservation of land vital to Ontario's natural heritage. It offers a 100-per-cent tax rebate for qualifying lands. Both programs were intended to be short-term solutions to address unfair property-tax systems that penalize people for protecting important natural areas. The government is moving ahead with its commitment to tax reform that ensures there is a permanent commitment to the environment and is making changes as part of its response to the recommendations of the Who Does What committee. These long-term, permanent property-tax reforms eliminate the need for the Managed Forest Tax Rebate and Conservation Land Tax Reduction programs. Starting in the 1998 tax year, eligible managed forests and conservation lands, including such lands owned by Conservation Authorities, will be assessed in a similar manner to farmlands, upon application by the landowner. Farmland in Ontario is assessed on the basis of current value in current use. The tax rate for eligible managed forests will be set at 25 per cent of the residential tax rate of the local municipality, while eligible conservation lands will be exempt from property taxes. This means that property owners will benefit from lower taxes rather than having to wait for the government to process a rebate, as occurred in the past. These new measures bring greater fairness to the property-tax system and promote responsible environmental stewardship.

I am impressed with how quickly Ontario Parks has delivered on commitments made less than a year ago, Mr. Hodgson said. In particular, it has made solid improvements in the areas of customer service, facilities and partnerships. Mr. Hodgson announced the new Ontario Parks structure for the provincial parks system on May 1, 1996. Ontario Parks has two basic objectives. One is to maintain and protect Ontario s world renowned 265 parks and irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage. The other objective is to manage parks more efficiently. This includes providing opportunities for involvement by partners and by the private sector to allow the parks system to continue to prosper in a challenging fiscal environment. Key areas where Ontario Parks has made significant progress include: Creating More Parks - Through many partnerships, new nature reserve parks are being considered, including Wainfleet Bog, Calder Island, Shaw Woods, Lyal Island, Carden Alvar, Holland River Fens and Alfred Bog, as well as selected Carolinian forest and Great Lake sites. Enhancing Existing Parks - In Algonquin, after successful negotiations with CN Rail in 1996, a 128-km rail line right-of-way running through the park has been added to the park s landbase. Under a proposal now in the final stages of public review, Wabakimi Provincial Park would be expanded from 155,000 hectares to almost 900,000 hectares, and MNR is committed to regulating the new boundary early in 1997. And in 1996, Massasauga became the newest operating provincial park, with 135 interior camp sites, sheltered bay and coves. Facility Improvements - Ontario Parks has made some good business investments to upgrade existing facilities, such as the addition of 1,162 new Hydro sites to the parks system. This resulted in an additional $800,000 in revenue during the 1996 season. At Balsam Lake, for instance, 64 sites were converted to electricity, for an increase of $22,000 in revenue. And at Mississagi, a co-op project with Ontario Hydro resulted in the installation of $50,000 worth of solar equipment and storage battery packs to operate lights and power in the park. Also, new campgrounds are being constructed in parks including Sandbanks and Bass Lake. Customer Service - Ontario Parks is reaching out and delivering information and services in new and effective ways. In particular, our Web site on the Internet is a resounding success, with close to 20,000 hits in its first six months. People now have access to more information directly from home, in addition to interactive functions and games related to parks and the many opportunities they offer. An excellent opportunity for unlimited use of provincial parks is provided by our new season permits, at $30.00 for the 1996-97 winter permit and $40.00 for the summer permit. Convenient and economical, they also make great gifts. And to serve more visitors, many parks now offer facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, while some parks also offer rental accommodation such as permanent tent-like structures called yurts , and renovated park lodges and cabins. Partnerships - More than 100 responses have been received to a prospectus sent to businesses earlier this year to develop major corporate partnerships. Meanwhile, under existing partnerships with the private sector and community groups, many provincial parks, including Pakwash, Killarney, Peters Woods and Lake Nipigon, are already showing signs of increased activity. Based on what has been achieved to date, I am more confident than ever that Ontario Parks will ensure the parks system continues to be a provincial showcase, enhancing tourism and business objectives for Ontario, Mr. Hodgson added. Ontario Parks is accountable to the Minister through a soon-to-be appointed board of directors, and oversees a special purpose account for retaining and managing parks revenues.

"This is the largest amount MNR has ever invested in its Community Fisheries Involvement Program in a single year," Hodgson said. MNR's Community Fisheries Involvement Program (CFIP) provides seed money and technical expertise to organized volunteer groups that have had projects approved by the ministry. Typical activities include: fish culturing and stocking projects, spawning bed restorations, stream rehabilitations, fish transfers, fish ladders and fishery assessments. CFIP funds are generally used for materials and supplies with the volunteer group providing all the necessary labor to complete the project. "The CFIP program facilitates worthwhile fishery projects throughout the province, but it is only possible because of the great contributions in time and energy provided by dedicated CFIP volunteers," said Minister Chris Hodgson. "I want to heartily thank all the participating individuals and groups for their vital assistance and pledge my ministry's continued support for this important program." Aside from providing direct benefits to Ontario fisheries, CFIP projects also enrich the volunteers who take part in them. Participants contribute to the resource while also learning about the finer points of fishery management. Funding for CFIP projects now comes from the special account established last year by MNR to support fish and wildlife management activities using revenue collected from fish and wildlife licence fees, royalties and fines. Groups receiving CFIP funding in 1996 included: tourist outfitters, fish and game clubs, schools, First Nations, service clubs, lake groups, cottagers' associations and community associations. The average CFIP contribution in 1996 was approximately $2,130 per project. Interested groups or individuals should contact their local MNR District Office for further information on the program or projects in their area.

MNR'S OBJECTIVES To ensure the long-term health of ecosystems by protecting and conserving our valuable soil, aquatic resources, forest and wildlife resources as well as their biological foundations. To ensure the continuing availability of natural resources for the long-term benefit of the people of Ontario; that is, to leave future generations a legacy of the natural wealth that we still enjoy today. To protect natural heritage and biological features of provincial significance. To protect human life, the resource base and physical property from the threats of forest fires, floods and erosion. This calls for an ecosystem-based approach to the management of Ontario's natural resources, with ecosystems defined to include the economic and social activities of humans as well as the natural environment. Since the essential attribute of healthly ecosystems is sustainability, MNR's goal can also be described as the maintenance of ecosystem health through the balancing of environmental, economic and social components. Fiscal constraints and rapid change are moving governments to concentrate on outcomes. The accountability of a ministry can be more clearly defined and systematically evaluated if these preferred results are clearly defined, priorities are more explicitly determined, and the contribution of various activities, functions and strategies are more rigorously assessed. BENEFITS Accomplishing the above four objectives contributes to significant benefits in Ontario. healthy natural ecosystems, a healthy and safe natural environment for people, resource based jobs, community stability, competitive, natural resource-based industries, revenue to the Province, outdoor recreation. MNR's contribution to each benefit varies across the province. Other government agencies and other sectors of society also contribute to these benefits. Back to Main Menu Modified on 30-Oct-95.

Based on recommendations from the new Fish & Wildlife Advisory Board, Mr. Hodgson said that effective January l, l997, 48 lakes will be open to lake trout fishing with: no slot limits, a daily catch limit of two fish, two lines allowed for ice fishing, permission to use live bait. On six additional lakes stocked by MNR as 'put, grow and take' lakes, fishing seasons will be expanded to open January l. (See lake lists for details.) "As a result of requests by the public, I asked the Fish and Wildlife Advisory Board to consider options which would benefit the lake trout fishery and increase recreational fishing opportunities," Mr. Hodgson said. "The board worked closely with MNR staff to build on the lake trout strategy we had developed earlier." The Minister also announced that MNR will be initiating lake surveys in l997 and l998 on each of the 48 lakes to determine the best future management strategy. These surveys will be funded from Ontario fishing and hunting licence revenues. New ministry legislation has made it possible for these revenues to be used directly to benefit fish and wildlife programs. "In response to the Minister's request, we conducted an extensive review with the angling public, fishery biologists with the Ontario Federation of Anglers & Hunters, and MNR fish management staff," Fish and Wildlife Advisory Board Chairman Phil Morlock said. "Our recommendations are built on the foundation that conservation of the resource is the first priority, which is the message we also received from the angling public across central Ontario." The Minister has asked MNR staff to continue to work closely with the board and local committees to streamline lake trout regulations and to explore other management options that can continue to improve the quality of fishing in the region.

"I want to improve MNR's tag allocation systems and I have asked George Simmons to provide me with advice on how to do it," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We are aware from our mail surveys that 56 per cent of responding hunters are dissatisfied with the current approach. With 110,000 moose hunters applying annually for approximately 20,000 tags in Ontario, we know we can't eliminate all complaints, but I hope we can reduce them substantially." Mr. Simmons has a background in municipal politics in central Ontario. His qualifications to conduct this review include his many years of experience hunting moose and deer in Ontario and his strong desire to see the quality of hunting in this province maintained and improved. Mr. Hodgson has instructed Mr. Simmons to meet with executives of provincial and local wildlife associations across the province between now and March 31, 1997 and to submit a written report by April 30, 1997. MNR hopes to implement recommendations for improvements in time for the 1997 hunting season. As of December 11, 1996, Mr. Simmons had already met with officials of the Ontario Conservation Officers Executive, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Big Game Committee and a hunt camp group. Hunters who wish to contribute to the review process should make their views known to the officers of wildlife or hunting organizations to which they belong. Before making his final recommendations, Mr. Simmons will again contact all the groups making submissions to see if they have any additional comments or recommendations. Interested members of the public can also submit their input and recommendations in writing directly to Mr. Simmons.

"This study will ensure the regulations we have in place are sufficient to protect the lake's walleye population over the long term," said Mr. Hodgson. "A healthy walleye population is important for the continued economic health of this area which is widely celebrated for its great fishing." This is the first year of the three-year project designed to monitor new fisheries regulations such as the slot size and trophy limits that came into effect in the early 1990s. Ministry of Natural Resources staff from both the Sioux Lookout and Red Lake offices will work in partnership with the Lac Seul Advisory Committee (LSAC), the local chapter of the Federation of Ontario Anglers and Hunters, the Sioux Lookout/Hudson Tourist Association, the Ear Falls/Perrault Falls Tourist Association and more than a dozen area tourist operators. The goal of this partnership is to protect the lake's walleye population for generations to come. "The slot size and trophy regulations were recommended to the ministry to prevent an over-harvest situation from developing," said Gary Beardsley, a member of the LSAC and a tourist operator on the lake. "The project has increased local interest in monitoring Lac Seul's high quality fishery. We are pleased to contribute to projects like this which will benefit everyone over the long term." In an effort to conduct an extensive two-week netting study of Lac Seul's walleye population this past September, ministry partners provided manpower and equipment totalling about $21,000. MNR provided about $17,000 including the staff expertise to design and supervise the project and analyse the results. Similar preparations are being arranged for the next two years of this study. During the random netting study this September, a few lodge guests who were present became interested and even asked to help out. "One of the lodge guests from Minnesota told us that the netting program was an incredible learning experience," said Al Mathews, MNR's Sioux Lookout District Manager. "He wrote a note to MNR to thank the lodge owners for their efforts to keep Lac Seul the best fishing lake he had ever seen." Mr. Mathews commended MNR's partners for their commitment to get more involved in gathering information that is used to make fisheries management decisions. Lac Seul is about 150 kilometres long and 1,500 square kilometres in area, making it the second largest lake wholly in Ontario. Due to its size, Lac Seul comprises the entirety of Division 30 as described in the Sport Fishing Regulations Summary. A variety of fish species is found within the seven management zones of Lac Seul, including walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and muskellunge. Walleye is the favourite sport fish of the thousands of visitors who come to Lac Seul from all over the world to fish. If data gathered from this project result in recommendations for changes to current regulations, the public will be advised and asked for comment through the Lac Seul Advisory Committee and the MNR.

"I'm committed to expanding Wabakimi Provincial Park as soon as possible," Mr. Hodgson said. "To finish the process of park expansion, we want a final review of the proposed boundary for the park." MNR is seeking public input into the proposed new boundary for Wabakimi Provincial Park. The proposal is to add more than 700,000 hectares to the existing Wabakimi Wilderness Park which is 155,000 hectares. At close to 900,000 hectares, this provincial park would be the largest provincial park within the forested region of Ontario, and the second biggest provincial park in the province, the largest being Polar Bear Provincial Park. This area is well known for its ecological features and recreational opportunities. The proposal to expand the park builds on the recommendations of a boundary review committee that represented local interests. MNR's proposal to expand Wabakimi will create an extensive protected area with no mining, timber harvesting and hydroelectric development. The permitted uses recommended for the park recognize the importance of protecting the environment while encouraging recreation and related economic activity, particularly tourism. Ministry staff will work with Aboriginal communities adjacent to the proposed new boundary on arrangements that will see their traditional uses of the area continues. MNR has developed an information package on the boundary proposal that is available through Ontario's Environmental Registry. Copies are also available through the MNR's Northwest Regional office. The deadline for comments is January 31, 1997. Following the public review and park regulation, the park management planning process will begin. There will be more public involvement during the park management planning stage. Please also read the Wabakimi fact sheet and summary.

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced a final review period on December 12, 1996. Wabakimi Provincial Park is located approximately 300 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, near the community of Armstrong in Northwestern Ontario. The Ministry of Natural Resources will analyse the comments from the public review before regulating the proposed park boundary early next year. What is the public being asked to review? 1. Comments are requested on a specific proposal for an expanded boundary for Wabakimi Park. In 1992 the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) initiated a review of the original boundary of Wabakimi Provincial Park to look at the park's size, shape and representation of natural features. A proposal to expand Wabakimi was announced in April of 1995 with many details about the proposed expansion left to be worked out before the park could be regulated. These details included minor boundary adjustments and an accurate mapping of the boundary location. MNR staff have completed this work in the boundary proposal now available for public comment. A Boundary Proposal Information Package is available that includes a map of the proposed expansion. 2. General comments are requested regarding the permitted uses recommended for the expanded area. The Wabakimi Park Boundary Committee, representing local interests, recommended permitted uses for an expanded park based on ecosystem protection, recreation opportunities and maintenance of existing remote tourism activities. MNR's boundary proposal reflects the input of the committee. Many of the current recreational and economic uses within the proposed expanded park area will continue to be permitted. These include remote tourism, mechanized travel, hunting, trapping and bait fishing. These are outlined in detail in the Boundary Proposal Information Package. More detailed consideration will be given to the extent and location of some permitted uses during park management planning. What other information is found within the final boundary proposal? The boundary proposal includes information on accommodating many of the current uses of the area through a unique framework of permitted uses recommended for the expanded park area. The proposal also recommends that the expanded park area be classified as a Natural Environment Park. The original 155,000-hectare Wabakimi Provincial Park will retain its wilderness classification. Traditional Aboriginal uses will continue within all of the expanded park area. There is an area of 550 ha of leased mining claims near the northwestern edge of the proposed expansion. Discussions are continuing with the primary leaseholder regarding the status and future of these claims. What happens after the review? The Minister of Natural Resources plans to proceed with park regulation after this review of the boundary proposal. It is anticipated that regulation will occur in the spring of 1997. Park regulation will be followed by a more detailed park management planning phase, during which additional public comments will be requested. MNR will amend the District Land-use Guidelines for Nipigon and Ignace to reflect the approved boundary and permitted uses resulting from this review. How to get the information package: Copies of the Boundary Proposal Information Package that provides additional details are available by calling (807) 475-1251. The information is also on Ontario's electronic Environmental Registry (ER) and can be accessed using a home computer and modem (dial 1-800-667-9979). The ER is also available at most public libraries.

After expansion, Wabakimi Provincial Park will be the largest area of protected boreal forest in Ontario and the second largest provincial park (Polar Bear being the largest). The proposed boundary expansion will add substantially to the conservation values already included within the existing Wabakimi Provincial Park boundary, without compromising established recreational and tourism uses. Some of the key values of the expanded park are summarized below: Woodland Caribou: the boundary proposal incorporates a large portion of high-value caribou habitat (a total of 550,000 hectares) the area will include key winter habitats, calving lakes and travel corridors the expansion area is sufficiently large to provide for seasonal habitat requirements of many of the area's caribou an estimated 300 or more woodland caribou inhabit the expanded park area for at least part of the year Landscape Features: several provincially significant earth science features representing past glacial history - the Nipigon Moraine, Pikitigushi Spillway, and a portion of the Agutua Moraine a diversity of kames, dune complexes, peatlands and other features Watershed Integrity: the proposed expansion area incorporates, to the extent possible, complete watersheds, sections of watersheds and heights of land Cultural Values: much of the expansion area forms part of the traditional use areas for the two Aboriginal communities and four First Nations surrounding the expansion area traditional Aboriginal uses include trapping, fishing, hunting, medicinal plant gathering and summer camps the unique residence of the reclusive inventor Wendell Beckwith an important pictograph site, and other Aboriginal cultural values Canoeing: a diversity of canoeing opportunities, including whitewater, rivers and large lakes more than 1,700 km of canoe routes major canoe routes include the Flindt, Allanwater, Berg, McKinley, and Ogoki rivers linkages with the Brightsand, Kopka and Albany River Waterway Provincial Parks Remote Tourism: the proposed expansion area is highly used for fly-in fishing and hunting 43 tourism establishments, both outposts and main base lodges a high density of tourism establishments - the proposed expanded park area contains over 90 per cent of the existing remote tourism capacity within a 120-km radius of Armstrong Please also read the Wabakimi news release and fact sheet.

The guidelines are designed to help protect public safety and the environment. The new guidelines cover activities for which MNR used to issue work permits under legislation such as the Public Lands Act and the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act. MNR's new guidelines provide information on how to conduct such activities as mineral exploration, the construction of floating or pole-supported docks and logging activities such as road building covered under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA). MNR still requires permits for many activities on Crown land. For example, MNR requires a permit for dredging activity that has the greatest potential for environmental harm including dredging new boat channels, swimming areas, and dredging to remove rocks and boulders. Other examples of permits MNR still requires include ones for: structures that occupy more than 15 square metres of shorelands (examples: concrete docks, boat ramps, docks and boathouses with a total crib surface area greater than 15 square metres) dredging and filling activities construction of breakwalls construction of all new roads construction of trails, other than for mineral exploration purposes construction of bridges and dams installation of large culverts or culverts draining a large area construction of most buildings on public landremoval of aquatic vegetation MNR encourages people to contact their nearest ministry district or area office to obtain a fact sheet that outlines the guideline for the activity they want to undertake. The fact sheets are listed at the end of this document. Ministry staff will work with the public to ensure that a clear understanding exists regarding responsibilities and MNR's enforcement mandate for ecological sustainability. MNR only eliminated permits that will not compromise ecological sustainability or public safety or permits that duplicated other forms of approval. Companies, agencies and individuals continue to be responsible for insuring that their actions won't harm public safety or ecological sustainability when working on Crown or private land. People conducting activities on Crown or private land are expected to comply with all other federal and provincial legislation such as the Federal Fisheries Act, the CFSA, the Mining Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Planning Act. MNR has already issued new burning guidelines that replace the need for fire permits for the burning of piles of wood, leaves and grass, or fires for cooking or warmth within the province's fire regions. The fire guidelines simplify the rules for the use of fire. They outline the types of fires people may use without a permit, the safe burning times during the day when those fires can be set, and the safe size of the fire allowed. Fires must be kept under control and must comply with the Forest Fires Prevention Act. MNR still requires permits for large fires such as burning debris from forestry operations. MNR retains the right to ban all fires when forest fire conditions are extreme. The changes to reduce the need for some fire and work permits has cut red tape, reduced the number of permits the ministry previously required, and will save more than $1 million in unnecessary paperwork and staff time. Before the changes in permitting, MNR processed about 59,000 individual permits a year. The ministry expects to reduce that total number by about 80 per cent. More than 37,000 of the reduction comes from eliminating unnecessary fire permits that MNR used to issue for small fires, and for incinerators.

Changes to the Act are as follows: A permit will not be required to burn piled wood, brush, or discarded wood by-products if: the material to be burned is in a pile less than two metres high and less than two metres in diameter; the fire is started no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished two hours after sunrise or earlier; a responsible person is available to tend the fire, and the person tending the fire has tools or water to contain the fire; the fire is two metres away from any flammable material. A permit will not be required to burn grass or leaves if: the total area to be burned does not exceed one hectare; the length of the flaming edge does not exceed 30 metres; the fire is started no sooner than two hours before sunset and extinguished two hours after sunrise or earlier; a responsible person is available to tend the fire, and the person tending the fire has tools or water to contain the fire. A permit will not be required for incinerators if they are: closed devices; at least five metres from any forest; at least two metres from flammable material; covered by a screen with mesh less than five millimetres in size; tended by a responsible person until the fire is out. A permit will not be required for: fires established for cooking or to provide warmth; travel within a restricted fire zone. Permits will not be required for: Logging, mining, land clearing, dam construction, operating a mill or any other activity liable to cause the accumulation of slash or debris. Information and operating conditions will be included in authorizations granted under other authorities, such as the Crown Forests Sustainability Act, Public Lands Act, and the Mining Act. Permits will continue to be issued for the following: all industrial slash pile burning operations; prescribed burns for site preparation, ecological maintenance and rehabilitation or other similar purpose; all other fires.

What you should know about Fish Habitat and Building Docks and Boathouses FACT SHEET The waters in front of your property are important fish habitat. To maintain the shoreline waters so that fish may continue to live in these areas, you need to build your waterfront structures with care. This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to build a dock or boathouse. It outlines the types of docks and boathouses that require a work permit under the Public Lands Act. For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for dock or boathouse construction. If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases. PERMITS The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land. In the past, any dock or boathouse built on this land needed a work permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources. Recent legislative changes removed the requirements for work permits for most docks and boathouses. Listed below are the types of docks and boathouses that do, and do not, require a permit. Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau or Trent-Severn Waterway, these areas are under Federal jurisdiction. Approval for in-water and shoreline works in these areas will be granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada. Docks and boathouses which WILL NOT require a work permit: Cantilever docks Floating docks and floating boathouses Docks and boathouses supported by posts, stilts, or poles Boathouses built above the high water mark Crib docks and crib boathouses where the total supporting crib structure (including historical crib structures) does not exceed 15 sq. metres in surface area. Any combination of the above (e.g. a floating dock with a crib < 15 sq. metres). Boat lifts and marine railways Removal of an old dock or boathouse Docks and boathouses which WILL require a work permit: Crib docks and/or boathouses where the total surface of all historical cribs and the proposed new cribs exceeds 15 sq. metres in surface area. Docks with solid foundations (e.g. concrete), jetty docks, or docks constructed with steel sheeting Boathouses with solid foundations (e.g. concrete) If you plan to build any of the structures described in section 2, you will need approval under the Public Lands Act through the work permit process. You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. Projects that require a work permit, pose a significant risk to the environment. MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area. This takes time, so submit your application early in the planning process. Construction of any type of two story boathouse, or single story boathouse with living accommodations, on Crown land is not covered under the Ministry's free use policy. As a result, although you do not need a work permit, you will require land use occupational authority under the Public Lands Act, at an appropriate fee. If you are thinking about building any type of two story boathouse or a boathouse with living accommodation, contact your local MNR office early in the planning stage. Keep in mind that you may need other approvals. Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency. BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat. Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization. Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water frequented by fish. Breaking these regulations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and you may be required to cover the costs of returning the site to its natural state. If you suspect your property is adjacent to a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike, muskellunge, talk to staff at your local MNR office, or have your project reviewed by an environmental consultant. These fish species often have only one spawning/nursery site in the waterbody. Any structure placed near these sites could affect fish habitat and result in fewer fish. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The following best management practices will help to ensure that your dock or boathouse will not harmfully alter or destroy fish habitat. Following these practices will help to ensure that the terms and conditions of the federal Fisheries Act are not violated. In addition, it's a good idea to talk to local contractors, engineers, and building supply outlets, to ensure that all aspects of your project are completed properly. Select a structure which minimizes disturbance to the river or lake bottom: Cantilever, floating and post-supported boathouses and docks do not disturb river or lake bottoms or restrict the movement of water near the shore. These structures can actually improve fish habitat by providing fish with extra shelter from predators. From a fish habitat perspective, these structures are preferred. If your dock requires a concrete abutment, this should be located entirely on the upland property, above the high water mark. Limit the size of crib foundations: Crib foundations for docks and boathouses are acceptable if there is bridging between them which enables water to circulate. Small cribs are preferred. Vertical planking is not recommended along the dock, because it can restrict water movement. Remember, if the total surface area of your cribbing exceeds 15 square meters, including existing or old cribs, you will need a permit from MNR. Use clean rocks taken from dry land: If you are planning to build a crib dock or boathouse, use rocks that are clean and free of soil. The rocks must not be taken from the lake or river bottom, or the shoreline. Removal of rocks from these areas could destroy fish habitat and result in charges under the federal Fisheries Act. Avoid any solid structures without bridging: Generally, MNR will not approve solid docks made from cement or steel sheeting. These structures are vulnerable to ice damage, destroy fish habitat, and can create stagnant backwater areas. Be careful with pressure-treated wood: If you are planning to use pressure- treated lumber, all cutting, end sealing, staining, etc. should be done well back from the water. The wood should be completely dry before being placed in the water. These practices will help to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the waterbody. Avoid projects which involve in-water dredging and filling: Dredging and filling may be harmful to fish and their habitat. If your project involves dredging or filling, you will need a permit. Do not work in the water during the spawning and nursery period for those fish species in your waterbody: In-water construction activities during spawning and nursery periods could kill eggs and young fish. If you are planning intensive, in-water construction activities, contact your local MNR district office for details on timing your project to protect fisheries. For more detailed advice on how to perform in-water works in an environmentally friendly manner, contact your local MNR office.

What you should know about the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act FACT SHEET The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act gives the Ministry of Natural Resources the mandate to manage water-related activities, particularly in the areas outside the jurisdiction of Conservation Authorities. The purpose of the Act is to manage the use of the waters of the lakes and rivers of Ontario, to regulate improvements in them, and to provide for: preserving public rights in or over water; protecting the interests of riparian owners; management of fish, wildlife and other natural resources dependent on such waters; preserving natural amenities; and ensuring the suitability of the location and nature of improvements. The waters in front of your property are important fish habitat. To maintain the shoreline waters so that fish may continue to thrive in these areas, water-related structures should be built with care. This Fact Sheet provides important information for planning and building the types of "projects" that require a permit under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act. For situations where a permit is not required, this Fact Sheet outlines some best management practices. It also identifies several reference documents to aid in carrying out work in an environmentally sound manner. If these practices are followed, fish and wildlife habitat as well as riparian interests can be protected. PERMITS The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act applies to both private and public lands covered by water. In the past, the LRIA required approvals for any dam built on this land; i.e. a work permit from the MNR. Recent legislative changes removed the permit requirements for some types of projects, but not for others. Table 1 indicates what does and does not require an approved work permit under the Act.

You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. Projects that require a work permit, can pose a potentially significant risk to the environment. MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area, as well as other environmental concerns. This takes time, so submit your application early in the planning process. Keep in mind that you may need additional approvals. For example, property fronting on the Rideau Canal or the Trent-Severn Waterway, is under Federal jurisdiction; for in-water and shoreline works approval, contact the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada. Bridges and large culverts may require Canadian Coast Guard approval under the Navigable Water Protection Act. It is also important to remember that approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency. BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Construction activities in water disrupt water flows and cause changes to water quality and fish habitat. The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat. Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is specific project authorization. Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water frequented by fish. A conviction under the Fisheries Act can result in fines of up to $1,000,000 and/or imprisonment, and you may be required to cover the costs of restoring the site. Construction activities in water can affect fish habitat in three ways: placement of fill or building in-water structures can cover important spawning beds or feeding areas; digging and filling in water introduces sediment that can be transported downstream a considerable distance. Sediment can kill fish, destroy spawning beds, and cover food sources (4); and an improperly placed culvert can block fish migration routes if there is insufficient water depth, or if stream flows are too fast. If you suspect your property is adjacent to or upstream from a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike, or muskellunge, your activities could place important fish habitat at risk. You should either talk to staff at the local MNR office, or have your project reviewed by an environmental consultant. The destruction of a single spawning or nursery site can result in a reduced fish population in the waterbody. Such destruction of habitat could lead to charges under the federal Fisheries Act. At certain times of the year, fish are more vulnerable to harm from sediment than at other times. The risk of killing newly laid fish eggs can be reduced considerably by timing construction outside the fish spawning, incubation, and fry emergence times. This occurs at different times for different fish species. The local MNR office can provide information on times to avoid working in the specific waterbody you are located on. Being environmentally friendly requires understanding the consequences of your actions, the use of designs engineered to perform the function intended, reduction of short term construction impacts to the lowest level possible and elimination of any long term damage to the ecosystem. A reference source that sets out good design and construction practices for the installation of bridges and culverts is the "Environmental Guidelines For Access Roads and Water Crossings3. " BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The following examples of best management practices will help you ensure that your project will not harmfully alter or destroy fish or wildlife habitat. Following these practices will reduce the chances of violating the Fisheries Act. It is also a good idea to talk to a biologist and an engineer to ensure that the design and construction aspects of your project are completed properly. Waterways must not be blocked so as to impede the free movement of water and fish. Culvert and bridge openings must be sized to pass flood flows expected during the life of the structure. Mitigation measures for erosion and sediment control must be used to reduce sediment entering the water to the lowest level practically achievable. Fill material placed below high water level within the floodplain of water bodies must be erosion resistant. The use of heavy construction machinery on stream or lake beds is discouraged during spawning and incubation periods and must be kept to an absolute minimum at other times. Fill slopes and waterway banks disturbed during construction must be trimmed to a stable angle of repose and protected from erosion. Upon completion of the project, any temporary fill, surplus culverts, refuse, etc. must be removed from the construction area and disposed of in a satisfactory manner. Measures must be taken to prevent contamination of waterbodies by foreign materials such as lumber, nails, logs, brush, fuel, oil, lime, cement, asphalt, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, oil base wood preservatives, and herbicides. Minimize the duration of construction, and stabilize exposed soils as soon as possible after final grades are established. Stabilize the site by encouraging the re-establishment of vegetation as quickly as possible: Avoid late fall or winter construction for works requiring vegetative stabilization. Avoid winter construction where soil compaction is critical to the structural integrity of the works (e.g. dams and culverts). Avoid construction on streams during high flows or periods when a spring flooding may occur. Protect existing vegetation as much as possible - it is nature's erosion control cover. Select a structure which minimizes disturbance to the river or lake bottom: For example, cantilever, floating and post-supported dock structures minimize disturbance to river or lake bottoms, and allow the movement of water near the shore. These structures can actually improve fish habitat by providing fish with extra shelter from predators. From a fish habitat perspective, these structures are preferred. Limit the area of disturbance: For example, a crib dock can be built with bridging between the cribs to enable water circulation. Small cribs are preferred. Construction which restricts water movement is not recommended. Remember, if the total surface area of your cribbing exceeds 15 square meters on the lake/river bottom, including existing or old cribs, you will need a permit from the MNR. Use clean granular materials or rock fill, taken from dry land: Materials that are coarse, with few particles of sand size and finer, will minimize sediment transport and provide a stable structure resistant to erosion. Material must not be taken from the lake or river bottom or the shoreline, unless it has been specifically authorized by MNR. Plan construction operations and materials to minimize impact on water quality: For example, if you are planning to use pressure treated lumber in a project, all cutting, end sealing, staining, etc. should be done well back from the water. The treated surface should be completely dry before being placed in the water. These practices will help to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the waterbody. Avoid in-water dredging: Dredging may be harmful to fish and their habitat. If your project involves dredging, you will need a permit. Avoid critical spawning and nursery periods: In-water construction activity should not occur during the spawning and nursery period for those fish species in the waterbody at the project site. It could kill eggs and young fish. For high risk projects, develop a Sediment Control Plan to guide the builders: These plans set out the construction sequence, expected operations that could cause sediment to enter the waterbody, and measures that will be taken to control erosion and sediment. Learn about potential impacts of construction and techniques to minimize the impacts: Information is available in the following MNR publications: Series of Short Fact Sheets titled "Working Around Water?

What you should know about Fish Habitat and Controlling Aquatic Plants FACT SHEET Aquatic plants are a natural part of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Plants play an important role in the ecology of shoreline areas, and they provide habitat in which fish can spawn, hatch their eggs, feed, and hide from predators. Aquatic plants also help maintain water quality by stabilizing sediments. The Ministry of Natural Resources aims to maintain and improve the quality of fish habitat in Ontario so that fish will continue to have healthy places to live. If you own or lease waterfront property, you can help protect the fish in your lake or river by protecting fish habitat along your waterfront. Having too many aquatic plants can interfere with boats, swimming and other water activities. At times, some control may be necessary. However, indiscriminate removal of aquatic plants can harm the environment and destroy fish habitat. This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to remove aquatic plants. It outlines when a work permit under the Public Lands Act is required. For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for aquatic plant removal. If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases. PERMITS Anyone proposing to apply a herbicide for the control of aquatic plants must first obtain a permit issued by the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MOEE) under the Pesticides Act. If you are planning to use a herbicide, you will not need a work permit from MNR. Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau Canal or Trent Severn Waterway, these areas are under Federal jurisdiction. To obtain approval for in-water and shoreline works in theses areas, contact the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada. If you wish to remove aquatic plants by physical or mechanical methods (e.g. using rakes, mechanical harvesters or bottom barriers) you may need a work permit from MNR. The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land. Historically, any project which involved aquatic plant removal on this land needed a work permit. Recent legislative changes removed the requirements for work permits for some aquatic plant removal projects. Listed below are the projects that do, and do not, require a permit under this legislation: Aquatic plant removal projects which WILL NOT require a work permit: Removal of up to 100 sq. metres of aquatic vegetation annually from any lake or stream located south of the line formed by Highway 7 from Lake Huron (at Sarnia) to Sharbot Lake at Highway 38, and the area south of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border. Aquatic plant removal projects which WILL require a work permit: If you plan to remove any amount of aquatic vegetation from a lake or stream in the area north of Highway 7 from Lake Huron to Sharbot Lake; or the area north of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border, you will need approval through the work permit process. Removal of more than 100 square metres of aquatic vegetation annually from any lake or stream located south of Highway 7 from Lake Huron to Sharbot Lake, and south of Highway 401 from Kingston to the Quebec border. If your project involves in-water dredging (removal of rocks or sediment from the bottom) or filling, you require a permit from MNR. Projects that require a work permit can pose a significant risk to fish habitat. MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area. This takes time, so submit your application early. You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. Keep in mind that you may also need other additional approvals (i.e. Parks Canada). Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency. BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat. Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization. Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water containing fish. Violations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and a requirement to cover the costs of returning the site to its natural state. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The following best management practices will help to ensure that your aquatic plant removal project will not harm fish habitat. Following these practices will also help to ensure that the federal Fisheries Act is not violated. To protect the aquatic environment, all plant control projects must be carefully planned and evaluated. Important factors include: Control methods: Many control methods are available for aquatic plants. These include raking, removing by hand, mechanical harvesting, using cutter-bar devices, bottom barriers such as mats or blankets, and the use of chemicals (herbicides). Generally, the preferred methods from a fish habitat perspective are hand removal and raking. The use of cutter bar devices or mechanical harvesting is also acceptable provided disturbance of the lake bottom is minimized. To use a herbicide: MOEE must approve your project, and you will need to obtain a Permit to Purchase and/or Perform a Water Extermination. Contact your local office of MOEE. How much to remove: The amount of plant material you may remove depends on the conditions in your waterfront site. Factors include the fish species present, the abundance and distribution of plants, and the reasons why you are controlling the plants. Generally, in lakes with extensive plant growth, you may remove up to 100 square metres of aquatic plants. However, in lakes with limited plant growth, removal of even small amounts of plant growth may be unacceptable. Dispose of the plants on dry land: If the plants are removed by physical or mechanical methods, they should be temporarily placed in a holding site distant from the shoreline before disposal. This prevents leaching of nutrients back into the water. Timing is critical: Warm-water fish species spawn during spring and early summer. Removing aquatic plants at this time could kill eggs and young fish. If you do not require a permit, we recommend that you only remove vegetation after the second or third week in June. If you are in an area where a permit is required, the permit will specify the exact time of removal. Avoid projects which involve in-water dredging and filling: Dredging and filling may be harmful to fish and their habitat. If your project involves filling or dredging (removal of rocks or sediment from the bottom), you will need a permit.

What you should know about Fish Habitat and Dredging FACT SHEET Shoreline waters are home to hundreds of aquatic species including fish. The nearshore area is where fish lay their eggs, feed, and seek protection from predators. Changes to these areas can threaten their survival. The Ministry of Natural Resources' goal is to maintain and improve the quality of fish habitat so that fish will continue to have healthy places to live. If you own or lease waterfront property, you can help protect the fish in your lake or river by protecting fish habitat along your waterfront. Dredging is the removal or displacement of any material from the bottom of a lake or stream. It can destroy the areas that fish need to live, breed and feed. If you want to dredge a large area, there is a good chance you will harm fish habitat. In addition your dredging project can stir up the material on the bottom of your lake or river, and this may affect water quality for you and your neighbours. If you decide to dredge, you will need to take special care to preserve fish habitat. This fact sheet provides important information for property owners planning to dredge. It outlines when a work permit under the Public Lands Act is required. For situations where permits are not required, this fact sheet outlines best management practices for dredging. If these practices are followed, fish habitat will be protected in most cases. PERMITS The beds of most waterbodies in Ontario are legally public land. Historically, any project which involved dredging on this land or on shorelands (defined as the area below the high water mark) required a work permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources. Recent legislative changes remove the requirement for a work permit for some dredging projects. Listed below are the projects that do, and do not require a permit under this legislation. Keep in mind that if your property fronts onto the Rideau Canal or Trent-Severn Waterway, these areas are under Federal jurisdiction. Approval for in-water and shoreline works in these areas will be granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada. Dredging projects which will not require a work permit: installing a water line, cable, or heat loop for private use (i.e. a single cottage or residence); log salvage; and submarine cables where laid on lake or river bottom. Dredging projects that WILL require a work permit: boat channels or swimming areas; installing a water line, heat loop or cable for commercial use (i.e. a waterline or heat loop for a lodge, marina, resort or large scale development); and Removing rocks/boulders, from shorelands or the bottom of the lakes or stream, to fill a crib or to create a beach. Projects that require a work permit can pose a significant risk to fish habitat. To assess the impact of your project on the environment, MNR may visit the site. This takes time, so submit your application early. You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office. You may also need other additional approvals (e.g. Conservation Authorities). Approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency. BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat. Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is clear authorization. Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water containing fish. Violations can mean substantial fines of up to $1,000,000, risk of imprisonment, and a requirement to cover the costs of returning the site to its original state. Dredging can effect water quality and destroy those areas that fish and wildlife live. Before deciding to dredge, consider the cost of the project and the cost of maintenance. Also consider if there are alternatives. For example, could you drive your boat around that shoal, stump or rock, or use an offshore mooring or swimming raft? BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The following best management practices will help to ensure that your dredging project will minimize harm to fish habitat and ensure that the federal Fisheries Act is not violated. Dredging methods: Many methods are available for dredging. These include removing material by hand or shovel, and mechanical methods such as a backhoe or other heavy equipment. The preferred methods from a fish habitat perspective are hand removal and shoveling. How much to remove: The size of the area you may dredge depends on your project type and the conditions in your waterfront site. Factors include the fish species present, the habitat at the site, the type of substrate, and the reasons why you are dredging. For those dredging projects that do not require a permit (e.g. dredging to install a private water line, or heat loop) minimize the size and depth of the area to be dredged. Generally, those types of activities that require a permit (dredging for a boat channel or swimming/beach area) pose a high risk to fish habitat. The size of the area to be dredged should be kept to a minimum. For example, dredging for a single boat channel should be no wider than six metres. A boat channel can be shared among adjacent property owners. For safety reasons, shared or community boat channels need to be wider than single channels. In most cases, community channels should not exceed eight metres in width. If you need a work permit, the permit will specify the area that can be dredged. Disposal of the dredge material: If the dredged material is made up of material that will not be transported by wave action, (e.g. gravel, rocks, boulders), it is a good idea to redistribute this material in the area immediately adjacent to the site on the lake/stream bottom. These materials provide excellent places for fish to lay their eggs, hide, and feed. Therefore by placing this material back into the lake (near the original site) you are moving that excellent fish habitat to another spot. Just be sure that you are not creating a navigational hazard. If however the materials are fine (silt, sand, clay), then all dredged material must be disposed of on land, and it must be suitably contained to prevent it from washing back into the water. Fine dredged material such as silt and sand can cover the areas that fish need to feed and reproduce. In addition these fine materials can affect water quality so you must ensure that the dredged material does not enter your neighbour's property. It is a good idea to cover the trench or dredged area with gravel or cobble material. Gravel/ cobble is stable and will not be transported by wave action. It is also very good fish habitat. If you require a work permit you should outline, in your work permit application form, specifically where the dredged material will be placed. You cannot dispose of dredged material in open waters unless you have special authorization from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy. In some cases you may also require approval from the Canadian Coast Guard. If you get approval, a series of rigorous chemical tests must be done to ensure the dredged material will not harm the water quality. You will be required to pay for these tests. Timing is critical: In-water dredging activity should not occur during the fish spawning and nursery period since it could kill eggs and young fish. If you are planning, in-water construction activities, contact your local district office for details on timing your project to minimize impacts on the aquatic environment. If your project requires a permit, the permit will specify the exact time of dredging. Maintain or preserve bankside or shoreline vegetation. Shrubs and trees growing adjacent to lakes and streams are important. This vegetation provides overhead cover for fish, shade to minimize warming of the water, and a source of food for fish as insects fall off the vegetation into the water. Near-shore vegetation also provides benefits to wildlife in the form of nesting sites, cover from predators, etc. In addition, the vegetation can help stabilize the soils in the area thereby minimizing erosion. The removal of some vegetation adjacent to the waterbody may be necessary to allow access of equipment. All areas should be stabilized to prevent erosion and replanted as soon as possible. Avoid areas with aquatic plants. Aquatic plants play an important role in the ecology of shoreline areas. Where possible, avoid dredging in these areas. If you must dredge in these areas contact your local office of the Ministry of Natural Resources. You may need authorization through the work permit process to remove aquatic vegetation. Avoid spawning and nursery areas. If you suspect your property is adjacent to a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike or muskellunge, we advise you to either talk to staff at your local MNR office, or have your project approved by an environmental consultant before you dredge. These fish species often have only one spawning/nursery site in the waterbody. Any in-water construction activity near these sites could affect fish habitat and result in fewer fish. Protect water quality: A sediment or silt screen should be installed around the work area prior to starting. After the work is completed, the screen should be carefully removed after all of the sediment has settled on the lake bottom. Work in the water on calm days. This will help prevent the suspension of fine sediment particles into the water column by wave action and will ensure the silt screen is not disturbed by wave action. WORKING TOGETHER TO PROTECT FISH HABITAT Help maintain the quality of our lakes and streams. For more detailed advice on how to conduct in-water construction activities in an environmentally friendly manner, contact your local MNR office.

FACT SHEET Approximately 87% of the land in Ontario is owned and managed by the provincial Crown. This land base includes the beds of, or land under, most navigable waterways. The Ministry of Natural Resources is charged with managing that land base for the people of Ontario in an ecologically sustainable manner. This fact sheet provides important information for individuals and companies intending to carry out mineral exploration, building construction or road/trail construction on Crown land in Ontario. MINERAL EXPLORATION PERMITS Since 1989 mineral explorers carrying out certain mineral exploration activities on unpatented mining claims have been required to apply for work permit approval under the Public Lands Act (PLA). Recent legislative changes to the PLA now limit work permit approval to the construction of roads and buildings. However, those engaged in exploration are still responsible for conforming with other legislation while carrying out their activities. Activities that will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act: prospecting activities including clearing, mechanical stripping, bulk sampling, drilling and blasting; and prospecting activities requiring the movement of heavy equipment, drilling rigs, etc., Activities which WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act: building construction. Buildings are defined as structures consisting of a roof, wall or floor, but do not include floating structures, docks, boathouses, tents or ice huts. Plan ahead. If there is no existing road accessing the proposed area, apply well in advance to allow time for your application to be reviewed. OTHER APPROVALS The removal of the requirement to get Public Lands Act work permits does not relieve mineral explorers from getting the applicable approval of other agencies (including Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, Ministry of Environment and Energy, Ministry of Labour). Additionally they are expected to continue to comply with all other Federal and Provincial legislation such as the following: Federal Fisheries Act - activities such as drilling on or near watercourses, trenching or stripping near watercourses that could lead to the harmful alteration of fish habitat; Crown Forest Sustainability Act - the cutting of Crown owned trees during road construction or advanced exploration (as defined in the Mining Act); Endangered Species Act - actions that will impact on endangered species of flora and fauna; Planning Act. The following groups or individuals should be considered, and consulted where appropriate, by the mineral explorer before the work begins: Surface rights owners - where the surface rights are owned separate from the mining rights; First Nations communities. BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Many mineral exploration activities, if not carried out in an environmentally conscious manner, have the potential to cause a negative impact on the environment. Fortunately, most individuals and companies involved in mineral exploration are aware of that potential and operate in a manner so as to avoid any problems or impacts. Exploration activities that commonly impact on the environment and suggestions to lessen these impacts are listed below: Drilling - normally there is very little impact from drilling , however, when conducted on ice or in or near water, the potential for allowing a deleterious material to enter the water is increased. This could lead to a violation of both the Fisheries Act and the Environmental Protection Act. Ensure that you can contain all of the fluids and cuttings to allow for appropriate disposal away from the water. Another area where drilling can have an impact is when located near an endangered species during a critical period of that organism's life cycle. This may be more a case of appropriate timing rather then a prohibition on drilling. For instance, delaying drilling near a raptor nesting site is critical when the birds are breeding, incubating, and rearing their young. Activities in or near water can impact on fish and fish habitat. You are reminded that the Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat by stating that no one may harmfully alter, disrupt or destroy fish habitat Also, no one is permitted to allow a deleterious substance to enter a waterbody frequented by fish. (A deleterious substance is any substance that when added to water alters the water in such a way as to be harmful to fish or fish habitat. Common deleterious substances are sand and silt that have been stirred up from the bottom during construction work or allowed to erode into the watercourse). Trenching - trenching can lead to hazards for both humans and animals when the trench is left in poor condition. Trenches are often left open to allow verification of work reported as well as ensuring the scientific benefit of viewing the exposed mineralization. However, care should be taken to protect the safety of other users and to protect the person who created the trench from liability. For instance, trenches that do not expose mineral soil should be filled in before leaving the area. Trenches that need to be left open should be sloped to at least a 2:1 grade and the excavated material should also be sloped to at least a 2:1 grade to avoid potential injuries to passersby. In addition you will want to consider excavating an escape route from the trench. Trenches leading to water should be stabilized to avoid any erosion of loose material into the watercourse. The eroded material would likely constitute a deleterious material resulting in a violation of the Fisheries Act and possibly the Environmental Protection Act. Landowner Concerns - because some exploration work involves heavy machinery the potential for noticeable changes to the land surface rights holder are very real. People involved in exploration activities on mining land where the surface rights are owned by someone other than the Crown should be aware of this sensitivity and seek to reduce the anxiety through consultation or possibly by avoiding working on/in certain sensitive sites. Often these precautions result in time saved for the explorer because potentially contentious issues are avoided. Included in this area of discussion are the locations in the province which are known to be of concern to the local First Nation communities. Examples would be activities conducted in close proximity to Reserves or areas subject to a land claim and sites that are considered to have ceremonial or religious value. Blasting - activities like blasting can be harmful when carried out near endangered wildlife species during critical periods of their life cycle. This could lead to inadvertent violations of the Endangered Species Act. Blasting that takes place within a waterbody must be in accordance with the April, 1990 Department of Fisheries and Oceans' "GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN CANADIAN FISHERIES WATERS'. Blasting in water can create a number of unwanted environmental concerns such as harmful alteration or destruction of fish habitat contrary to the Fisheries Act. Stripping - care must be taken when stripping overburden from a site to ensure that an endangered species of flora or fauna , or its habitat, is not destroyed or interfered with. Stripping near watercourses can also create the potential for erosion and care should be taken to stabilize the removed material. BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PERMITS The construction of most buildings and structures on Crown land normally requires the approval of MNR under the Public Lands Act in the form of a land use occupational authority. Since 1989, any construction must be carried out in accordance with a work permit. Recent legislative changes have amended the Public Lands Act so that some buildings and structures no longer require work permit approval under the Public Lands Act. The definition of a building that is contained within the new Regulation is "a structure consisting of a roof, wall or floor but does not include floating structures, docks, boathouses, tents or ice huts." Buildings or Structures which will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act: floating structures, ice fishing huts, tents; docks and boathouses , provided the structure is not supported by a solid foundation; crib docks and crib boathouses where the total surface area of all cribs is less than 15 square meters; maintenance and improvements to existing recreation and outpost camps. Maintenance of existing hunt camps (referred to as recreation camps) and outpost camps is subject to the conditions contained in the land use permit that authorizes the existence of those buildings on Crown land. NOTE: all buildings and structures constructed in the water MUST be in front of, and often attached to, the constructors' private property. Buildings and structures which WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act: construction of all new buildings consistent with the definition of a building mentioned above (e.g., recreation camps, outpost camps, trap cabins, commercial fish camps, recreational trail shelters and buildings constructed by the resource harvest industry). Anyone intending to construct or place a building, as described above, on Crown land will need the prior approval of a Public Lands Act work permit. You may obtain work permit applications from your local MNR office, but remember to plan ahead and apply well in advance of your proposed construction date. OTHER APPROVALS The construction of most buildings and structures on Crown land normally requires separate land use occupational authority. This authority is processed by the local MNR staff and often requires the payment of rent. It is the responsibility of the constructor of any building or structure including docks, boathouses, etc. to comply with all existing laws and requirements. For instance, most buildings and structures placed in areas in municipalities require building permit approval before construction. All buildings must be built in accordance with the Ontario Building Code. ROADS AND TRAILS PERMITS Since 1989, the clearing of any Crown land required the prior approval of a Public Lands Act work permit. Often that clearing was the first step in the construction of a road or trail. Recent legislative amendments have removed this requirement. However, the amended legislation requires work permit approval for the construction of roads and trails. Trails are defined as "a path over public land not used for mineral exploration or extraction". Roads or Trails that will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act: all roads or trails that already exist and do not require construction; all roads and trails that are constructed as part of a forest operation activity that is subject to the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA); all trails constructed for mineral exploration or extraction; general maintenance of existing roads and trails such as grading, brushing, trail grooming, etc. Roads or Trails that WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act: all new roads constructed on Crown land (except those subject to CFSA); all new trails except those constructed for mineral exploration or extraction purposes; existing roads or trails that are altered, widened, etc., other than what could be considered normal maintenance. Work permit applications can be obtained from your local MNR office. Remember to plan ahead and submit your application well in advance of your proposed construction date to allow for the necessary MNR review. OTHER APPROVALS Some roads or trails that are constructed may require separate land use occupational approval under the Public Lands Act. You will be advised by the local MNR staff should this requirement apply to any road or trail that you have received approval to construct. The Ministry of Transportation requires approval (entrance permits) for any road or trail that provides access from, across or to a highway right of way. BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY The construction of roads and trails on Crown land can often impact directly on the environment. However often there are impacts which are not so obvious . For instance, the clearing may cause violations of the Endangered Species Act, access corridors may be created that allow increased pressure on a remote fishery, remote tourism values may be affected through the creation of vehicle access to an area, or neighboring landowners may resent having access created to a previously boat access only area. It is important to consider all of these issues when any trail or road is planned. Often you will be required to resolve any issues before a work permit will be issued. All roads and trails constructed on Crown land must be done so in accordance with the publication "ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDELINES FOR ACCESS ROADS AND WATER CROSSINGS, 1988".

This includes red and white pine in protected areas, conservation reserves and areas available for logging. Forest areas where red and white pine are the dominant species (40 per cent or more of all species present on any given stand), cover 723,658 ha. In forest areas where red and white pine dominate, more than 124,000 ha are classified as old red and white pine. In these areas, MNR policy on the conservation of old growth pine will ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems, including old growth stands, are present on the landscape now and in the future. To qualify as red and white pine old growth, a forest must meet certain criteria including the presence of old trees, associated trees and other plants, and little or no traces of activities such as logging. MNR has protected 66,000 ha of old growth red and white pine - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management areas. The following table shows the total area of red and white pine forests older than 120 years that are protected in Ontario: Region Parks Conservation Reserves Total Protected Area Northwest 17,900 ha + 3,200 ha = 21,100 ha Northeast 3,500 ha + 19,000 ha = 22,500 ha South-Centre 2,400 ha = 2,400 ha No-cut Reserves = 20,000 ha Total = 66,000 ha This protection of red and white pine across its range includes 16,345 ha of old growth red and white pine forest in Quetico Wilderness Park in Northwestern Ontario, and in the Southcentral Region, 955 ha as part of 11,250 ha of protected red and white pine 81 years and older in Algonquin Park. Of the total 66,000 ha area, nearly 11,000 ha is old growth red and white pine that is protected in the Temagami area. A citizens committee, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), recommended that the government protect 12 old growth red and white pine sites in Temagami. The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on old growth. Protection and Regeneration MNR has adopted a Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red and White Pine Ecosystems in Ontario. It commits MNR to protecting representative areas of old growth red and white pine forests to allow those areas to evolve through natural ecological processes. A key feature of MNR's conservation strategy is to leave healthy old trees (120 years and older), snags (standing dead trees), dying and rotting trees on red and white pine sites after logging. MNR's goal is to ensure that a range of ages from young to old red and white pine trees are left in areas across the forested landscape. Where possible, protected areas will be surrounded by young red and white pine forest, so that the full range of ages is maintained to replace old growth in protected areas that change as a result of successional pressures such as wildfire and individual tree mortality. To ensure genetic conservation, natural regeneration, and wildlife habitat protection in red and white pine forests, MNR will leave healthy, mature seed trees in the harvested area, including some of the straightest and oldest, as well as dead and dying trees. In addition, tree tops and limbs of harvested trees are left on the forest floor to provide wildlife habitat. In addition to protection and regeneration, the conservation strategy identifies other goals: Ensuring that in a stand where it is the dominant species, red and white pine will be maintained. Ensuring that red and white pine areas are not reduced to less than current levels. Restoring red and white pine areas, guided by historical records, within the bounds of silvicultural funding at the management unit level. Ensuring an age distribution that maintains old red and white pine stands in areas across the forested landscape. Providing a sustainable supply of red and white pine to the forest industry.

This 321-ha harvest area is part of a larger, mature forest containing stands of red, white and jack pine. The Owain Lake Block is being partially logged. Significant portions of the Owain Lake Block were harvested before. It is likely that the area was harvested before the turn of the century. In addition, aerial photographs taken in 1946 show conclusively that approximately half of the block was harvested sometime between the late 1930s and the early 1940s. The Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), a citizens committee, considered Owain Lake when it reviewed sites to be protected as old growth. The government accepted the CPC's recommendations that the Owain Lake Block did not qualify as a representative old growth site that should be protected from harvest. Following extensive public consultation, the CPC recommended a land-use strategy for Temagami that included recommendations on protecting old growth red and white pine areas. The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on protecting old growth. Conservation Strategy In planning for harvesting in the Owain Lake Block, MNR has applied its Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red And White Pine Forest Ecosystems. This means that many old trees in the Owain Lake Block will not be logged in 1996 and after any future shelterwood harvests; snags, dying and rotting trees will be left standing; and tree tops and limbs will be left on the forest floor. In addition, the plan leaves 93 ha in no-cut reserves where no logging will take place. The plan permits partial logging in 228 ha of the block. Species to be harvested include jack pine, spruce, poplar and white birch, as well as red and white pine. The "shelterwood system" used in the Owain Lake Block is a widely recognized harvesting method that encourages natural regeneration by leaving healthy mature trees standing, as well as snags, tree tops and limbs on the forest floor. Temagami Old Growth Red And White Pine MNR has protected nearly 11,000 ha old growth red and white pine in the Temagami area. This includes all 12 old growth red and white pine sites that the CPC recommended for protection. Old Growth in Ontario Protected areas in Ontario where old growth red and white pine is the dominant species (40 per cent or more), cover 66,000 ha - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management units. As the dominant species on any given stand, old red and white pine cover more than 124,000 ha in Ontario. Forests containing a component of red and white pine cover almost 4 million ha in Ontario, in an area that covers much of Southern Ontario, north to Lake Temiskaming and west to an area just south of Wawa. The red and white pine range also covers an area around Thunder Bay, Dryden, Fort Frances and Kenora. Both species are common in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region.

Today, through the work of conservation authorities across much of the province, Ontario has incorporated watershed-based resource management planning, and flood control measures into municipal and provincial strategic plans. "In recognizing this milestone in Ontario's history of resource management," said Chris Hodgson, Minister of Natural Resources, "we salute the long-standing tradition of water management, natural heritage protection and outdoor recreation Ontario's conservation authorities have brought to their communities." "While we are celebrating 50 years of community-based watershed conservation in 1996, more importantly, we are looking to the future and the challenge of providing essential watershed services in a rapidly changing fiscal environment," said Gerry Houston, Chair of the Association of Conservation Authorities. "The government will continue to work with conservation authorities and municipalities to further define their roles, and to achieve efficient service delivery, while ensuring that Ontario's tradition of watershed-based resource management is maintained and strengthened in the years to come," said Mr. Hodgson. In celebration of the 50th anniversary, the ACAO is planning events and activities over the next six months.

"Our government has promised fair and common-sense principles for meeting the objectives of environmental protection in Temagami," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This land-use strategy sets up a framework that will protect the environment, improve community stability and, after years of uncertainty, get on with the job of enhancing the quality of life in the Temagami area." Through the land-use strategy, MNR will create Protected Areas that prohibit resource extraction and Special Management Areas that require careful management of resource extraction. In both areas MNR will allow and encourage recreation and tourism. These areas will provide additional protection around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Together these areas total 300,000 hectares, an area about three times the size of the 100,000 hectares of forests and waters protected in seven provincial parks in the Temagami area. The province developed its comprehensive strategy from the 39 recommendations the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) presented to the government in April. "The CPC and predecessors spent nearly a decade undertaking extensive consultation with the public and studying land-use issues before recommending locally developed solutions," Mr. Hodgson said. The province's strategy adopts 22 of the CPC recommendations without change and adopts the other 17 recommendations with minor changes. As part of the strategy, the province will protect an additional 2,628 hectares of old growth red and white pine and will also protect the 3,520 hectare North Obabika site, which includes 939 hectares of old growth red and white pine. Protected old growth red and white pine sites will cover 10,800 hectares in provincial parks, the Lake Temagami skyline reserve and a new protection zone. "This government recognizes the importance of old growth forests. That's why we've increased the area of protected old growth red and white pine," Mr. Hodgson said. "We also recognize the importance of protecting headwaters in the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater park area and through the strategy we have added the necessary safeguards." The province has also acknowledged the need to resolve outstanding issues with local aboriginal communities. To provide the opportunity for resolution, the province has set aside lands that could form part of a land claim settlement. The Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat will pursue a resolution over the next two years. "We want to improve the quality of life for all communities in the Temagami area and that is why we have included in this strategy significant measures that allow us to work out agreements with local aboriginal communities," Mr. Hodgson said. Through the new strategy, MNR will establish four new land use zones in the Temagami area. These zones were recommended by the CPC. They are: Protected Areas where logging, mineral and aggregate extraction are not permitted Special Management Areas where resource extraction will be allowed under special prescriptions to ensure protection of significant resource values Integrated Management Areas where resource extraction and development will be carefully managed and public access will be less restricted than in the Protected and Special Management areas Developed Areas where resource management will be permitted and controlled to ensure it is compatible with other uses. MNR will also spend until September 30 working with local interests to examine a new governance structure for Temagami as part of the ministry's acceptance of the CPC recommendation on this issue. As a result of the implementation of the new comprehensive strategy, staking of new mining claims will be allowed to resume in areas identified for resource development. Following a notice period, staking will begin September 17. The notice period will be longer than the usual 60-day period to notify claim holders of the re-opening and to produce new, up-to-date maps for use by claim seekers.

"Etobicoke Motel Strip Park will become an important new green space on the city's lakeshore, and will form a link in the Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail that is currently being developed across the Greater Toronto Area," Mr. Hodgson said. The project -- which received approval in 1992 and will cost an estimated $8.3 million -- involves the creation of the park, a nine-hectare (13-acre) green space on the south side of Lakeshore Boulevard West between Park Lawn Road and Palace Pier Court. The province has contributed close to $4 million to date toward the project, with matching funds provided by the City of Etobicoke, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. Mr. Hodgson noted that the provincial funding will be used to help create the park, protect the Lake Ontario shoreline, improve the near-shore fisheries habitat and build an innovative treatment facility to improve the quality of storm water discharged into Lake Ontario from the local community.

"The forest fire situation in the north is serious enough to warrant the province's commitment of 4,100 firefighters and support staff to suppress the more than 175 forest fires currently burning," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We call upon people in communities with severe fire hazard conditions to use extreme caution if they decide to set off fireworks." Local municipal bylaws may apply regarding the setting off of fireworks. Members of the public should contact their local municipality before planning any event using fireworks. MNR is also reminding the public that they are responsible for any fire resulting from fireworks, and that they could be fined or charged under the Forest Fires Prevention Act if their actions result in a forest fire. A Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ) will continue to be in effect in the West Fire Region over the Canada Day weekend, or until fire hazard conditions are significantly reduced. The Restricted Fire Zone for the East Fire Region is scheduled to expire at midnight, June 26, 1996. For the exact boundaries of these areas, the public should contact their local MNR office. Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including campfires. The regulation does permit the use of a portable stove or charcoal installation but the public is asked to exercise caution. FOR MORE INFORMATION: Barry Radford Provincial Fire Centre SAULT STE.

"In keeping with its commitment to finding a resource management solution that is fair and equitable, and which respects the legal rights of First Nations, MNR is instituting a regulated system that we believe fairly accommodates these rights. At the same time, it will provide for a healthy, sustainable fishery that will benefit all the people of Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Justice Fairgrieve's 1993 decision regarding Aboriginal fishing in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay accepted the Crown's right to regulate fishing for the purposes of conservation and resource management, and that the Aboriginal right to fish was not an exclusive right. Through the commercial licences, the ministry is providing the two First Nations 50 per cent of the commercially allowable Bruce Peninsula catch. This is equivalent to approximately 540,000 kilograms (1.2 million pounds) of fish, mostly whitefish and chub. Chinook salmon, rainbow trout and brown trout are not included in any provincial commercial allocations. "The ministry is providing a fair and reasonable allocation to First Nation commercial fishers in the waters around the Bruce Peninsula," Mr. Hodgson said. Since 1993, MNR has spent approximately $2 million on commercial fishing buyouts and leasebacks for the waters surrounding the Bruce Peninsula. In addition, the ministry spent $400,000 on pre-negotiation discussions which took place with the two First Nations in 1994 and 1995. "We would have preferred a negotiated arrangement with the two First Nations. However, the reasonable efforts by both this government and the previous one, including the provisions of thousands of dollars to support discussions with the First Nations, were unsuccessful." Mr. Hodgson said. MNR will regulate the Bruce Peninsula Aboriginal fishery by issuing a commercial fishing licence under the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations (ACFLR), a mechanism designed by the federal government following the Supreme Court of Canada Sparrow decision. The ACFLR are applicable in Quebec and Ontario, as well as in federally managed fisheries across the country. They also permit the First Nations flexibility and are best suited to communal use, while ensuring that the commercial fishery is regulated, and fish stocks are protected. MNR has been in discussion with the First Nations regarding fishery management for three years without reaching a negotiated solution. This decision is unique to the area and does not affect other First Nations in the province. In the recent R v. Nikal case, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that licensing is a necessary first step to the preservation and management of the fisheries resources and that licensing will not of itself constitute an infringement of Aboriginal rights.

The Scarborough program will run from July 2 through to the end of August, while the fox baiting program will run from July 8 through to the end of September. The trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program in Scarborough will cover a 60-square-kilometre area bounded by Highway 401 to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, Victoria Park Avenue to the west, and Markham Road to the east. "We have assigned 10 ministry staff to the Scarborough TVR area," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "They will be setting live-traps, and all captured raccoons and skunks will be tagged for identification, vaccinated against rabies by injection, then released." MNR is asking the public to leave the traps alone, especially if they contain animals. The traps will be checked regularly. The Scarborough TVR program has been so successful that the 60-square-kilometre area has been free of rabies in skunks for more than seven years. Data collected from the program has also enabled the ministry to develop a strategy to keep raccoon rabies out of Ontario. That strategy is being used along the Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers to block the spread of raccoon rabies into Ontario. The fox vaccine-bait program covers an area from Hamilton to Oshawa. The northern boundary from Hamilton to Mississauga is Highway 5. From Mississauga to Pickering the northern boundary is Major Mackenzie Drive, and from Pickering to Oshawa the northern boundary is Taunton Road. MNR staff and volunteers will place 40,000 chicken/cod baits containing rabies vaccine in ravines and near fox dens. Each bait carries a label that reads, "Rabies Vaccine, DO NOT EAT," and MNR is asking the public not to touch the packets. The vaccine is not harmful to humans or to pets and other animals. However, it will not protect pets and other animals from rabies. Pet owners should ensure that their pets are properly vaccinated against rabies. Since the fox vaccine baiting program started in 1989, there have been only three cases of rabies in foxes in the Greater Toronto Area. Metro has been free of rabid foxes for two years. The goal of the ministry's rabies vaccine programs is to immunize between 60 and 70 per cent of the target animal population against rabies. MNR research shows that if a high percentage of animals are immunized, a rabies outbreak does not take hold in the animal population.

"Effective midnight tonight, the Restricted Fire Zone now will include the MNR districts of Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, and all of Manitoulin Island," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This is a serious fire situation and we are using all our resources to control it." The RFZ, first introduced at noon Friday June 14, covers all of northwestern Ontario and those parts of northeastern Ontario located north of a line running from the Quebec border at Mattawa and along Highway 17 and the French River. There are currently more than 200 fires burning in the province, covering an area of about 230,000 hectares. Sixty-one of these firesare considered problem fires. There have been more than 370 new forest fires reported in Ontario between Tuesday June 11 and Tuesday June 18. "Our provincial fire program is responding efficiently and quickly to ensure human safety and the protection of valuable resources," said Mr. Hodgson. "I'm pleased that the forest industry is also pitching in by curtailing a lot of its regular harvest activities, and providing suppression assistance with crews and heavy equipment," Mr. Hodgson added. Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including fires for cooking or warmth. The regulation does permit the use of portable stoves or charcoal installations, but the public is asked to exercise caution. "High temperatures and windy conditions, which cause erratic and dangerous fire behavior, are expected to continue for the next few days," Mr. Hodgson said.

"This new 1-900 telephone application system will make the 1996 antlerless deer validation tag draw more efficient and cost-effective," said Mr. Hodgson. "Hunters can still apply by mail, the way they always have, but the telephone system offers many advantages over the mail application system." "Results will be available faster than ever before," Mr. Hodgson added. "Starting September 3, hunters can dial a dedicated 1-800 toll-free number to find out if they have received an antlerless deer tag." The telephone numbers are contained in a brochure that has been mailed to all deer hunters who have applied at least once for the draw during the last three years. The brochure explains in detail how to access the telephone application system and includes a worksheet to help applicants prepare all the information they will need when they make the call to the 1-900 line. A $5.10 fee is charged for every call and it will appear on the caller's next telephone bill. The telephone application system opens at 7:00 a.m. (EDT) on June 17 and closes at midnight (EDT) on July 31. Hunters can apply from home seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The service is available in English and French, at two different numbers. "All you need is your valid hunting-version Outdoors Card number and the numbers of your first and second choice Wildlife Management Units (WMUs)" Mr. Hodgson said. "Another feature of the telephone system that hunters will like is that they don't need to buy a deer licence before the draw. They will have to buy a licence if they have drawn a tag and wish to hunt an antlerless deer or an antlered deer." Hunters can access this system with a rotary-dial telephone or a touch-tone. Hunters should note that cordless phones, radio phones, cellular phones and pay phones will not work with the system. FOR MORE INFORMATION: Rob Savage Minister's Office TORONTO (416) 314-2208 J.J.

It is also illegal for anyone, including baitfish dealers, to purchase spawn from anglers. The amendment to Section 72, which took effect January 1, 1996, states that: "Except under the authority of a licence and in accordance with the regulations, no person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase, barter, culture or be concerned in the sale, purchase, barter or culture of fish other than species designated in the regulation." Fish spawn can only be sold by a licensed aquaculturist. Bait fish dealers can purchase spawn from licensed aquaculturalists for resale to anglers. This new regulation will protect natural fish populations in Ontario's lakes and rivers by prohibiting anglers from harvesting fish for commercial gain.

"The fire situation is reaching extreme levels and is now affecting most of Northern Ontario," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We are introducing the RFZ to reduce the risk of person-caused fires at a time when there are increasing demands on our fire fighting resources." The RFZ covers all of northwestern Ontario and, in the east, all lands north of a line running from the Quebec border just south of New Liskeard and running through Gogoma, Chapleau, and Wawa, and south of the Albany River. For the exact boundaries of each of these areas, the public should call their local MNR office. "The situation is not as critical in the east as it is in northwestern Ontario, but the high number of lightning starts, combined with high winds and continuing hot, dry weather are forcing us to take preventative measures across most of the north," Mr. Hodgson said. Currently, there are 249 active fires in Ontario, most of them in the northwest, involving approximately 31,200 hectares of forest lands. Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including campfires. The regulation does permit the use of a portable stove or charcoal installation but the public is asked to exercise caution. "With the Forest Fire Weather Index reaching extreme levels, we need the public's cooperation to ensure that no new fires are started in and around forest areas," added Mr. Hodgson.

The trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) program is scheduled to take place between June and November this year. Under the two TVR programs, raccoons will be trapped, vaccinated and released within a 680-square-kilometre area between the Welland Canal and the Niagara River, and along an area 3 to 10 kilometres deep on the St. Lawrence River. "Trained MNR staff will conduct the TVR programs by setting up live traps," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "Captured raccoons, skunks and foxes will be tagged for identification, vaccinated by injection with rabies vaccine, then released. Ministry staff will check the traps every morning." MNR is asking the public to leave the traps alone, especially if they contain animals. To date, there are no confirmed cases of raccoon rabies in Ontario. However, raccoon rabies has been reported in New York State, along the banks of the Niagara River, and within 10 kilometres of the St. Lawrence River in an area across from Gananoque. This will be the third year for the TVR program in the Niagara area. During the 1995 season, MNR captured 75 per cent of the raccoon population in that area. It is the second year for the TVR program in the St. Lawrence region, which has also been identified as a likely entry point for raccoon rabies. For the second year, a study which involves testing blood samples from a number of wild raccoons for signs of certain viruses, will be conducted in the TVR areas of the St. Lawrence and the whole Niagara Peninsula. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada requires that this study be done before any consideration can be given to using oral rabies vaccines for raccoons. Oral vaccine is currently being tested in the United States as an approach to preventing rabies in raccoons and other wildlife. Contingency plans have been developed by MNR and its partners on the province's Raccoon Rabies Task Force should raccoon rabies be reported in areas other than those with TVR programs. A provincial contingency plan is also in place if raccoon rabies should enter Ontario. As well, the Ministry of Natural Resources is continuing its work on eliminating fox rabies in Ontario this year. Since 1989, aerial baiting programs have taken place throughout the province and, by 2001, MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies from Ontario. A rabies hotline with two toll-free numbers is available to the public for direct and immediate access to information on rabies.

Marie area forest companies today advised the Ministry of Natural Resources that they are in a position to negotiate a Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) for the Algoma and Wawa Management Units. A shareholders' agreement between St. Marys Paper Ltd., AGAWA Forest Products Ltd., Midway Lumber Mills Ltd., Jager Strandboard Limited Partnership, and Levesque Plywood Ltd., will pave the way for the companies to apply to MNR for an SFL. "The shareholders agreement is a major step toward the development of Sustainable Forest Licences for the Algoma and Wawa management units," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This is part of our new business relationship with the forest industry that will ensure the long-term sustainability of resources and forest-dependent communities." An SFL is a 20-year renewable licence through which the licensee becomes responsible for all aspects of forest management planning and renewal. In return, the licence provides the company with access to a long-term wood supply and greater control over forest operations and planning activities. The company also has its own account in the Forest Renewal Trust fund. With this fund, a portion of the harvesting fees paid by the company are collected for future silvicultural works on its SFL management unit. "Our companies are committed to sustainable forestry and are ready, willing and able to assume our new responsibilities," said Mike Barker, spokesperson for the companies. The licence applicants will submit a detailed business plan including their specific goals and responsibilities for forest operations and planning activities, as well as business and financial information in support of their proposal. Once draft plans for the Algoma and Wawa units are completed and accepted by MNR, they will form the basis for the proposed SFL. "Prior to approving an SFL on the Wawa and Algoma Management Units, MNR will want to be satisfied that existing wood commitments to the industry will continue to be met, and that the arrangements put in place for existing smaller companies and operators are fair," said Wawa District Manager Quentin Day. The proposed SFLs will undergo a 30-day public review. The public will be invited to participate through media notices, a public advertisement, letters to local stakeholders groups, and public meetings.

"The Ministry will begin immediately to develop and negotiate a new business relationship with the Federation," said Mr. Hodgson. "Partnerships such as this are an example of the government's new way of doing business. "This partnership will continue to position Ontario as a leading jurisdiction in resource management in North America," added Mr. Hodgson. "We represent the interests of 10,500 licensed trappers in Ontario and we are committed to establishing this new business relationship with the Ministry," said Murray Monk, president of the OFMF. "Fur harvesting in one of the oldest industries in North America, and this partnership will enable us to move fur management into the next century," Mr. Monk added. The OFMF is a grass-roots organization made up of individual trappers, local trapper councils and a board of directors elected by trappers across the province. The federation is committed to educating and training trappers, harvesting at sustainable levels and working with other groups to ensure the future of the trapping industry. "We want to ensure that trapping remains a vibrant and sustainable industry in Ontario, one that will continue to be naturally renewable," said Mr. Monk. "I have assigned Ron Lessard, Sault Ste. Marie District Manager to work with the federation as General Manager to assist in development of the new business relationship," Mr. Hodgson said. The federation's head office will be in Sault Ste.

These guidelines apply to the province's fire regions. "We have developed simpler guidelines that clearly outline the types of fires people can set without a permit. These guidelines apply to lighting a fire for purposes other than cooking or warmth and require the person to keep the fire small and under control at all times," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. The new guidelines result from changes to the Forest Fires Prevention Act. Under these changes, people no longer require a permit for burning grass, leaves, or woody debris, provided the fires fall within the guidelines. People are not allowed to start a small fire during the day, since that's the time of greatest fire risk. All small fires must now be started no sooner than two hours before sunset, and must be extinguished two hours after sunrise or earlier. Specific conditions about the size of a fire also apply. In all cases, a responsible person must attend the fire until it is out, and adequate tools and water to contain the fire must be kept on hand. "The new guidelines about safe burning times are a significant change from the past since they allow a person to set a small fire without a permit as long as the rules are strictly followed," said Mr. Hodgson. "During forest fire season, and when weather conditions are extreme, MNR will still reserve the right to ban all fires." Anyone wishing to start a small fire under the new guidelines must remember that he or she is fully responsible for that fire. People must keep the fire under control and comply with the Forest Fires Prevention Act. Measures under the Act related to safe burning, such as warnings, fines and, or charges, will continue to be in place. The conditions and specifications for incinerators are still in force, but permits are not required. However, permits will still be required for any large-scale, open burning. "The Forest Fires Prevention Act applies within the province's fire regions, including municipalities located within those regions," Mr. Hodgson said. "The only exception would be if a municipality has a bylaw regulating burning and requires a permit. In this instance, the bylaw would take precedence." For more information on municipal bylaws, the public should contact their nearest municipal fire department. Information on the province's fire regions and the new guidelines is available at MNR District and Area offices.

As in previous years, an alcohol ban is in place from May 10 to May 20 in selected provincial parks across the province. (List of provincial parks provided at end of release.) With the creation of Ontario Parks, visitors will begin to see some changes in how provincial parks are being managed this year. "Ontario Parks now have a revenue-retention system that ensures money raised at the parks stays within the parks system," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "Ontario's provincial parks will be operating more like a business as we work with potential partners and sponsors to ensure park visitors receive the services and products they want and need, and to ensure that our parks continue to be the finest in the world." Ontario's 265 provincial parks cover 6.2 million hectares and attract more than eight million visitors annually. "The protection of Ontario's natural and cultural heritage within provincial parks continues to be a priority for this government," said Mr. Hodgson. "As we enter what is expected to be another busy season, I would like to thank the people of Ontario for their ongoing support and interest in Ontario's provincial parks." The 1996 Provincial Parks Guide provides detailed information about Ontario's provincial parks.

"Changes to the ministry's aggregates and petroleum programs will eliminate red tape and inefficiency, streamline delivery and remove barriers to private sector job creation," said Mr. Hodgson. "This restructuring will maintain Ontario's leadership in regulating the two industries, and improve MNR's enforcement capability to ensure regulatory compliance," Mr. Hodgson added. MNR will work with the aggregates industry to develop a compliance partnership where the industry will be responsible for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring, while the ministry will concentrate on auditing and enforcement. "I am also pleased to announce changes to modernize petroleum regulations and bring them more in line with other jurisdictions," Mr. Hodgson said.A new type of well licence, for example, will make regulatory and administrative processes more efficient, while making it clear that landowners and well operators are responsible for registering their wells and meeting strict provincial standards. Changes to the Act will also support enforcement efforts, by increasing the maximum fine for offences under the Petroleum Resources Act to $500,000 from $10,000. Increased efficiency will also result from the move to simpler, more concise regulations, combined with clearly defined, detailed technical standards. These standards will allow MNR to be more responsive to emerging issues, while providing the industries with greater clarity about how they should manage their operations. These standards will be developed in consultation with industry representatives, and other key stakeholders, and will be similar to current Canadian Standards Association standards governing hydrocarbon storage.

Through business planning, MNR has restructured its non-renewable resource programs (aggregates, petroleum and brine) to shift more responsibility for direct program delivery to industry. MNR will concentrate its core focus on policy development, the setting and enforcement of standards, and approvals of permits and licences. This new business approach will also involve a shift from complex, detailed legislation and regulations to ones that are simpler and more streamlined, backed by detailed technical standards. This is similar to the approach taken with the forest industry under the Crown Forests Sustainability Act. The restructuring of the ministry's non-renewable resources program is consistent with the government's plan to provide better government services at a reasonable price to taxpayers. It will help to reduce the cost of government, eliminate red tape, and remove barriers to private sector job creation. The aggregates and petroleum industries will become more accountable for meeting provincial standards. Through compliance partnerships, responsibility for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring will be transferred to industry. MNR will be responsible for auditing industry operations to ensure compliance with legislation and standards, and for enforcing the law in situations of non-compliance. The revised Acts enhance enforcement through increased fines, longer licence suspensions and a longer time period to initiate prosecution. Companies, agencies and individuals will remain liable for their actions. Changes to Aggregates Industry Regulation Detailed guidelines will be provided in technical standards, which will be developed in consultation with industry and other key stakeholders. They will be published and available to all stakeholders and will provide greater clarity than the current regulations. Industry will be responsible for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring to ensure compliance with legislation, regulations and standards. Industry will be required to submit compliance reports to the ministry and will be held legally accountable for the accuracy of those reports. MNR will verify the accuracy of reports through random auditing. Two pilot projects in 1995 proved very successful in ensuring compliance. Public authority and personal aggregate permits will be eliminated to help facilitate streamlining of the program. Currently public authority and personal permits have a restriction which prohibits the resale of extracted material. Permit holders will now be able to obtain a new aggregate permit if they can meet applicable standards. If they are unable to meet the standards, they will have to get their aggregate from another licensed operation. In keeping with the trust fund model developed in the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, a trustee will assume responsibility for the functions associated with the aggregates trust fund. The trust has been established to collect and disburse annual licence fees; administer the Abandoned Pits and Quarries Rehabilitation Fund; and, administer a new pooled trust fund to provide for rehabilitation where aggregate permits and licences have been revoked as a result of default (e.g. bankruptcy). The Aggregate Producers Association of Ontario will be responsible for the administration and delivery of the rehabilitation program associated with the Abandoned Pits and Quarries Rehabilitation Fund. Changes to Regulation of the Petroleum and Brine Industries Similar to the aggregates industry, legislation and regulations governing the petroleum and brine (salt solution mining) industries will be streamlined and simplified. Operational standards will be developed to provide detailed, technical guidelines for the industry. These standards will be similar to the current Canadian Standards Association standard for hydrocarbon storage. MNR will continue to conduct field inspections with strengthened powers. For example, inspectors will have the authority to order the plugging of wells. Private inspectors, certified by the ministry, will also be used. This combination will provide a solid framework to guarantee operations are complying with Ontario's environmental standards. The revised Petroleum Resources Act enhances enforcement, including increasing fines (to a maximum of $500,000 from $10,000) and extending the time period for initiating prosecution. The current well permit system, which only addresses the regulatory functions associated with drilling, will be changed to a life-cycle well licence. This will require adherence to operational standards for the life of the well, from the initiation of well drilling to the final plugging and abandonment. The activities covered include drilling, production, maintenance, and change in well status or purpose. A life-cycle well licence will eliminate the need for annual production and rig licences and special brine well permits under the Mining Act. A new trust account funded by industry will pay for the operation of the geological core and chip library managed by MNR, ensuring the continuation of this information and research service to the industry and academic institutions.

Co-sponsors of the program include the Ontario ministries of Natural Resources (MNR), Health, and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Ontario Veterinary Medical Association and the Six Nations of the Grand River. "The fight against rabies is important," said Chris Hodgson, Ontario's Minister of Natural Resources. "We must take every precaution to ensure that all strains of rabies will eventually be controlled," Mr. Hodgson added. This year's rabies awareness program focuses on cats and how they can spread rabies to humans. During May, local Community Contingency Planning Teams will be organizing activities to educate the public on rabies and rabies prevention. The best protection against rabies is for people to ensure their pets are vaccinated and kept away from stray domestic or wild animals. If they suspect that they, or their pets, may have come in contact with a rabid animal, they should call their doctor or veterinarian immediately. Cats left outside, especially at night, may come into contact with foxes and other wild animals such as raccoons. Rabies experts suggest keeping cats indoors, or on a leash, especially in the evening. Cats and dogs should also wear a collar which properly identifies their owner. There is an ongoing concern that raccoon rabies -- which has been identified on the New York State side of the Niagara River, and within 10 kilometres of the St. Lawrence river near Gananoque -- may enter Ontario. A raccoon immunization program, called Trap-Vaccinate-Release (TVR), has created a buffer zone against raccoon rabies in that portion of Ontario between the Niagara River and the Welland Canal. Additional buffer zones have also been created at bridges along the Ontario side of the St. Lawrence River, where infected raccoons could enter from New York State. Through this program, raccoons are live-trapped, vaccinated, ear-tagged and released. MNR hopes that the TVR program will contain or slow the spread of raccoon rabies. MNR's Rabies Research Unit has also developed a contingency plan on how any potential spread of raccoon rabies will be contained in areas where the animals have not been vaccinated. This could occur where raccoons with rabies enter Ontario as "stowaways" on transport trucks, recreational vehicles or boats. The Ministry of Natural Resources is also continuing its work on eliminating fox rabies in Ontario. Since 1989, aerial baiting programs have taken place throughout the province and, by 2001, MNR expects to have eliminated fox rabies in Ontario.

Mr. Charles won the award for an article on lake trout entitled "Save the Lakers", which was published in the Fishing 1995 edition of Outdoor Canada magazine. "I congratulate Mr. Charles on winning this award and I commend him on his choice of subject," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "It is important for us to find ways to protect the province's trout populations. Through the activities of anglers and fish and game clubs, and the use of proper angling and live-release techniques, I am confident we can preserve trout populations in Ontario." The Greg Clark Outdoor Writing Award commemorates the late Greg Clark, a prominent conservationist and outdoor writer whose career as a reporter, columnist, humorist and story-teller spanned almost 60 years. The competition was administered by the Canadian Science Writers' Association. The article detailed the importance of lake trout as both a national fish, and as a popular fish in Ontario. It also informed readers about the considerable interest this species has generated in the angling community and how it is valued from both an ecological and economic standpoint. Mr. Charles describes the concerns over declining lake trout populations in Ontario, and explains how the Ministry of Natural Resources and some U.S. states are looking into ways of sustaining the trout population. "I am especially honored to receive the Greg Clark award," said Mr. Charles. "Mr. Clark has been an idol of mine for many years, and his writing has been an inspiration to me as I am sure it is to many writers. I am currently working on a series of short stories. As I write, I try to keep the spirit of Greg Clark alive by adopting his approach to outdoors storytelling, humour and reflections on life," he added. Mr. Charles works as a full-time freelance writer. He spent most of his professional career in Toronto as an on-air broadcaster and news director as well as a national anchor for Broadcast News and Canadian Press. He has also taught broadcasting at Humber College in Etobicoke.

The award recognizes Conservation Officers James A. Abbott, Timmins District, and David Arbour, Kemptville District, for their accomplishments in dealing with crimes against wildlife through the Crime Stoppers Program in Ontario. "I congratulate Jim Abbott and Dave Arbour for their excellent work with Crime Stoppers," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "They have contributed greatly to our goal of protecting Ontario's wildlife." The two Conservation Officers have been working jointly since 1991, actively promoting Crime Stoppers in their respective areas and across the province. In 1994, the two were invited to join the Ontario Advisory Board (OAB) of Crime Stoppers as MNR provincial representatives. "Through its association with Crime Stoppers, MNR has entered a new era of community-based law enforcement," said Mr. Abbott. "Increased public participation over the last five years has resulted in a more effective approach by the ministry to crimes against wildlife." "We have received tremendous response from all stakeholders," said Mr. Arbour. "We want to acknowledge members of the community at large for their enthusiastic participation from the very start. We also thank our superiors and colleagues in MNR for their continued support." Crime Stoppers is a non-profit organization relying solely on community support such as fund-raising. The program receives no government funding. Based on a partnership between the community, media, law-enforcement agencies, and members of the public, Crime Stoppers invites anyone with information on a crime to report it to the local program. If the information leads to an arrest, the caller is eligible for a reward while being ensured of complete anonymity.

"I am satisfied that the implementation of the recommendations from the review carried out last fall will result in enhanced safety procedures and effectiveness, within Ontario's prescribed burn (PB) program," said Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Hodgson immediately requested a review of prescribed burns and placed a ban on such burns last summer after two burns in the Wawa area escaped their boundaries. A Prescribed Burn Review Committee, which included representatives from the MNR, the Fire Marshal's Office, the municipality of Dubreuilville, Hearst Forest Management Inc. and the Canadian Forestry Service, presented recommendations in December for improvements in the management of prescribed burns. The recommendations included earlier identification of problem fires; a revised and more extensive PB planning manual for fire managers; and improved weather monitoring and long-term forecasting. This year MNR and its clients plan 35 prescribed burns involving a total area of approximately 4,500 hectares. The burns are primarily for site preparation for silviculture, ecosystem restoration, vegetation management and wildlife habitat enhancement. They range in size from one hectare burns for ecosystem restoration in southern Ontario, to a 1,400-hectare site preparation burn in Northern Ontario. "The use of prescribed burning as an effective and efficient forest and ecological management tool is widely recognized but it is not without a degree of risk," Mr. Hodgson said. "However, I am very confident that with the implementation of the recommendations we have further minimized any such risks."

The implementation of these recommendations have been summarized into four sections: Operations, Planning, Communications, and Future Development. Operations: Ontario's PB program now recognizes "problematic control" as a potential fourth stage of prescribed burning. This is defined as a condition when the prescribed burn (during any of its three stages of ignition, control or demobilization) is not developing as planned and the fire could potentially escape or consume more resources and funds than was planned. Specific criteria have been developed to invoke more aggressive action to extinguish the burn once this declaration has been made. Planning: A complete review of the Prescribed Burn planning manual this past winter has resulted in the preparation of a revised interim manual. This will be replaced in June by a final version which incorporates the recommendations of the review committee. New planning initiatives cover: criteria to be used in the planning process that will direct more aggressive control and management; planned contingencies for fires that go beyond prescribed boundaries, and which also may have environmental impacts; specific directions for communicating with communities in close proximity to burn projects. Communications: A more structured approach to communications both internally and externally has been developed. The communications section of the PB planning manual has been greatly expanded, and places greater emphasis on communications after ignition and during problematic control. Future Development: The PB program has upgraded internal weather forecasts through a new agreement with Atmospheric Environment Services, which also includes enhanced long-term forecasting and application. MNR's Fire Science and Technology Unit is also evaluating new developments in the field of infrared scanning technology, and their application to fire operations.

"With the creation of Ontario Parks, the government is charting a bold new course in park management in Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson. "As an organization within MNR, Ontario Parks will operate like a business. It will work closely with business partners, and provide our customers with the products and services they want and need. Most of all, it will ensure that Ontario's provincial parks system remains one of the finest in the world." Mr. Hodgson made the announcement this morning at the official opening of the new Sandbanks Provincial Park entrance way. Ontario Parks is the first entrepreneurial program of its kind in the Ontario Government. It is designed to maintain the goals and objectives of the existing parks system while managing the parks more efficiently. It will be accountable to the Minister through a newly-appointed board of directors, and will develop a "special purpose account" for retaining and managing park revenues. "Maintaining our parks system and protecting Ontario's irreplaceable natural heritage is a priority with this government, and a core responsibility for MNR," said Mr. Hodgson. "The new organization will provide opportunities for the private sector and allow the provincial parks system to continue to prosper in a challenging fiscal environment. "Ontario Parks will ensure that the parks system continues as a provincial showcase, enhancing tourism and business objectives for Ontario," Mr. Hodgson added.

Ontario Parks Mandate "To protect, plan, develop and manage Ontario's system of provincial parks while improving their self-reliance." This includes helping the province to establish new provincial parks and to safeguard the unique cultural, recreational and natural features of the provincial parks system through responsible land use planning. Ontario Parks will fulfil this mandate by providing a variety of outdoors recreational opportunities to the public and providing natural and cultural heritage protection within the park system. There are four objectives for the provincial parks program: the protection of significant elements of our natural and cultural landscape the opportunity for exploration and appreciation of our natural and cultural heritage the provision of recreational opportunities, ranging from day use to wilderness experiences the encouragement of economic benefits through tourism. Ontario Parks will balance the wants and needs of visitors for new services and programs, with a continued commitment to natural and cultural heritage protection. Business Objectives Ontario Parks has set the following business objectives: Provide strong leadership in natural and cultural protection. Improve customer service and market our products and services effectively. Move toward financial self-reliance in the parks. Operate more like a business. Build management and workforce excellence in business operations. Be a leader in building a new business model in government. Involve the private sector in program delivery, from service contracts to park contracting to partnerships. Business Plan A brand name for Ontario's provincial parks: Ontario Parks A new visual identity will be developed. The Minister of Natural Resources has the authority to establish a new board of directors. The board will be chaired by the Deputy Minister. It will have members from outside the Ontario government with interests in areas such as the environment, tourism, business, finance and education. A special purpose account for retaining and managing park revenues (fees, licences, permits, rentals) will be developed. It will improve customer service, maximize revenues and make park operations more efficient and accountable. Ontario Parks will be able to set or change park fees and charges, subject to the Minister's approval. Financial Projections Ontario Parks' business plan covers the five-year period 1996-2001. During that time:revenues are expected to increase to $20 million from $15 million; andcost recovery on operating and capital expenditures is expected to improve to 70 per cent from 45 per cent over the five-year period. Ontario Parks Today Today, Ontario's 265 provincial parks cover 6.2 million hectares. On average, parks receive some 8.5 million visits every year, with 20 per cent coming from outside of Ontario. Services offered in provincial parks include camping, picnic areas, visitor centres, museums, beaches, and trails for hiking, biking, skiing and snowmobiling. In addition, popular programs include outdoor education, resource management and research. All parks are open to the public and offer a variety of day-use and camping facilities. Of the 265 provincial parks, 105 are classified as "operating" and 160 as "non-operating". Only operating parks have staff on site. However, facilities in non-operating parks are maintained, and the public is welcome to walk into the parks and enjoy most traditional activities. Fifteen of the current 105 operating parks are scheduled to become non-operating parks, unless suitable partners can be found or other cost-saving measures are implemented. This will achieve a saving of $515,000. The parks are Batchawana Bay, John E. Pearce, Lake on the Mountain, Lake Nipigon, Mark S. Burnham, Middle Falls, Missinaibi, Obatanga, Pakwash, Peche Island, Peter's Wood, Port Bruce, Potholes, The Shoals and Tidewater. In addition, 12 parks may be operated with partners. This could provide a saving of $834,000. The parks are: Caliper Lake, Driftwood, Fushimi Lake, Greenwater, Inverhuron, Kap-kig-iwan, Lake of the Woods, Marten River, Mississagi, Ojibway, Ouimet Canyon and Windy Lake. As part of the continuing process to bring greater efficiency and effectiveness to government program delivery, Ontario Parks will offer new opportunities for service contracts within provincial parks in 1996. This will save the parks system approximately $1 million. Services that may be contracted include: road and ground maintenance, garbage disposal, janitorial services and snow removal. Service contracts will be established through a public tender process.

"With this partnership, the government is able to move forward to secure significant natural areas for the protection and enjoyment of future generations," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This land acquisition will also assist us in research and education efforts to develop a better understanding of Ontario's natural environment," Mr. Hodgson added. "Our organization has a long history of working with both private and public sector partners to preserve some of the best remaining examples of Ontario's diverse natural heritage," said John Eisenhauer, Executive Director of The Nature Conservancy of Canada. "Through the Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 program, and with a higher level of support from private sources, the Nature Conservancy looks forward to securing new park lands for the benefit of wildlife and as a continuing legacy for the people of Ontario," Mr. Eisenhauer added. The Nature Conservancy of Canada is a national organization dedicated to securing and protecting significant natural areas in Canada, and has worked in partnership with MNR over the years. The Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 agreement is based on a four-year plan, under which the Nature Conservancy of Canada will conduct a campaign to raise funds for the acquisition of new parkland worth at least $4 million before April 1, 2000. Annual reports prepared by the Nature Conservancy will provide updates on the funds raised and details on important land acquisitions.

The number of tags in some Wildlife Management Units has been reduced this year. However, some WMUs are in a position to offer more tags than last year. The largest reduction in the number of tags issued has taken place in WMU 35, in an area north of Sault Ste. Marie District. This is because of a decline in the moose population coupled with a greater than planned harvest of bull moose in 1995. For similar reasons other WMUs, including 13, 15B and 21A in Thunder Bay District, have seen a smaller number of tags issued than WMU 35.

"Given the current value of the Serpent Mounds property, the province can no longer afford to continue to operate the park and provide fair compensation to the First Nation for use of the land," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "My ministry is turning over all the park's fixed assets to the Hiawatha First Nation, and should the First Nation be in a position to operate the park, our staff will assist, where possible, in setting up the park operation to create an economic development opportunity for the community," added Mr. Hodgson. The parties agree that the park offers an excellent economic opportunity for the First Nation and surrounding communities. "Should financing be forthcoming, Hiawatha is looking forward to operating the park, keeping it open to visitors and protecting the area as a natural site which has cultural, historical and spiritual significance to Native peoples throughout North America," said Hiawatha First Nation Chief Frank Cowie. Serpent Mounds Park is located south of Highway 7 near Rice Lake and the village of Keene. Owned by the Hiawatha First Nation, the site has been leased by the province for the past 41 years to operate as a provincial park. The park is named for ancient Aboriginal burial mounds found in the area. The Serpent Mounds site is unique in Canada. Nine burial mounds located in the park enclose the remains of Aboriginal people who gathered on the shores of Rice Lake more than 2,000 years ago. Six of the mounds combine to form the shape of a serpent.

There are only four exceptions to this policy: Algonquin, Point Farms and Sauble Falls, where reservation services open April 1, and Quetico which accepts reservations starting February 1 as part of backcountry travel packages. In the past, a few other provincial parks have also offered early reservation services. Campers who have previously booked campsites at these parks by telephone, mail, or in-person will now be able to do so, beginning May 1. "This measure will reduce our operating costs," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We have tried to choose cost-saving measures that have the least impact on our park customers. We will have more than two months in which to process reservations before the busy July-August camping period," Mr. Hodgson added. "We will be working hard to accept customers' requests starting May 1," said Ontario Parks Managing Director, Norm Richards. "This year, another eight parks will implement the new computerized reservation/registration system, which will allow us to process applications faster. Now more than 80 per cent of our reservations will be handled through this computer service."

The documents were signed at the Ontario Out Of Doors 1996 Fishing Show in Toronto. The Ontario Family Fishing Weekend is designed to encourage participation in recreational fishing, especially by Ontarians who have never or seldom fished. "During the weekend of July 5 to 7, the people of Ontario and other Canadians will have a unique opportunity to enjoy recreational fishing without having to buy a licence," Mr. Hodgson said. "The Family Fishing Weekend is becoming a tradition in Ontario. It gives people who only thought about fishing an opportunity to try it and to learn about conservation and rehabilitation of Ontario's fishing resources." The weekend is made possible through the work of a steering committee comprising of representatives from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, the Association of Conservation Authorities of Ontario, the Canadian National Sportsfishing Foundation, Resorts Ontario, and representatives from the tourism and tackle industries. "The Family Fishing Weekend is a fine example of partnership at work," said Mr. Hodgson. "All partners on the steering committee contribute expertise and significant resources to make this a perfect weekend for all Ontarians to enjoy fishing." This is the third consecutive year that MNR and its partners are offering the licence-free fishing weekend. Studies done last year show that in addition to providing excellent recreational and educational opportunities, the event brought more people out to fish. This should stimulate the fishing and tourism industries across the province in the long run. The Fishing Show, where today's signing ceremony took place, is being held until February 18 at the International Centre in Mississauga. It is an annual event with promotional activities and displays that attracts some 40,000 anglers.

"The program will ensure that owners of private forest lands are in a better position to manage their woodlots for the long-term health of the environment," Mr. Hodgson said. The MFTRP -- which is being re-introduced as an interim measure until the property tax system is reformed -- is designed to promote better management of private woodlands, contribute to the overall health of Ontario's forest ecosystems, and create rural economic development opportunities. It was first introduced in 1973 but was cancelled in 1993 by the previous NDP government which had other spending priorities. To control expenditures, the new program has an expenditure ceiling of $4 million. "The Managed Forest Tax Rebate will nicely complement MNR's Private Land Resources Stewardship Program and sustainability fund," said Mr. Hodgson. "Together, they will effectively encourage and support owners to invest in the management of their forests based on environmentally sound practices." The Ministry will work with the Ontario Forestry Association (OFA) and the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators' Association (OWSOA) to conduct information sessions for private woodlot owners across Ontario. "We are pleased to be working with the Ministry on this important initiative which will benefit both woodlot owners and the environment," said Rick Monzon, OFA's Executive Director. "This program will ensure that communities continue to reap the benefits of well-managed private forest lands," said Harry Barr, President of OWSOA. "Snowmobile clubs depend on the goodwill of private landowners who permit organized recreational trails to cross their property. The MFTRP was very helpful in promoting a broader view of the importance of recreational access to private woodlots and the OFSC has strongly advocated its re-establishment," said Ron Purchase, General Manager of the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs. Mr. Hodgson also announced that MNR's Private Forest Sustainability Fund will be reduced to $1 million from $2 million as a further cost-control measure. The fund was established in 1994 to support MNR's community-based programs that encourage good management of private forests. Information sessions will be conducted in various locations across Ontario during March and April, 1996.

Marie, North Bay, Parry Sound, Bracebridge and Bancroft have declared an emergency status for deer because of the severity of this winter's weather. "We have set up an emergency feeding program," Mr. Hodgson said. "Without these measures, conditions for deer could be critical by late March. MNR staff are monitoring the status of deer herds in other areas." Repeated snowfalls and unusually cold temperatures this winter have depleted the animals' fat reserves, which could result in high losses without emergency feeding. To deal with this situation, MNR has set up a feeding program with the assistance of several major partners, including the St. Joseph Hunters and Anglers Association, the Loring-Restoule Deer Feeding Fund, the Wildlife Winter Feeding Fund Inc. administered by Jack Newton of Huntsville, and the DeerSave Fund of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters in Peterborough. While the mid-January thaw helped briefly to make the situation less critical, recent snowfalls have again restricted deer movements. Deer started moving into their winter yards in late November - a month earlier than normal - where they fed on vegetation that they would have required later in the winter. "Many clubs, groups and individuals have contributed time, money and effort breaking trails, providing feed and donating money, Mr. Hodgson said. "Their help is greatly appreciated and will continue to be needed to help reduce stress on deer wintering in these key locations." Individuals and groups can help by donating funds to a group directly involved with this program, or by contacting the local MNR office.

It is also illegal for anyone to purchase fish caught by anglers. The amendment to Section 72, which took effect January 1, 1996, states: "Except under the authority of a licence and in accordance with the regulations, no person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase, barter, culture or be concerned in the sale, purchase, barter or culture of fish other than species designated in the regulation." Yellow perch angled from the waters of Lake St. Francis in eastern Ontario may continue to be sold, but only within the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. The sale of angler-caught fish has long been an issue within Ontario's angling community. With this new regulation, angling will focus on the recreational values of fishing and no longer involve commercialization of the fish caught.

Texas will pay all MNR expenses including salaries. "I am very pleased that MNR has been awarded this contract," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This is further proof of Ontario's worldwide reputation for excellence in rabies research and technology." The contract begins January 2, 1996. Last February two MNR Twin Otter aircraft were used in the experimental fight against coyote rabies in the state. An estimated 800,000 rabies baits were dropped over an area of more than 31,000 square kilometres in less than two weeks. The plan this year is to expand the coyote rabies bait drop zone to include the area baited last February, and to drop grey fox rabies bait in another part of the state. During the experimental drop last February, MNR air service staff flew and maintained the two aircraft, while MNR rabies research staff trained their Texas counterparts in the use of the Ontario-designed bait dropping equipment. The Ontario team included a Queen's University computer specialist who provided navigational data to ensure precise coverage of the target areas. This year's expanded MNR mission to Texas includes crews for three Twin Otters, five rabies research staff, and the Queen's University computer specialist. They will work every day for one month to complete the project. Ontario is well on the way to eliminating fox rabies in the province. The fox rabies control project, started in 1989, is expected to eliminate the disease in Ontario by the year 2001. This fall MNR dropped 1.8 million fox rabies vaccine baits in southern Ontario. In addition, the ministry provided aircraft, baiting machines and staff for similar, smaller-scale, bait-dropping projects in areas of New York State and Quebec which border Ontario.

"It represents a unique blend of private and public interests, and it is good for Etobicoke and Metro. "This will create jobs and stimulate the economy," Mr. Hodgson said. The motel strip redevelopment plan includes private commercial and residential development, along with development by the conservation authority of a new waterfront park and roadway. "The park will link the Etobicoke Humber Bay parks to the western beaches in Toronto," said Mr. Hodgson. "It is also an important part of the stormwater management system that is necessary if the rest of the development in the area is to go ahead". The properties being expropriated will form part of the park. The conservation authority has already negotiated agreements with other landowners, developers and public agencies for the rest of the land it needs.

The most recent round of public consultation occurred earlier this fall when Minister Chris Hodgson called on five local advisory committees to make recommendations on how to rehabilitate declining trout populations. The changes take effect on January 1, 1996 and affect close to 200 lakes in the Bracebridge, Minden/Haliburton, Bancroft, Mazinaw and Pembroke areas. Most of the regulatory changes apply to lakes with naturally reproducing brook trout and lake trout. "Trout have been in decline in some parts of South-Central Ontario for many years," said Mr. Hodgson. "In addition to development and pollution from faulty septic systems, overharvest has played a significant role in the decline." Under the new regulations, some trout lakes will be closed for fishing during the winter and early spring, and others will be subject to slot size limits plus a one-line restriction. Slot size limits are a kind of catch-and-release fishing procedure that require anglers to release fish of reproductive size. Fish larger and smaller than the "slot" may be kept. "Ice fishing in this part of Ontario is a time-honoured pastime and an integral component of the rural Ontario winter tourism economy", said Mr. Hodgson. "We simply can't afford to lose this precious resource, so we must take steps now to ensure that it will be there for generations to come". The Ministry of Natural Resources will continue working with the local advisory committees for years to come. "I want to congratulate and thank the members of the five committees for the hard work they've done to date", said the Minister. "It has only just begun though. The process of finding local solutions to local problems must continue. "I'm calling on individual anglers and the fish and game clubs of Ontario to help in this move to rebuild fish stocks," said Mr. Hodgson. "Proper angling and live-release techniques are key to rebuilding trout populations and I am confident that anglers will play their part to preserve lake trout and brook trout." The Minister also announced new regulations to provide greater fishing opportunities in some other lakes. "In divisions 7, 15, and 29, rainbow trout and splake seasons will now be open year round," he said. The ministry is advising anglers to familiarize themselves with the new regulations before the trout season opens on January 1. Anglers should contact their local MNR office for details about specific lakes and to inquire about alternate angling opportunities in their area.

"Partnerships with the public and private sectors are an important priority for Trent as a means of strengthening our research and teaching capabilities," said Trent University President Leonard Conolly. "Given Trent's recognized expertise in environmental studies, this new partnership makes perfect sense for the university and brings tangible benefits to all three organizations," Dr. Conolly added. "This agreement provides an opportunity for Sir Sandford Fleming College to expand and enrich these relationships in ways which will better serve its students, the community and the citizens of Ontario," said Sir Sandford Fleming President Dr. Brian Desbiens. The Partnership Agreement is a statement of intent by the organizations to undertake ongoing discussion, maintain working committees, identify potential efficiencies and explore partnership opportunities in five broad categories: strategic business development, community development/social integration, training/education, sharing resources and information, and co-operative research. Initially, the agreement will be for five years, and may be renewed for another five years.

"Based on available evidence, the project may pose a risk to public health and to the environment," Mr. Hodgson said. "In addition, information brought recently to our attention raises uncertainty concerning potential impacts on the environment." A Toronto Board of Health report states that the project could cause contaminants to be released into surrounding waters. This could have adverse effects on drinking water quality, sewer outfall operations, general lakeshore water quality, and fish and other aquatic habitat. "Field data and model studies show that the effects of the disturbance of lake bed sediments by underwater dredging are largely unpredictable," Mr. Hodgson said. Under the Aggregate Resources Act, the Minister can refuse to issue an aggregate permit if he considers that the resulting operations would be contrary to public interest.

The panel will focus on a thorough review of four prescribed burns that escaped their boundaries in the Wawa and Hearst districts in August and propose measures to improve current provincial practices. Mr. Hodgson's announcement follows his recently receiving a preliminary report on the prescribed burns. "We will move to try to prevent a situation such as the Dubreuilville fire from ever happening again," Mr. Hodgson said. Bob French, a field service manager with the Office of the Fire Marshal, and Al Stewart, regional director of MNR's Central Region, co-chair the program review panel. Other members include representatives from the forest industry, the municipality of Dubreuilville, the Canadian Forest Service and a cross-section of MNR staff. Mr. Hodgson launched the initial review of the program on August 22, following the escape of the prescribed burns in northeastern Ontario that were ignited by MNR crews on August 2. The two Wawa district burns, fanned by extreme winds, turned into wildfires by August 20, forcing a week-long evacuation of some 1,000 residents of Dubreuilville. The preliminary report contains a brief summary of the ministry's prescribed burn program, a chronological account of the Wawa and Hearst prescribed burns, cost estimates, and an overview of this summer's fire and drought conditions. "I expect to receive the final report by November 30, 1995," Mr. Hodgson said. "The ban on prescribed burns that I had ordered in August remains in effect, but I am lifting the ban on slash pile burning."

MNR scientists will team up with research veterinarians and wildlife biologists from Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine for the project which begins on October 14 and runs to October 16, weather permitting. Two different baits -- one produced in Ontario, the other in the United States and both containing a U.S. approved oral rabies vaccine, will be distributed in two areas of New York State -- Niagara County, and portions of Jefferson, Lewis and St. Lawrence counties near the St. Lawrence River. The New York trials objectives are to establish a barrier of vaccinated raccoons to stop the advance of the raccoon rabies front along the St. Lawrence, and to try and stop an already existing outbreak of raccoon rabies in Niagara County, New York. The New York project will test both vaccine-baits to see if the raccoons eat the baits and also which one they prefer. The two baits, will be distributed at a rate of one per three acres. The cream- coloured Ontario-made baits have a distinctive smell and are made of beef tallow, wax, icing sugar and marshmallow essence. The American-made polymer bait consists of fish meal, a binder and fish oil and is brown in colour. Ontario stands to benefit from the New York State project because it contributes to provincial efforts to prevent the spread of raccoon rabies into Ontario. It will also provide new information on which bait, at what density, we should use if raccoon rabies does get into Ontario. Along with on-site technical advice, MNR is providing two Twin Otters, specially equipped with baiting machines and computerized flight line navigation system for the aerial drops.

LBS is committed to the use of advanced investment technology to analyze markets and manage risk. LBS is convinced computational intelligence married with sound investment and trading experience provides the most effective method to manage investment portfolios. State-of-the-art technologies developed by LBS will lead investment management into the next century. Copyright (c) 1996 by LBS Capital Management, Inc.

Computational Intelligence is one of the fastest growing areas of market research on Wall Street Today. It is computer intervention or assistance in tasks requiring human reasoning, intelligence, intuition and imagination. Using knowledge based "expert" systems , neural networks and genetic algorithms , this technology is capable of resolving problems of uncertain outcome that normally require human judgment and experience. Properly programmed, the results of such problem solving efforts are accurate within a very narrow range of tolerance or confidence. Looking at today's market place, with its thousands of inter-relationships and increasing number of variables that continue to grow exponentially, C.I. is revolutionizing the way we approach market analysis. A C.I. system can do mechanically what a team of skilled market analysts would do. What makes it better, is that it can analyze more data faster and more reliably than a human can and do it without bias or emotion. The most crucial investment decisions are made at market turning points. That is where human emotion gets in the way of judgment. The computer eliminates that problem. C.I. systems offer distinct advantages over traditional methods of analysis. They have the ability to efficiently process thousands of pieces of data and consider millions of possible combinations to discover relevant relationships that may not otherwise be apparent. Such analysis is extremely rapid, unemotional, and unaffected by personal bias. These systems are dynamic and self adapting. Unlike conventional market analysis that relies on static approaches, these new methods are able to adjust to changing market conditions and downplay or eliminate factors that are no longer relevant. The LBS System provides a dynamic, self adapting decision mechanism that is intelligently sensitive to changing market conditions. The process is disciplined, completely objective and highly risk-averse. As a leading provider of advanced technology-based investment management services worldwide, LBS is driven by client needs and a pursuit of excellence in developing solutions for those needs.

These programs employ two branches of Computational Intelligence: neural networks and genetic algorithms. The MEP program allows the individual investor to participate in the same strategies employed by some of the country’s largest institutional investors. ASSET ALLOCATION Focused Sector Opportunities An aggressively managed mutual fund program that rotates client assets among Fidelity Select Funds, using LBS technology to periodically shift assets to the three sectors (of 35) deemed to have the greatest performance potential for the intermediate term. SMAART...a first of its kind global asset allocation program This program manages risk by diversifying assets globally among 6-8 stock and bond funds selected from 10 asset classes. Each fund is pre-screened for excellence. Accounts are dynamically rebalanced and re-weighted as market conditions dictate. With the simplicity of a single account, SMAART provides clients with an investment in multiple mutual funds and a strategy designed to reduce investment risk. INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Individual Mutual Fund and Variable Annuities LBS manages investment risk for over 300 mutual funds and variable annuities covering a broad spectrum of global equity and fixed income asset classes. OMNI, LBS’ proprietary risk management model, is designed to keep accounts invested in rising markets and shift them to the safety of money markets when the systems anticipate a period of high risk. MAXIMIZER - an LBS exclusive In this program, LBS selects the funds, using technology to identify and invest accounts in three to four equity funds from a pre-screened universe of domestic or international funds. When OMNI anticipates a period of high risk, accounts are transferred to the safety of money markets; when a buy signal is registered, the universe is re-analyzed and accounts are reinvested in funds exhibiting the greatest relative strength and momentum at that time. With the convenience of a single account, this program is designed to rotate clients’ investments among top performing domestic or international funds. This strategy seeks maximum returns while controlling market risk. Global Advantage The Global Advantage program is designed to combine, in a single account, LBS’ Investment Risk Management signals with an asset allocation approach. The driving force behind the program is the inverse correlation demonstrated by U.S. and foreign equity markets. Based on our intermediate market forecasts, the program shifts assets among domestic equities, international equities, and money markets. ** Programs not available in Maine and North Dakota.

The Lipper Mid Cap Index has surged ahead 9.21% as of December 31st, with the Lipper Growth and Income Fund charging ahead 12.55%. As in 1995, the Energy, Banking, and Semiconductor sectors have led the way, benefiting from their ability to impose their pricing power on the consumer. As we moved into the fourth quarter, LBS' proprietary systems were indicating the market was poised to move 5-7% higher. Interest rates were on the decline, and the overall sentiment of the market was constructive. Ours was cautious optimism, however, as earnings season was once again upon us. The Dow broke through the 6,000 barrier for the first time on October 14th, as earnings ranged from in-line to better than expected. The overriding concern for the market remained the tenuous control over Congress held by the Republican party. This concern led to increased jockeying by portfolio managers, and the market held in a tight trading range through the election. The election results brought relief to the financial markets, as Republicans were able to maintain control of the Congress. This resulted in a drastic increase in trading activity, as well as a tremendous volatility breakout to the upside. Heavy short covering fueled the breakout, and the equity market played catch-up with the bond market. Investors were looking for liquidity, and large capitalization stocks were the recipient of heavy inflows. A gap began to develop between the S&P 500 index and the Frank Russell 2000, a broader-based index. This divergence is typical of a market which may be on the last legs of a rally. However, the market continued to exhibit upward momentum. Alan Greenspan wrecked havoc on the psyche of the market in early December, as he wondered aloud how we would know when investors were exhibiting "irrational exuberance". Perhaps when all regard to inherent market risk is discounted? Despite Mr. Greenspan's musings on the rationality of the markets, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee elected to leave interest rates unchanged. This news was digested well by the exchanges, and we continued to probe the upper resistance levels. As we head into the New Year, we remain cautiously optimistic. The market has formed a "double-top", and interest rates have begun to rise. In general, the equity markets have moved inversely to interest rates. Caution, vigilance, and a disciplined approach will be the keys to navigating a potentially volatile 1997. International Equities - LBS remained headed into the fourth quarter fully invested in both international equity categories. Many international indices were at all-time highs heading into the quarter, with several European bourses exhibiting particular strength. The Eurotop 100 index (similar to the S&P 500) advanced 20% in 1996, benefiting from slow growth and strong bond markets. The bond market was fueled by nations running budget deficit reduction programs to comply with the standards set for the pending European Monetary Union. London's FTSE 100 Index returned 22.1% in dollar terms. Asia did not fully participate in the international rally. In fact, Japan was down 16.2% in dollar terms, and has sustained several 2%+ daily losses. LBS exited the Asia Pacific category on December 19th, and as we go to press the Nikkei Index has broken down through the 19,000 support level. Utilities, Gov't Bonds, Muni Bonds, Int'l Bonds - We entered the fourth quarter fully invested in all bond categories. The yield on the 30 year long bond tumbled as traders began to discount any possibility of the Fed hiking interest rates. A slowing economy, as evidenced by the 2.1% annual increase in 3rd quarter GDP (this versus the 4.8% seen in the second quarter) and rising unemployment figures were the impetus for the declining yield. Labor costs have not increased as rapidly as in the past, which helped keep inflation moderate. Utilities, which normally presage activity in the bond market, staged a nice rally in late October. The bond market, however, was focused on the pending election. The Republicans were able to hold their majority in Congress, and the bond market celebrated, driving the yield on the long bond down to 6.46%, a thirty basis point drop from the first day of the quarter. December saw a marked increase in the volatility of the bond market. December 11th brought rumors from London of waning Japanese demand for our bonds (the Japanese are by far the biggest foreign owners of our debt securities). LBS exited all interest related categories on the heels of this news, with the exception of high yield bonds, which continue to show incredible resiliency. We move into the new year with bonds at a critical juncture. We remain on the sidelines, with a readiness to re-enter these categories should fourth quarter economic growth be softer than anticipated. Gold - LBS entered the fourth quarter as we had the third, in the safety of money markets. This market was suffering from a marked malaise, and was having trouble finding any legs. Given the deterioration earlier in the year (most of which LBS had sidestepped), our system was looking for any signs of strength. Again, the pending election seemed to affect this highly volatile and illiquid market. Just after the election, the gold market seemed to bottom. LBS re-entered the gold market on November 13th. This entry was met with a quick uptick in prices, but the market never truly found its legs. European central banks are rumored to be selling heavily, regardless of their effect on the market. The seeming lack of inflation was also contributing to the continued troubles of this market. We move into the first quarter with a sell signal pending. Int'l Maximizer - This portfolio remains invested in Europe, which has outperformed the Asia Pacific area (see above). Domestic Maximizer - These portfolios have retained their large market capitalization bias, which has served us extremely well over the past quarter. Investors have been making the flight to liquidity, and this has bolstered the valued of large cap stocks. Copyright (c) 1997 by LBS Capital Management, Inc.

Signature Guarantees are required on Powers of Attorney, Fee liquidations, and some other special forms. They are also required when sending a check anywhere other than address of record. How will my Risk Management account be billed? Risk Management fees are billed annually in advance. That means that you will receive a bill once a year for the upcoming year's fees. Your account is valued one month and one day prior to your anniversary date, and the fee is calculated based on that value. A typical billing cycle looks like this: Your anniversary date is December 1, 1996. We value your account on October 31, and mail your bill November 15. The bill is for the period December 1, 1996 through November 30, 1997.

Based upon genetic and evolutionary principles, GAs work by repeatedly modifying a population of artificial structures through the application of selection, crossover, and mutation operators. The choice of an appropriate structure for a particular problem is a major factor determining a GAs success. GAs are capable of operating upon a variety of structures, including binary strings (Goldberg, 1989), computer programs (Koza, 1992), neural networks (Whitley, Starkweather, & Bogart, 1990), and if-then rules (Bauer, 1994). GAs have traditionally been used for optimization, but with a few enhancements, can be applied to classification and prediction as well. We first examine how a traditional GA performs optimization. The goal in optimization is to find the best possible solution to a problem. In real-world problem solving, one does not usually know the best possible solution. Therefore, a more realistic objective is to find a good solution; or, given a current benchmark, to search for a better solution. A GAs fitness function measures the quality of a particular solution. The traditional GA begins with a population of n randomly generated structures, where each structure encodes a solution to the task at hand. The GA proceeds for a fixed number of generations. During each generation, the GA improves the structures in its current population by performing selection, followed by crossover, followed by mutation. After a number of generations, the GA converges, meaning that all structures in the population become identical or nearly identical. The user typically chooses the best structure of the last population as the final solution. Selection is the population improvement or "survival of the fittest" operator. Basically, it duplicates structures with higher fitnesses and deletes structures with lower fitnesses. A common selection method is to randomly choose two structures from the population and hold a tournament, advancing the fitter structure to the crossover stage. A total of n such tournaments are held to fill the input population of the crossover stage. Crossover, when combined with selection, results in good components of good structures combining to yield even better structures. Crossover forms n/2 pairs from the mutation stage. The offspring are the results of cutting and splicing the parent structures at various crossover points. The crossover stage advances a total of n elements to the mutation stage. Mutation creates new structures that are similar to current structures. With a small, prespecified probability, mutation randomly alters each component of each structure. The mutation stage advances n elements to the selection stage of the next generation, completing the cycle. Figure 1 illustrates one generation of a GA with a population of size n = 4. Structures are represented as rectangles, each containing two square components. Components may take on one of two values, represented by the colors, black and white. Assume that structures with two black components have the highest fitness, structures with two white components have the lowest fitness, and mixed structures have intermediate fitness. The selection stage holds four tournaments between randomly chosen pairs of individuals. The crossover stage then cuts and splices structures at component boundaries. Finally the mutation stage, through random choices, mutates only the leftmost component of Structure 9, yielding Structure 13. Although the initial population has no optimal structures, after the generation shown, an optimal structure emerges (Structure 14).

There are three primary components to an expert system: rules, knowledge base, and inference engine. An expert system begins by capturing human expertise in the form of IF/THEN rules. For example, the rule "IF the traffic light is red THEN step on the brake," captures one small aspect of driving expertise. Often dozens (or hundreds) of such rules are required to arrive at solutions to complicated problems. The next step in the process involves applying the rules against a set of facts to determine which rules apply. Embedded within the expert system is an inference engine which determines when and how to apply the rules. The unique order in which the rules are applied to a given set of facts allows the expert system to be dynamic. As one might expect given the features and capacity of these technologies, the number of potential good solutions to a problem can be vast. To further analyze the vast array of good solutions, LBS employs another type of Computational Intelligence known as Genetic Algorithms.

A neural net can make a decision or a prediction by drawing on an inventory of patterns previously learned, seeking the one most relevant to the current situation. What distinguishes neural nets from "classical" Artificial Intelligence paradigms, such as rule-based systems, is that they "learn" by example and modify themselves, rather than having to be programmed with specific preconceived rules. Neural nets use layers of real or "simulated" electronic neurons with various numeric weights. These weights are dynamically modifiable in the "training" phase representing the connection strengths between them to "learn" a predictive ability. A trained neural net can be described as a matrix of neurons and connection strengths that represent the "solution" to a problem. Commercially available neural net shells, as well as those still being researched, use a variety of algorithms to adjust the connection strengths between the neurons until convergence is achieved and the system is able to make correct predictions with a significant percentage of accuracy. Once the network successfully sets the weights of the connections to produce the correct output, the trained net is ready to use as a predictive or diagnostic tool.

The Institute is equipped with state of the art researchlaboratory facilities. Three separate laboratories aremaintained within the mid-town Phoenix facility as follows; The In-Vitro Fertilization Laboratory cultures eggs and embryos prior to embryo transfer. Eggs and embryos are evaluated using highlyspecialized microscopes to determine maturity levels. Humidifiedincubators are carefully monitored to assure control of temperatureand gas concentration. Highly qualified personnel can performmicromanipulation to inject sperm into the egg intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) or assist hatching of the fertilized egg (embryo). On-sitecryopreservation and storage units allow us to "bank" a couplesembryos for future use. Our embryo bank also offers donatedembryos for persons who are unable to produce their own eggs. The Andrology Laboratory's functions include semen analysis, maleand female antibody testing, hamster egg penetration test andpreparation of sperm specimens for artificial insemination and in-vitro fertilization. Cryopreservation of sperm enables us to storea patient's sperm as well as maintain a comprehensive donor pool(Arizona Sperm Bank, est. 1973) for clients unable to produce theirown sperm. The General Medical Laboratory provides a broad range of testingincluding hormonal assays which give the physician prompt andcomplete analysis needed for OB/GYN and infertility evaluation.

Why Use the Institute of Reproductive Medicine, LTD. This page is MIDI Sound Ready! Since age 14, when Dr. Tamis' father taught him ovarian transplantation, the younger Tamis has been involved with research. That research background has been a dominant characteristic of his approach to medicine, and that philosophy permeates all aspects of this institution. One can summarize our approach to medicine, especially infertility, with two statements: Build a better "mouse trap." Whether one discusses our innovative C.A.R.E. financial package, ourindividualized approach to stimulation protocols, or our various routes ofhormone administration. We constantly look for ways to improve what we do, thusstaying at the cutting edge of our field. Infertility is "a mystery." Thus our approach to treating the patient is one of being the "detective" hired tolook for the clues to your individual problem. Without searching for those clues,one will have difficulty correcting infertility. Some patient present themselves tous with very obvious problems, but for most, the cause of their infertility iscomplicated. requiring innovative management. Not all infertility treatment requires high tech procedures Long before invitro fertilization was developed for humans (did you know it wasperformed successfully in the rabbit in 1930?), Dr. T@s has had a deepinvolvement in evaluating and treating infertility problems. Today, we still believethat most problems of fertility can be treated by simply looking for the "clues" thateach patient or couple presents. Thus, careful evaluation of hormone levels, timingof ovulation in relationship to LH surge, onset of menses post LH surge, etc manytimes can be the signal for simple hormonal manipulation without the need for hightech procedures. The easiest way to achieve a pregnancy - is the best way! Integrin At the end of 1994, we began participating with Dr. Lessey at the University ofNorth Carolina evaluating failure of invitro fertilization with regards to thepresence or absence of integrin within the endometrium. The data obtained fromour involvement with Dr. Lessey's group has helped us a high success rate withfrozen embryo transfers in natural cycles in 1995.Along with the above, Dr. Tamis has been actively involved in the fight for women's reproductivehealth. Thus, the Institute's staff cares for all women - single, married, or otherwise - concerned about their reproductive status.

SPERM INJECTION FOR SEVERE MALE INFERTILITY One of the latest, and most exciting advances in treatment of infertility has been in the area of male factor problems. Low numbers, poor quality, or absence of sperm have limited the ability to help the couple where the main cause of their infertility was the husband�s sperm. In the past, these couples would have had to resort to donor sperm insemination, or adoption. Today, it is possible to help these patients with the latest technology of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injectin (ICSI). In this procedure, one sperm is injected directly into the egg allowing fertilization to occur. Thus, minute amounts of sperm can be worked with, for one only needs enough sperm to inject the eggs available, i.e., 10 sperm if one has 10 eggs available. Because of that, the Arizona Institute of Reproductive Medicine can help couples where: men have had vasectomies (tubes tied) men born without a vas (the tube from the testicle to the outside) men with failed vas reversals men with extremely low counts men with Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome It is important to understand that there are many ways to perform sperm counts. Most commercial laboratories do not spend the time needed to locate minute amounts of sperm. We have several patients that have been told that they did not have sperm, when in truth, we have located sufficient sperm to allow us to achieve pregnancies via Intracytolplasmic Sperm Injection. The technology of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) was introduced by us in Arizona in 1993. Our success rate in 1995 using ICSI shows the 57% of mature eggs captured fertilized normally, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy rate in women less than 40 of 50%. We have obtained sperm directly from the testicle by either sperm aspiration or testicular biopsy done in the office and successfully fertilized 42% of eggs injected. Our first set of twins recently delivered and celebrated Father�s Day with their dad. If you believe that a male factor fertility problem exists, call our office for further information, or come visit us and see the modern facility that is here to help you. Our goal is to help inform you of the options and help you gain a better understanding of the latest concepts of causes and treatment of infertility as a whole.

Uno de los mas recientes y mas fascinantes avances en tratamiento de infertilidad, ha sido en el area de los problemas de factores masculinos. Bajo conteo, probre calidad del esperma o ausencia de el, ha limitado la habilidad de ayudar a la pareja donde la principal causa de su infertilidad fue el esperma del esposo. En el pasado esta parejas hubieran recurrido a inseminacion con donador de esperma o a la adopcion. Hoy en dia, es posible ayudar a esos pacientes con la mas reciente tecnologia de InyeccionIntracitoplasmisca del Esperma (ICSI), en este procedimiento un esperma es directamente inyectado dentro del ovulo, permitiendo que ocurra la fertilizacion. De esta manera, con una minima cantidad de esperma puede trabajarse, solamente necesitas suficiente esperma para inyectar ovulos disponibles, como por ejemplo: 10 espermas, para 10 ovulos disponibles, debido a esto El Instituto de Arizona de Medicina Reproductiva, puede ayudar a parejas en: Hombres que han tenido Vasectomia Hombres que han nacido sin el conducto (es un tubo que va desde el testiculo hacia afuera) Hombres que han fracasado la reversion de la vasectomia Hombres con extremadamente bajo conteo de esperma Hombres con el Sindrome de Sertoli Cell Es importante entender que hay muchas maneras de hacer un conteo de esperma. Casi todos los laboratorios comerciales no toman el tiempo necesario para localizar pequenas cantidades de esperma. Tenemos varios pacientes que les han dicho que no tienen esperma, cuando en verdad hemos localizado suficiente esperma para permitirnos concebir en embarazo por medio de la Inyeccion Intracitoplasmica del esperma (ICSI). La tecnologia de (ICSI) fue introducida en Arizona por nosotros, en 1993. Nuestro exito en 1995 usando ICSI se observa que el 57% porciento de ovulos maduros capturados, fertilizaron normalmente, resultando en un porcentaje de embarazos que siguen su curso en 50% porciento, en mujeres menores de 40 anos de edad. Hemos obtenido esperma directamente del testiculo, ya sea por aspiracion del esperma o biopsia testicular hecha en la oficina, exitosamente fertlizando ovulos inyectados en un 42% porciento. Nuestro primer par de Gemelos recientemente ha nacido y celebrado el dia del Padre con su papa.

EL PORQUE This page is MIDI Sound Ready! Desde la edad de 14 anos, cuando el padre del Doctor Tamis, le enseno como tranplantar ovarios en ratones, el joven Tamis ha estado envuelto en el campo de la investigacion. Este conocimiento en la investigacion ha sido una caracteristica dominante de sus avances en la medicina, y esta filosofia abarca todos los aspectos de esta Institucion. Uno puedo resumir los puntos principales de nuestros avances in la medicina, especialmente en infertilidad, en estas cuatro declaraciones. CONSTRUIR UNA MEJOR VERSATILIDAD De esta manera algunos hablan de nuestro inovador paquete finaciero llamado C.A.R.E , nuestro interes por individualizar los protocolos de estimulacion, o nuestras variadas rutas en la administracion hormonal. Constantemente buscamos formas de llegar a ser mejores en lo que hacemos, de esta manera estamos a la vanguardia en nuestro campo. INFERTILIDAD ES UN MISTERIO Con nuestro interes de tratar a los pacientes como si fueramos unos detectives ; que han sido contratados para encontrar una pista para su individual problema. Sin esta busqueda para esas pistas, se tendria dificultad en corregir infertilidad. Algunos pacientes se presetan con problemas faciles de percibir, pero la gran mayoria de ellos, la causa de su infertilidad es complicada, requiriendo un manejo inovador. NO TODO EL TRATAMIENTO DE INFERTILIDAD REQUIERE PROCEDIMIENTOS DE ALTO TECNOLOGIA Antes de que In-Virtro Fertilizacion fuera desarrollado para humanos. Sabia usted que fue exitosamente hecho en conejos en 1930? El Dr. Tamis ha estado profundamente ligado a la evaluacion y tratamiento de problemas de infertilidad. Hoy en dia, creemos que la mayoria de los problemas pueden ser tratados solo buscando simplemente las pistas que cada paciente o pareja presenta. De esa manera, evaluacion cuidadosa de niveles de hormonas, tiempo de ovulacion en relacion con prueba positiva de la hormona luteinizante (LH), conteo de dias despues de la hormona luteinizante (LH) al periodo menstrual, muchas veces puede se una senal, para una sencilla manipulacion hormonal si ninguna necesidad de tener procedimientos de alta tecnologia. La via mas facil de concebir un emarazo - es el mejor camino! Proteina B3 o Integrin, que se encuentra alrededor del endometrio. La informacion obtenida de nuestra participacion con el grupo del Dr. Lessey, nos ha ayudado a incrementar nuestro porcentaje de exito, en Transferencia de Embrion Congelado en ciclos de forma natural en 1995. Junto con todo esto que hemos mencionado aqui arriba, el Dr. Tamis, ha estado activamente envuelto en la lucha por los derechos de la salud reproductiva de la mujer. Asi como el, el equipo del Instituto les da sus servicios a todo tipo de mujer, ya sea solteras, casadas o caulquier mujer mujer que tenga algun problema reproductivo. El objetivo es ayudar a informarle a usted de las opciones y en proporcionarleun mejor entendimiento de todo lo que significa infertilidad.

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONSANDTAX MATTERS DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS Except with respect to Ready CashInvestment Fund, Shares become entitled to receive dividends onthe next Fund Business Day after acceptance of an order and arenot entitled to receive dividends declared after the day on whichtheir redemption becomes effective. Ready Cash Investment FundShares become entitled to receive dividends on the day of theacceptance of an order and are not entitled to receive dividendsdeclared on or after the day on which their redemption becomeseffective. Dividends of net investment incomecurrently are declared and paid at least annually by each Fundin accordance with the Fund's dividend policy. For IntermediateU.S. Government Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Stable IncomeFund, dividends currently are declared and paid monthly and forReady Cash Investment Fund are declared daily and paid monthly.Each Fund's net capital gain, if any, is distributed at leastannually, typically in December. Shareholders may choose to havedividends and distributions of a Fund reinvested in shares ofthat Fund (the "Reinvestment Option"), to receive dividendsand distributions in cash (the "Cash Option") or todirect dividends and distributions to be reinvested in sharesof another fund of the Trust(the "Directed Dividend Option").Plan, IRA and KEOGH accounts are automatically assigned the ReinvestmentOption. All dividends and distributions are treated in the samemanner for Federal income tax purposes whether received in cashor reinvested in shares of a fund. Under the Reinvestment Option,all dividends and distributions of a Fund are automatically investedin additional Shares of that Fund. All dividends and distributionsare reinvested at a Fund's net asset value as of the payment dateof the dividend or distribution. Shareholders are assigned thisoption unless one of the other two options is selected. Underthe Cash Option, all dividends and distributions are paid to theshareholder in cash. Under the Directed Dividend Option, shareholdersof a Fund whose shares in a single account of that Fund total$10,000 or more may elect to have all dividends and distributionsreinvested in shares of another fund of the Trust, provided thatthose shares are eligible for sale in the shareholder's stateof residence. For further information concerning the DirectedDividend Option, shareholders should contact the Transfer Agent. TAX MATTERS Taxation of the Funds. EachFund is treated as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposesand intends to continue to qualify for each fiscal year as a regulatedinvestment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, asamended. In addition, each Fund intends to distribute all of itsnet investment income and capital gain each year. Accordingly,it is anticipated that the Funds will not be liable for Federalincome or excise taxes on their net investment income and capitalgain. International Fund-InternationalPortfolio. InternationalPortfolio is not required to pay Federal in-come taxes on itsnet investment income and capital gain, as it is treated as apartnership for Federal tax purposes. All interest, dividendsand gains and losses of International Portfolio are deemed tohave been "passed through" to International Fund inproportion to its holdings of International Portfolio, regardlessof whether such interest, dividends or gains have been distributedby International Portfolio or losses have been realized by theInternational Portfolio. Investment income received by InternationalFund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreignincome or other taxes. International Fund intends to elect, ifeligible to do so, to permit its shareholders to take a credit(or adeduction) for foreign income and other taxes paid by InternationalPortfolio. Shareholders of Inter-national Fund will be notifiedof their share of those taxes and will be required to includethat amount as income. In that event, the shareholder may be entitledto claim a credit or deduction for those taxes. SHAREHOLDER TAX MATTERS General. Dividendspaid by a Fund out of its net investment income (including anyrealized net short-term capital gain) are taxable to shareholdersas ordinary income. Distributions by a Fund of realized net long-termcapital gain, if any, are taxable to shareholders as long-termcapital gain, regardless of the length of time the shareholdermay have held shares in the Fund at the time of distribution.If Fund shares are sold at a loss after being held for 6 monthsor less, the loss will be treated as long-term capital loss tothe extent of any long-term capital gain distribution receivedon those shares. All capital gain distributionspaid by a Fund and all dividends paid by a Fund (except TotalReturn Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund) and receivedby a shareholder reduce the net asset value of the shareholder'sshares by the amount of the distribution or dividend. Furthermore,a dividend or distribution made shortly after the purchase ofshares by a shareholder, although in effect a return of capitalto that particular shareholder, would be taxable to the shareholderas described above. It is expected that a substantialportion of the dividends to shareholders of each Equity Fund,except International Fund, and a portion of each Balanced Fund'sdividends to shareholders will qualify for the dividends receiveddeduction for corporations. The amount of such dividends eligiblefor the dividends received deduction is limited to the amountof dividends from domestic corporations received during a Fund'sfiscal year. To the extent International Fund invests in the securitiesof domestic issuers, the dividends to shareholders of the Fundmay qualify for the dividends received deduction for corporations. The Funds may be required by Federallaw to withhold 31 percent of reportable payments (which may includetaxable dividends, capital gain distributions and redemption proceeds)paid to individuals and certain other non-corporate shareholders.Withholding is not required if a shareholder certifies that theshareholder's social security or tax identification number providedto the Trust is correct and that the shareholder is not subjectto backup withholding for prior under-reporting to the InternalRevenue Service. Reports containing appropriateinformation with respect to the Federal income tax status of dividendsand distributions paid during the year by the Funds will be mailedto shareholders shortly after the close of each year. Tax-Deferred Accounts. Dividendsor distributions of net long-term capital gain, if any, paid withrespect to the shares of a Fund held by a tax-deferred accountwill not be taxable to that account. Currently, distributionsfrom such accounts will be taxable to individual participantsunder applicable tax rules without regard to the character ofthe income earned by the account.

THE NORWEST ADVANTAGE FUNDS EMPLOYEES AND COMPANIES Investment Programs and Structures Each Fund has distinct investment objectives andpolicies. These investment objectives and policies are summarizedbelow and more fully described under "Investment Objectives,Policies and Risk Considerations." There are nine equity funds (the "Equity Funds"):two Equity Funds, Diversified Equity Fund and Growth Equity Fund,that invest their assets in several different equity investmentstyles according to specified percentages, and seven Equity Fundsthat invest in single styles. One of the single-style Equity Funds,International Fund, invests exclusively in the International Portfolio("International Portfolio") of Core Trust, a registeredopen-end management investment company. There are three balancedfunds (the "Balanced Funds"), which invest specifiedpercentages of their assets in accordance with the investmentstyles of Diversified Equity Fund and three to five differentfixed income investment styles.

Contrarian Stock Fund seeks capital appreciation by investingprimarily in common stocks for which the Fund's investment adviserbelieves there is significant potential for price appreciation.Investments are typically focused in undervalued and out of favorcompanies. Small Company Stock Fund seeks long-term capital appreciationby investing primarily in the common stock of small and mediumsize domestic companies that have a market capitalization wellbelow that of the average company in the Standard & Poor's500 Composite Stock Price Index. Small Company Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciationby investing primarily in the common stock of small and mediumsize domestic companies that are either growing rapidly or completinga period of significant change. This Fund currently is not opento new investors. Large Company Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciationby investing in large, high-quality domestic companies that theinvestment adviser believes have superior growth potential. International Fund seeks long-term capital appreciationby investing directly or indirectly in high-quality companiesbased outside the United States and currently pursues its investmentobjective through investment of all of its investable assets inInternational Portfolio. As International Fund invests exclusively in InternationalPortfolio, the investment experience of International Fund willcorrespond directly with the investment experience of InternationalPortfolio. See "Other Information - Core Trust Structure."International Portfolio has the same investment objective andpolicies as International Fund and selects its investments onthe basis of their potential for capital appreciation withoutregard to current income. Income Equity Fund seeks long-term capital appreciationin line with that of the overall equity securities markets andto provide above-average dividend income. Index Fund seeks to duplicate the return of the Standard& Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index.

FIXED INCOME FUNDS Intermediate U.S. Government Fund seeks income and safetyof principal by investing primarily in U.S. Government Securities.The Fund seeks to moderate Funds its volatility by using a conservativeapproach in structuring the maturities of its investment portfolio. Managed Fixed Income Fund seeks to provide consistent fixedincome returns by investing primarily in a portfolio of intermediatematurity, investment grade fixed income securities. Effective April 1, 1996, Managed Fixed Income Fund will berenamed "Diversified Bond Fund." Total Return Bond Fund seeks total return by investingin a portfolio of U.S. Government and high-quality corporate fixedincome securities. Stable Income Fund seeks to maintain safety of principaland provide low volatility total return by investing primarilyin short and intermediate maturity, investment grade fixed incomesecurities. Ready Cash Investment Fund seeks to provide high currentincome to the extent consistent with the preservation of capitaland the maintenance of liquidity. Ready Cash Investment Fund is a money market fund. Management of the Funds The investment adviser to each Fund (the "Adviser")is Norwest Investment Management, a part of Norwest Bank Minnesota,N.A. ("Norwest"). Norwest is a subsidiary of NorwestCorporation, a multi-bank holding company that was incorporatedunder the laws of Delaware in 1929. As of December 31, 1995, NorwestCorporation was the 11th largest bank holding company in the UnitedStates in terms of assets. As of that date, the Adviser managedor provided investment advice with respect to assets totalingapproximately $23 billion. Except for International Fund, theAdviser makes investment decisions for the Funds and continuouslyreviews, supervises and administers each Fund's investment program. Subject to the Adviser's general oversight, CrestoneCapital Management, Inc. ("Crestone"), a subsidiaryof Norwest, acts as investment subadviser to Small Company StockFund. Subject to the Adviser's general oversight, Schroder CapitalManagement International Inc. ("Schroder") acts as investmentsubadviser to Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund andeach Balanced Fund (Schroder, Crestone and the Adviser are sometimesreferred to collectively as the "Advisers"). Schroderalso serves as International Portfolio's investment adviser. Norwest serves as the Trust's transfer agent, dividenddisbursing agent and custodian, and provides certain administrativeservices to International Fund. The manager of the Trust and distributorof its shares is Forum Financial Services, Inc. ("Forum").Forum also serves as administrator of Core Trust. See "Managementof the Funds - Investment Advisory Services" and "Administrativeand Other Services." Purchase and Redemption of Shares Shares of beneficial interest of each Fund are offeredwithout a sales charge and may be redeemed without charge. Norwestoffers investors in the Funds various periodic investment andredemption services. The minimum initial investment in each Fundis $1,000, except that the minimum initial investment in ReadyCash Investment Fund is $100,000. See "Purchases and Redemptionsof Shares." Certain Risk Factors There can be no assurance that any Fund will achieveits investment objective or that Ready Cash Investment Fund willmaintain a stable net asset value. Except for Ready Cash InvestmentFund, each Fund's net asset value will fluctuate based upon changesin the value of the Fund's portfolio securities and, accordingly,upon redemption an investment in a Fund may be worth more or lessthan its original value. The Fixed Income Funds' net asset valueswill tend to vary inversely with movements in interest rates andthe potential for appreciation in a Fixed Income Fund in the eventof a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increasedprincipal prepayments on certain mortgage-backed securities heldby the Fund. The policy of investing in smaller companies employedby Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth Fund and theEquity Funds and Balanced Funds that invest in small company securitiesentails certain risks in addition to those normally associatedwith investments in equity securities. Similarly, Contrarian StockFund's policy of investing in securities that may be out of favorwith many institutional investors and International Fund's policyof investing directly or indirectly in foreign securities entailcertain risks in addition to those normally associated with investmentsin equity securities. By investing solely in International Portfolio, InternationalFund may achieve certain efficiencies and economies of scale.Nonetheless, this investment could also have potential adverseeffects on International Fund. Investors in International Fundshould consider these risks, as described under "Other Information- Core Trust Structure." An investment in any Fund involves certain risks,depending on the types of investments made and the types of investmenttechniques employed. All investments by the Funds entail somerisk. Certain investments and investment techniques, however,entail additional risks, such as investments in foreign issuers,issuers with limited market capitalization, mortgage- or asset-backedsecurities, zero-coupon bonds and options, futures contracts,forward contracts and swap agreements. The use of leverage bycertain Funds through borrowings, margin transactions, short sales,reverse repurchase agreements and other investment techniquesinvolves additional risks. For more details about each Fund andits investments and risks, see "Investment Objectives, Policiesand Risk Considerations" and "Appendix A: Investments,Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations." EXPENSES OF INVESTING IN THE FUNDS The purpose of the following table is to assist investorsin understanding the various expenses that an investor in theFunds will bear directly or indirectly.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND RISK CONSIDERATIONS The Funds offered through this Prospectus consistof seventeen Funds, each with distinct investment objectives andpolicies: nine Equity Funds, three Balanced Funds and five FixedIncome Funds. Most of the Funds invest their assets in singularinvestment styles that correspond to their objectives. Of theEquity Funds, two Funds - Diversified Equity Fund and Growth EquityFund - invest their assets in several different equity investmentstyles. The use of multiple equity investment styles by each ofthese Funds - through percentage allocations consistent with theFund's investment objective - is intended to reduce the risk associatedwith the use of a single style, which may move in and out of favorduring the course of a market cycle. The Balanced Funds investspecified percentages of their assets in accordance with the investmentstyles of Diversified Equity Fund and three to five differentfixed income investment styles. The Balanced Funds rebalance theirportfolios periodically and Diversified Equity Fund and GrowthEquity Fund rebalance their portfolios daily to maintain specifiedpercentages of assets invested in particular investment styles.The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a specified investmentstyle may be changed at any time by the Adviser in response tomarket or other conditions. The investment objective, policiesand risk considerations of each Fund are described below. Fora further description of each Fund's investments and investmenttechniques and additional risk considerations associated withthose investments and techniques, see "Investment Objectives,Investment Policies and Risk Considerations - Additional InvestmentPolicies," "Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategiesand Risk Considerations" and the SAI. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES Each of the Funds has its own distinct investmentobjective which may not be changed without approval of the Fund'sshareholders. There can be no assurance that any Fund will achieveits investment objective. Equity Funds Diversified Equity Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide long-term capital appreciationwhile moderating annual return volatility by diversifying itsinvestments in accordance with different equity investment styles. Growth Equity Fund's investmentobjective is to provide a high level of long-term capital appreciationwhile moderating annual return volatility by diversifying itsinvestments in accordance with different equity investment styles.Because the Fund seeks increased returns, it is subject to correspondinglygreater risks than Diversified Equity Fund. Contrarian Stock Fund'sinvestment objective is to seek capital appreciation by investingprimarily in common stocks for which the Adviser believes thereis significant potential for price appreciation. Small Company Stock Fund'sinvestment objective is long-term capital appreciation. The Fundpursues this objective by investing primarily in the common stockof small and medium-size domestic companies which have a marketcapitalization well below that of the average company in the Standard& Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Small Company Growth Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide long-term capital appreciationby investing primarily in small and medium-sized domestic companiesthat are either growing rapidly or completing a period of significantchange. International Fund's investmentobjective is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investingdirectly or indirectly in high-quality companies based outsidethe United States. International Portfolio, in which InternationalFund invests all of its assets, has the same investment objective. Large Company Growth Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide long-term capital appreciationby investing primarily in large, high-quality domestic companiesthat the investment adviser believes have superior growth potential. Income Equity Fund's investmentobjective is to provide both long-term capital appreciation inline with that of the overall equity securities markets and above-averagedividend income. Index Fund's investment objective is to duplicatethe return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock PriceIndex. Balanced Funds Conservative Balanced Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide a combination of current incomeand capital appreciation by diversifying investment of the Fund'sassets among stocks, bonds and other fixed income investments.The Fund emphasizes safety of principal through limited exposureto equity securities. The Fund has the smallest equity securitiesposition of the three Balanced Funds. Moderate Balanced Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide a combination of current incomeand capital appreciation by diversifying investment of the Fund'sassets among stocks, bonds and other fixed income investments.The Fund provides a portfolio more evenly-balanced between fixedincome and equity securities than the other Balanced Funds. Growth Balanced Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide a combination of current incomeand capital appreciation by diversifying investment of the Fund'sassets between stocks and bonds. The Fund has the largest equitysecurities position of the Balanced Funds. Fixed Income Funds Intermediate U.S. Government Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide income and safety of principalby investing primarily in U.S. Government Securities. Managed Fixed Income Fund'sinvestment objective is to provide consistent fixed income returnsby investing primarily in a portfolio of intermediate maturity,investment grade fixed income securities. Effective April 1,1996, Managed Fixed Income Fund, in pursuing its investment objective,will begin investing its assets in two investment styles in additionto the investment style currently employed and will be renamed"Diversified Bond Fund" to reflect this change. Total Return Bond Fund'sinvestment objective is to seek total return. The Fund pursuesthis objective by investing in a portfolio of U.S. Governmentand investment grade corporate fixed income investments. StableIncome Fund's investment objective is to maintain safety of principalwhile providing low-volatility total return. Ready Cash InvestmentFund's investment objective is to provide high current incometo the extent consistent with the preservation of capital andthe maintenance of liquidity. INVESTMENTS IN CORE TRUST International Fund currently seeks to achieve itsinvestment objective by investing all of its investment assetsin International Portfolio, a separate Portfolio of Core Trust.In addition, the Trust has received an exemptive order from theSEC under which Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, ConservativeBalanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund and Growth Balanced Fund(collectively the "Blended Funds") currently investthe portions of their assets that are managed in a small company,an index and an international investment style, respectively,in Small Company Portfolio, Index Portfolio, and InternationalPortfolio II (the "Blended Portfolios"). These Portfoliosare each separate portfolios of Core Trust. By pooling their assetsin the Blended Portfolios, the Blended Funds may be able to achievebenefits that they could not achieve by investing directly insecurities. See "Other Information - Core Trust Structure." The investment objectives and policies and investmentrisk considerations for International Portfolio II and Index Portfolioare identical to the investment objectives and policies and investmentrisk considerations of International Fund and Index Fund. Theinvestment objective of Small Company Portfolio is to providelong-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in smalland medium-sized domestic companies that are either growing rapidlyor completing a period of significant change. This Portfolio investsits assets in the investment styles of Small Company Stock Fundand Small Company Growth Fund and a small company "value"investment style described below; in the future, this Portfoliomay invest its assets in accordance with additional small companyinvestment styles. INVESTMENT POLICIES Equity Funds To achieve their investment objectives, the EquityFunds invest primarily in common stocks and other equity securities.International Fund currently invests exclusively in InternationalPortfolio which invests primarily in common stocks and other equitysecurities of foreign issuers. See "Other Information - CoreTrust Structure." The domestic securities in which an EquityFund invests are generally listed on a securities exchange orincluded in the National Association of Securities Dealers AutomatedQuotation (NASDAQ) National Market System but may be traded inthe over-the-counter securities market. Under normal circumstances,each of the Equity Funds will invest substantially all of itsassets, but not less than 65 percent of its total assets, in equitysecurities. Diversified Equity Fundfollows a "multi-style" approach designed to minimizethe volatility and risk of investing in equity securities. TheFund's portfolio combines five different equity investment styles,those of four of the Equity Funds - Large Company Growth Fund,International Fund, Income Equity Fund and Index Fund - and asmall company investment style (the "Small Company style")that in turn utilizes the investment styles of Small Company StockFund and Small Company Growth Fund (the "Small Company StockFund style" and the "Small Company Growth Fund style,"respectively) and a small company value investment style (the"Small Company Value style"). The Fund utilizes differentequity investment styles in order to reduce the risk of priceand return volatility associated with reliance on a single investmentstyle. Because Diversified Equity Fund blends five equity investmentstyles, it is anticipated that its price and return volatilitywill be less than that of Growth Equity Fund, which blends threeequity investment styles. The Fund generally invests the followingpercentages of its total assets in the indicated investment styles: Diversified Equity Fund Allocation Index Fund style 25% Income Equity Fund style 25% Large Company Growth Fund style 25% Small Company style 10% International Fund style 15% TOTAL FUND ASSETS 100% Investors should refer to the descriptions below of each of theforegoing Equity Funds and Small Company style for a discussionof the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investmentsand investment techniques of those styles and, accordingly, ofthe portions of Diversified Equity Fund invested in those styles.The management of the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund'ssix portfolio managers, including four who are also the portfoliomanagers for corresponding Equity Funds. Three portfolio managersjointly co-manage the assets allocated to the Small Company style.The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a particularinvestment style may be changed at any time by the Adviser inresponse to market or other conditions. Growth Equity Fund follows a "multi-style" approachdesigned to reduce the volatility and risk of investing in equitysecurities. The Fund's portfolio combines three different equityinvestment styles, those of two of the Equity Funds - Large CompanyGrowth Fund and International Fund - and a small company investmentstyle (the "Small Company style") that in turn utilizesthe investment styles of Small Company Stock Fund and Small CompanyGrowth Fund (the "Small Company Stock Fund style" andthe "Small Company Growth Fund style," respectively)and a small company value investment style (the "Small CompanyValue style"). The Fund utilizes different equity investmentstyles in order to reduce the risk of price and return volatilityassociated with reliance on a single investment style. It is anticipatedthat the Fund's price and return volatility will be somewhat greaterthan those of Diversified Equity Fund, which blends five equityinvestment styles. The Fund generally invests the following percentagesof its total assets in the indicated investment styles: Growth Equity Fund Allocation Large Company Growth Fund style 35% Small Company style 35% International Fund style 30% TOTAL FUND ASSETS 100% Investors should refer to the descriptions below of each of theforegoing Equity Funds and the Small Company style for a discussionof the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investmentsand investment techniques of those styles and, accordingly, ofthe portions of Growth Equity Fund invested using those styles.The management of the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund'sfour portfolio managers, including three who are also the portfoliomanagers for corresponding Equity Funds. Three portfolio managersjointly co-manage the assets allocated to the Small Company style.The percentage of a Fund's assets invested using a particularinvestment style may be changed at any time by the Adviser inresponse to market or other conditions. Contrarian Stock Fund invests according to the basic premiseof the Adviser's "contrarian" investment approach: thatsecurity prices change more than fundamental investment valuesbecause consensus thinking often results in severe undervaluationof securities whose immediate problems are obvious and whose longerterm prospects are, therefore, viewed too negatively. This consensuspessimism can create investment opportunity. Consistent with thisunderlying approach, the Adviser will purchase stocks whose pricesare temporarily depressed, either because they are out of favorwith, or simply ignored by, the investment community. The basis of the Adviser's contrarian investment approach is thecomparison of the value and the price of a security. The Advisergenerally analyzes a security's value in terms of recovery earningsand potential share price over a three-year investment time horizon.Typically, stocks that the Adviser considers for purchase willtend to have significantly depressed prices and relatively lowprice to book value ratios. The Fund's policy of investing in securities that may be temporarilyout of favor differs from the investment approach followed bymany other mutual funds with a similar investment objective. Suchmutual funds typically do not invest in securities that have declinedsharply in price, are not widely followed, or are issued by companiesthat may have reported poor earnings or that may have suffereda cyclical downturn in business. The Adviser believes, however,that purchasing securities depressed by temporary factors mayprovide investment returns superior to those obtained when premiumprices are paid for issues currently in favor. The Fund may invest in preferred stock and securities convertibleinto common stock and may invest up to 20 percent of its totalassets in foreign securities and in American Depository Receiptsand other similar securities of foreign issuers. See "InvestmentPolicies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign InvestmentRisks and Considerations." In addition, the Fund may investin fixed income securities that are rated, at the time of purchase,within the three highest rating categories assigned by a nationallyrecognized statistical rating organization such as Moody's InvestorsService, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Investors Service L.P.,or which are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparablequality. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variablerates of interest. See "Additional Investment Policies -Fixed Income Securities and Their Characteristics." Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth Fund and theSmall Company style each invest primarily in the common stockof small and medium size domestic companies which have a marketcapitalization well below that of the average company in the Standard& Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Market capitalizationrefers to the total market value of a company's outstanding sharesof common stock. Small Company Stock Fund considers small andmedium companies as those whose market capitalizations are lessthan $1 billion at the time of the Fund's purchase, although itis anticipated that investments will be primarily in companieswith capitalizations of less than $750 million. Small CompanyGrowth Fund considers small and medium companies to be those withmarket capitalizations less than $750 million at the time of theFund's purchase. Under normal circumstances, Small Company Stock Fund, Small CompanyGrowth Fund and the components of the other Funds that investin the Small Company style will invest at least 65 percent oftheir total assets in common stock issued by small and mediumsize companies. In selecting securities for Small Company Stock Fund, theAdviser seeks securities with significant price appreciation potential,and attempts to identify companies that show above-average growth,as compared to long-term overall market growth. The companiesin which the Fund invests may be in a relatively early stage ofdevelopment or may produce goods and services which have favorableprospects for growth due to increasing demand or developing markets.Frequently, such companies have a small management group and singleproduct or product line expertise that, in the view of the Adviser,may result in an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit and greater focuswhich may allow the firms to be successful. The Adviser believesthat such companies may develop into significant business enterprisesand that an investment in such companies offers a greater opportunityfor capital appreciation than an investment in larger more establishedentities. Small companies frequently retain a large part of theirearnings for research, development and investment in capital assets,however, so that the prospects for immediate dividend income arelimited. Small Company Stock Fund may invest in preferred stock and securitiesconvertible into common stock and may invest up to 20 percentof its total assets in foreign securities and in American DepositoryReceipts, European Depository Receipts and other similar securitiesof foreign issuers. See "Investment Policies - Equity Funds- International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations."In addition, the Fund may invest in fixed income securities ofsmall companies that are rated, at the time of purchase, withinthe three highest rating categories assigned by a nationally recognizedstatistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors Service,Standard & Poor's and Fitch Investors Service, L.P., or whichare unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparablequality. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variablerates of interest. See "Additional Investment Policies -Fixed Income Securities and Their Characteristics." In selecting securities for Small Company Growth Fund,the Adviser seeks to identify companies that are rapidly growing(usually with relatively short operating histories) or that areemerging from a period of investor neglect by undergoing a dramaticchange. These changes may involve a sharp increase in earnings,the hiring of new management or measures taken to close the gapbetween its share price and takeover/asset value. The Fund mayinvest up to 10 percent of its total assets in foreign securitiesand in American Depository Receipts and other similar securitiesof foreign issuers. See "Investment Policies - Equity Funds- International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations."The Fund may not invest more than 10 percent of its total assetsin the securities of a single issuer. The Fund does not currentlyinvest in preferred stock and securities convertible into commonstock but reserves the right to do so in the future. In selecting securities allocated to the Small Company stylecomponent of Growth Equity Fund, Diversified Equity Fund and theBalanced Funds, the Adviser uses the Small Company Stock Fundstyle, the Small Company Growth Fund style and the Small CompanyValue style, currently allocating 1/3 of its assets to each style. Prior to December 11, 1995, the Small Company style did notallocate any assets to the Small Company Value style. The allocationof 1/3 of assets invested in the Small Company style to the SmallCompany Value style is expected to be complete by June 1, 1996.The Small Company style may in the future allocate its assetsto additional investment styles. In selecting portfolio investments, the Small Company Value stylefocuses on securities that are conservatively valued in the marketplacerelative to their underlying fundamentals. Value investing providesinvestors with a less aggressive way to take advantage of growthopportunities of small companies. In investing in accordance withthis style, the Adviser will seek to invest in stocks priced lowrelative to the stock of comparable companies, determined by price/earningsratios, cash flows or other measures. Value investing thereforemay reduce downside risk while offering potential for capitalappreciation as a stock gains favor among other investors andits stock price rises. Small Company Investment Risks and Considerations. Thecompanies in which Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company GrowthFund and the Small Company style components of the other Fundsinvest may be in a relatively early stage of development or mayproduce goods and services which have favorable prospects forgrowth due to increasing demand or developing markets. Frequently,such companies have a small management group and single productor product line expertise. These characteristics may result inan enhanced entrepreneurial spirit and greater focus which maymake those companies successful. The Adviser believes that suchcompanies may develop into significant business enterprises andthat an investment in such companies offers a greater opportunityfor capital appreciation than an investment in larger more establishedentities. Small companies frequently retain a large part of theirearnings for research, development and investment in capital assets,however, so that the prospects for immediate dividend income arelimited. Investments in smaller companies generally involve greater risksthan investments in larger companies due to the small size ofthe issuer and the fact that the issuer may have limited productlines, access to financial markets and management depth. In addition,many of the securities of smaller companies trade less frequentlyand in lower volumes than securities issued by larger firms. Theresult is that the short-term price volatility of small companysecurities is greater than the short-term price volatility ofthe securities of larger, more established companies that arewidely held. The securities of small companies may also be moresensitive to market changes generally than the securities of largecompanies. In addition, securities that are traded in the over-the-countermarket or on a regional securities exchange may not be tradedevery day or in the volume typical of securities traded on a nationalsecurities exchange. As a result, disposition of a portfolio security,to meet redemptions by shareholders or otherwise, may requirea Fund to sell the security at a discount from market prices,to sell during periods when disposition is not desirable, or tomake many small sales over an extended period. While securities issued by smaller companies historically haveexperienced greater market appreciation than the securities oflarger entities, there is no assurance that they will continueto do so or that the Fund will be successful in identifying companieswhose securities will appreciate. Large Company Growth Fund invests primarily in the commonstock of large, high-quality domestic companies that have superiorgrowth potential. Large companies are those whose market capitalizationsare at least $500 million at the time of the Fund's purchase andwhose equity trading volume would permit the sale or purchaseof a large position in the securities of the company in 2 or 3trading days. Market capitalization refers to the total marketvalue of a company's outstanding shares of common stock. In selectingsecurities for the Fund, the Adviser seeks issuers whose stockis attractively valued and whose fundamental characteristics bothare significantly better than the market average and which supportinternal earnings growth capability. The Fund's holdings may includethe securities of companies whose growth potential is, in theAdviser's opinion, generally unrecognized or misperceived by themarket. In addition, the Fund may invest up to 20 percent of itstotal assets in American Depository Receipts, European DepositoryReceipts and other similar securities of large foreign issuersand may attempt to reduce the overall risk of its foreign investmentsby using foreign currency forward contracts. See "InvestmentPolicies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign InvestmentRisks and Considerations." Under normal circumstances, theFund will not invest more than 10 percent of its total assetsin the securities of a single issuer. The Fund does not currentlyinvest in preferred stock or securities convertible into commonstock but reserves the right to do so in the future. International Fund is designed for investors who desireto achieve international diversification of their investmentsby participating in foreign securities markets. Because internationalinvestments generally involve risks in addition to those risksassociated with investments in the United States, the Fund shouldbe considered only as a vehicle for international diversification. As the Fund has the same investment policies as InternationalPortfolio and currently invests all of its assets in InternationalPortfolio, the following investment policies are discussed withrespect to International Portfolio only. International Portfolionormally will invest substantially all of its assets in equitysecurities of companies domiciled outside the United States. InternationalPortfolio selects its investments on the basis of their potentialfor capital appreciation without regard to current income. ThePortfolio also may invest in the securities of closed-end investmentcompanies investing primarily in foreign securities and may investin debt obligations of foreign governments or their politicalsubdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, and debt obligationsof supranational organizations and foreign corporations. Investmentwill be diversified among securities of issuers in foreign countriesincluding, but not limited to, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom,France, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. Ingeneral, International Portfolio will invest only in securitiesof companies and governments in countries that Schroder, in itsjudgment, considers both politically and economically stable.International Portfolio has no limit on the amount of its foreignassets which may be invested in any one type of foreign instrumentor in any foreign country; however, to the extent InternationalPortfolio concentrates its assets in a foreign country, it willincur greater risks. International Portfolio may purchase preferred stock and securitiesconvertible into common stock, and may purchase American DepositoryReceipts, European Depository Receipts or other similar securitiesof foreign issuers. International Portfolio may also enter intoforeign exchange contracts, including forward contracts to purchaseor sell foreign currencies, in anticipation of its currency requirementsand to protect against possible adverse movements in foreign exchangerates. Although such contracts may reduce the risk of loss toInternational Portfolio from adverse movements in currency values,the contracts also limit possible gains from favorable movements. Foreign Investment Risks and Considerations. All investments,domestic and foreign, involve certain risks. Investments in thesecurities of foreign issuers may involve risks in addition tothose normally associated with investments in the securities ofU.S. issuers. All foreign investments are subject to risks offoreign political and economic instability, adverse movementsin foreign exchange rates, the imposition or tightening of exchangecontrols or other limitations on repatriation of foreign capital,and changes in foreign governmental attitudes towards privateinvestment, possibly leading to nationalization, increased taxationor confiscation of foreign investors' assets. Moreover, dividends payable on foreign securities may be subjectto foreign withholding taxes, thereby reducing the income availablefor distribution to International Portfolio's shareholders; commissionrates payable on foreign transactions are generally higher thanin the United States; foreign accounting, auditing and financialreporting standards differ from those in the United States and,accordingly, less information may be available about foreign companiesthan is available about issuers of comparable securities in theUnited States; and foreign securities may trade less frequentlyand with lower volume and may exhibit greater price volatilitythan U.S. securities. Changes in foreign exchange rates will also affect the value inU.S. dollars of all foreign currency-denominated securities heldby International Portfolio. Exchange rates are influenced generallyby the forces of supply and demand in the foreign currency marketsand by numerous other political and economic events occurringoutside the United States, many of which may be difficult, ifnot impossible, to predict. Income from foreign securities will be received and realized inforeign currencies, and International Portfolio is required tocompute and distribute income in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, adecline in the value of a particular foreign currency againstthe U.S. dollar will reduce the dollars available to make a distribution.Similarly, if the exchange rate declines between the time afterInternational Portfolio's income has been earned and computedin U.S. dollars and the time it is paid may require InternationalPortfolio to liquidate portfolio securities to acquire sufficientU.S. dollars to make a distribution. Similarly, if the exchangerate declines between the time International Portfolio incursexpenses in U.S. dollars and the time such expenses are paid,International Portfolio may be required to liquidate additionalforeign securities to purchase the U.S. dollars required to meetsuch expenses. Income Equity Fund invests primarily in the common stockof large, high-quality domestic companies that have above-averagereturn potential based on current market valuations. Primary emphasisis placed on investing in securities of companies with above-averagedividend income. In selecting securities for the Fund, the Adviseruses various valuation measures, including above-average dividendyields and below industry average price to earnings, price tobook and price to sales ratios. The Fund considers large companiesto be those whose market capitalizations are at least $600 millionat the time of the Fund's purchase. Market capitalization refersto the total market value of a company's outstanding shares ofcommon stock. The Fund may also invest in preferred stock andsecurities convertible into common stock and may purchase AmericanDepository Receipts, European Depository Receipts and other similarsecurities of foreign issuers. See "Investment Policies -Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign Investment Risks andConsiderations." Under normal circumstances, the Fund willnot invest more than 10 percent of its total assets in the securitiesof a single issuer. Index Fund is designed to duplicate the return of the Standard& Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index (the "Index")with minimum tracking error, while also minimizing transactioncosts. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will hold stocks representing96 percent or more of the capitalization-weighted market valuesof the Index. Portfolio transactions for the Fund generally areexecuted only to duplicate the composition of the Index, to investcash received from portfolio security dividends or shareholderinvestments in the Fund, and to raise cash to fund Share redemptions.The Fund may hold cash or cash equivalents for the purpose offacilitating payment of the Fund's expenses or Share redemptions.For these and other reasons, the Fund's performance can be expectedto approximate but not be equal to that of the Index. The Fund may utilize index futures contracts to a limited extent.Index futures contracts are bilateral agreements pursuant to whichtwo parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cashequal to a specified dollar amount times the difference betweenthe index value at the close of trading of the contract and theprice at which the futures contract is originally struck. As nophysical delivery of securities comprising the index is made,a purchaser of index futures contracts may participate in theperformance of the securities contained in the index without therequired capital commitment. Index futures contracts may be usedfor several reasons: to simulate full investment in the underlyingindex while retaining a cash balance for fund management purposes,to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. For a descriptionof futures contracts and their risks see "Appendix A: Investments,Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations - Futures Contractsand Options." The Index tracks the total return performance of 500 common stockswhich are chosen for inclusion in the Index by Standard &Poor's ("S&P") on a statistical basis. The inclusionof a stock in the Index in no way implies that S&P believesthe stock to be an attractive investment. The 500 securities,most of which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, representapproximately 70 percent of the total market value of all U.S.common stocks. Each stock in the Index is weighted by its marketvalue. Because of the market-value weighting, the 50 largest companiesin the Index currently account for approximately 45 percent ofits value. The Index emphasizes large-capitalizations and, typically,companies included in the Index are the largest and most dominantfirms in their respective industries. The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by S&P,nor does S&P make any representation or warranty, impliedor express, to the purchasers of the Fund or any member of thepublic regarding the advisability of investing in index fundsor the ability of the Index to track general stock market performance.S&P does not guarantee the accuracy and/or the completenessof the Index or any data included therein. S&P makes no warranty,express or implied, as to the results to be obtained by the Fund,owners of the Fund, any person or any entity from the use of theIndex or any data included therein. S&P makes no express or implied warranties and hereby expresslydisclaims all such warranties of merchantability or fitness fora particular purpose for use with respect to the Index or anydata included therein. Balanced Funds Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate BalancedFund and Growth Balanced Fund each investin a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities.Conservative Balanced Fund has the smallest equity securitiescomponent of the three Funds and is the most conservative BalancedFund. Growth Balanced Fund has the largest equity securities componentof the three Balanced Funds and is the most aggressive of theseFunds. The equity portion of each Balanced Fund's portfolio usesthe five different equity investment styles of Diversified EquityFund. Diversified Equity Fund combines the different equity investmentstyles of four of the Equity Funds - Large Company Growth Fund,International Fund, Income Equity Fund and Index Fund - and investmentin a small company investment style (the "Small Company style")in order to reduce the risk of relying on a single equity investmentstyle. See "Investment Policies - Equity Funds - DiversifiedEquity Fund." The blending of different equity investmentstyles is intended to reduce the price and return volatility ofthe equity portion of the Balanced Funds. The fixed income portion of each Balanced Fund'sportfolio uses from three to five different fixed income investmentstyles. Conservative Balanced Fund uses five fixed income investmentstyles - the investment styles of Managed Fixed Income Fund, TotalReturn Bond Fund and Stable Income Fund (the "Managed FixedIncome Fund style," the "Total Return Bond Fund style"and the "Stable Income Fund style," respectively), a"positive return" investment style (the "PositiveReturn style") and a short maturity investment style (the"Short Maturity style"). Moderate Balanced Fund usesfour fixed income investment styles - the Managed Fixed IncomeFund style, the Total Return Bond Fund style, the Stable IncomeFund style and the Positive Return style. Growth Balanced Funduses three fixed income investment styles - the Managed FixedIncome Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fund style and the PositiveReturn style. The blending of different fixed income investmentstyles is intended to reduce the risk associated with relyingon a single fixed income investment style. The base allocation among investment styles for eachBalanced Fund is set forth below. As market values of the Funds'assets change, the percentage of Fund assets invested in any stylemay temporarily deviate from the base allocations. In responsethereto, the Adviser will periodically effect transactions forthe Balanced Funds to reestablish their base allocations. In addition,as the securities markets change, the Adviser may attempt to enhancethe returns of any of the Balanced Funds by changing, within certainlimits, the percentage of Fund assets invested in fixed incomeand equity securities. The Adviser may, in its discretion, increaseor decrease the fixed income and equity percentages by up to 5percent for Conservative Balanced Fund, 10 percent for ModerateBalanced Fund and 15 percent for Growth Balanced Fund. For example,the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fundstyle and the Positive Return style of Growth Balanced Fund, eachof which is used currently with respect to 11 2/3 percent of thatFund's assets (a total of 35 percent), may each be increased to16 2/3 percent (a total of 50 percent) or decreased to 6 2/3 percent(a total of 20 percent) of that Fund's assets. In making thesechanges, each Balanced Fund is required to limit its redemptionsto no more than 1 percent of a Blended Portfolio's net assetsduring any period of less than thirty days. Absent unstable marketconditions, the Adviser does not anticipate making a substantialnumber of percentage changes. When the Adviser believes a changein the base allocation percentages is desirable, it will selland purchase securities to effect the change. When the Adviserbelieves that a change will be temporary (generally, 3 years orless), it may choose to effect the change by using futures contractstrategies as described below in "Temporary Allocations." Conservative Balanced Fundis designed for investors seeking to invest in fixed income securitieswith limited exposure to equity securities. The fixed income portionof the Fund's portfolio uses the Managed Fixed Income Fund style,the Total Return Bond Fund style, the Stable Income Fund style,the Positive Return style and the Short Maturity style, in orderto reduce the risk of relying on a single fixed income investmentstyle. The Fund generally invests the following percentagesof its total assets in accordance with the indicated investmentstyles (as noted under "Investment Policies - Equity Funds- Diversified Equity Fund" above, Diversified Equity Fundgenerally invests its assets using five different equity investmentstyles): Diversified Equity Fund style 25% Index Fund style 25%, Income Equity Fund style 25%, Large Company Growth Fund style 25%, Small Company style 10%, International Fund style 15% Managed Fixed Income Fund style 16 2/3% Total Return Bond Fund style 16 2/3% Positive Return style 16 2/3% Stable Income Fund style 15% Short Maturity style 10% TOTAL FUND ASSETS 100% Investors should refer to the descriptions of Diversified EquityFund (and the five investment styles used by that Fund), ManagedFixed Income Fund and Stable Income Fund for a discussion of theobjectives, policies and risks involved in the investments andinvestment techniques of those Funds which relate to the portionsof Conservative Balanced Fund that are invested using similarinvestment styles. The investment policies related to the TotalReturn Bond Fund style, the Positive Return style and the ShortMaturity style are listed below. The management of the Fund'sassets is divided among the Fund's twelve portfolio managers -the portfolio managers of Diversified Equity Fund, Managed FixedIncome Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Stable Income Fund andthe portfolio managers who manage assets allocated to the PositiveReturn style and the Short Maturity style. The percentage of aFund's assets invested using a particular investment style maybe changed at any time by the Adviser in response to market orother conditions. Moderate Balanced Fund is designed for investors seekingroughly equivalent exposures to fixed income securities and equitysecurities. The fixed income portion of the Fund's portfolio usesthe Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Total Return Bond Fundstyle, the Stable Income Fund style and the Positive Return stylein order to reduce the risk of relying on a single fixed incomeinvestment style. The Fund generally invests the following percentagesof its total assets in accordance with the indicated investmentstyles (as noted under "Investment Policies - Equity Funds- Diversified Equity Fund" above, Diversified Equity Fundgenerally invests its assets using five different equity investmentstyles): Diversified Equity Fund style 40% Index Fund style 25%, Income Equity Fund style 25%, Large Company Growth Fund style 25%,Small Company style 10%, International Fund style 15% Managed Fixed Income Fund style 15% Total Return Bond Fund style 15% Positive Return style 15% Stable Income Fund style 15% TOTAL FUND ASSETS 100% Investors should refer to the descriptions of Diversified EquityFund (and the five investment styles used by that Fund), ManagedFixed Income Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Stable Income Fundfor a discussion of the objectives, policies and risks involvedin the investments and investment techniques of those Funds and,accordingly, of the portions of Moderate Balanced Fund that areinvested using their investment styles. The investment policiesrelated to the Positive Return style are listed below. The managementof the Fund's assets is divided among the Fund's ten portfoliomanagers - the portfolio managers of Diversified Equity Fund,Managed Fixed Income Fund, Total Return Bond Fund, Stable IncomeFund and the portfolio manager who manages assets allocated tothe Positive Return style. The percentage of a Fund's assets investedusing a particular investment style may be changed at any timeby the Adviser in response to market or other conditions. Growth Balanced Fund is designed for investors seekinglong-term capital appreciation in the equity securities marketin a balanced fund. The fixed income portion of the Fund's portfoliouses the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Total Return BondFund style and the Positive Return style in order to reduce therisk of relying on a single fixed income investment style. The Fund generally invests the following percentages of its totalassets in accordance with the indicated investment styles (asnoted under "Investment Policies - Equity Funds - DiversifiedEquity Fund" above, Diversified Equity Fund generally investsits assets using five different equity investment styles): Diversified Equity Fund style 65% Index Fund style 25%, Income Equity Fund style 25%, Large Company Growth Fund style 25%,Small Company style 10%, International Fund style 15% Managed Fixed Income Fund style 11 2/3% Total Return Bond Fund style 11 2/3% Positive Return style 11 2/3% TOTAL FUND ASSETS 100% Investors should refer to the descriptions of Diversified EquityFund (and the five investment styles used by that Fund), ManagedFixed Income Fund and Total Return Bond Fund for a discussionof the objectives, policies and risks involved in the investmentsand investment techniques of those Funds which relate to the portionsof Growth Balanced Fund that are invested using their investmentstyles. The investment policies related to the Positive Returnstyle are listed below. Management of the Fund's assets is dividedamong the Fund's nine portfolio managers - the portfolio managersof Diversified Equity Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund and TotalReturn Bond Fund and the portfolio managers who manage assetsallocated to the Positive Return style. The percentage of a Fund'sassets invested using a particular investment style may be changedat any time by the Adviser in response to market or other conditions. The Positive Return style seeks positive total return eachcalendar year regardless of the bond market by investing in aportfolio of U.S. Government and corporate fixed income investments.The Adviser's investment with respect to assets invested in thisinvestment style are divided into two components, short bondswith maturities of 2 years or less and long bonds with maturitiesof 25 years or more. Shifts between short bonds and long bondsare made based on movement in the prices of bonds rather thanon the Adviser's forecast of interest rates. During periods offalling prices (generally, increasing interest rate environments)long bonds are sold to protect capital and limit losses. Conversely,when bond prices rise, long bonds are purchased. Accordingly,the average maturity of the portfolio of securities invested inthe Positive Return style will vary. It is anticipated that undernormal circumstances the portfolio of securities invested in thisinvestment style will have an average dollar-weighted maturityof between 1 and 30 years. Under normal circumstances, at least 50 percent of the net assetsallocated to this style will be U.S. Government Securities, includingTreasury securities. All securities allocated to this style willbe, at the time of purchase, (i) rated in one of the two highestlong-term rating categories assigned by a nationally recognizedstatistical rating organization such as Moody's Investors Service,Standard & Poor's and Fitch Investors Service, L.P. or (ii)unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality.No more than 25 percent may be in the second highest rating category.Investments may include zero-coupon securities, securities withvariable or floating rates of interest and asset-backed securities,but only 25 percent of the net assets allocated to this investmentstyle, in the aggregate, may be invested in these securities.The Positive Return style may not invest in convertible securities,mortgage pass-through securities or private placement securities.Within these constraints, the Adviser purchases securities thatit believes have above-average yields. The Short Maturity style seeks to provide a higher total returnthan is generally available from money market funds. The assetsallocated to the Short Maturity style will be invested in a portfolioof high-quality fixed and variable rate fixed income securities.This investment style is managed to increase income and preserveor enhance total return by actively managing average portfoliomaturity in light of market conditions and trends. Investmentsmay include a broad spectrum of short-term instruments of UnitedStates and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securities,and the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,foreign governments, municipal governments, supranational organizationsand others. Investments are limited to instruments with a remainingmaturity of 5 years or less. With respect to assets allocatedto this style, the Fund will maintain a dollar-weighted averageportfolio maturity of 1 year or less and, under normal circumstances,will maintain 50 percent of the assets in instruments with a maturityof under 1 year. Up to 25 percent of the assets may be non-U.S.dollar denominated and, with respect to those assets, the Adviserwill attempt to hedge currency fluctuation risk. Investments mayinclude mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities,limited to not more than 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively,of the assets allocated to this investment style. The Fund mayenter into "dollar roll" transactions related to theseinvestments and may purchase stripped mortgage-backed securities.The Fund may invest up to 10 percent of its assets allocated tothe style in guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurancecompanies. The securities allocated to the style may have variableor floating rates of interest or principal and may include participationinterests and Municipal Securities. Municipal Securities includeobligations of the states, territories or possessions of the UnitedStates and their subdivisions, authorities and corporations. All securities allocated to the Short Maturity style will be,at the time of purchase, (i) rated in one of the two highest short-termrating categories by two Nationally Recognized Statistical RatingOrganizations ("NRSROs") (or, if only one NRSRO hasissued a rating, by that NRSRO), (ii) rated in one of the threehighest long-term rating categories by two NRSROs (or, if onlyone NRSRO has issued a rating, by that NRSRO), or (iii) unratedand determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. Ofthe securities allocated to this style, no more than 5 percentmay be in any of the lowest permissible rating categories. In order to manage its exposure to different types of investments,when investing in this style the Adviser may enter into interestrate, currency and mortgage swap agreements and may purchase andsell interest rate caps, floors and collars. With respect to assetsinvested in this style, the Adviser may also engage in certainstrategies involving options (both exchange-traded and over-the-counter)to attempt to enhance the return on assets invested in this styleand may attempt to reduce the overall risk of those assets orlimit the uncertainty in the level of future foreign exchangerates (hedge) by using options and futures contracts and foreigncurrency forward contracts. The Adviser's ability to use thesestrategies with respect to this style may be limited by marketconsiderations, regulatory limits and tax considerations. In investingin accordance with this style, the Adviser may write covered calland put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interestrate and foreign currency futures contracts and buy options andwrite covered options on those futures contracts. An option iscovered if, so long as the respective Fund is obligated underthe option, it owns an offsetting position in the underlying securityor futures contract or maintains a segregated account of liquid,high-grade debt instruments with a value at all times sufficientto cover the Fund's obligations under the option. Temporary Allocations. In its discretion, the Adviser mayincrease or decrease the percentage of assets of each BalancedFund that are invested in fixed income and equity securities.When the Adviser believes that a percentage reallocation willbe of short duration (generally, up to 3 years), the Adviser maydetermine to achieve the economic equivalent of a reallocationwithout incurring securities transaction costs by using futurescontracts rather than selling and purchasing securities. Underthis strategy, to the extent of the percentage asset allocationchange, the Fund would not be invested in nor subject to the risksrelated to the types of individual securities purchased in accordancewith the various investment styles used by the Fund. Rather, theFund would be invested in and subject to the risks related tofutures contracts. For a description of futures contracts andtheir risks, see "Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategiesand Risk Considerations - Futures Contracts and Options." Fixed Income Funds The five Fixed Income Funds invest primarily in fixedincome securities pursuant to the investment policies describedbelow. For a general description of fixed income securities, see"Additional Investment Policies - Fixed Income Securitiesand Their Characteristics" below. Each Fixed Income Fundexcept Intermediate U.S. Government Fund may invest in foreignissuers. These investments may involve certain risks. See "InvestmentPolicies - Equity Funds - International Fund - Foreign InvestmentRisks and Considerations." Intermediate U.S. Government Fundseeks to attain its investment objective by investing primarilyin fixed and variable rate U.S. Government Securities. Under normalcircumstances, the Fund intends to invest at least 65 percentof its assets in U.S. Government Securities and may invest upto 35 percent of its assets in fixed income securities that arenot U.S. Government Securities. The Fund emphasizes the use ofintermediate maturity securities to lessen interest rate risk,while employing low risk yield enhancement techniques to add tothe Fund's return over a complete economic or interest rate cycle,such as adjustable rate securities and swap agreements. The securities in which the Fund invests will includemortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, although theFund will limit these investments to not more than 50 percentand 25 percent, respectively, of its total assets. As part ofits mortgage-backed securities investments, the Fund may enterinto "dollar roll" transactions. Certain fixed incomesecurities are "zero-coupon" securities and the Fundwill limit its investment in these securities, except those issuedthrough the U.S. Treasury's STRIPS program, to not more than 10percent of the Fund's total assets. The Fund may also invest insecurities that are restricted as to disposition under the Federalsecurities laws (sometimes referred to as "private placements"or "restricted securities"). In addition, the Fund maynot invest more than 25 percent of its total assets in securitiesissued or guaranteed by any single agency or instrumentality ofthe U.S. Government, except the U.S. Treasury. The Fund may makeshort sales and may purchase securities on margin (borrow moneyin order to purchase securities), which are considered speculativeinvestment techniques. See "Appendix A: Investments, InvestmentStrategies and Risk Considerations - Short Sales" and "-Purchasing Securities on Margin." The Fund will only purchase securities that are rated,at the time of purchase, within the two highest rating categoriesassigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization,such as Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's or FitchInvestors Services, L.P., or which are unrated and determinedby the Adviser to be of comparable quality. See "AdditionalInvestment Policies - Rating Matters" below. The Fund primarily will invest in debt obligationswith maturities (or average life in the case of mortgage-backedand similar securities) ranging from short-term (including overnight)to 12 years. Under normal circumstances, the Fund's portfolioof securities will have an average dollar-weighted maturity ofbetween 3 and 7 years. Under normal circumstances, the Fund'sportfolio of securities will have a duration of between 75 percentand 125 percent of the duration of the Lehman Intermediate GovernmentBond Index, which is used as the Fund's benchmark index as describedunder "Other Information - Fund Performance." Durationis a measure of a debt security's average life that reflects thepresent value of the security's cash flow and, accordingly, isa measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes ("durationrisk"). Because earlier payments on a debt security havea higher present value, duration of a security, except a zero-couponsecurity, will be less than the security's stated maturity. In order to manage its exposure to different typesof investments, the Fund may enter into interest rate and mortgageswap agreements and may purchase and sell interest rate caps,floors and collars. The Fund may also engage in certain strategiesinvolving options (both exchange-traded and over-the-counter)to attempt to enhance the Fund's return and may attempt to reducethe overall risk of its investments ("hedge") by usingoptions and futures contracts. The Fund's ability to use thesestrategies may be limited by market considerations, regulatorylimits and tax considerations. The Fund may write covered calland put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interestrate futures contracts, and buy options and write covered optionson those futures contracts. An option is covered if, so long asthe Fund is obligated under the option, it owns an offsettingposition in the underlying security or futures contract or maintainsa segregated account of liquid, high-grade debt instruments witha value at all times sufficient to cover the Fund's obligationsunder the option. It is anticipated that, effective May 17, 1996,the Fund will change its name to "Intermediate GovernmentIncome Fund." Managed Fixed Income Fundseeks to attain its investment objective by investing primarilyin investment grade intermediate term obligations. The Fund investsin a diversified portfolio of fixed and variable rate U.S. dollardenominated fixed income securities of a broad spectrum of UnitedStates and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securitiesand the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,and others. The Fund emphasizes the use of intermediate maturitysecurities to lessen duration risk (as described below), whileemploying low risk yield enhancement techniques to add to theFund's return over a complete economic or interest rate cycle.Intermediate term obligations comprise securities with maturitiesof between 2 and 20 years. The securities in which the Fund invests includemortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities,although the Fund limits these investments to not more than 50percent and 25 percent, respectively, of its total assets. Aspart of its asset-backed securities investments, the Fund mayenter into "dollar roll" transactions and may purchasestripped mortgage-backed securities. The Fund may invest any amountof its assets in U.S. Government Securities, or in the securitiesof financial institutions, corporations, and others. The Fund may invest in securities that are restrictedas to disposition under the Federal securities laws (sometimesreferred to as "private placement" or "restrictedsecurities"). In addition, the Fund may not invest more than30 percent of its total assets in the securities issued or guaranteedby any single agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government,except the U.S. Treasury. The Fund may invest up to 10 percentof its total assets in participations purchased from financialinstitutions in loans or securities in which the Fund may investdirectly. The Fund may also invest up to 10 percent of its totalassets in each of (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by thegovernments of countries which the Adviser believes do not presentundue risk or by those countries' political subdivisions, agenciesor instrumentalities, (ii) obligations of supranational organizationsand (iii) obligations of the states, territories or possessionsof the United States and their subdivisions, authorities and corporations("municipal securities"). The Fund only purchases securities that are rated,at the time of purchase, within the four highest long-term ortwo highest short-term rating categories assigned by a nationallyrecognized statistical rating organization, such as Moody's InvestorsService, Standard & Poor's or Fitch Investors Service, L.P.,or which are unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparablequality. See "Additional Investment Policies - Rating Matters"below. The Fund invests in debt obligations with maturities(or average life in the case of mortgage-backed and similar securities)ranging from short-term (including overnight) to 30 years. Undernormal circumstances, the Fund's portfolio of securities willhave an average dollar-weighted portfolio maturity of between3 and 12 years and a duration of between 2 and 6 years. Durationis a measure of a debt security's average life that reflects thepresent value of the security's cash flow and, accordingly, isa measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes ("durationrisk"). Because earlier payments on a debt security havea higher present value, duration of a security, except a zero-couponsecurity, is less than the security's stated maturity. In order to manage its exposure to different typesof investments, the Fund may enter into interest rate and mortgageswap agreements and may purchase and sell interest rate caps,floors and collars. The Fund may also engage in certain strategiesinvolving options (both exchange-traded and over-the-counter)to attempt to enhance the Fund's return and may attempt to reducethe overall risk of its investments ("hedge") by usingoptions and futures contracts. The Fund's ability to use thesestrategies may be limited by market considerations, regulatorylimits and tax considerations. The Fund may write covered calland put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interestrate futures contracts and buy options and write covered optionson those futures contracts. An option is covered if, so long asthe Fund is obligated under the option, it owns an offsettingposition in the underlying security or futures contract or maintainsa segregated account of liquid, high-grade debt instruments witha value at all times sufficient to cover the Fund's obligationsunder the option. Effective April 1, 1996 the Fund will employ twoinvestment styles - the Total Return style and the Positive Returnstyle - in addition to the investment style currently employedby the Fund (the "Managed Fixed Income Fund style")to the extent consistent with the Fund's investment objectiveand policies. In addition, to more appropriately reflect the utilizationof three distinct investment styles in pursuit of the Fund's investmentobjective, effective April 1, 1996 the Fund will be renamed "DiversifiedBond Fund." Under the Fund's new "multi-style"approach, the Fund generally will invest the following percentagesof its total assets in accordance with the indicated investmentstyles: Managed Fixed Income Fund style 33 1/3% Total Return style 33 1/3% Positive Return style 33 1/3% TOTAL FUND ASSETS 100% Each of the two new investment styles, based on disparate investmentcriteria, tends to invest in debt obligations with either shorteror longer maturities than the Fund's current investment style.Reliance on multiple investment styles is intended to reduce theprice and return volatility of the Fund and provide more consistentfixed income returns. For a description of each of the Total ReturnBond style and the Positive Return style, see "InvestmentPolicies - Balanced Funds." Total Return Bond Fund invests primarily in U.S. GovernmentSecurities, including mortgage-backed securities, and investmentgrade corporate fixed income securities. The Adviser's investmentdecisions are based on its analysis of major changes in the directionof interest rates rather than on attempts by the Adviser to predictshort-term interest rate fluctuations. The Adviser also appliesa contrarian perspective by looking for undervalued segments ofthe fixed income market which the Adviser believes offer opportunitiesfor increased returns. In making its investment decisions for the Fund, the Adviser focuseson the maturity structure and quality structure of the Fund'sportfolio. When the Adviser's outlook is for rising interest ratesand falling bond values, the majority of the Fund's portfoliowill be invested in securities with short-term maturities in aneffort to ride interest rates up while minimizing the negativeeffect of falling bond prices. When the Adviser anticipates interestrates to fall and bond prices to increase, the Fund generallywill be invested in securities with long-term maturities in anattempt to lock in high interest rates and capitalize on bondprice appreciation. Accordingly, the average maturity of the Fund'sportfolio will vary from 1 to 30 years. The Fund may invest an unlimited amount of its assets in eithercorporate securities, including corporate bonds, debentures andnotes, or U.S. Government Securities. The Fund will be investedto a greater degree in corporate securities, however, as the spreadbetween corporate and U.S. Government Securities offers potentialfor incremental returns. The Fund limits its investments in variableor floating rate securities to 5 percent of its net assets. TheFund does not currently invest in mortgage-backed securities orenter "dollar roll" transactions, but reserves the rightto do so in the future. The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and securities convertibleinto common stock, but may not own the common stock into whicha convertible security converts. The Fund will only purchase securities(including convertible securities) that are rated, at the timeof purchase, within the four highest long-term or two highestshort-term rating categories assigned by a nationally-recognizedstatistical rating organization, such as Moody's Investors Service,Standard & Poor's and Fitch Investors Services, L.P., or whichare unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparablequality. Stable Income Fund seeks to maintain safety of principalwhile providing low volatility total return by investing primarilyin investment grade short-term obligations. The Fund invests ina diversified portfolio of fixed and variable rate U.S. dollardenominated fixed income securities of a broad spectrum of UnitedStates and foreign issuers, including U.S. Government Securitiesand the debt securities of financial institutions, corporations,and others. The securities in which the Fund invests include mortgage-backedand other asset-backed securities, although the Fund limits theseinvestments to not more than 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively,of its total assets. In addition, the Fund limits its holdingsof mortgage-backed securities that are not U.S. Government Securitiesto 25 percent of its total assets. The Fund may invest any amountof its assets in U.S. Government Securities, but under normalcircumstances less than 50 percent of the Fund's total assetsare so invested. The Fund may invest in securities that are restrictedas to disposition under the Federal securities laws (sometimesreferred to as "private placements" or "restrictedsecurities"). In addition, the Fund may not invest more than25 percent of its total assets in the securities issued or guaranteedby any single agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government,except the U.S. Treasury, and may not invest more than 10 percentof its total assets in the securities of any other issuer. The Fund only purchases those securities that are rated, at thetime of purchase, within the three highest long-term or two highestshort-term rating categories assigned by a nationally recognizedstatistical rating organization, such as Moody's Investors Service,Standard & Poor's or Fitch Investors Services, L.P., or whichare unrated and determined by the Adviser to be of comparablequality. See "Additional Investment Policies - Rating Matters"below. The Fund invests in debt obligations with maturities (or averagelife in the case of mortgage-backed and similar securities) rangingfrom short-term (including overnight) to 12 years and seeks tomaintain an average dollar-weighted portfolio maturity of between2 and 5 years. In order to manage its exposure to different types of investments,the Fund may enter into interest rate and mortgage swap agreementsand may purchase and sell interest rate caps, floors and collars.The Fund may also engage in certain strategies involving options(both exchange-traded and over-the-counter) to attempt to enhancethe Fund's income and may attempt to reduce the overall risk ofits investments or limit the uncertainty in the level of futureforeign exchange rates (hedge) by using options and futures contractsand foreign currency forward contracts. The Fund's ability touse these strategies may be limited by market considerations,regulatory limits and tax considerations. The Fund may write coveredcall and put options, buy put and call options, buy and sell interestrate and foreign currency futures contracts and buy options andwrite covered options on those futures contracts. An option iscovered if, so long as the Fund is obligated under the option,it owns an offsetting position in the underlying security or futurescontract or maintains a segregated account of liquid, high-gradedebt instruments with a value at all times sufficient to coverthe Fund's obligations under the option. Ready Cash Investment Fund invests in a broad spectrumof high-quality, short-term money market instruments of UnitedStates and foreign issuers that are determined by the Adviser,pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board, to be eligible forpurchase and to present minimal credit risks. These instrumentsmay be U.S. Government Securities or the securities of financialinstitutions, corporations, foreign governments, municipal governments,supranational organizations and others. The Fund may invest onlyin U.S. dollar-denominated instruments that have a remaining maturityof 397 days or less (as calculated pursuant to Rule 2a-7 underthe Investment Company Act of 1940) and will maintain a dollar-weightedaverage portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. The Fund may purchasesecurities with ultimate maturities of greater than 397 days onlyin accordance with Rule 2a-7. Under that Rule, only those long-terminstruments that have demand features which comply with certainrequirements and certain variable rate U.S. Government Securitiesmay be purchased. The Fund normally will invest more than 25% of its total assetsin the obligations of domestic and foreign financial institutions,their holding companies, and their subsidiaries. This concentrationmay result in increased exposure to risks pertaining to the bankingindustry. These risks include a sustained increase in interestrates, which can adversely affect the availability and cost ofa bank's lending activities; exposure to credit losses duringtimes of economic decline; concentration of loan portfolios incertain industries; regulatory developments; and competition amongfinancial institutions. The Fund may not invest more than 25%of its total assets in any other single industry. The securities in which the Fund invests will include mortgage-relatedsecurities, asset-backed securities and participation interestsand may have variable or floating rates of interest or principal.Except to the limited extent permitted by Rule 2a-7 and exceptfor U.S. Government Securities, the Fund will not invest morethan 5 percent of its total assets in the securities of any oneissuer. Also, the Fund may not purchase a security if the valueof all securities held by the Fund and issued or guaranteed bythe same issuer (including letters of credit in support of a security)would exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. In addition, to ensureadequate liquidity, the Fund may not invest more than 10 percentof its net assets in illiquid securities. Under the supervisionof the Board, the Adviser determines and monitors the liquidityof portfolio securities. High-quality instruments include those that (i) are rated (or,if unrated, are issued by an issuer with comparable outstandingshort-term debt that is rated) in one of the two highest ratingcategories by two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations("NRSROs") or, if only one NRSRO has issued a rating,by that NRSRO or (ii) are otherwise unrated and determined bythe Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund will investat least 95 percent of its total assets in securities in the highestrating category (as determined pursuant to Rule 2a-7). ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT POLICIES All investment policies of a Fund that are designatedas fundamental, and each Fund's investment objective, may notbe changed without approval of the holders of a majority of theFund's outstanding voting securities. A majority of a Fund's outstandingvoting securities means the lesser of 67 percent of the sharesof the Fund present or represented at a shareholders' meetingat which the holders of more than 50 percent of the shares arepresent or represented, or more than 50 percent of the outstandingshares of the Fund. Except as otherwise indicated, investmentpolicies of the Funds are not fundamental and may be changed bythe Board without shareholder approval. Investment Limitations.The Funds have adopted the investment limitations listed below,each of which is a nonfundamental policy except as noted. Thesepolicies relate to each Fund and, unless otherwise noted, notto a portion of a Fund invested in a particular investment style.Other investment limitations, including additional provisionswith respect to the limitations listed below, are described inthe SAI. Diversification. EachFund is a "diversified" portfolio as defined in theInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").As a fundamental policy, with respect to 75 percent of its assets,no Fund may purchase a security (other than a U.S. GovernmentSecurity) if, as a result, (i) more than 5 percent of the Fund'stotal assets would be invested in the securities of a single issueror (ii) the Fund would own more than 10 percent of the outstandingvoting securities of any single issuer. International Fund mayinvest up to 100 percent of its investment assets in the InternationalPortfolio and each other Fund (except Ready Cash Investment Fund)reserves the right to invest all or a portion of its assets inanother diversified, open-end investment company with substantiallythe same investment objective and policies as the Fund. Concentration. Exceptas noted below, each of the Funds is prohibited from concentratingits assets in the securities of issuers in any industry. As afundamental policy, no Fund may purchase securities if, immediatelyafter the purchase, more than 25 percent of the value of the Fund'stotal assets would be invested in the securities of issuers conductingtheir principal business activities in the same industry. Thislimit does not apply to investments in U.S. Government Securities,foreign government securities, repurchase agreements coveringU.S. Government Securities or investment company securities. Itis currently anticipated that the Funds will not concentrate insecurities issued by any single foreign government. Under normalcircumstances, Ready Cash Investment Fund will invest more than25 percent of its total assets in the obligations of domesticand foreign financial institutions and their holding companies.This concentration may result in increased exposure to risks pertainingto the financial institution industry. These risks include a sustainedincrease in interest rates, which can adversely affect the availabilityand cost of a bank's lending activities; exposure to credit lossesduring times of economic decline; concentration of loan portfoliosin certain industries; regulatory developments; and competitionamong financial institutions. Illiquid Securities. Eachof the Funds limits its purchase of illiquid securities. No Fundmay knowingly acquire securities or invest in repurchase agreementswith respect to any securities if, as a result, more than 15 percent(10 percent for Ready Cash Investment Fund) of the Fund's netassets taken at current value would be invested in securitieswhich are not readily marketable. Illiquid investments includesecurities that are illiquidby virtue of legal or contractual restrictions on the sale ofsuch securities and repurchase agreements not entitling the holderto principal within 7 days. Under the supervision of the Board,the Advisers determine and monitor the liquidity of portfoliosecurities. Borrowing and Lending. Asa fundamental policy, each Fund may borrow money for temporaryor emergency purposes, including the meeting of redemption requests,but not in excess of 33 1/3 percent of the value of the Fund'stotal assets as computed immediately after the borrowing. Borrowingfor other than temporary or emergency purposes or meeting redemptionrequests is limited to 5 percent of the value of each Fund's totalassets except in the case of Intermediate U.S. Government Fund,Man-aged Fixed Income Fund and, with respect to their assets investedin the Managed Fixed Income Fund style, the Balanced Funds. Whena Fund establishes a segregated account to limit the amount ofleveraging of the Fund with respect to certain investment techniques,the Fund does not treat those techniques as involving borrowings(although they may have characteristics and risks similar to borrowingsand result in the Fund's assets being leveraged). See "AppendixA: Investments, Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations- Borrowing" and "Techniques Involving Leverage."As a fundamental policy, no Fund may make loans except for loansof portfolio securities, through the use of repurchase agreements,and through the purchase of debt securities that are otherwisepermitted in-vestments for the Fund. Margin and Short Sales. Exceptfor Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, no Fund may purchase securitieson margin or make short sales of securities, except short salesagainst the box. These prohibitions do not restrict the Funds'ability to use short-term credits necessary for the clearanceof port-folio transactions and to make margin deposits in connectionwith permitted transactions in options and futures contracts. Temporary Defensive Position.When business or financialconditions warrant, each Fund may assume a temporary defensiveposition and invest all or any portion of their assets in cashor in cash equivalents, including (i) short-term U.S. GovernmentSecurities, (ii) prime quality short-term instruments of commercialbanks, (iii) prime quality commercial paper, (iv) repurchase agreementswith banks and broker-dealers covering any of the securities inwhich the Fund may invest directly and (v) shares of money marketmutual funds. During periods when and to the extent that a Fundhas assumed a temporary defensive position, it may not be pursuingits investment objective. The Funds may from time to time maintaininvestments in cash and cash equivalents pending investment insecurities. The International Portfolio and, with respect to theportion of their assets managed by Schroder, Diversified EquityFund, Growth Equity Fund and each Balanced Fund, may hold cashand bank instruments denominated in any major foreign currency.Prime quality refers to the two highest short-term ratings ofa nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Common Investment Techniques.Each of the Funds mayenter into repurchase agreements (for reasons other than temporarydefensive purposes) and reverse repurchase agreements, may lendtheir portfolio securities and may purchase portfolio securitieson a when-issued or forward commitment basis. It is currentlyanticipated that the Equity Funds will not enter into reverserepurchase agreements or purchase portfolio securities on a when-issuedor forward commitment basis to any significant extent. Fixed Income Securities andTheir Characteristics. Althougheach Fund only invests in investment grade fixed income securities,including money market instruments, an investment in a Fund issubject to risk even if all fixed income securities in the Fund'sportfolio are paid in full at maturity. All fixed income securities,including U.S. Government Securities, can change in value whenthere is a change in interest rates or the issuer's actual orperceived creditworthiness or ability to meet its obligations. The market value of the interest-bearingdebt securities held by the Funds will be affected by changesin interest rates. There is normally an inverse relationship betweenthe market value of securities sensitive to prevailing interestrates and actual changes in interest rates. In other words, anincrease in interest rates produces a decrease in market value.Moreover, the longer the remaining maturity of a security, thegreater will be the effect of interest rate changes on the marketvalue of that security. Changes in the ability of an issuer tomake payments of interest and principal and in the market'sperception of an issuer'screditworthiness will also affect the market value of the debtsecurities of that issuer. The possibility exists, therefore,that, the ability of any issuer to pay, when due, the principalof and interest on its debt securities may become impaired. Fixed income securities includethose issued by the governments of foreign countries or by thosecountries' political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalitiesas well as by supranational organizations such as the InternationalBank for Reconstruction and Development. To the extent otherwisepermitted, the Funds may invest in these securities if the Adviseror Schroder believes that the securities do not present risksinconsistent with a Fund's investment objective. Rating Matters. TheFixed Income Funds and, with respect to their assets investedin fixed income investment styles, the Balanced Funds will investin securities rated in the categories specified by their investmentpolicies. The Funds also may purchase unrated securities if theAdviser determines the security to be of comparable quality toa rated security that the Fund may purchase. Unrated securitiesmay not be as actively traded as rated securities. Each Fund mayretain a security whose rating has been lowered below the Fund'slowest permissible rating category (or that are unrated and determinedby the Adviser to be of comparable quality to securities whoserating has been lowered below the Fund's lowest permissible ratingcategory) if the Adviser or Schroder, as appropriate, determinesthat retaining the security is in the best interests of the Fund. The Fund's investments are subjectto "credit risk" relating to the financial conditionof the issuers of the securities that the Funds hold. To limitcredit risk, the Funds (other than Ready Cash Investment Fund)may only invest in securities that are investment grade - ratedin the top four long-term investment grades by a nationally recognizedstatistical rating organization ("NRSRO") or in thetop two short-term investment grades by an NRSRO. Accordingly,the lowest permissible long-term investment grades for corporatebonds, including convertible bonds, are Baa in the case of Moody'sInvestor Service ("Moody's") and BBB in the case ofStandard & Poor's ("S&P") and Fitch InvestorsService, L.P. ("Fitch"); the lowest permissible long-terminvestment grades for preferred stock are Baa in the case of Moody'sand BBB in the case of S&P and Fitch; and the lowest permissibleshort-term investment grades for short-term debt, including commercialpaper, are Prime-2 (P-2) in the case of Moody's, A-2 in the caseof S&P and F-2 in the case of Fitch. A further descriptionof the rating categories of certain NRSROs is contained in theSAI. All these ratings are generally considered to be investmentgrade ratings, although Moody's indicates that securities withlong-term ratings of Baa have speculative characteristics. Asa money market fund, Ready Cash Investment Fund has separate ratingrestrictions. Variable and Floating Rate Securities.The securities in whichthe Funds invest may have variable or floating rates of interestand, under certain limited circumstances, may have varying principalamounts. These securities pay interest at rates that are adjustedperiodically according to a specified formula, usually with referenceto some interest rate index or market interest rate (the "underlyingindex"). The interest paid on these securities is a functionprimarily of the underlying index upon which the interest rateadjustments are based. Such adjustments minimize changes in themarket value of the obligation and, accordingly, enhance the abilityof the Fund to maintain a stable net asset value. Similarly tofixed rate debt instruments, variable and floating rate instrumentsare subject to changes in value based on changes in market interestrates or changes in the issuer's creditworthiness. The rate ofinterest on securities purchased by a Fund may be tied to Treasuryor other government securities or indices on those securitiesas well as any other rate of interest or index. Certain variablerate securities(including mortgage-backed securities) pay interestat a rate that varies inversely to prevailing short-term interestrates (sometimes referred to as inverse floaters). For example,upon reset the interest rate payable on a security may go downwhen the underlying index has risen. During periods when short-terminterest rates are relatively low as compared to long-term interestrates, a Fund may attempt to enhance its yield by purchasing inversefloaters. Certain inverse floaters may have an interest rate resetmechanism that multiplies the effects of changes in the underlyingindex. While this form of leverage may increase the security's,and thus the Fund's, yield, it may also increase the volatilityof the security's market value. There may not be an active secondarymarket for any particular floating or variable rate instrument;this could make it difficult for a Fund to dispose of the instrumentduring periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty orif the issuer's credit became impaired at a time when the Fundwas not entitled to exercise any demand rights it might have.A Fund could, for this or other reasons, suffer a loss with respectto the instrument. The Advisers monitor the liquidity of the Funds'investments invariable and floating rate instruments, but therecan be no guarantee that an active secondary market will existat any time. Ready Cash Investment Fund also may purchase variableand floating rate demand notes which are unsecured obligationsredeemable upon not more than 30 days' notice. These obligationsinclude master demand notes that permit investment of fluctuatingamounts at varying rates of interest pursuant to direct arrangementwith the issuer of the instrument. The issuer of these obligationsoften has the right, after a given period, to prepay their outstandingprincipal amount of the obligations upon a specified number ofdays' notice. These obligations generally are not traded, norgenerally is there an established secondary market for these obligations.To the extent a demand note does not have a seven day or shorterdemand feature and there is no readily available market for theobligation, it is treated as an illiquid security. Certain securities may have aninitial principal amount that varies over time based on an interestrate index, and, accordingly, a Fund might be entitled to lessthan the initial principal amount of the security upon the security'smaturity. The Funds intend to purchase these securities only whenthe Adviser believes the interest income from the instrument justifiesany principal risks associated with the instrument. The Advisersmay attempt to limit any potential loss of principal by purchasingsimilar instruments that are intended to provide an offsettingincrease in principal. There can be no assurance that an Adviserwill be able to limit the effects of principal fluctuations and,accordingly, a Fund may incur losses on those securities evenif held to maturity without issuer default.

PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONSOF SHARES Shares of each Fund are continuouslysold and redeemed at a price equal to their net asset value oneach Fund Business Day (as defined below) without charge. Alltransactions in Fund Shares are effected through the TransferAgent, which accepts orders for purchases and redemptions onlyfrom shareholders of record and new investors. Shareholders ofrecord receive periodic statements from the Trust listing allaccount activity during the statement period. I Shares of a Fundare offered to fiduciary, agency and custodial clients of banktrust departments, trust companies and their affiliates. PURCHASE AND REDEMPTIONPROCEDURES Purchases and Redemptions ThroughFinancial Institutions. Sharesmay be purchased and redeemed(and in the case of Plans, generallywill be purchased and redeemed) through certain broker-dealers,banks, trust companies and their affiliates, including Norwestand its affiliates ("Processing Organizations").

Fund Shares are redeemed as of the next determinationof the Fund's net asset value following acceptance by the TransferAgent of the redemption order in proper form (and any supportingdocumentation which the Transfer Agent may require). Normally,redemption proceeds are paid immediately, but in no event laterthan 7 days, following acceptance of a redemption order. Proceedsof a redemption request, however, will not be paid unless anycheck used for investment has been cleared by the shareholder'sbank, which may take up to 15 days. Unless otherwise indicated,redemption proceeds normally are paid by check mailed to the shareholder'srecord address. The right of redemption may not be suspended northe payment dates postponed for more than 7 days except when theNew York Stock Exchange is closed (or when trading thereon isrestricted) for any reason other than its customary weekend orholiday closings or under any emergency or other circumstancesas determined by the SEC.

Sharesmay be a suitable investment vehicle for part or all of the assetsheld in certain IRAs or KEOGH accounts. An appropriate accountapplication form may be obtained by contacting the Trust or, foraccounts rolling over from a Plan, the shareholder's employer.Undercurrent IRA rules, by directly rolling over a distributionfrom a Plan, investors can avoid the 20percent withholding taximposed on distributions from a Plan.

Currently, individuals may maketax-deductible IRA contributions of up to a maximum of $2,000annually.However, the deduction will be reduced if the individual or, inthe case of a married individual filing jointly, either the individualor the individual's spouse is an active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan and has adjusted gross income abovecertain levels.

Other Redemption Information.Proceeds of redemptionsnormally are paid in cash. However, payments may be made whollyor partially in portfolio securities if the Board determines thatpayment in cashwould be detrimental to the best interests of the Fund. The Companywill only effect a redemption in portfolio securities if the particularshareholder is redeeming more than $250,000 or 1 percent of theFund's total net assets, whichever is less, during any 90-dayperiod. Due to the cost to the Trust of maintaining smaller accounts,the Trust reserves the right to redeem, upon not less than 60days written notice, all shares in any Fund account with an aggregatenet asset value of less than $1,000. The Trust will not redeemaccounts that fall below that amount solely as a result of a reductionin net asset value. Automatic Investment Plan.

Ashareholder of I Shares of a Fund whose shares in a single accounttotal $1,000 or more (or of Institutional Shares whose sharesin a single account total $10,000 or more) may establish a withdrawalplan to provide for the pre authorized payment from the shareholder'saccount of $250 or more on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual orannual basis. Under the withdrawal plan, sufficient shares inthe shareholder's account are redeemed to provide the amount ofthe periodic payment and any taxable gain or loss is recognizedby the shareholder upon redemption of the shares. Shareholders wishing to utilizethe withdrawal plan may do so by completing an application whichmay be obtained by writing or calling the Transfer Agent. TheTrust may suspend a shareholder's withdrawal plan without noticeif the account contains insufficient funds to effect a withdrawalor if the account balance is less than the required minimum amountat any time. Reopening Accounts. Providedthat the information on the account application form on file withthe Trust is still applicable, a shareholder may reopen an account,without filing a new account application form, at any time withinone year after the shareholder's account is closed. Determination of Net Asset Value.The Trust determinesthe net asset value per share of each Fund as of 4:00 P.M., Easterntime, on all weekdays, except New Year's Day, Presidents' Day,Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, ColumbusDay, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas ("Fund BusinessDay") by dividing the value of the Fund's net assets (i.e.,the value of its securities and other assets less its liabilities)by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the determinationis made. Securities owned by a Fund forwhich market quotations are readily available are valued at currentmarket value. Securities for which market quotations are not readilyavailable are valued at fair value as determined by the Boardin accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. Trading in securities on European,Far Eastern and other international securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets is normally completed well before the close ofbusiness of each Fund Business Day. In addition, trading in foreignsecurities generally or in a particular country or countries maynot take place on all Fund Business Days. Trading does take placein various foreign markets, however, on days on which the Funds'net asset value is not calculated. Calculation of the net assetvalue per share of a Fund may not occur contemporaneously withthe determination of the prices of the foreign securities usedin the calculation. Events affecting the values of foreign securitiesthat occur after the time their prices are determined and beforethe Fund's determination of net asset value will not be reflectedin the Fund's calculation of net asset value unless the Adviseror Schroder determines that the particular event would materiallyaffect net asset value, in which case an adjustment will be made. All assets and liabilities ofa Fund denominated in foreign currencies are valued in U.S. dollarsat the mean of the bid and asked prices of such currencies againstthe U.S. dollar last quoted by a major bank prior to the timeof the valuation.

As International Fundcurrently invests all of its assets in International Portfolio,no fees are payable under that agreement. Pursuant to the investmentsubadvisory agreements, the Adviser (and not the Trust) pays Schrodera fee for its investment subadvisory services; however, that compensationdoes not increase the amount paid by the Trust to the Adviserpursuant to the Adviser's investment advisory agreements. With respect to InternationalPortfolio, for services under its advisory agreement, Schroderreceives from Core Trust an advisory fee of 0.45 percent of InternationalPortfolio's average annual daily net assets.

Norwest waives all of the advisoryfees payable by Small Company Portfolio and Index Portfolio. Schroderdoes not receive a subadvisory fee from any Blended Fund to theextent that such Fund's assets are invested in International PortfolioII, and Norwest reimburses International Portfolio II the amountof the advisory fee the Portfolio pays to Schroder. Accordingly,duplicative investment advisory fees are not incurred by any Fund. Advisory fees are accrued dailyand paid monthly. The advisory fees for Growth Equity Fund, ContrarianStock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund and Small Company GrowthFund and the combined advisory and administrative services feesfor International Fund are higher than those paid by most investmentcompanies of all types to their advisers, but the Trust believesthat the fees are appropriate for these Funds considering theirinvestment objectives and policies.

Under this agreement, Norwest irresponsible for compilingdata for and preparing communications between the Fund and itsshare-holders, maintaining requisite information flows betweenthe Fund and the investment adviser to International Portfolio,monitoring and reporting to the Board on the performance of InternationalPortfolio and reimbursing the Fund for certain excess expenses.No fees are payable under this service agreement in the eventthat the International Fund is not completely invested in InternationalPortfolio or another investment company. International Fund incurstotal management and administrative fees at a higher rate thanthe other Funds due in part to the nature of the Fund's structureand the Fund's investment policies. Pursuant to a separate distributionagreement with the Trust, Forum acts as the agent of the Trustin connection with the offering of the Shares of the Funds. Forumreceives no payments for its services as distributor of the Shares.In addition, no Fund and no Portfolio of Core Trust has adopteda Rule12b-1 Plan applicable to the Shares and, accordingly, noFund incurs any distribution expenses with respect to the Shares.Forum also provides accounting services to the Funds and to CoreTrust. Shareholder Servicing and Custody.Norwest serves as transfer agent and dividend disbursing agentfor the Trust (in this capacity, the "Transfer Agent").The Transfer Agent maintains an account for each shareholder ofthe Trust (unless such accounts are maintained by sub-transferagents or processing agents), performs other transfer agency andshareholder servicing functions for the Trust, and acts as dividenddisbursing agent for the Trust. The Transfer Agent is permittedto subcontract any or all of its functions with respect to allor any portion of the Trust's shareholders to one or more qualifiedsub-transfer agents or processing agents, which may be its orForum's affiliates, who agree to comply with the terms of theTransfer Agent's agreement with the Trust. The Transfer Agentis permitted to compensate those agents for their services; however,no such compensation may increase the aggregate amount of paymentsby the Trust to the Transfer Agent. For its services, Norwestis compensated at the annual rate of 0.25 percent of each Fund'saverage annual daily net assets attributable to the Shares. Inthe case of Ready Cash Investment Fund, Norwest is compensatedat an annual rate of 0.10percent of the Fund's average annualdaily net assets attributable to Institutional Shares and maybe reimbursed for certain expenses related to its transfer agencyservices. Norwest also serves as the Trust'scustodian and may appoint subcustodians for the foreign securitiesand other assets held in foreign countries. Except as noted below,Norwest currently receives no additional compensation for itscustodial services, but the Funds will incur the expenses andcosts of any subcustodian. International Fund and, to the extentthey invest in the International Fund style, each Blended Fundindirectly incurs its pro rata portion of the custodial fees ofCore Trust. The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. serves as custodianof International Portfolio and International Portfolio II andis paid a fee by Core Trust for its services. Norwest serves ascustodian of Small Company Portfolio and Index Portfolio and currentlyreceives no additional compensation for its custodial serviceswith respect to those Portfolios. For its custodian services,Norwest is compensated for providing custodian services to eachof the Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, TotalReturn Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund at a rate up to0.05 percent of the Fund's average annual daily net assets. EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS Each Fund (as well as each Portfolioof Core Trust) is obligated to pay for all of its expenses, althoughNorwest has agreed to reimburse the Trust for certain of eachFund's operating expenses which in any year exceed the limitsprescribed by any state in which the Fund's shares are qualifiedfor sale. For more information about Fund expenses, see "Summary- Expenses of Investing in the Funds." These expenses include:interest charges; taxes; brokerage fees and commissions; certaininsurance premiums; applicable fees and expenses under the Trust'sor Core Trust's contracts with the Advisers, Forum, the TransferAgent and any custodian; fees of pricing, interest, dividend,credit and other reporting services; costs of membership in tradeassociations; auditing, legal and compliance expenses; costs ofpreparing and printing the Trust's prospectuses, statements ofadditional information and share-holder reports and deliveringthem to existing shareholders; compensation of certain of theTrust's or Core Trust's trustees, officers and employees and otherpersonnel performing services for the Trust or Core Trust; andregistration fees and related expenses. Each Fund's expenses compriseTrust expenses attributable to the Fund and expenses not attributableto any particular portfolio of the Trust, which are allocatedamong the Funds and all other portfolios of the Trust in proportionto their average net assets. International Fund's expenses includethe Fund's pro rata share of the operating expenses of InternationalPortfolio, which are borne indirectly by International Fund'sshareholders. Although the Blended Portfolios do not incur investmentadvisory fees, they do incur other administrative and operatingexpenses. While the Blended Portfolios' expenses are not bornedirectly by the Blended Funds, those expenses have the effectof reducing the net investment income of the Blended Portfolios.Expenses of each Blended Portfolio for the period ended October31, 1995, as a percentage of average net assets, were: Small CompanyPortfolio, 0.15 percent, Index Portfolio, 0.17percent and InternationalPortfolio II, 0.25 percent. Each Blended Fund incurs its pro ratashare of the Blended Portfolios' expenses, but only to the extentit invests in a Blended Portfolio. The Advisers, Forum, the TransferAgent and any other service provider to the Funds, InternationalPortfolio or a Blended Portfolio may elect to waive all or a portionof their fees. Any such waivers will have the effect of increasinga Fund's performance for the period during which the waiver wasin effect. No fee waivers may be recouped at a later date. Otherthan investment advisory fees, any fee paid by the Trust or CoreTrust may be increased by the Board or the board of trustees ofCore Trust without shareholder approval. Fee waivers are voluntaryand may be reduced or eliminated at any time. Each service provider to the Trustor their agents or affiliates may also act in various capacitiesfor, and receive compensation from, their customers who are shareholdersin a Fund. Under agreements with those customers, these entitiesmay elect to credit against the fees payable to them by theircustomers or to rebate to customers all or a portion of any feereceived from the Trust with respect to assets of those customersinvested in the Funds.

OTHER INFORMATION FUND PERFORMANCE Each Fund's performance may bequoted in advertising in terms of yield or total return. Bothtypes are based on historical results and are not intended toindicate future performance. The Funds' advertisements may referenceratings and rankings among similar funds by independent evaluatorssuch as Morningstar, Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. and IBC/Donoghue,Inc. In addition, the performance of a Fund may be compared torecognized indices of market performance. The comparative materialfound in the Funds' advertisements, sales literature or reportsto shareholders may contain performance ratings. This materialis not to be considered representative or indicative of futureperformance. Yield. AFund's yield is a way of showing the rate of income earned bythe Fund as a percentage of the Fund's share price. Yield is calculatedby dividing the net investment income of the Fund for the statedperiod by the average number of shares entitled to receive dividendsand expressing the result as an annualized percentage rate basedon the Fund's share price at the end of the period. A Fund mayalso quote a compounded annualized yield which assumes the reinvestmentof dividends paid by the Fund and therefore will be somewhat higherthan the annualized yield for the same period. Total Return. TotalReturn refers to the average annual compounded rates of returnover some representative period that would equate an initial amountinvested at the beginning of a stated period to the ending redeemablevalue of the investment, after giving effect to the reinvestmentof all dividends and distributionsand deductions of expenses during the period. Because averageannual returns tend to smooth out variations in a Fund's returns,shareholders should recognize that they are not the same as actualyear-by-year results. Performance Benchmarks. Eachof the Funds uses a benchmark securities index as a measure ofthe Fund's performance. These indices may be comprised of a compositeof various recognized securities indices to reflect the investmentpolicies of Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund and eachBalanced Fund, which invest their assets using different investmentstyles. These indices are not used in the management of the Fundbut rather are standards by which the Advisers and shareholdersmay compare the performance of a Fund to an unmanaged compositeof securities with similar, but not identical, characteristicsas the Fund. For instance, Index Fund's investment objective isto duplicate the return of the Standard & Poor's 500 CompositeStock Price Index. Accordingly, the Adviser generally uses thatindex as a comparison to measure the performance of Index Fund.The Funds may from time to time advertise a comparison of theirperformance against any of these or other indices. BANKING LAW MATTERS Federal banking laws and regulationsgenerally permit a bank or bank affiliate to act as investmentadviser, transfer agent and custodian to an investment companyand to purchase shares of the investment company as agent forand upon the order of a customer. Forum believes that Norwestand any other bank or bank affiliate that may perform sub-transferagent or similar services or purchase shares as agent for itscustomers may perform the services described in this Prospectusfor the Trust and its shareholders without violating applicableFederal banking laws or regulations. Federal or state statutes or regulationsand judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations relatingto the activities of banks and their affiliates, however, couldprevent a bank or bank affiliate from continuing to perform allor a part of the activities contemplated by this Prospectus. IfNorwest or another bank or bank affiliate were prohibited fromso acting, its shareholder customers would be permitted to remainshareholders of the Trust and alternative means for continuingthe servicing of such shareholders would besought. In this event,changes in the operation of the Trust might occur and shareholdersserviced by the bank or bank affiliate might no longer be ableto avail themselves of its services. It is not expected that shareholderswould suffer any adverse financial consequences as a result ofany of these occurrences. PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS The Advisers place orders forthe purchase and sale of assets they manage with brokers and dealersselected by and in the discretion of the respective Adviser. TheAdvisers seek "best execution" for all portfolio transactions,but a Fund may pay higher than the lowest available commissionrates when an Adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in lightof the value of the brokerage, research and other services providedby the broker effecting the transaction. Commission rates for brokeragetransactions are fixed on many foreign securities exchanges, andthis may cause higher brokerage expenses to accrue to InternationalFund and each other Fund that invests in foreign securities thanwould be the case for comparable transactions effected on UnitedStates securities exchanges. Subject to the Funds' policy ofobtaining the best price consistent with quality of executionof transactions, each Adviser may employ Norwest Investment Services,Inc., Schroder Wertheim & Company and other broker-dealeraffiliates of an Adviser (collectively "Affiliated Brokers")to effect brokerage transactions for the Funds. The Fund's paymentof commissions to Affiliated Brokers is subject to proceduresadopted by the Board and, with respect to the Portfolios of CoreTrust, Core Trust's board of trustees, to provide that the commissionswill not exceed the usual and customary broker's commissions chargedby unaffiliated brokers. No specific portion of a Fund's brokeragewill be directed to Affiliated Brokers and in no event will abroker affiliated with an Adviser directing the transaction receivebrokerage transactions in recognition of research or other servicesprovided to the Adviser. Tax rules applicable to short-termtrading may affect the timing of a Fund's portfolio transactionsor its ability to realize short-term trading profits or establishshort-term positions. For the fiscal period ended October31, 1995, the annual turnover rates of Small Company Growth Fund,Intermediate U.S. Government Fund and Stable Income Fund were106.55 percent, 240.90percent and 115.85 percent, respectively.An annual turnover rate of 100 percent would occur if all of thesecurities in a Fund were replaced once in a period of 1 year.Higher portfolio turnover rates may result in higher taxable incomefor shareholders and, with respect to Funds that invest in equitysecurities, may result in increased brokerage costs to the Fund.For more information about the port-folio transactions of theFunds and International Portfolio, see the SAI. THE TRUST AND ITS SHARES The Trust was originally organizedunder the name "Prime Value Funds, Inc." as a Marylandcorporation on August 29, 1986 and on July 30, 1993 was reorganizedas a Delaware business trust under the name "Norwest Funds."The Trust has an unlimited number of authorized shares of beneficialinterest. The Board may, without shareholder approval, dividethe authorized shares into an unlimited number of separate portfoliosor series (such as the Funds) and may divide portfolios or seriesinto classes of shares (such as I Shares), and the costs of doingso will be borne by the Trust. Currently the authorized sharesof the Trust are divided into 30 series. Other Classes of Shares. EachFund may issue shares of other classes. Funds of the Trust (exceptmoney market funds) currently may issue three classes of shares,I Shares, A Shares and B Shares, and may in the future createadditional class types. Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company StockFund, International Fund and Total Return Bond Fund currentlyoffer A Shares and B Shares in addition to I Shares. DiversifiedEquity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Income Equity Fund, IntermediateU.S. Government Fund and Stable Income Fund plan to offer A Sharesand B Shares in April 1996. I Shares are offered to fiduciary,agency and custodial clients of bank trust departments, trustcompanies and their affiliates without any sales charges. A Sharesare sold with front-end sales charge or, in some cases, a contingentdeferred sales charge. B Shares are sold with a contingent deferredsales charge and pay distribution fees. Ready Cash InvestmentFund currently has two classes of shares outstanding, InstitutionalShares and Investor Shares, and may in the future create additionalclass types. Institutional Shares are offered with a minimum investmentof $100,000. Investor Shares are offered with a mini-mum investmentof $1,000 and incur greater transfer agency and other expensesthan Institutional Shares. Each class of a Fund will have a differentexpense ratio and may have different sales charges(including distributionfees). Each class's performance is affected by its expenses andsales charges. For more information on any other class of sharesof the Funds investors may contact the Transfer Agent at 612-667-8833or 800-338-1348. Investors may also contact their Norwest salesrepresentative to obtain information on the other classes. Salespersonnel of broker-dealers and other financial institutions sellingthe Fund's shares may receive differing compensation for sellingI Shares, A Shares and B Shares of the Funds. Shareholder Voting and OtherRights. Each shareof each portfolio of the Trust and each class of shares has equaldividend, distribution, liquidation and voting rights, and fractionalshares have those rights proportionately, except that expensesrelated to the distribution of the shares of each class (and certainother expenses such as transfer agency and administration expenses)are borne solely by those shares and each class votes separatelywith respect to the provisions of any Rule 12b-1 plan which pertainto the class and other matters for which separate class votingis appropriate under applicable law. Generally, shares will bevoted in the aggregate without reference to a particular portfolioor class, except if the matter affects only one portfolio or classor voting by portfolio or class is required by law, in which caseshares will be voted separately by portfolio or class, as appropriate.Delaware law does not require the Trust to hold annual meetingsof shareholders, and it is anticipated that shareholder meetingswill be held only when specifically required by Federal or statelaw. Shareholders have available certain procedures for the removalof Trustees. There are no conversion or preemptive rights in connectionwith shares of the Trust. All shares when issued in accordancewith the terms of the offering will be fully paid and nonassessable.Shares are redeemable at net asset value, at the option of theshareholders, subject to any contingent deferred sales chargethat may apply. A share-holder in a portfolio is entitled to theshareholder's pro rata share of all dividends and distributionsarising from that portfolio's assets and, upon redeeming shares,will receive the portion of the portfolio's net assets representedby the redeemed shares. As an investor in InternationalPortfolio, International Fund will be entitled to vote in proportionto its relative beneficial interest in International Portfolio.On most issues subject to a vote of investors, as required bythe 1940 Act and other applicable law, the Fund will solicit proxiesfrom shareholders of the Fund and will vote its interest in InternationalPortfolio in proportion to the votes cast by its shareholders.If there are other investors in International Portfolio, therecan be no assurance that any issue that receives a majority ofthe votes cast by Fund shareholders will receive a majority ofvotes cast by all investors in International Portfolio; indeed,if other investors hold a majority interest in International Portfolio,they could hold have voting control of International Portfolio. From time to time, a shareholdermay own a large percentage of a Fund. Accordingly, that shareholdermay be able to greatly affect (if not determine) the outcome ofa shareholder vote. CORE TRUST STRUCTURE International Fund invests allof its assets in International Portfolio, a separate series ofCore Trust, a business trust organized under the laws of the Stateof Delaware in September 1994. Core Trust is registered underthe 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company. Pursuantto an exemptive order issued by the SEC, the Blended Funds investportions of their assets in Small Company Portfolio, InternationalPortfolio II and Index Portfolio of Core Trust. Core Trust currentlyconsists of eight diversified portfolios. The assets of each Portfolioof Core Trust belong only to, and the liabilities of each Portfolioare borne solely by, the respective Portfolio and no other Portfolioof Core Trust. International Portfolio. InternationalFund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing allof its investable assets in International Portfolio, which hasthe same investment objective and policies as the Fund. Accordingly,International Portfolio directly acquires its own securities andthe Fund ac-quires an indirect interest in those securities. Theinvestment objective and fundamental investment policies of InternationalFund and International Portfolio can be changed only with shareholderapproval. See "Summary," "Investment Objectives,Policies and Risk Considerations," "Management of theFunds" and "Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategiesand Risk Considerations" for a complete description of InternationalPortfolio's investment objective, policies, restrictions, management,and expenses. International Fund's investmentin International Portfolio is in the form of a non-transferablebeneficial interest. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Fundis the only institutional investor that has invested all of itsassets in International Portfolio. International Portfolio maypermit other investment companies or institutional investors toinvest in International Portfolio. All investors in InternationalPortfolio will invest on the same terms and conditions as InternationalFund and will pay a proportionate share of International Portfolio'sexpenses. International Portfolio will notsell its shares directly to members of the general public. Anotherinstitutional investor in International Portfolio that might sellits shares to members of the general public would not be requiredto sell its shares at the same public offering price as InternationalFund, could have different advisory and other fees and expensesthan International Fund, and might charge a sales commission.Therefore, International Fund shareholders may have differentreturns than shareholders in another investment company that investsexclusively in International Portfolio. There is currently nosuch other investment company that offers its shares to membersof the general public. Information regarding any such funds inthe future will be available from Core Trust by calling 207-879-1900. Certain Risks of Investing inInternational Portfolio. InternationalFund's investment in International Portfolio may be affected bythe actions of other large investors in International Portfolio,if any. For example, if International Portfolio had a large investorother than International Fund that redeemed its interest in InternationalPortfolio, International Portfolio's remaining investors (includingthe Fund) might, as a result, experience higher pro rata operatingexpenses, thereby producing lower returns. International Fund may withdrawits entire investment from International Portfolio at any time,if the Board determines that it is in the best interests of InternationalFund and its shareholders to do so. International Fund might withdraw,for example, if there were other investors in International Portfoliowith power to, and who did by a vote of the shareholders of allinvestors (including the Fund), change the investment objectiveor policies of International Portfolio in a manner not acceptableto the Board. A withdrawal could result in a distribution in kindof portfolio securities (as opposed to a cash distribution) byInternational Portfolio. That distribution could result in a lessdiversified portfolio of investments for the Fund and could affectadversely the liquidity of the Fund's portfolio. If InternationalFund decided to convert those securities to cash, it usually wouldincur brokerage fees or other transaction costs. If InternationalFund withdrew its investment from International Portfolio, theBoard would consider what action might be taken, including themanagement of the Fund's assets in accordance with its investmentobjective and policies by the Adviser and Schroder, the Fund'sinvestment adviser and subadviser, respectively, or the investmentof all of the Fund's investable assets in another pooled investmententity having substantially the same investment objective as theFund. The inability of International Fund to find a suitable replacementinvestment, in the event the Board decided not to permit the Adviserand Schroder to manage the Fund's assets, could have a significantimpact on shareholders of the Fund. Each investor in InternationalPortfolio, including International Fund, will be liable for allobligations of International Portfolio but not for those of anyother portfolio of Core Trust. The risk to an investor in InternationalPortfolio of incurring financial loss on account of such liability,however, would be limited to circumstances in which InternationalPortfolio was unable to meet its obligations. Upon liquidationof International Portfolio, investors would be entitled to sharepro rata in the net assets of International Portfolio availablefor distribution to investors. Core Trust Blended Portfolios.The Blended Funds arepermitted to invest a portion of their assets which are managedby using the small company, index and international investmentstyles in Small Company Portfolio, Index Portfolio, and InternationalPortfolio II pursuant to an exemptive order obtained from theSEC. The conditions of the Trust's exemptive order do not permita Fund to invest all of its assets in a Blended Portfolio. Accordingly,Index Fund does not invest in Index Portfolio and InternationalFund does not invest in International Portfolio II. The Trust's exemptive order imposesseveral substantive conditions. On behalf of each Blended Fund,the Board is required to review at least annually reports identifyingall instances in which a Portfolio in which the Fund invests buysa security at approximately the same time that another Portfolioin which the Fund invests sells the same security. The Board willconsider whether the duplication of brokerage costs resultingfrom these transactions is significant. If the duplication ofbrokerage costs becomes significant, the Board will adopt proceduresdesigned to limit duplication. Conservative Balanced Fund, ModerateBalanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund will limit any redemptionsresulting from a reallocation in their respective equity and fixedincome security positions to no more than 1 percent of a Portfolioduring any period of less than 30 days. The Board will determine,at least annually, that investment in the Portfolios is in thebest interests of the share-holders of each Blended Fund. As each Blended Portfolio comprisesinvestment components of several Blended Funds, a Blended Fundmay be affected by the actions of other Blended Funds with respectto a particular Blended Portfolio. These risks are similar tothose associated with International Fund's investment in InternationalPortfolio, as described above. These risks include the possibilitythat another Blended Fund might withdraw its investment from aBlended Portfolio, leading to increased expenses for other BlendedFunds that invest in the Blended Portfolio, or that a BlendedPortfolio's investment policies might be changed in a manner notsuitable to a Blended Fund.

Commonstockholders are the owners of the company issuing the stock and,accordingly, vote on various corporate governance matters suchas mergers. They are not creditors of the company, but rather,upon liquidation of the company are entitled to their pro ratashare of the company's assets after creditors (including fixedincome security holders) and, if applicable, preferred stockholdersare paid. Preferred stock is a class of stock having a preferenceover common stock as to dividends and, in the alternative, asto the recovery of investment. A preferred stockholder is a shareholderin the company and not a creditor of the company as is a holderof the company's fixed income securities. Dividends paid to commonand preferred stockholders are distributions of the earnings ofthe company and not interest payments, which are expenses of thecompany. Equity securities owned by a Fund may be traded on nationalsecurities exchanges, in the over-the-counter market or on a regionalsecurities exchange and may not be traded every day or in thevolume typical of securities traded on a major national securitiesexchange. As a result, disposition by a Fund of a portfolio securityto meet redemptions by shareholders or otherwise may require theFund to sell these securities at a discount from market prices,to sell during periods when disposition is not desirable, or tomake many small sales over an extended period of time. The marketvalue of all securities, including equity securities, is basedupon the market's perception of value and not necessarily thebook value of an issuer or other objective measure of a company'sworth. Convertible SecuritiesEquity Funds, Balanced Funds, Total Return Bond Fund. Convertiblesecurities, which include convertible debt, convertible preferredstock and other securities exchangeable under certain circumstancesfor shares of common stock, are fixed income securities or preferredstock which generally may be converted at a stated price withina specific amount of time into a specified number of shares ofcommon stock. A convertible security entitles the holder to receiveinterest paid or accrued on debtor the dividend paid on preferredstock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, convertedor exchanged. Before conversion, convertible securities have characteristicssimilar to nonconvertible debt securities in that they ordinarilyprovide a stream of income with generally higher yields than thoseof common stocks of the same or similar issuers. These securitiesare usually senior to common stock in a company's capital structure,but usually are subordinated to non-convertible debt securities.In general, the value of a convertible security is the higherof its investment value (its value as a fixed income security)and its conversion value (the value of the underlying shares ofcommon stock if the security is converted). As a fixed incomesecurity, the value of a convertible security generally increaseswhen interest rates decline and generally decreases when interestrates rise. The value of a convertible security is, however, alsoinfluenced by the value of the underlying common stock. ContrarianStock Fund and Small Company Stock Fund currently intend to limittheir investments in convertible securities, and the other Fundsmay only invest in convertible securities, that are investmentgrade. A Fund may invest in equity-linkedsecurities, including Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock("PERCS"), Equity-Linked Securities ("ELKS"),and Liquid Yield Option Notes ("LYONS"). Equity-LinkedSecurities are securities that are convertible into or based uponthe value of, equity securities upon certain terms and conditions.The amount received by an investor at maturity of these securitiesis not fixed but is based on the price of the underlying commonstock, which may rise or fall. In addition, it is not possibleto predict how equity-linked securities will trade in the secondarymarket or whether the market for them will be liquid or illiquid. WarrantsEquity Funds, Balanced Funds. AFund may invest in warrants, which are options to purchase anequity security at a specified price (usually representing a premiumover the applicable market value of the underlying equity securityat the time of the warrant's issuance) and usually during a specifiedperiod of time. Unlike convertible securities and preferred stocks,warrants do not pay a fixed dividend. Investments in warrantsinvolve certain risks, including the possible lack of a liquidmarket for the resale of the warrants, potential price fluctuationsas a result of speculation or other factors and failure of theprice of the underlying security to reach a level at which thewarrant can be prudently exercised (in which case the warrantmay expire without being exercised, resulting in the loss of theFund's entire investment therein). ADRs and EDRsEquity Funds (except Index Fund and Small Company Growth Fund),Balanced Funds. A Fundmay invest in sponsored and unsponsored American Depository Receipts("ADRs"), which are receipts issued by an American bankor trust company evidencing ownership of underlying securitiesissued by a foreign issuer. ADRs, in registered form, are designedfor use in U.S. securities markets. Unsponsored ADRs may be createdwithout the participation of the foreign issuer. Holders of theseADRs generally bear all the costs of the ADR facility, whereasforeign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored ADR.The bank or trust company depository of an unsponsored ADR maybe under no obligation to distribute shareholder communicationsreceived from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights.A Fund (other than Contrarian Stock Fund and Small Company StockFund) may also invest in European Depository Receipts ("EDRs"),receipts issued by a European financial institution evidencingan arrangement similar to that of ADRs, and in other similar instrumentsrepresenting securities of foreign companies. EDRs, in bearerform, are designed for use in European securities markets. U.S. Government SecuritiesAll Funds. As usedin this Prospectus, the term U.S. Government Securities meansobligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interestby the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. TheU.S. Government Securities in which a Fund may invest includeU.S. Treasury Securities and obligations issued or guaranteedby U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities and backed bythe full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, such as thoseguaranteed by the Small Business Administration or issued by theGovernment National Mortgage Association. In addition, the U.S.Government Securities in which the Funds may invest include securitiessupported primarily or solely by the creditworthiness of the issuer,such as securities of the Federal National Mortgage Association,the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Tennessee ValleyAuthority. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Government willsupport securities not backed by its full faith and credit. Accordingly,although these securities have historically involved little riskof loss of principal if held to maturity, they may involve morerisk than securities backed by the U.S. Government's full faithand credit. Zero-Coupon SecuritiesFixed Income Funds, Balanced Funds. AFund may invest in separately traded principal and interest componentsof securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Thesecomponents are traded independently under the Treasury's SeparateTrading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities("STRIPS")program or as Coupons Under Book Entry Safekeeping ("CUBES").The Funds may invest in other types of related zero-coupon securities.For instance, a number of banks and brokerage firms separate theprincipal and interest portions of U.S. Treasury securities andsell them separately in the form of receipts or certificates representingundivided interests in these instruments. These instruments aregenerally held by a bank in a custodial or trust account on behalfof the owners of the securities and are known by various names,including Treasury Receipts ("TRs"), Treasury InvestmentGrowth Receipts ("TIGRs") and Certificates of Accrualon Treasury Securities ("CATS"). Zero-coupon securitiesalso may be issued by corporations and municipalities. Zero-coupon securities are soldat original issue discount and pay no interest to holders priorto maturity, but a Fund holding a zero-coupon security must includea portion of the original issue discount of the security as income.Because of this, zero-coupon securities may be subject to greaterfluctuation of market value than the other securities in whichthe Funds may invest. The Funds distribute all of their net investmentincome, and may have to sell portfolio securities to distributeimputed income, which may occur at a time when the Adviser orSchroder would not have chosen to sell such securities and whichmay result in a taxable gain or loss. Corporate Debt Securities Commercial Paper Corporate Debt Securities -Balanced Funds, Fixed Income Funds, Contrarian Stock Fund, SmallCompany Stock Fund. Commercial Paper - All Funds. Thecorporate debt securities in which the Funds may invest includecorporate bonds and notes and short-term investments such as commercialpaper and variable rate demand notes. Commercial paper (short-termpromissory notes) is issued by companies to finance their or theiraffiliates' current obligations and is frequently unsecured. Variableand floating rate demand notes are unsecured obligations redeemableupon not more than 30 days' notice. These obligations includemaster demand notes that permit investment of fluctuating amountsat varying rates of interest pursuant to direct arrangement withthe issuer of the instrument. The issuer of these obligationsoften has the right, after a given period, to prepay the outstandingprincipal amount of the obligations upon a specified number ofdays' notice. These obligations generally are not traded, norgenerally is there an established secondary market for these obligations.To the extent a demand note does not have a 7 day or shorter demandfeature and there is no readily available market for the obligation,it is treated as an illiquid security. Financial InstitutionObligations All Funds. AFund may invest in obligations of financial institutions, includingnegotiable certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and timedeposits of U.S. banks (including savings banks and savings associations),foreign branches of U.S. banks, foreign banks and their non-U.S.branches (Eurodollars), U.S. branches and agencies of foreignbanks (Yankee dollars), and wholly-owned banking-related subsidiariesof foreign banks. Short Maturity style of Conservative BalancedFund limits these purchases to institutions which at the timeof investment have total assets in excess of 1 billion dollars,or the equivalent in other currencies. Certificates of deposit representan institution's obligation to repay funds deposited with it thatearn a specified interest rate over a given period. Bankers' acceptancesare negotiable obligations of a bank to pay a draft which hasbeen drawn by a customer and are usually backed by goods in internationaltrade. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits with a bankinginstitution that earn a specified interest rate over a given period.Certificates of deposit and fixed time deposits, which are payableat the stated maturity date and bear a fixed rate of interest,generally may be withdrawn on demand but maybe subject to earlywithdrawal penalties which could reduce the Fund's yield. Depositssubject to early withdrawal penalties or that mature in more than7 days are treated as illiquid securities if there is no readilyavailable market for the securities. A Fund's investments in theobligations of foreign banks and their branches, agencies or subsidiariesmay be obligations of the parent, of the issuing branch, agencyor subsidiary, or both. Investments in foreign bank obligationsare limited to banks and branches located in countries which theAdvisers believe do not present undue risk. Participation InterestsBalanced Funds, Managed Fixed Income Fund, Ready Cash InvestmentFund. A Fund may purchaseparticipation interests in loans or securities in which the Fundmay invest directly that are owned by banks or other financialinstitutions. A participation interest gives the Fund an undividedinterest in a loan or security in the proportion that the Fund'sinterest bears to the total principal amount of the security.Participation interests, which may have fixed, floating or variablerates, may carry a demand feature backed by a letter of creditor guarantee of the bank or institution permitting the holderto tender them back to the bank or other institution. For certainparticipation interests the Fund willhave the right to demandpayment, on not more than 7 days' notice, for all or a part ofthe Fund's participation interest. A Fund will only purchase participationinterests from banks or other financial institutions that theAdviser deems to be creditworthy. A Fund will not invest morethan 10 percent of its total assets in participation interestsin which the Fund does not have demand rights. Illiquid Securities Restricted Securities Illiquid Securities - All Funds.Restricted Securities - International Fund, Balanced Funds, FixedIn-come Funds (except Ready Cash Investment Fund). EachFund may invest up to 15 percent (10 per-cent in the case of ReadyCash Investment Fund) of its net assets in securities that atthe time of purchase are illiquid. Historically, illiquid securitieshave included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictionson resale because they have not been registered under the SecuritiesAct of 1933("restricted securities"), securities whichare otherwise not readily marketable, such as over-the-counteroptions, and repurchase agreements not entitling the holder topayment of principal in 7 days. Limitations on resale may havean adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securitiesand a Fund might also have to register restricted securities inorder to dispose of them, resulting in expense and delay. A Fundmight not be able to dispose of restricted or other securitiespromptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experiencedifficulty satisfying redemptions. There can be no assurance thata liquid market will exist for any security at any particulartime. An institutional market has developedfor certain securities that are not registered under the SecuritiesAct of 1933, including repurchase agreements, commercial paper,foreign securities and corporate bonds and notes. Institutionalinvestors depend on an efficient institutional market in whichthe unregistered security can be readily resold or on the issuer'sability to honor a demand for repayment of the unregistered security.A securities contractual or legal restrictions on resale to thegeneral public or to certain institutions may not be indicativeof the liquidity of the security. If such securities are eligiblefor purchase by institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144Aunder the Securities Act of 1933 or other exemptions, the Advisersmay determine that such securities are not illiquid securities,under guidelines or other exemptions adopted by the Board. Theseguidelines take into account trading activity in the securitiesand the availability of reliable pricing information, among otherfactors. If there is a lack of trading interest in a particularRule 144A security, a Fund's holdings of that security may beilliquid. BorrowingAll Funds. Each Fundmay borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes, includingthe meeting of redemption requests, in amounts up to 33 1/3 percentof the Fund's total assets. Borrowing involves special risk considerations.Interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing marketrates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the returnearned on borrowed funds (or on the assets that were retainedrather than sold to meet the needs for which funds were borrowed).Under adverse market conditions, a Fund might have to sell portfoliosecurities to meet interest or principal payments at a time wheninvestment considerations would not favor such sales. No Fund,other than Managed Fixed Income Fund, Intermediate U.S. GovernmentFund and, to the extent they invest in the Managed Fixed IncomeFund style or the Short Maturity style, the Balanced Funds maypurchase securities for investment while any borrowing equal to5 percent or more of the Fund's total assets is outstanding orborrow for purposes other than meeting redemptions in an amountexceeding 5 per-cent of the value of the Fund's total assets.A Fund's use of borrowed proceeds to make investments would subjectthe Fund to the risks of leveraging. Reverse repurchase agreements,short sales not against the box, dollar roll transactions andother similar investments that involve a form of leverage havecharacteristics similar to borrowings but are not considered borrowingsif the Fund maintains a segregated account; the use of these techniquesin connection with a segregated account may result in a Fund'sassets being 100 percent leveraged. See "Appendix A - TechniquesInvolving Leverage." Purchasing Securitieson Margin Intermediate U.S. GovernmentFund. When the Fundpurchases securities on margin, it only pays part of the purchaseprice and borrows the remainder, typically from the Fund's broker.As a borrowing, a Fund'spurchase of securities on margin is subject to the limitationsand risks described in "Borrowing" above. In addition,if the value of the securities purchased on margin decreases suchthat the Fund's borrowing with respect to the security exceedsthe maximum permissible borrowing amount, the Fund will be requiredto make margin payments (additional payments to the broker tomaintain the level of borrowing at permissible levels). A Fund'sobligation to satisfy margin calls may require the Fund to sellsecurities at an inappropriate time. Techniques InvolvingLeverage All Funds. Utilizationof leveraging involves special risks and may involve speculativeinvestment techniques. The Funds may borrow for other than temporaryor emergency purposes, lend their securities, enter reverse repurchaseagreements, and purchase securities on a when issued or forwardcommitment basis. In addition, certain funds may engage in dollarroll transactions and Intermediate U.S. Government Fund may purchasesecurities on margin and sell securities short (other than againstthe box). Each of these transactions involve the use of "leverage"when cash made available to the Fund through the investment techniqueis used to make additional portfolio investments. In addition,the use of swap and related agreements may involve leverage. TheFunds use these investment techniques only when the Adviser toa Fund believes that the leveraging and the returns availableto the Fund from investing the cash will provide shareholdersa potentially higher return. Leverage exists when a Fund achievesthe right to a return on a capital base that exceeds the Fund'sinvestment. Leverage creates the risk of magnified capital losseswhich occur when losses affect an asset base, enlarged by borrowingsor the creation of liabilities, that exceeds the equity base ofthe Fund. The risks of leverage includea higher volatility of the net asset value of the Fund's sharesand the relatively greater effect on the net asset value of theshares caused by favorable or adverse market movements or changesin the cost of cash obtained by leveraging and the yield obtainedfrom investing the cash. So long as a Fund is able to realizea net return on its investment portfolio that is higher than interestexpense incurred, if any, leverage will result in higher currentnet investment income being realized by the Fund than if the Fundwere not leveraged. On the other hand, interest rates change fromtime to time as does their relationship to each other dependingupon such factors as supply and demand, monetary and tax policiesand investor expectations. Changes in such factors could causethe relationship between the cost of leveraging and the yieldto change so that rates involved in the lever-aging arrangementmay substantially increase relative to the yield on the obligationsin which the proceeds of the leveraging have been invested. Tothe extent that the interest expense involved in leveraging approachesthe net return on the Fund's investment portfolio, the benefitof leveraging will be reduced, and, if the interest expense onborrowings were to exceed the net return to shareholders, theFund's use of leverage would result in a lower rate of returnthan if the Fund were not leveraged. Similarly, the effect ofleverage in a declining market could be a greater decrease innet asset value per share than if the Fund were not leveraged.In an extreme case, if the Fund's current investment income werenot sufficient to meet the interest expense of leveraging, itcould be necessary for the Fund to liquidate certain of its investmentsat an inappropriate time. The use of leverage may be consideredspeculative. Segregated Account. Inorder to limit the risks involved in various transactions involvingleverage, the Trust's custodian will set aside and maintain ina segregated account cash, U.S. Government Securities and otherliquid, high-grade debt securities in accordance with SEC guidelines.The accounts value, which is marked to market daily, will be atleast equal to the Fund's commitments under these transactions.The Fund's commitments may include (i) the Fund's obligationsto repurchase securities under a reverse repurchase agreement,settle when-issued and forward commitment transactions and makepayments under a cap or floor (see "Appendix A - Swap Agreements")and (ii) the greater of the market value of securities sold shortor the value of the securities at the time of the short sale (reducedby any margin deposit). The net amount of the excess, if any,of a Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect toeach interest rate swap will be calculated on a daily basis andan amount at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintainedin the segregated account. If the Fund enters into aninterest rate swap on otherthan a net basis, the Fund will maintain the full amount accruedon a daily basis of the Fund's obligations with respect to theswap in their segregated account. The use of a segregated accountin connection with leveraged transactions may result in a Fund'sportfolio being100 percent leveraged. Repurchase Agreements Securities Lending Reverse RepurchaseAgreements When-Issued Securitiesand Forward Commitments Dollar Roll Transactions A Fund's use of repurchase agreements,securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements and forwardcommitments (including dollar roll transactions) entails certainrisks not associated with direct investments in securities. Forinstance, in the event that bankruptcy or similar proceedingswere commenced against a counterparty while these transactionsremained open or a counterparty defaulted on its obligations,the Fund might suffer a loss. Failure by the other party to delivera security purchased by the Fund may result in a missed opportunityto make an alternative investment. The Advisers monitor the creditworthinessof counterparties to these transactions and intend to enter intothese transactions only when they believe the counterparties presentminimal credit risks and the income to be earned from the transactionjustifies the attendant risks. Counterparty insolvency risk withrespect to repurchase agreements is reduced by favorable insolvencylaws that allow the Fund, among other things, to liquidate thecollateral held in the event of the bankruptcy of the counterparty.Those laws do not apply to securities lending and, accordingly,securities lending involves more risk than does the use of repurchaseagreements. As a result of entering forward commitments and reverserepurchase agreements, as well as lending its securities, a Fundmay be exposed to greater potential fluctuations in the valueof its assets and net asset value per share. See "AppendixA - Techniques Involving Leverage." Repurchase Agreements - AllFunds. A Fund may enterinto repurchase agreements, transactions in which a Fund purchasesa security and simultaneously commits to resell that securityto the seller at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon futuredate, normally 1 to 7 days later. The resale price of are purchaseagreement reflects a market rate of interest that is not relatedto the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security. TheTrust's custodian maintains possession of the collateral underlyinga repurchase agreement, which has a market value, determined daily,at least equal to the repurchase price, and which consists ofthe types of securities in which the Fund may invest directly.International Portfolio and, with respect to the portion of theirassets managed in the International Fund style, Diversified EquityFund, Growth Equity Fund and each Balanced Fund, may enter intorepurchase agreements with foreign entities. Securities Lending - All Funds.A Fund may lend securitiesfrom its portfolios to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions.Securities loans must be continuously secured by cash or U.S.Government Securities with a market value, determined daily, atleast equal to the value of the Fund's securities loaned, includingaccrued interest. A Fund receives interest in respect of securitiesloans from the borrower or from investing cash collateral. A Fundmay pay fees to arrange the loans. No Fund will lend portfoliosecurities in excess of 33 1/3 percent of the value of the Fund'stotal assets. Reverse Repurchase Agreements- Balanced Funds, Fixed Income Funds. AFund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, transactionsin which the Fund sells a security and simultaneously commitsto repurchase that security from the buyer at an agreed upon priceon an agreed upon future date. The resale price in a reverse repurchaseagreement reflects a market rate of interest that is not relatedto the coupon rate or maturity of the sold security. For certaindemand agreements, there is no agreed upon repurchase date andinterest payments are calculated daily, often based upon the prevailingovernight repurchase rate. Because certain of the incidents ofownership of the security are retained by the Fund, reverse repurchaseagreements may be viewed as a form of borrowing by the Fund fromthe buyer, collateralized by the security sold by the Fund. AFund will use the proceeds of reverserepurchase agreements tofund redemptions or to make investments. In most cases these investmentseither mature or have a demand feature to resell to the issueron a date not later than the expiration of the agreement. Interestcosts on the money received in a reverse repurchase agreementmay exceed the return received on the investments made by theFund with those monies. Any significant commitment of a Fund'sassets to the reverse repurchase agreements will tend to increasethe volatility of the Fund's net asset value per share. When-Issued Securities and ForwardCommitments - All Funds. AFund may purchase fixed income securities on a "when-issued"or "forward commitment" basis. When these transactionsare negotiated, the price, which is generally expressed in yieldterms, is fixed at the time the commitment is made, but deliveryand payment for the securities take place at a later date. Normally,the settlement date occurs within 3 months after the transaction.During the period between a commitment and settlement, no paymentis made for the securities purchased and no interest on the securityaccrues to the purchaser. At the time a Fund makes a commitmentto purchase securities in this manner, the Fund immediately assumesthe risk of ownership, including price fluctuation. Failure bythe other party to deliver a security purchased by a Fund mayresult in a loss or a missed opportunity to make an alternativeinvestment. The use of when-issued transactionsand forward commitments enables a Fund to hedge against anticipatedchanges in interest rates and prices. If the Adviser or Schroderwere to forecast incorrectly the direction of interest rate movements,however, a Fund might be required to complete these transactionswhen the value of the security is lower than the price paid bythe Fund. Except for dollar-roll transactions, a Fund will notpurchase securities on a when-issued or forward commitment basisif, as a result, more than 15 percent (35 percent in the caseof Total Return Bond Fund) of the value of the Fund's total assetswould be committed to such transactions. When-issued securities and forwardcommitments may be sold prior to the settlement date, but theFunds purchase securities on a when-issued and forward commitmentbasis only with the intention of actually receiving the securities.When-issued securities may include bonds purchased on a "when,and if issued" basis under which the issuance of the securitiesdepends upon the occurrence of a subsequent event. Commitmentof a Fund's assets to the purchase of securities on a when-issuedor forward commitment basis will tend to increase the volatilityof the Fund's net asset value per share. Dollar Roll Transactions - BalancedFunds, Fixed Income Funds (except Ready Cash Investment Fund).A Fund may enter intodollar roll transactions wherein the Fund sells fixed income securities,typically mortgage-backed securities, and makes a commitment topurchase similar, but not identical, securities at a later datefrom the same party. Like a forward commitment, during the rollperiod no payment is made for the securities purchased and nointerest or principal payments on the security accrue to the purchaser,but the Fund assumes the risk of ownership. A Fund is compensatedfor entering into dollar roll transactions by the difference betweenthe current sales price and the forward price for the future purchase,as well as by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of theinitial sale. Like other when-issued securities or firm commitmentagreements, dollar roll transactions involve the risk that themarket value of the securities sold by the Fund may decline belowthe price at which a Fund is committed to purchase similar securities.In the event the buyer of securities under a dollar roll transactionbecomes insolvent, the Fund's use of the proceeds of the transactionmay be restricted pending a determination by the other party,or its trustee or receiver, whether to enforce the Fund's obligationto repurchase the securities. The Funds will engage in roll transactionsfor the purpose of acquiring securities for its portfolio andnot for investment leverage. Each Fund will limit its obligationson dollar roll transactions to 35 percent of the Fund's net assets. Swap AgreementsBalanced Funds, Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, Managed FixedIncome Fund, Stable Income Fund. Tomanage its exposure to different types of investments, a Fundmay enter into interest rate, currency and mortgage (or otherasset) swap agreements and may purchase and sell interest rate"caps," "floors" and "collars."In a typical interest rate swap agreement, one party agrees tomake regular payments equal to a floating interest rate on a specifiedamount (the "notional principalamount") in returnfor payments equal to a fixed interest rate on the same amountfor a specified period. If a swap agreement provides for paymentin different currencies, the parties may also agree to exchangethe notional principal amount. Mortgage swap agreements are similarto interest rate swap agreements, except that the notional principalamount is tied to a reference pool of mortgages. In a cap or floor,one party agrees, usually in return for a fee, to make paymentsunder particular circumstances. For example, the purchaser ofan interest rate cap has the right to receive payments to theextent a specified interest rate exceeds an agreed upon level;the purchaser of an interest rate floor has the right to receivepayments to the extent a specified interest rate falls below anagreed upon level. A collar entitles the purchaser to receivepayments to the extent a specified interest rate falls outsidean agreed upon range. Swap agreements may involve leverageand may be highly volatile; depending on how they are used, theymay have a considerable impact on the Fund's performance. See"Appendix A - Techniques Involving Leverage." Swap agreementsinvolve risks depending upon the counterparties creditworthinessand ability to perform as well as the Fund's ability to terminateits swap agreements or reduce its exposure through offsettingtransactions. The Adviser monitors the creditworthiness of counterpartiesto these transactions and intends to enter into these transactionsonly when they believe the counterparties present minimal creditrisks and the income expected to be earned from the transactionjustifies the attendant risks. Short Sales Intermediate U.S. GovernmentFund. The Fund is authorizedto make short sales of securities it owns or has the right toacquire at no added cost through conversion or exchange of othersecurities it owns(referred to as short sales "against thebox") and to make short sales of securities which it doesnot own or have the right to acquire. A short sale that is notmade "against the box" is a transaction in which a Fundsells a security it does not own in anticipation of a declinein the market price for the security. When the Fund makes a shortsale, the proceeds it receives are retained by the broker untilthe Fund replaces the borrowed security. In order to deliver thesecurity to the buyer, the Fund must arrange through a brokerto borrow the security and, in so doing, the Fund becomes obligatedto replace the security borrowed at its market price at the timeof replacement, whatever that price may be. Short sales that are not made"against the box" create opportunities to increase theFund's return but, at the same time, involve special risk considerationsand may be considered a speculative technique. Since the Fundin effect profits from a decline in the price of the securitiessold short without the need to invest the full purchase priceof the securities on the date of the short sale, the Fund's netasset value per share, will tend to increase more when the securitiesit has sold short decrease in value, and to decrease more whenthe securities it has sold short increase in value, than wouldotherwise be the case if it had not engaged in such short sales.Short sales theoretically involve unlimited loss potential, asthe market price of securities sold short may continuously increase,although a Fund may mitigate such losses by replacing the securitiessold short before the market price has increased significantly.Under adverse market conditions a Fund might have difficulty purchasingsecurities to meet its short sale delivery obligations and mighthave to sell portfolio securities to raise the capital necessaryto meet its short sale obligations at a time when fundamentalinvestment considerations would not favor those sales. See "AppendixA - Techniques Involving Leverage." If the Fund makes a short sale"against the box", the Fund would not immediately deliverthe securities sold and would not receive the proceeds from thesale. The seller is said to have a short position in the securitiessold until it delivers the securities sold, at which time it receivesthe proceeds of the sale. The Fund's decision to make a shortsale "against the box" may be a technique to hedge againstmarket risks when the Adviser believes that the price of a securitymay decline, causing a decline in the value of a security ownedby the Fund or a security convertible into or exchangeable forsuch security. In such case, any future losses in the Fund's longposition would be reduced by an offsetting future gain in theshort position. The Fund's ability to enter into short sales transactionsis limited by certain tax requirements. See "Dividends, Distributionsand Taxes" in the SAI. Mortgage-Backed Securities Fixed Income Funds, BalancedFunds. Mortgage-backedsecurities represent an interest in a pool of mortgages originatedby lenders such as commercial banks, savings associations andmortgage bankers and brokers. Mortgage-backed securities may beissued by governmental or government-related entities or by non-governmentalentities such as special purpose trusts created by banks, savingsassociations, private mortgage insurance companies or mortgagebankers. Interests in mortgage-backed securitiesdiffer from other forms of debt securities, which normally providefor periodic payment of interest in fixed amounts with principalpayments at maturity or on specified call dates. In contrast,mortgage-backed securities provide monthly payments which consistof interest and, in most cases, principal. In effect, these paymentsare a "pass-through" of the monthly payments made bythe individual borrowers on their mortgage loans, net of any feespaid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities or a mortgageloan servicer. Additional payments to holders of these securitiesare caused by prepayments resulting from the sale or foreclosureof the underlying property or refinancing of the underlying loans. Underlying Mortgages. Poolsof mortgages consist of whole mortgage loans or participationsin mortgage loans. The majority of these loans are made to purchasersof 1-4 family homes, but may be made to purchasers of mobile homesor other real estate interests. The terms and characteristicsof the mortgage instruments are generally uniform within a poolbut may vary among pools. For example, in addition to fixed-rate,fixed-term mortgages, the Fund may purchase pools of variablerate mortgages, growing equity mortgages, graduated payment mortgagesand other types. Mortgage servicers impose qualification standardsfor local lending institutions which originate mortgages for thepools as well as credit standards and underwriting criteria forindividual mortgages included in the pools. In addition, manymortgages included in pools are insured through private mortgageinsurance companies. Liquidity and Marketability.The market for mortgage-backedsecurities has expanded considerably in recent years. The sizeof the primary issuance market and active participation in thesecondary market by securities dealers and many types of investorsmake government and government-related pass-through pools highlyliquid. The recently introduced private conventional pools ofmortgages(pooled by commercial banks, savings and loan institutionsand others, with no relationship with government and government-relatedentities) have also achieved broad market acceptance and consequentlyan active secondary market has emerged. However, the market forconventional pools is smaller and less liquid than the marketfor government and government-related mortgage pools. Average Life and Prepayments.The average life ofa pass-through pool varies with the maturities of the underlyingmortgage instruments. In addition, a pool's terms may be shortenedby unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest onthe underlying mortgages. Prepayments with respect to securitiesduring times of declining interest rates will tend to lower thereturn of a Fund and may even result in losses to a Fund if thesecurities were acquired at a premium. The occurrence of mortgageprepayments is affected by various factors including the levelof interest rates, general economic conditions, the location andage of the mortgage and other social and demographic conditions. As prepayment rates of individualpools vary widely, it is not possible to accurately predict theaverage life of a particular pool. For pools of fixed-rate 30-yearmortgages, common industry practice is to assume that prepaymentswill result in a 12-year average life. Pools of mortgages withother maturities or different characteristics will have varyingassumptions for average life. The assumed average life of poolsof mortgages having terms of less than 30 years is less than 12years, but typically not less than5 years. Yield Calculations. Yieldson pass-through securities are typically quoted by investmentdealers based on the maturity of the underlying instruments andthe associated average life assumption. In periods of fallinginterest rates, the rate of prepayment tends to increase, therebyshortening the actual average life of a pool of mortgages. Conversely,in periods of rising rates, the rate of prepayment tends to decrease,thereby lengthening the actual average life of the pool. Actualprepayment experience may cause the yield to differ from the assumedaverage life yield. Reinvestment of prepayments may occur at higheror lower interest rates than the original investment, thus affectingthe yield of a Fund. Government and Government-RelatedGuarantors. The principalgovernment guarantor of mortgage-backed securities is the GovernmentNational Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), a wholly-ownedUnited States Government corporation within the Department ofHousing and Urban Development. GNMA is authorized to guarantee,with the full faith and credit of the United States Government,the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issuedby institutions approved by GNMA and backed by pools of FHA-insuredor VA-guaranteed mortgages. The Federal National MortgageAssociation ("FNMA") is a government-sponsored corporationowned entirely by private stockholders that is subject to generalregulation by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.FNMA purchases residential mortgages from a list of approved seller-servicers.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC")is a corporate instrumentality of the United States Governmentthat was created by Congress in 1970 for the purpose of increasingthe availability of mortgage credit for residential housing. Itsstock is owned by the twelve Federal Home Loan Banks. FHLMC issuesParticipation Certificates ("PCs") which represent interestsin mortgages from FHLMC's national portfolio. FNMA and FHLMC eachguarantee the payment of principal and interest on the securitiesthey issue. These securities, however, are not backed by the fullfaith and credit of the United States Government. Privately Issued Mortgage-BackedSecurities. Mortgage-backedsecurities offered by private issuers include pass-through securitiescomprised of pools of conventional mortgage loans; mortgage-backedbonds which are considered to be debt obligations of the institutionissuing the bonds and which are collateralized by mortgage loans;and collateralized mortgage obligations. Mortgage-backed securities issuedby non-governmental issuers may offer a higher rate of interestthan securities issued by government issuers because of the absenceof direct or indirect government guarantees of payment. Many non-governmentalissuers or servicers of mortgage-backed securities, however, guaranteetimely payment of interest and principal on such securities. Timelypayment of interest and principal may also be supported by variousforms of insurance, including individual loan, title, pool andhazard policies. There can be no assurance that the private issuersor insurers will be able to meet their obligations under the relevantguarantees and insurance policies. Adjustable Rate Mortgage-BackedSecurities. Adjustablerate mortgage-backed securities ("ARMs") are securitiesthat have interest rates that are reset at periodic intervals,usually by reference to some interest rate index or market interestrate. Although the rate adjustment feature may act as a bufferto reduce sharp changes in the value of adjustable rate securities,these securities are still subject to changes in value based onchanges in market interest rates or changes in the issuer's creditworthiness.Because of the resetting of interest rates, adjustable rate securitiesare less likely than non-adjustable rate securities of comparablequality and maturity to increase significantly in value when marketinterest rates fall. Also, most adjustable rate securities (orthe underlying mortgages) are subject to caps or floors. "Caps"limit the maximum amount by which the interest rate paid by theborrower may change at each reset date or over the life of theloan and, accordingly, fluctuation in interest rates above theselevels could cause such mortgage securities to "cap out"and to behave more like long-term, fixed-rate debt securities. ARMs may have less risk of a declinein value during periods of rapidly rising rates, but they mayalso have less potential for capital appreciation than other debtsecurities of comparable maturities due to the periodic adjustmentof the interest rate on the underlying mortgages and due to thelikelihood of increased prepayments of mortgages as interest ratesdecline. Furthermore, during periods of declining interest rates,income to a Fund will decrease as the coupon rate resets to reflectthe decline in interest rates. During periods of rising interestrates, changes in the coupon rates of the mortgages underlyinga Fund's ARMs may lag behind changes in market interest rates.This may result in a slightly lower net value until the interestrate resets to market rates. Thus, investors could suffer someprincipal loss if they sold Fund Shares before the interest rateson the underlying mortgages were adjusted to reflect current marketrates. Collateralized Mortgage Obligations.Collateralized MortgageObligations ("CMOs") are debt obligations that are collateralizedby mortgages or mortgage pass-through securities issued by GNMA,FHLMC or FNMA or by poolsof conventional mortgages ("Mortgage Assets"). CMOsmay be privately issued or U.S. Government Securities. Paymentsof principal and interest on the Mortgage Assets are passed throughto the holders of the CMOs on the same schedule as they are received,although, certain classes (often referred to as tranches) of CMOshave priority over other classes with respect to the receipt ofpayments. Multi-class mortgage pass-through securities are interestsin trusts that hold Mortgage Assets and that have multiple classessimilar to those of CMOs. Unless the context indicates otherwise,references to CMOs include multi-class mortgage pass-through securities.Payments of principal of and interest on the underlying MortgageAssets (and in the case of CMOs, any reinvestment income thereon)provide funds to pay debt service on the CMOs or to make scheduleddistributions on the multi-class mortgage pass-through securities.Parallel pay CMOs are structured to provide payments of principalon each payment date to more than one class. These simultaneouspayments are taken into account in calculating the stated maturitydate or final distribution date of each class, which, as withother CMO structures, must be retired by its stated maturity dateor final distribution date but may be retired earlier. Plannedamortization class mortgage-based securities("PAC Bonds")are a form of parallel pay CMO. PAC Bonds are designed to providerelatively predictable payments of principal provided that, amongother things, the actual prepayment experience on the underlyingmortgage loans falls within a contemplated range. If the actualprepayment experience on the underlying mortgage loans is at arate faster or slower than the contemplated range, or if deviationsfrom other assumptions occur, principal payments on a PAC Bondmay be greater or smaller than predicted. The magnitude of thecontemplated range varies from one PAC Bond to another; a narrowerrange increases the risk that prepayments will be greater or smallerthan contemplated. CMOs may have complicated structures and generallyinvolve more risks than simpler forms of mortgage- backed securities. The final tranche of a CMO maybe structured as an accrual bond (sometimes referred to as a Z-tranche).Holders of accrual bonds receive no cash payments for an extendedperiod of time. During the time that earlier tranches are outstanding,accrual bonds receive accrued interest which is a credit for periodicinterest payments that increases the face amount of the securityat a compounded rate, but is not paid to the bond holder. Afterall previous tranches are retired, accrual bond holders startreceiving cash payments that include both principal and continuinginterest. The market value of accrual bonds can fluctuate widelyand their average life depends on the other aspects of the CMOoffering. Interest on accrual bonds is taxable when accrued eventhough the holders receive no accrual payment. The Funds distributeall of their net investment income, and may have to sell portfoliosecurities to distribute imputed income, which may occur at atime when the Adviser would not have chosen to sell such securitiesand which may result in a taxable gain or loss. Stripped Mortgage-Backed Securities.Stripped mortgage-backedsecurities are classes of mortgage-backed securities that receivedifferent proportions of the interest and principal distributionsfrom the underlying Mortgage Assets. They may be may be privatelyissued or U.S. Government Securities. In the most extreme case,one class will be entitled to receive all or a portion of theinterest but none of the principal from the Mortgage Assets (theinterest-only or "IO" class) and one class will be entitledto receive all or a portion of the principal, but none of theinterest (the "PO" class). Currently, no fund may purchaseIOs or POs. Asset-Backed Securities Balanced Funds, IntermediateU.S. Government Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund, Ready Cash InvestmentFund. Asset-backedsecurities represent direct or indirect participations in, orare secured by and payable from, assets other than mortgage-backedassets such as motor vehicle installment sales contracts, installmentloan contracts, leases of various types of real and personal propertyand receivables from revolving credit (credit card) agreements.No Fund may invest more than 10 percent of its net assets in asset-backedsecurities that are backed by a particular type of credit, forinstance, credit card receivables. Asset-backed securities, includingadjustable rate asset-backed securities, have yield characteristicssimilar to those of mortgage-backed securities and, accordingly,are subject to many of the same risks. Assets are securitized throughthe use of trusts and special purpose corporations that issuesecurities that are often backed by a pool of assets representingthe obligations of a number of different parties. Payments ofprincipal and interest may be guaranteed up to certain amountsand for a certain time period by a letter of credit issued bya financial institution. Asset-backed securities do not alwayshave the benefit of a security interest in collateral comparableto the security interests associated with mortgage-backed securities.As a result, the risk that recovery on repossessed collateralmight be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on asset-backedsecurities is greater for asset-backed securities than for mortgage-backedsecurities. In addition, because asset-backed securities are relativelynew, the market experience in these securities is limited andthe market's ability to sustain liquidity through all phases ofan interest rate or economic cycle has not been tested. Foreign Exchange Contractsand Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Small Company Growth Fund, LargeCompany Growth Fund, International Fund, Balanced Funds, ManagedFixed Income Fund. Changesin foreign currency exchange rates will affect the U.S. dollarvalues of securities denominated in currencies other than theU.S. dollar. The rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar andother currencies fluctuates in response to forces of supply anddemand in the foreign exchange markets. These forces are affectedby the international balance of payments and other economic andfinancial conditions, government intervention, speculation andother factors. When investing in foreign securities a Fund usuallyeffects currency exchange transactions on a spot(i.e., cash) basisat the spot rate prevailing in the foreign exchange market. TheFund incurs foreign exchange expenses in converting assets fromone currency to another. A Fund may enter into foreigncurrency forward contracts or currency futures or options contractsfor the purchase or sale of foreign currency to "lock in"the U.S. dollar price of the securities denominated in a foreigncurrency or the U.S. dollar value of interest and dividends tobe paid on such securities, or to hedge against the possibilitythat the currency of a foreign country in which a Fund has investmentsmay suffer a decline against the U.S. dollar. The Funds have nopresent intention to enter into currency futures or options contractsbut may do so in the future. A forward currency contract is anobligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a futuredate, which may be any fixed number of days from the date of thecontract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the timeof the contract. This method of attempting to hedge the valueof a Fund's portfolio securities against a decline in the valueof a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the underlyingprices of the securities. Although the strategy of engaging inforeign currency transactions could reduce the risk of loss dueto a decline in the value of the hedged currency, it could alsolimit the potential gain from an increase in the value of thecurrency. The Funds do not intend to maintain a net exposure tosuch contracts where the fulfillment of the Fund's obligationsunder such contracts would obligate the Fund to deliver an amountof foreign currency in excess of the value of the Fund's portfoliosecurities or other assets denominated in that currency. A Fundwill not enter into these contracts for speculative purposes andwill not enter into non-hedging currency contracts. These contractsinvolve a risk of loss if the Adviser fails to predict currencyvalues correctly. Futures Contracts andOptions Balanced Funds, IntermediateU.S. Government Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund, Stable IncomeFund, Index Fund. AFund may seek to enhance its return through the writing (selling)and purchasing of exchange-traded and over-the-counter optionson fixed income securities or indices. A Fund may also to attemptto hedge against a decline in the value of securities owned byit or an increase in the price of securities which it plans topurchase through the use of those options and the purchase andsale of interest rate futures contracts and options on those futurescontracts. A Fund may only write options that are covered. Anoption is covered if, so long as the Fund is obligated under theoption, it owns an offsetting position in the underlying securityor futures contract or maintains cash, U.S. Government Securitiesor other liquid, high-grade debt securities in a segregated accountwith a value at all times sufficient to cover the Fund's obligationunder the option. Certain futures strategies employed by a BalancedFund in making temporary allocations may not be deemed to be forbona fide hedging purposes, as defined by the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission. A Fund may enter intothese futures contractsonly if the aggregate of initial margin deposits for open futurescontract positions does not exceed 5 percent of the Fund's totalassets. Risk Considerations. TheFund's use of options and futures contracts subjects the Fundto certain investment risks and transaction costs to which itmight not otherwise be subject. These risks include: (1) dependenceon the Adviser's ability to predict movements in the prices ofindividual securities and fluctuations in the general securitiesmarkets; (2) imperfect correlations between movements in the pricesof options or futures contracts and movements in the price ofthe securities hedged or used for cover which may cause a givenhedge not to achieve its objective; (3) the fact that the skillsand techniques needed to trade these instruments are differentfrom those needed to select the other securities in which theFund invests; (4) lack of assurance that a liquid secondary marketwill exist for any particular instrument at any particular time,which, among other things, may hinder a Fund's ability to limitexposures by closing its positions; (5) the possible need to deferclosing out of certain options, futures contracts and relatedoptions to avoid adverse tax consequences; and (6) the potentialfor unlimited loss when investing in futures contracts or writingoptions for which an offsetting position is not held. Other risks include the inabilityof the Fund, as the writer of covered call options, to benefitfrom any appreciation of the underlying securities above the exerciseprice and the possible loss of the entire premium paid for optionspurchased by the Fund. In addition, the futures exchanges maylimit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contractprices during a single trading day. A Fund may be forced, therefore,to liquidate or close out a futures contract position at a disadvantageousprice. There can be no assurance thata liquid market will exist at a time when a Fund seeks to closeout a futures position or that a counterparty in an over-the-counteroption transaction will be able to per-form its obligations. Thereare a limited number of options on interest rate futures contractsand exchange traded options contracts on fixed income securities.Accordingly, hedging transactions involving these instrumentsmay entail "cross-hedging." As an example, a Fund maywish to hedge existing holdings of mortgage-backed securities,but no listed options may exist on those securities. In that event,the Adviser may attempt to hedge the Fund's securities by theuse of options with respect to similar fixed income securities.The Fund may use various futures contracts that are relativelynew instruments without a significant trading history. As a result,there can be no assurance that an active secondary market in thosecontracts will develop or continue to exist. Limitations. Exceptfor the futures contracts strategies of the Balanced Funds usedfor making temporary allocations among fixed-income and equitysecurities, the Funds have no current intention of investing infutures contracts and options thereon for purposes other thanhedging. No Fund may purchase any call or put option on a futurescontract if the premiums associated with all such options heldby the Fund would exceed 5 percent of the Fund's total assetsas of the date the option is purchased. No Fund may sell a putoption if the exercise value of all put options written by theFund would exceed 50 percent of the Fund's total assets or sella call option if the exercise value of all call options writtenby the Fund would exceed the value of the Fund's assets. In addition,the current market value of all open futures positions held bya Fund will not exceed 50 percent of its total assets. Options on Securities. Acall option is a contract pursuant to which the purchaser of thecall option, in return for a premium paid, has the right to buythe security underlying the option at a specified exercise priceat any time during the term of the option. The writer of the calloption, who receives the premium, has the obligation upon exerciseof the option to deliver the underlying security against paymentof the exercise price during the option period. A put option givesits purchaser, in return for a premium, the right to sell theunderlying security at a specified price during the term of theoption. The writer of the put, who receives the premium, has theobligation to buy the underlying security, upon exercise at theexercise price during the option period. The amount of premiumreceived or paid is based upon certain factors, including themarket price of the underlying security or index, the relationshipof the exercise price to the market price, the historical pricevolatility of the underlying security or index, the option period,supply and demand and interest rates. Options on Stock Indices. Astock index assigns relative values to the stock included in theindex, and the index fluctuates with changes in the market valuesof the stocks included in the index. Stock index options operatein the same way as the more traditional stock options except thatexercises of stock index options are effected with cash paymentsand do not involve delivery of securities. Thus, upon exerciseof stock index options, the purchaser will realize and the writerwill pay an amount based on the differences between the exerciseprice and the closing price of the stock index. Index Futures Contracts. Bondand stock index futures contracts are bilateral agreements pursuanttowhich two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amountof cash equal to a specified dollar amount times the differencebetween the bond or stock index value at the close of tradingof the contract and the price at which the futures contract isoriginally struck. No physical delivery of the securities comprisingthe index is made. Generally, these futures contracts are closedout prior to the expiration date of the contract. Options on Futures Contracts.Options on futurescontracts are similar to stock options except that an option ona futures contract gives the purchaser the right, in return forthe premium paid, to assume a position in a futures contract ratherthan to purchase or sell stock, at a specified exercise priceat anytime during the period of the option. Upon exercise of theoption, the delivery of the futures position to the holder ofthe option will be accompanied by transfer to the holder of anaccumulated balance representing the amount by which the marketprice of the futures contract exceeds, in the case of a call,or is less than, in the case of a put, the exercise price of theoption on the future.

Avg. Performance Highlights The government money market yield curve (yields on securities with maturities of up to 1 year) flattened during the fourth quarter -- yields on 3 and 6-month Treasury bills rose, while the yield on 1-year bills declined by 20 basis points. During December, short Treasury notes traded more attractively relative to Treasury bills. The maturity of December cash management bills forced additional money into the market. This increased the demand for 6-month and 1-year Treasury bills as investors attempted to reinvest the proceeds from cash management bills, thus lowering their yield and making them less attractive. During the quarter, the Fund's assets grew by $84 million. At 2 days longer, its average maturity stayed pretty much the same as at the previous quarter-end.

Inflation fears were rekindled when a lower than expected trade deficit, coupled with consumer spending that exceeded expectations, led to an upward revision in fourth quarter GDP. The Fund performed well during 1996, in line with its benchmark. During December, however, the Fund's performance lagged its benchmark's by 5 basis points. Using cash proceeds, we purchased a LIBOR-based (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) floating rate note into the Fund during December. With yield spreads tightening across all market sectors, we are continuing to focus on purchasing securities which represent the best relative values. With a targeted duration of 1 year, the Fund continues to provide a yield that is higher than its benchmark's. The Fund's credit quality remains excellent, averaging 'AAA'.

Its return ranked it near the top third of its Lipper peers for 1996, with a return that was 1.4% higher than that of the average fund in the Equity Income Funds group. The best performing sectors for the Fund during the fourth quarter were consumer staples, energy and finance. Leading the way for consumer staples were the tobacco stocks that advanced on an improving environment regarding political litigation. The energy group benefited from higher oil and gas prices, while our finance stocks fared well upon anticipation of stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings. The Fund's fourth quarter performance trailed that of the S&P 500 Index. The major culprits were the Fund's consumer cyclicals, technology and health care stocks. Retailers, who count on the holiday shopping season for most of their annual sales, reported only mediocre sales increases over 1995. Even though we believe that our technology and health care stocks have promising long-term prospects, they produced modest returns during the quarter because of short-term concerns. The fundamentals of the Fund continue to compare very favorably with the market indicating positive prospects going forward. In addition, its long-term performance continues to be very competitive.

Avg. Performance Highlights The government money market yield curve (yields on securities with maturities of up to 1 year) flattened during the fourth quarter -- yields on 3 and 6-month Treasury bills rose, while the yield on 1-year bills declined by 20 basis points. During the quarter, short agency paper continued to be attractively valued versus Treasury bills, offering a yield pick up in excess of 20 basis points. Overnight government repurchase rates were relatively high during December, trading near the Federal Funds rate. This was particularly so on the last day of the year, when year-end borrowing pressures forced overnight repurchase rates above 7%. During the quarter, we shortened the Fund's average maturity and built liquidity because we often experience redemptions during December. This did not negatively impact the Fund's yield, however, because repurchase rates were as high as they were.

This uncertainty about the magnitude of economic growth hurt certain sectors of the Fund, which is heavily weighted in cyclical stocks. The Fund's retail stocks, including Wal-Mart, the Limited and Dillard Department Stores, were hit hardest as investors pondered whether heavy debt burdens will slow consumer spending in 1997. The Fund's basic industry stocks (steel, aluminum, chemical, paper) were negatively impacted this quarter as investors contemplated economically sensitive demand levels for 1997. Still trading at extremely low valuation levels, the Fund's stocks should outperform in the coming months as investors, with renewed confidence in the economy, again start buying economically sensitive stocks. During December, we eliminated our position in AAR Corporation, as this stock reached its predetermined sell price. We did not add any new names to the Fund during the month.

Concerns that foreign demand for Treasury bonds was drying up also negatively impacted bond prices during the fourth quarter.

Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Greenspan, and rumors of reduced foreign buying caused interest rates to move higher during December. Even though the Fund's shorter-than-benchmark strategy benefited from rising rates in December, the cumulative underperformance for the quarter still reflected the general decline in rates since September 30. The Fund's management strategy has worked well for the year, however, with the Fund ranking in the top half of its Lipper peers. As the bond market rallied early in the fourth quarter, we shortened the duration of the Fund slightly. At this point in the business cycle, the Fund is still focused on protecting principal with a duration strategy that is shorter than its benchmark.

Its annual return placed it in the top 15% of its Lipper Growth Fund peer group of 669 mutual funds. The stock market turned in a very impressive year. In particular, growth stocks performed very well as their earnings stood out amidst moderating profits for the average company. As a pure growth style, the Fund participated fully in the growth stock leadership. Portfolio companies demonstrated their superior fundamental characteristics. Average annual earnings gains of 23% for the Fund's stocks far exceeded the 6%-8% earnings gains for the S&P 500 Index. The performance leaders during the year included Intel, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, Coca-Cola and LM Ericcson.

Performance Highlights The Fund performed well during 1996, outperforming its benchmark and ranking in the top half of its Lipper Small Company Growth Funds peer group for the year. During 1996, small company stocks materially underperformed large company stocks. In general, small value stocks outperformed small growth stocks. The Fund's fourth quarter results reflected the sharp performance divergence between small cap growth and value stocks. The Russell 2000 Value Index rose 10% while its Growth Index was flat, paralleling the Fund's Overlooked/ Discovery results during the quarter. The Fund's energy-related holdings and selected technology stocks, however, performed very well. As we enter the new year, we believe that interest in small company stocks will grow as investors seek out those stocks whose appreciation prospects are still bright and which have yet to reach the higher valuations already attained by large cap stocks. The Fund is positioned favorably relative to the overall market and possesses potential for dramatic gains. The Fund's current holdings are expected to grow earnings at 24% per year compared to single digits for the general market (S&P 500 Index), and are valued at only 16x 1997 earnings, well below the 18x P/E accorded the market.

Volatility was a prevalent factor, however, with yields fluctuating within a 60 basis point trading range. During the quarter, we increased the Fund's investment in Treasury notes by 8% to 74%. We reduced our holding in the agency note sector to 5% as the spreads had become too tight to compensate for the lower liquidity in that market.

Most of this decline came from the Far East. The Hong Kong stock market fell 0.5%; despite this, we believe that it still offers some attractive buying opportunities and added Wharf Holdings Ltd. to the Fund. The emerging Asian countries that continue to disappoint include Korea and Thailand where December declines were 12.7% and 11.6%, respectively. Japan slipped again during December, falling 6.9%. Disappointing corporate earnings and rising taxes caused much of the weakness. We continue to expect the rate of corporate profit growth in Japan to be among the best of the developed markets in 1997, which should help the relative performance of the market. Shares in Continental Europe remained strong as countries continued to keep a tight leash on monetary and fiscal policies in their on-going efforts to satisfy stringent European Monetary Union requirements. The Netherlands rose 2.6% during December, France gained 1.0% and the United Kingdom advanced 3.5%. We restructured a portion of our portfolio by selling Sphinx, a Netherlands manufacturer of furnishings and fittings and CS Holdings, a Swiss financial company, while adding SAP AG, a German software developer.

Performance Highlights After several months of underperformance, small company stocks outperformed large company holdings in December, though they ended up underperforming for the year as a whole. For the month of December, health care, consumer staples, financial services and energy were the best performing sectors of the market. Managed care providers such as Compdent and Healthsource were strong performers after significant weakness earlier in the quarter. Consumer staples stocks performed well as investors fled retailers and other cyclicals in favor of more conservative consumer stocks. Financial stocks, like Walden Bancorp, UST Corp. and Banknorth Group, outperformed in the month as earnings estimates were revised upward and merger and acquisition activity continued. Energy stocks continued to outperform the market; this category was the best performing sector for the year with a strong 76% return. Our overweight position in the group added to the Fund's performance during the year. The weakest performing sectors were utilities, consumer discretionary and technology. The Fund has no exposure to utilities. We are overweight, however, in consumer discretionary stocks, which impacted performance during December. Looking forward to 1997, we are optimistic about the prospects for smaller company stocks. We believe that many small companies offer more attractive investment opportunities than larger companies based on both valuation and growth rates.

Its return matched that of its Lipper peer group average for December and has ranked it within the top 15% of its peers for the quarter, the year and the last 3 years. No major changes in average maturity or duration were made during December. The Fund continues to maintain about a 17 year average maturity and a duration slightly under 8 years. The portfolio has a high credit quality profile with 75% rated AA or better. Recent changes in the Fund focused on structure, particularly in improving call protection. While analyzing the performance of various sectors of the Fund, it is clear that the best performance came from lower quality holdings. This was true during December and for the year as a whole. This is explained by the fact that interest rates moved in no clear direction but within a fairly narrow trading range throughout the year. Furthermore, interest rates were relatively low, while investors were desirous of higher yields, thereby raising the demand for lower quality holdings and causing quality spreads to narrow. This benefited the price of lower quality issues.

The Fund ranked in the top 10% of this group for the year. New issue supply in the municipal bond market increased a great deal after election day, because a number of bond elections were passed by the voters of various cities and school districts. Because net admissions into the Fund were minimal during the quarter, only a couple of new names were added to the Fund. We made no major changes in the Fund during the last three months. Longer duration and lower credit quality holdings were the best performing assets in the Fund during the fourth quarter. Cash equivalents and mortgage revenue bonds were the worst performing sectors.

Yields along the municipal money market yield curve (maturities up to 1 year) declined by 10-15 basis points in the short end of the curve and by 25-30 basis points in the 1-year area. Yields within the variable rate sector of the municipal market remained relatively unchanged throughout the majority of the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, the Fund's assets increased by $60 million. Its yield increased 19 basis points, while its average maturity decreased by 21 days to 54 days.

Well, on the line with us is Michael Jackson PR man Willie Buyit. Thanks for joining us! WB: Oh, no, no, no, no...it's my pleasure. Announcer: My, Buyit, how do you respond to those who feel that this media blitz is a desperate move by Mr. Jackson to win back fans? WB: Oh, well...I think it's completely unfounded. After all, Michael Jackson is the King of Pop. And I'd like you to refer to him as such for the rest of the interview, if you don't mind. He doesn't have to sink that low. Announcer: He doesn't? WB: No! The big media blitz is a gesture on Michael's part to show his millions of fans that he really loves all (giggle) their millions! (snicker) Announcer: What?! WB: Them! He loves all of them! (bigger laugh) He's really a very warm, sensitive man...(giggle) You can see that reflected in what the plastic surgeons left of his face! (laugh) Announcer: I beg your pardon?

This is the only serious stuff on this page. The rest is pure sarcasm. :) Eliza Nicole Lawrence was born on July 22nd, 1995 at 8:09 AM, after only 3 contractions. Wendy had asked for and received the one thing she missed out on when she gave birth to our other daughter, Madison Erica, two and a half years earlier...an epidural. 4 hours later, the neonatologist informed us that they were transferring Eliza to St. Agnes' Neonatal ICU up in Baltimore. She was having problems regulating her glucose levels. Here she is in her isolette, leads and IV's everywhere. What a trooper. While Wendy was in the hospital over the weekend, I went to the NICU to visit Eliza. I was able to hold her hand through an access port in her isolette. The nurses and doctors and the NICU are terrific...they told us things, putting our minds at ease, whereas others in the process didn't. It turns out that about 30% of infants born slightly premature and larger than normal have a bit of a problem adjusting their glucose levels. An IV drip that was lessened and eventually removed corrected this imbalance. We went to St. Agnes every day to feed her and watch the staff do there work. After every feeding, they'd do a "chem strip" test to make sure that Eliza was maintaining her glucose levels between accepted norms. Once she was able to do that without the drip, she was started on heavier feedings, and eventually was able to go a full 24 hours without dropping below the minumum. We got a chance to hold her a lot, and the nurses kept telling us how great she was doing. This kept us from becoming basket cases. We finally got to bring her home three days after the ordeal began. Wendy got to ride in the back seat all the way home, scrunched between Eliza's car seat and Madison's. Stitches and cramps and all, I don't think there's any place else she would have wanted to be. OK...enough seriousness... Life began for me on September 20th, 1958 at 8:35 PM. I was born in the exact bed as my mother was 20 years earlier at Cleveland's famed Polyclinic Hospital, and I recall my mother complaining that they still hadn't changed the sheets. Here, my father pauses to admire my Fatty Arbuckle impression before heading down to Dermatology to have his hands surgically separated. My brother and I loved to read. We especially like to read with 3D glasses on, even if the books weren't in 3D. I miss those incredible headaches to this day. I remember my mother placing me on the counter at the Tobin Page drug store on Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland, where I would show off and read the stock quotes from the Plain Dealer for lollipops and the occasional raw fish. If you look closely, you will see the very top of the National Lampoon tucked away inside our Mighty Mouse comic. Now, *that* kept our attention. The Yarnells were my parents best friends. They had a TV, and we had a basement that often flooded in those harsh Cleveland Heights springtime thaws. Dave Yarnell, may he rest in peace, was constantly at Thistledown, betting the trifecta, leaving Betty in charge of raising Brucie, Marcie, Tracie and Stacie. Years later, at Stacie's shotgun wedding, Brucie would approach me. "Anything you need, you let me or Anthony know." Anthony cautioned me not to refer to him as 'Brucie' any longer, if I valued being able to speak on the radio. The air in Cleveland was OK, I guess. I never really found out. One morning, I took off on my tricycle from East 105th and Euclid and headed downtown. Got through Collinwood, Hough, and was almost to East 30th when a policeman stopped me. "I'm going to see my mom where she works at Sterling Lindner," I said brightly. He chided me for not wearing a mask so far from home, handed me a spare from the trunk of his cruiser, and patted my head. He then drove away. By the time I got to Sterling Lindner, it was past closing time. A kindly lady in a very short skirt was standing in front of the store. She and her supervisor, Mr. Smith, took time out of their busy work night to return me safely at home. Harold and I had paper routes. He delivered the Plain Dealer, and I delivered the Press. Here is a rare shot of me actually selling the papers, as opposed to sitting on the top stairs of the apartment buildings on Mayfield Road. It was there that I would try my first Swisher Sweet cigar, and it was there that I would first throw up in public. I actually won a trip to Six Gun Territory in Orlando one year for increasing my route by 10 customers. The older carriers who would canvas the neighborhood for new customers, stealing them from the younger boys who actually had routes there, all became strangely ill after a party I held. Mom was right...after a hint or two that it was spiked, they *did* drink the special punch. Cousin Donna. I really don't want to talk about it here. Growing up, the theater was always a big part of my life, especially the joy of standing in line for popcorn and Goobers. My mother used to take our family to the movies, and then sneak out in the middle of the first reel. After six or seven years of this, we all began to suspect that something was up. Here, my sister Elaine tries to stop my mother from sneaking out yet again. That's me in the upper right, hoping to hell that Raquel Welch's top falls off, *just* for a moment, in 3-D. This was taken several days befor my own hand separation surgery. My very first girlfriend, Mary Nachtman. I brought her home to meet my parents, and there was my dad, sitting at the dining room table, shirtless, filling out his driving logs. "Want a sandwich or a beer?" he asked Mary. "No, thank you," she replied. "How about a punch in the mouth?" he joked. "Take me home," she demanded. She would later enter the convent, muttering all the while and claiming she was saying the Rosary whenever someone noticed. Prom night, 1976. Mike Curry and his date, John Bailey and his date, and I and my date all board the bus to the Iron Gate for dinner. Surf and turf had just topped $15 and I was ready. The waitress kept calling me Toots. I had an great time that night with my girlfriend, Fawn Archambault, and later, she would surprise me by spending time in my back seat with John Rego. And Milo Swanson. And every other boy in the senior class except Brian Uveges, since he wasn't there. She was too tired to go to Cedar Point the next day. I went to Ohio State, and majored in both Computer and Information Science and Broadcast Communications. I also learned that the best friends you'll ever have are the ones you have when you're stealing underwear from the women. The Stadium Dorm is far and away the best place on campus to live, and if it wasn't for being caught in the Unit D utility room in a comprimising position with Arlene Wichter, I might have stayed there for longer than just one year. Here, the boys of Unit V display the catch of the day. My first program director, E. Karl, offering me some pointers. At WNCI, they had unusual motivational techniques. Along with being on the radio, I also was the DJ at a swanky private nightclub in Upper Arlington called Whisper. We used to have incredibly exciting dance competitions, and the crowds (shown here) would clamor for a good seat. It was here that my reputation as a club DJ led to the first of several Billboard DJ of the year awards, as well as several treatable communicable diseases. I still have most of the 12 inch records from my nightclub career, and someday, I'll find a couple of Technics SL-MKII turntables, a GLI mixer, a JBL amp and some Klipsch speakers, and really piss off my neighbors. Me and my first wife, Kim. We were married for one year to the day. It was just too hard to balance everything, so we just dropped it. My sister Elaine is actually much prettier than it looks here. She always would come to the openings of the clubs I played at and the events that the radio stations would hold. She's a hair designer, and, as you can see, she's also a fairly competent HVAC engineer. Unfortunately, this well-intentioned attempt at marrying the two passions in her life failed to gel properly. If there was anything in life I wish I had done, it was to be a member of America's Dream Team, the LA Thunderbirds. In the world of Danny Reilly, Ronnie Rains and #747, Big Mama, the circular battlefield of roller derby is poised to make a comeback. You mark my words. And maybe, just maybe, I'll be the one wearing the helmet, getting whipped from the jam, screaming around the track and hipchecking my way to a clean score. And just as I touch my hands to my hips to signal the end of the jam, a chair will come flying through the air. They'll go to a commercial, then come back to see if I'm still alive. Man, that's living. [Home] [Radio] [Computers] [Press1*Press2] [OnLine Today] [Web Design] [Personal] [Mail] All contents copyright ©1995 David Lawrence. Comments?

General 1.1 The America Online Service ("AOL Service"), operated by America Online, Inc. ("AOL Inc."), is a computer online, interactive information, communication and transaction service. The AOL Service is available to an authorized member (hereinafter referred to as "Member," "Members," when used collectively or "You") through a personal membership account ("Membership"); it is accessible through a personal computer, or other access device, using AOL Software (e.g. the software used to connect to the AOL Service) and a communications connection (e.g., modem, telephone line). 1.2 Please read this document carefully. Please also read the "Rules of the Road." This document, the Rules of the Road, and the "Membership Conditions" (which You saw when You first signed on) are all of the applicable AOL Service rules. (They collectively comprise the contract between AOL Inc. and Members and are collectively referred to as the "Terms of Service" or "TOS"). You can view all of these documents on the AOL Service at any time free of charge in the "Members' Online Support" department located within the "Member's Services" Area. 1.3 BY COMPLETING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND USING THE AOL SERVICE AND AOL SOFTWARE (OTHER THAN TO READ THE TOS AGREEMENT AND THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR THE FIRST TIME), YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE, JUST AS IF YOU HAD SIGNED THIS AGREEMENT. If You do not wish to be bound by our TOS, You may not continue to use the AOL Service and AOL Software. In that case, You should immediately terminate your Membership account and You are prohibited from using AOL Software. 1.4 AOL Inc. may modify its TOS at any time and in any manner. Any modification is effective immediately upon either a posting on the AOL Service, electronic mail, or conventional mail. If any modification to the TOS is unacceptable to You, You may immediately terminate your Membership as provided in Section 8 below. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE AOL SERVICE FOLLOWING MODIFICATION TO THE TOS SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED AS ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH MODIFICATION. 1.5 The Terms of Service Agreement, Rules of the Road and the Membership Conditions together constitute the entire and only agreement between AOL Inc. and Member with respect to the AOL Service and AOL Software. AOL Inc. may discontinue or alter any aspect of the AOL Service, including, but not limited to, (i) restricting the time of availability, (ii) restricting the availability and/or scope of the AOL Service for certain platforms (i.e., computer types and operating systems), (iii) restricting the amount of use permitted, and (iv) restricting or terminating any Member's right to use the AOL Service, at AOL Inc.'s sole discretion and without prior notice or liability. AOL Inc. reserves the right to change or add any fees or surcharges at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' prior notice. 2. Member Responsibilities 2.1 Connect Charges. Member is responsible for all charges (e.g., telephone) associated with connecting to the AOL Service through an available access number. THE ACCESS NUMBER IS USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, A LOCAL TELEPHONE CALL. Please read Section 2.A (ii) of the Rules of the Road for a more detailed explanation of telephone charges or search "Local Access Number" under the "Help" menu. To find additional or closer access numbers use keyword "Access." 2.2 Equipment. Member is responsible for obtaining or providing all telephone access lines, telephone and computer equipment (including modem), or other access device, necessary to access the AOL Service. 2.3. Registration. MEMBER CERTIFIES TO AOL INC. THAT HE/SHE IS AN INDIVIDUAL (E.G., NOT A CORPORATION) AND AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE. AOL Inc. may, at its discretion, enter into special billing arrangements with employers and other entities. A minor's parent or legal guardian may authorize a minor's use of Member's account under adult supervision and with assumption of all liabilities resulting from minor's use. (Please refer to Section 2.B of the Rules of the Road). MEMBER AGREES TO PROVIDE AOL INC. WITH ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND UPDATED INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE REGISTRATION TO THE AOL SERVICE ("Member Registration Data"), including Member's legal name, address, telephone number(s), and applicable payment data (i.e., credit card number and expiration date or checking account information). Member agrees to notify AOL Inc. within thirty (30) days of any changes in Member Registration Data. Failure to comply fully with this provision may result in immediate suspension or termination of your right to use the AOL Service. 2.4 Accounts/Charges/Payment. (a) Accounts. The TOS applies to all sub-accounts and alternate screen names associated with Member's principal account(s) ("Master Account(s)"). Each Member is responsible for all activities and charges resulting from use of Member's Master Account(s) under any screen name of the Master Account(s) by any person, and for ensuring full compliance with the TOS by all users of his/her Master Account(s). AOL Service Master Account(s) may not be transferred without prior written approval from AOL Inc. and is subject to any limits established by AOL Inc. (b) Passwords. Upon your enrollment as a Member, You will select a unique password. Member is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her password and is liable for any harm resulting from disclosing or allowing disclosure of any password. In the event of a breach of security, Member will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the AOL Service until Member notifies AOL Inc. by calling 1-800-827-6364. (c) Payment. Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by calling AOL Inc. Customer Service or by using keyword "Billing." Member will pay all sales, use, value- added, personal property or other governmental tax or levy imposed on the goods or services billed to his/her Master Account(s), other than taxes based on net income or profits of AOL Inc. If AOL Inc. does not receive the full amount of Member's AOL Service account balance within thirty (30) days of invoice date, an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month late charge will be added to Member's bill and shall be due and payable. Member shall also be liable for all attorney and collection fees arising from AOL Inc.'s efforts to collect any unpaid balance of Member's Master Account(s). 2.5 Online Conduct. Any conduct by a Member that in AOL Inc.'s discretion restricts or inhibits any other Member from using or enjoying the AOL Service will not be permitted. Member agrees to use the AOL Service only for lawful purposes. Member is prohibited from posting on or transmitting through the AOL Service any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable material of any kind, including, but not limited to, any material which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national or international law. 2.6 Content (a) Proprietary Rights. Member acknowledges that the AOL Service contains information, software, photos, video, graphics, music, sounds or other material (collectively, "Content") that are protected by copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other proprietary rights, and that these rights are valid and protected in all forms, media and technologies existing now or hereinafter developed. All Content is copyrighted as a collective work under the U.S. Copyright laws, and AOL Inc. owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement and enhancement of such Content. Member may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, in whole or in part. If no specific restrictions are displayed, Member may make copies of portions of the Content, including copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary materials, provided that the copies are made only for Member's personal use and that Member maintains any notices contained in the Content such as all copyright notices, trademark legends or other proprietary rights notices. Except as provided in the preceding sentence or as permitted by the fair use privilege under the U.S. copyright laws (see e.g. 17 U.S.C. Section 107), You may not upload, post, reproduce, or distribute Content protected by copyright, or other proprietary right, without obtaining permission of the copyright owner. Use of any software Content shall be governed by the software license agreement accompanying such software or, if none exists, then such use shall be proscribed by the terms governing licensing and use of the AOL Software as provided in Section 6 herein. (b) Distribution/Uploading of Third Party Content. Member may upload to the software files or otherwise distribute on the AOL Service only Content that is not subject to any copyright or other proprietary rights protection (collectively, "Public Domain Content"), or Content in which the author has given express authorization for on-line distribution. Any copyrighted Content submitted with the consent of a copyright owner should contain a phrase such as "Copyright owned by [name of the owner]; Used by Permission." The unauthorized submission of copyrighted or other proprietary Content constitutes a breach of the TOS and could subject You to criminal prosecution as well as personal liability for damages in a civil suit. Remember You, not AOL Inc. or its independent contractors, are liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, or any other harm arising from such submission. By submitting Content to any "Public Area" (Public Area(s) are those areas of the AOL Service that are generally accessible to other Members, such as chat rooms, message boards, and file uploads) You automatically grant, or warrant that the owner of such Content has expressly granted, AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute the Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such Content. You also permit any Member to access, view, store or reproduce the Content for that Member's personal use. Subject to this grant, the owner of Content placed on the AOL Service retains any and all rights which may exist in such Content. (c) Export. The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of technology originating in the United States. This includes the electronic transmission of information and software to foreign countries and to certain foreign nationals. Member agrees to abide by these laws -- including but not limited to the Export Administration Act, the Arms Export Control Act and their implementing regulations -- and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from the AOL Service to either a foreign national or a foreign destination without first obtaining any required government authorization. Member further agrees not to upload to the AOL Service any data or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software. This assurance and commitment shall survive termination of the Agreement. In addition, because the U.S. export control laws currently prohibit nationals of Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria from gaining access to certain Content on the AOL Service, nationals of these countries currently may not legally access the AOL Service at this time. (d) Benefit of Provisions. The foregoing provisions of this section 2.6 are for the benefit of AOL Inc. and its independent third-party information providers ("Information Providers"), merchants ("Merchants") and licensors ("Licensors"), and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly on their own behalf. 2.7 Third Party Content. AOL Inc. is a distributor (and not a publisher) of Content supplied by third parties and Members. Accordingly, AOL Inc. has no more editorial control over such Content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or Content expressed or made available by third parties, including Information Providers, Merchants (as defined herein), Members, or any other user of the AOL Service, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of AOL Inc. NEITHER AOL INC. NOR ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER OF INFORMATION GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY CONTENT, NOR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. (Refer to Section 5 below for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.) In many instances, the Content available through the AOL Service represents the opinions and judgments of the respective Information Provider, Member, or other user not under contract with AOL Inc. AOL Inc. neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on the AOL Service by anyone other than authorized AOL Inc. employee spokespersons while acting in their official capacities. (Forum leaders and Member Guides are not authorized spokespersons.) Under no circumstances will AOL Inc. be liable for any loss or damage caused by a Member's reliance on information obtained through the AOL Service. It is the responsibility of Member to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other Content available through the AOL Service. Please seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, regarding the evaluation of any specific information, opinion, advice, or other Content. 2.8 Retention of Files. Member is responsible for retention of all files, information data and other materials as may be necessary for reconstruction of any files, information material or messages lost or misprocessed by AOL Inc. 3. Third-Party Sales and Services 3.1 Member may order and purchase merchandise or services from other Members and users of the AOL Service, who are not affiliated with AOL Inc. All transactions concerning third-party ("Merchant") goods or services, including, but not limited to, purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between Merchant and Member. AOL Inc. makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any good or service provided or offered by any Merchant. AOL Inc. shall not be a party to a transaction between Member and Merchant, or be liable for any cost or damage arising either directly or indirectly from any action or inaction of any Merchant. AOL Inc.'s Rights 4.1 AOL Inc. may elect to electronically monitor the Public Areas for adherence to its TOS and may disclose any Content, records or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized governmental request, (ii) if such disclosure is necessary to operate the AOL Service, or (iii) to protect the rights or property of AOL Inc., its Members, or Information Providers or Merchants. 4.2 AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to individual Members, the communities which make up the AOL Service, AOL Inc.'s or other third-party rights, or to violate any applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc. nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct, communication or Content which might violate its TOS prior to transmission on the AOL Service, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of questionable Content after on-line posting. Accordingly, neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume liability for any action or inaction with respect to conduct, communication or Content on the AOL Service. 4.3 AOL Inc. will not intentionally monitor or disclose any private electronic communication unless permitted or required by law. AOL Inc. may terminate immediately without notice any Member who misuses or fails to abide by the TOS, including, without limitation, misuse of the software libraries, discussion boards, E-Mail, or conference areas. 4.4 Unless Member elects otherwise by selecting the appropriate "Marketing Preference" choice (Keyword "Marketing Preferences"), AOL Inc. reserves the right to distribute to merchants or third parties certain general Member information, such as Member's name and mailing address. AOL Inc. will not distribute specific Member billing information (i.e. credit card or checking account numbers). 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 5.1 MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE AOL SERVICE IS AT MEMBER'S SOLE RISK. NEITHER AOL INC., ITS EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, LICENSORS OR THE LIKE, WARRANT THAT THE AOL SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE AOL SERVICE, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE, OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED THROUGH THE AOL SERVICE. NEITHER AOL INC. NOR ANY OF ITS INDEPENDENT NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, THAT ANY AVAILABLE ACCESS NUMBER WILL BE A LOCAL CALL FROM YOUR AREA CODE AND EXCHANGE. 5.2 THE AOL SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OTHER THAN THOSE WARRANTIES WHICH ARE IMPLIED BY AND INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR MODIFICATION UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT. NO ORAL ADVICE OR WRITTEN INFORMATION GIVEN BY AOL, INC., ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS (INCLUDING MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES OR GUIDES), THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, LICENSORS OR THE LIKE, SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY; NOR SHALL MEMBER RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE. 5.3 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL AOL INC., OR ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING THE AOL SERVICE OR THE AOL SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE AOL SERVICE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RELIANCE BY A MEMBER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED ON THE AOL SERVICE; OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR E-MAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION, OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE,WHETHER OR NOT LIMITED TO ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AOL INC.'S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES. MEMBER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PARAGRAPH 5.3 SHALL APPLY TO ALL CONTENT, MERCHANDISE OR SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AOL SERVICE. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES AOL'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 5.4 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF AOL INC., OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS OR LICENSORS, FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EITHER JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT PAID BY MEMBER TO AOL INC. IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIMED INJURY OR DAMAGE. The foregoing provisions of this Section 5 are for the benefit of AOL Inc., its employees, directors, affiliates, agents, Information Providers, Merchants and Licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce the provisions directly on their own behalf. 6. Software License and Use 6.1 AOL Inc. grants to Member a limited license to use AOL Software under the following terms and conditions. All AOL Software provided to You, and each revised version thereof, is licensed, not sold, to You by AOL Inc. only for use in connecting to the AOL Service from the United States of America, Canada, and other authorized locations internationally. You may use or copy AOL Software only as specified by AOL Inc., and use or copying for any other purpose violates AOL Inc.'s TOS and is prohibited by law. 6.2 As an authorized Member, AOL Inc. grants You a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right to use, in object code form only, each authorized copy of AOL Software on as many processors (e.g., personal computers) as You reasonably designate for your use and the use of any authorized sub-accounts under your Master Account(s). (Please remember that You are responsible for all use of the AOL Software and the AOL Service under your Master Account(s).) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Member is prohibited from using AOL Software and/or the AOL Service for the purpose of exceeding the allotted ten (10) free trial-hours of AOL Service per Master Account, or the then-applicable free trial-hours. 6.3 You are permitted to archive AOL Software, provided that all such copies contain the same copyright notice and proprietary markings as are on the original AOL Software. Unauthorized copying of AOL Software, including AOL Software that has been modified, merged or included with AOL Software or any related written material, is prohibited. You may not translate, reverse engineer or reverse compile, disassemble or make derivative works from AOL Software. You may not modify AOL Software in any manner or form, including without limitation for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to the AOL Service (e.g., hacking). 6.4 You may not sublicense, assign or transfer this license or AOL Software without prior written authorization from AOL Inc. You agree to destroy all AOL Software and related written material together with any copies promptly when no longer needed or authorized for use, including when termination of Membership is effected as provided herein. As provided in Section 8 herein, termination or suspension by AOL Inc. automatically terminates or suspends (as the case may be) Member's license to use AOL Software. 6.5 AOL Inc.'s entire liability and your exclusive remedy with respect to the use of AOL Software shall be the replacement of any diskette deemed by AOL Inc. to be defective. AOL INC. MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE AOL SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT SHALL AOL INC. BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM USING AOL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF INFORMATION OR MATERIAL OF ANY KIND . 7. Indemnification 7.1 Upon request of AOL Inc., Member agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AOL Inc. its officers, directors, employees, agents, third party Information Providers, Merchants and Licensees, from any claims and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, related to any violation of the TOS by use of Member's Master Account(s), or in connection with the placement or transmission by or through Member of any Content on the AOL Service and its third party Information Providers, Merchants and Members. 8. Termination. 8.1 Either Member or AOL Inc. may terminate Membership at any time. Member's only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any (i) TOS term or policy, guideline, or practice of AOL Inc. in operating the AOL Service, (ii) Content available through the AOL Service or change therein, or (iii) change in the amount or type of fees charged in connection with the AOL Service, is to terminate Membership by delivering notice to AOL Inc., effective the day AOL Inc. receives notification of termination or such specified future date as may be acceptable to AOL Inc. In the event that a Member's Master Account is terminated or canceled, any online time credited to Member's Master Account(s) is not convertible to cash or other form of credit. 8.2 AOL Inc. may terminate Membership, or suspend any individual Member's access to all or part of the AOL Service, without notice, for any conduct that AOL Inc. in its sole discretion believes violates the TOS, interferes with another Member's enjoyment of the AOL Service, or is harmful to another Member, third-party Information Provider, Merchant, Licensor, service provider or AOL Inc.'s interests. 8.3 Termination of Membership automatically terminates service to all other users or sub-accounts under Member's Master Account.

Termination or suspension by AOL Inc. automatically terminates or suspends, as the case may be, Member's license to use AOL Software as provided herein. In the event of Termination, Member remains bound by Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 herein. 9. Miscellaneous 9.1 Construction. In the event that any portion of the TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect. The paragraph headings herein are provided only for reference and shall have no effect on the construction or interpretation of the TOS. 9.2 No Implied Waiver/Modification. The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance by the other party of any provision of the TOS shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of the TOS. 9.3 Applicable Law. The TOS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except with regard to its conflicts of law rules. Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal courts situated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in connection with any action arising under the TOS or relating to the AOL Service or AOL Software. Any cause of action of Member or its authorized user(s) with respect to the AOL Service or AOL Software must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose, or be barred. 9.4 Trademarks. The "America Online(R) Service" is a registered service mark of AOL Inc. "AOL" is a service mark of AOL Inc. All rights reserved. All other trademarks appearing on the AOL Service are the property of their respective owners. Legal Notices Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Members are entitled to the following specific consumer rights information: 1) Pricing Information. Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by calling 1-800-827-6364. AOL Inc. reserves the right to change fees, surcharges, monthly membership fees or to institute new fees at any time upon thirty (30) days prior notice, as provided for in the TOS Agreement at Section 1.5. 2) Complaints. The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1020 N.

("AOL Inc.") will operate the America Online Service ("AOL Service") and how Members may use the AOL Service. The Rules of the Road also explain many practical aspects of using the AOL Service. Please read this document carefully and refer to it as often as necessary. You should also read the Terms of Service ("TOS") Agreement. This document, the TOS Agreement, and the Membership Conditions (which you saw when you first signed on) are all of the applicable AOL Service rules and collectively comprise the contract between AOL Inc. and Members and are referred to as the "Terms of Service" or "TOS." You can view all of the TOS on the AOL Service at any time free of charge in the "Members' Online Support" department located within the "Members Services" area. B. We believe that these Terms of Service will enhance AOL Inc.'s efforts to make the AOL Service informative, entertaining and, above all, FUN!! for all our Members. We have tried to explain clearly our Terms of Service, but if any aspect of the TOS is unclear, we welcome your comments. We hope that these Terms of Service will foster an online community where there is both free exchange of ideas and information, and respect for individual and community rights. Access (i) Equipment. Most Members will access the AOL Service through a standard residential telephone line, a modem, and a personal computer. (Please remember that when you are connected to the AOL Service, your telephone or other communications equipment, e.g., fax, cannot be operated on the same line at the same time.) There are a variety of personal computers that are capable of accessing and using the AOL Service. For specific technical questions, use the keyword "TechLive." Tech Live is currently open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. (Eastern time) and weekends from 12 p.m. to 1 a.m. (ii) Telephone Charges. You are responsible for all telephone charges incurred in connecting to the AOL Service through the most locally available access number(s) (sometimes referred to as the local access nodes). DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR LOCATION, THE ACCESS NUMBER IS USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS A LOCAL TELEPHONE CALL. To find additional or closer access numbers use keyword "Access." If you have any questions about which telephone number is best or whether an access number is a local call, please check with your local phone company. Any disputes or problems regarding phone service are strictly between Member and the applicable local phone company and/or long distance service provider. Please note that AOL Inc. does not maintain the access numbers used to connect to the AOL Service; rather they are owned and operated by independent network service providers. MEMBERS ACCESSING THE AOL SERVICE FROM CANADA WILL BE ASSESSED A SURCHARGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY TWELVE (12) DOLLARS PER HOUR. If you cannot currently find an access number that is a local call, check the "New Access Number Updates," which is updated monthly and available in the free Members' Online Support department. (We are continuously expanding the list of local numbers.) You can also call your long-distance telephone company to see if a calling plan is available to allow you to call a long-distance access number for a flat rate, or to purchase blocks of calling time in advance at a discount. Your AOL Service Account (i) YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE TO REGISTER FOR THE AOL SERVICE AND BECOME AN AUTHORIZED MEMBER; HOWEVER, A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MAY AUTHORIZE A MINOR TO USE HIS/HER ACCOUNT(S) UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION. In that case, the parent or legal guardian recognizes that he/she is fully responsible for the online conduct of such minor, for controlling the minor's access to and use of the AOL Service, and for the consequences of any misuse. The AOL Service offers a "Parental Control" feature that enables the Master Account holder to restrict access to certain areas and features on the AOL Service. Please refer to the Parental Control area in the Members' Online Support department for an explanation of this feature. (ii) You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. For security purposes, we recommend that you change your password often. (You can do this by entering the "Change Your Personal Password" area in the free Members' Online Support department.) Although the AOL Service offers a feature that allows you to bypass the password protection, please remember that this feature permits anyone who has access to your computer to easily access your account. Use of this password bypass feature is at your own risk. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR SUB-ACCOUNT(S), INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, UNTIL YOU NOTIFY AOL OF ANY BREACH OF SECURITY BY CALLING AOL AT 1-800-827-6364. (iii) Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by using keyword "Billing." (iv) AOL reserves the right to distribute to merchants or third parties certain general Member information, such as Member's name and mailing address, unless Member elects otherwise by selecting the appropriate "Marketing Preferences" choice within the "Personal Choices" area on the AOL Service. AOL will not distribute specific billing information (i.e. credit card and checking account numbers). (v) AOL encourages you to be creative and have fun with the screen names you choose, but you are also expected to be reasonable and responsible; vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names can offend the sensibilities of many Members, and it is only common courtesy to remember this when you are selecting screen names. You may not use a screen name to impersonate someone, or a name protected by trademark or copyright law. You may use a name of a historical person, but not of another living person. If you are unsure about a screen name, send us an E-Mail using the "Write to Terms of Service Staff" button under keyword "TOS," and select the "Names/Profiles Violations" button. Unfortunately, some Members occasionally select vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names as a joke, or just a momentary lapse of good judgment. AOL Inc. reserves the right to delete any such screen name, or to request deletion. Online Conduct Please refer to Section 2.5 of the Terms of Service Agreement for AOL Inc's policy on impermissible types of online conduct. Below are some common violations of the Terms of Service. This list is not exhaustive. AOL Inc. reserves the right, but does not assume the responsibility, to restrict communication which AOL Inc. deems in its discretion to be harmful to individual Members, damaging to the communities which make up the AOL Service, or in violation of AOL Inc.'s or any third-party rights. Please be aware, however, that communication over the AOL Service often occurs in real-time, or is posted on one of the AOL Service's thousands of message boards or libraries, and AOL Inc. cannot, and does not intend to, screen communication in advance. If you witness chat in a public chat room that violates AOL's Terms of Service, you may contact an AOL Service Guide by using the keyword "Guide Pager." You may also contact AOL's Terms of Service Staff about any violation by using the "Write to the Terms of Service Staff" icon located in the Terms of Service area of the Member's Online Support department. Offensive Communication The AOL Service is a community-oriented service composed of many different communities of people. Our goal is to provide an interesting, stimulating and fun place for all Members. Using vulgar, abusive or hateful language undermines this goal and is not allowed. Please use your best judgment and be respectful of other Members. Remember, there are children online. If you use vulgar, or abusive language online, even if masked by symbols or other characters, you may either receive an "on-screen-warning" by a Guide or Room Host, or in extreme cases be terminated immediately. A warning indicates that your language is not in compliance with AOL Inc.'s Rules. Should you receive such a warning, take the time to read the TOS Agreement again and these Rules of the Road posted in the free Members' Online Support department. Harassment When a Member targets another specifically to cause him/her distress, embarrassment, unwanted attention, or other discomfort, this is harassment. AOL Inc. does not condone harassment in any form and may suspend or terminate the accounts of any Member who harasses others. You may have a disagreement with someone's point of view -- we encourage lively discussion in our chat rooms and message boards -- but personal attacks, or attacks based on a person's race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other such affiliation, are prohibited. If you have a disagreement with someone's point of view, address the subject, not the person. Graphic Files AOL Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on the AOL Service of sexually explicit images or other content deemed offensive by AOL Inc. Scrolling "Scrolling" means repeatedly causing the screen to roll faster than Members are able to type to it. It is caused by a user entering a set of random characters or by repeatedly entering a carriage return or any such action to a similar disruptive effect. Scrolling is an expressly prohibited form of disruption. Impersonation This can involve the portrayal of an account in an official capacity, such as AOL Inc. staff or an information provider, authorized Guide or Host, or communication under a false name or a name that you are not authorized to use. Members must avoid the portrayal of AOL personnel or other persons in all forms of online communication, including, but not limited to, screen names, member profiles, chat dialogue and message postings. Room DisruptionThis includes purposefully interfering with the normal flow of dialogue in a chat room. Room disruption may occur by repeatedly interrupting conversation between Members, or by acting in such a way as to antagonize, harass or create hostility in a chat room. Chain Letters and Pyramid Schemes Transmission of chain letters and pyramid schemes of any kind is not allowed on the AOL Service. This material places an unnecessary load on our mail system and is considered a nuisance by many Members. Certain chain letters and pyramid schemes are illegal. Letters or messages that offer a product or service based on the structure of a chain letter are also of questionable legality. At minimum, they are a waste of resources and are not permitted on the AOL Service. Advertising and Solicitation You may not use the AOL Service to send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms of solicitation to other Members except in those specified areas that are designated for such a purpose (e.g., the classified area). Internet Access and Conduct The AOL Service will soon feature comprehensive access to the Internet. When using the Internet and all of its components, Members must conduct themselves responsibly according to the Internet's own particular code of conduct. Participating successfully on the Internet is really a matter of common sense. Although AOL Inc. does not control the Internet, your conduct on the Internet when using your AOL account is subject to the Terms of Service. Because AOL Inc. wants to be a good Internet citizen, it prohibits Members from engaging in certain conduct on the Internet through or by means of the AOL Service including the following: (i) Chain Letters. Chain letters are prohibited on the AOL Service and are inappropriate on the Internet. Posting a chain letter to an Internet newsgroup (or via E-Mail on the Internet) may result in your AOL Service account being terminated. (ii) Commercial Communication. The vast majority of newsgroups and mailing lists on the Internet are not commercial in nature and participants in such groups may object strongly to commercial postings, solicitations, or advertisements. (iii) Other Inappropriate Posts. Each newsgroup and mailing list on the Internet focuses on a particular set of topics and posts not related to these topics are not welcomed by the participants. We suggest that all AOL Service Members become familiar with the guidelines, themes, and culture of the specific newsgroups and mailing list in which they wish to participate. Posting patently inappropriate material on the Internet may result in suspension or termination of your AOL Service account. (iv) Copyrighted and Proprietary Materials. Transmitting to the Internet copyrighted or other proprietary material of any kind without the express permission of the right holder is prohibited and will result in termination of your membership and possible civil and/or criminal liability. Additionally, AOL Inc. does not control the Internet and therefore use of the Internet is at Member's own risk. Members should exercise their discretion and supervision when allowing any minors under their Master Account to access the Internet. Third-Party Content and Information. Because AOL Inc. encourages open and candid communication, it cannot determine in advance the accuracy of Content transmitted on the AOL Service. AOL is not responsible for screening, policing, editing, or monitoring such Content. If notified of allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal or offensive Content, AOL Inc. may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such Content from the AOL Service. AOL Inc. shall be held harmless from any performance or non-performance by AOL Inc. of such activities, as long as it has acted in good faith. Please use your best judgment in evaluating all information contained or opinions expressed on the AOL Service. You should be at least as careful in your evaluation of such information and opinions on the AOL Service as you are in everyday life. It is AOL Inc.'s policy not to endorse, oppose, or edit any opinion expressed by a Member or information or material provided by an independent contractor. Independent contractors who supply information or content to the AOL Service ("Information Provider") endeavor to make it accurate and reliable, but do not guarantee or warrant as so. In some instances, the information provided may represent opinion and judgment and/or may have been supplied by a Member not in any way under a contract with AOL Inc. Purchasing Products and Services through the AOL Service Please remember that AOL Inc. does not endorse, warrant or guarantee any product or service offered through the AOL Service and will not be a party to any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services. As with the purchase of a product or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your best judgment and exercise caution where appropriate. Blind opportunity ads and "get rich quick" schemes should be approached with ample skepticism. The AOL Service cannot mediate disputes and cannot assume responsibility for any outcome. Be careful, be smart, have fun! Public and Private Communication The AOL Service offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member. Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members, such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards. Private Communication is electronic correspondence sent or received by you to particular individuals. AOL Inc. will maintain the AOL Service Public Areas as an open forum for discussion of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc. will administer standards of online conduct according to its TOS for the enjoyment of all its Members. While we will endeavor to monitor the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in the role of "Big Brother" by screening public communication in advance. It is AOL Inc.'s policy to respect the privacy of personal electronic communication. AOL Inc. will not intentionally inspect the contents of an electronic message ("E-Mail" or "Instant Message") sent by one Member to another individual, monitor discussions in private rooms, or dislose the contents of any personal electronic communication to an unauthorized third party, except as required or permitted to do so by law. AOL Inc. reserves the right to cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any investigation relating to any Content, including private electronic communication, transmitted on the AOL Service or the unlawful activities of any Member. AOL Inc. reserves the right to remove any Content that it deems in its sole discretion to be a violation of its Terms of Service. AOL Inc. may terminate immediately any Member who misuses or fails to abide by its Terms of Service. AOL, Inc.'s current general practice is that (i) E-Mail is retained on the AOL Service for five (5) days after the date it is read and then permanently deleted, and (ii) unread E-Mail is kept on the AOL Service for approximately thirty (30) days; however, AOL Inc. makes no warranties of any kind with respect to its E-Mail service and is not responsible for any message which may be misprocessed by AOL Inc. AOL Inc. reserves the right to change its general E-Mail practice at any time without notice. If a screen name is deleted, any unread E-Mail sent prior to that deletion will also be removed, as a deleted screen name cannot be reinstated.

Terry was following along. Here is the list: Buzz is Mike Elsten. Bitchy women equal foxes. Good looking guys equal morons. Good Morning (insert city name), is a good idea for the name of a TV show. Nobody is home. People piss Don off. Be nice to Mom. I wish we were on TV. All French women have hairy underarms. Women with hairy underarms are unattractive. Joe Jacoby is God. People who love Harry Anderson are stupid. Jim J. Buttocks has good cheek bones. Going through tapes on carts is a good idea. Jurassic is a good new word. Everybody hates Harry Anderson. Advertisers are greedy bloodsuckers. Don't trust Roger. Dennis Murphy is a mad viking. You can't get VD from a toilet seat. Billy Reed is not a man. If it smells like cologne, leave it alone. Push on the vagina. Stop the 'Stop the Insanity' Lady. Buzz Burbank made a funny. Mike O'Meara-he ain't no circus clown. God is an American. God speaks American English. Mike O'Meara had to ice down his genitals. If you can tea bag, you can come to work. You can get sicker from a baby than you can from a toilet seat.

Call-sign "Lucia." DIANAS RULES TO LIVE BY: There is never a reason to lie. There is never a reason to raise your voice at someone. Take responsibility for your own actions! There comes a time in everyones life that we realize the importance of this. For some of us, this realization comes early in life. For others it comes tragically late. Often if we realize this in our adult life, it's because we have done something horrible, and have lost someone, or something close to us as a result. Life is not a joke. It is not a game.. It is a precious gift that we need to respect and appreciate. Never trust anyone. Unless you think they understand #3, and even then, don't trust them until they prove themselves. Start them off with an "F" and see if they work their way up to an "A". Never break a promise, or make one you can not keep. TRY to forgive someone if they have hurt you, but don't be discouraged if you can't forget. Never expect anything from anyone. Always remember, everything happens for a reason. Look for the good in all situations. Have a strong faith in God. Now, if she follows these rules to the letter, we don't know.  She does tend toyell.  She claims that she yells about someone, but not *at* them.3.02  Robbay SpiewakA.K.A.  - Robert Wadams Spiewak Jr.  (Real Name)A.K.A.  - Bobby Sparkles  (Las Vegas Showman Name)A.K.A.  - Delores  (Pre-operative Transsexual Name)A.K.A.  - BoBoA.K.A.  - Round-eyesBirthday  03/08/71FAMILYFather  Name Robert Wadams Spiewak, Sr.Mother  Name SharonGrandfather  Name affectionately called "Big Daddy" by Robbay.Robbay started out at WJFK as an intern in 1992, and caught Don's eye becauseof his girth (he's a member of the Big-man's club, with Don & Mike), hisElvis-like sideburns, and the license-plate on his car, "TCB BABY" for TakingCare of Business, Elvis's catch-phrase (Current license plate: ROBBAY.

Don & Mike will periodically send him out wearing hisclown suit.  He currently is known as 'BoBo the Smoking Clown.  He has worn afew uniforms previously, including a pilgrim suit, first worn on the 1994Thanksgiving show.)  Before this, fans could se him frequently stuffed intogreen shorts, 44DD brassiere, a director's outfit, and thebig-afro-like-wig shouting "LOOK AT ME (pronounced MAY)!  I'M ROBBAY!"His catch phrase was "Manja, baby!" (used for a signoff.)  Don & Mike (now)cut him off during his signoff as a goof when he's speaking.

Generally, you either like her,or you don't like her.  Some people find her to be a refreshing check forDon's incredible masculinity, where others find her to be a whineypain-in-the-ass that won't let Don buy a Porsche (See 7.00.)  She is left withthe tasks of taking care of the house while her hubby is gone, paying all thebills, getting the newsletter together, and driving Bart home from school.She spends her spare time with the neighborhood ladies' Book Club, and WineClub or annoying Don with her piano playing at all hours of the day and night.Will hang up the phone INSTANTLY if you say the following: COME IN TOKYO!Refers back to some movie where a geeky guy tweaks a girl's breasts likethey're radio knobs.Hates (with a passion) when they have strippers in the studio for specialoccasions.3.05  BartA.K.A.  - Bart Sorce  (Real Name)A.K.A.  - Big Guy  (Don's nickname for Bart)Birthday  03/31/85FAMILY(See 2.01)We, the listeners, have had the distinct honor of listening to Bartgrow up from a cute babbling baby to the young man we have today.

The Mad Viking, as Don Calls him, isalways a welcome addition to any show.  He as free-reign to call any time helikes as long as he sings "White Christmas."  They usually put him onrestriction if he abuses this privilege.He appears at just about every remote that the boys do.  He has a speechimpediment.He's about 5'7" tall, with thinning black hair and glasses.  He looks fairlynormal, except for his missing hand.  Dennis is no longer a virgin, although ittook a lot to accomplish this.  He just recently lost his virginity, despiteDon's gift of a trip to a Reno Whore-house in mid 1993.  Don told him to'satisfy himself' before the actual act.  Dennis found, however, that thiscaused him to be, sort of, spent.  Denise (See 4.07) agreed to assist him in "tripping the Light Fantastique"after winning a Strip Trivia game.  She promised Don & Mike that she wouldhelp Dennis out with his little wish, and Don remembered this some time later.He got Denise to make good on her promise, and he lost it on September 181994 at 2:18 PM (eastern).A tape exists of the event, but no one will release it, however, parts wereplayed on the air.4.02  WandaA.K.A.  - DemitriusWanda is a pre-operative transsexual with a very distinctive voice.Loves St. Pauli Girl, and Martinis.  Mike does a wonderful impression of herthat pisses Wanda off.4.03  Steve the Gay GuyAlways organized the Gay and Lesbian Rodeo for D&M, but has moved toNorfolk, recently.  The homosexual voice of D&M.4.04  FrancisBig Breasted woman with presents for Don to fish for under her huge-gelatinous breasts.  Don always says, "As you can see, I wear my wedding ringon my left hand, that's why I'm reaching with my right hand!"  Her presentsalways seems to smell of cheese.4.05  Boom-BoomPart owner of a strip-o-gram company.  Has stripped for Don & Mikefor birthday shows.4.06  Carl (the Merry Jew, the Bewildered, dog nipples) GrossmanWeird space-cadet kinda guy that shows up at many Don & Mikeappearances with his green-guitar, into which he built an amp,speaker, and headphone jacks.   Used to live the rock-n-roll lifestyle.  Wasbackstage at Woodstock, and lived with rock bands, opening for such names asAlice Cooper.  He took far too many drugs in the 60s, and is paying for it nowby going back to school, moving back with his folks, and getting a new career.He Has written "two sides" "to everything" on his sneekers.  Helikes to say "some people wear their heart on their sleves, Iwear my philosophy on my feet."  He made a model of the humaneye, for school, which he brought to a show (at Dianas request).Drives a car with vanity plates "Artist1c"("Artistic licence" -- he's fond of puns).  He's fastened akitchen sink handle to a furniture roller, and bolted it to hissteering wheel, because he's too lazy to exert the effort tosteer like normal people.     Has gone from their "favorite wacko" (M. O'Meara -- I haveit on tape) to being banned from the show for his weirdness andcompulsiveness, to being provisionally allowed to call every two-weeks or so. MIght've had something to do with Shari.  That's notclear.   Stay tuned.  Don and Mike always seem to allow him toreappear from time to time, or whenever he can get on the airhimself. He's a reasonably articulate fellow (having had Lettersto the Editor published in the Washington post four times), butmelts into a a puddle of mumbling, stumbling, un-funnyboorishness  whenever he's in the presenceof Don-n-Mike, (whose greatness intimidates the hell out of him.)      Has bemoaned his recent lack of luck with the ladies (hecalls it his "long coital dry spell -- a term which Don chose notto use) and once said it would probably have been easier if hewas gay.   He wrote long drawn-out letters, begging for Don'sforgiveness, and submits all sorts of weird ideas (like peanut-butter and marshmallow sandwiches, elevator buttons that could bere-pressed to turn off, a contraption which could allow people tohave sex at speeds of hundreds-of-thrusts per minute, 13-manjuries (so one deranged idiot couldn't side-track the wholeprocess -- since a majority of only 12 would still be required),on and on anon ad nausem.  He loves Don.4.07  DeniseDenise has been on with the cheese Gods quite a few times.  She is best knownfor curing Dennis Murphy of his virginity, wearing chains, and flashingD&M.  She loves sex, coining the term "Schwanking" as the activity sheloves to partake in.4.08  Lady CassandraA.K.A  - Cassy/Cassandra/Al St. JohnOnce upon a time before Wanda the Transsexual (See 4.02), there was anotherone.  Her name was Lady Cassandra St.John.  This time, Cassandra actually wentthrough with the sex change, going from being a proud man who served to awoman.She is reputed to have flashed D&M in their studio.There was a series of disgusting dates that Don fixed her up with, thenthey introduced her to a lovely lesbian....They had a fever courtship and were married lesbian style on the Don andMike show 23 July 1993...About a month later she had a falling out with Don on the air and Don kickedhim/her off the show because he/she was making appearances on anotherWashington, D.C. radio station.  Cassandra was/is a Wican Priestess. In otherwords, a pagan witch. Her radio exploits, coupled with the revelation that shewas a he made others in her coven insist that she back off on the witchassociation.  So she droppped down from "Lady Cassandra, Witch" to plainCassandra.  She and Francis (See 4.04) have an afternoon show on a small stationin Maryland, discussing various girl-type things.  They bill themselves as"opposites attract" (ie: "Cassandra's Gay, and Francis isn't...Francis likesguys, Cassandra doesn't...But we get along just fine."4.09  Tom Gavin - click here to mail him a message!Tom Gavin, affectionately known as Tommy, called into the Don and Mike showone day, and fast became one of the regulars.  He was first noticed by hisillegible and mispelled faxes, that looked like an elementary school kid wrotethem.  It was only many months later that he actually called and got on theair.  Tom is famous for the phrases "Hey buddy!", "Yep." "How you doin'?" and "How you doin' out deer goiz?"  He has an accent that would be closelyrelated to someone who is mildly deaf or Elmer Fudd. He has a fondness forShari, since he always gets in a few words directed at her when he realizesthat Don and Mike are going to take the hook out of his mouth (hang up on him.)Also, he is a DJ on an FM cable station in Fairfax County.  It is thepublic access station provided by the Cable Company.That frequency is 94.7 (WCSX), which you can listen to if you have an FMsplitter, or you can listen by tuning in channel 37 on Greater Mediacable in Fairfax county.  Don and Mike enjoy playing his DJ tapes, and goofon him as they do with other people who are in their business.  Hefrequently repeats himself on these tapes, and leaves a lot of dead air.There was a "Tom Gavin's DJ Delights", which served the Baltimore/DC area,but I don't know if this is the same Tom Gavin.He also is a terrific speller.  So good, infact, that he only spelled oneword correctly after a few dozen words for him to attempt.  The phoneticsaren't even there.  He will, in most cases, start off spelling a word forDon and Mike, giving the first letter correctly, then completely blowingthe rest of the word. 5.00  History Don Geronimo started in radio at 16 years old.  He worked in New Yorkas a DJ making what he thought was good money, had his own place, and'made-it' with teachers who heard his voice on the radio.  He was a smart-assall his life which landed him in trouble, and in-and-out of many radio jobs.He even did it with a midget, which he likes to talk about.  He has been firedfrom some 20 radio stations!  Most of the time, he's been fired for talking toomuch and playing too few songs.  He has DJ'ed in Los Angeles, Chicago (at WLS),New York City, Detroit at WDRQ (for 6 whole weeks!), WNDE in Indianapolis, WPROin Providence RI, and here in Washington on 3 stations; WPGC where he was justDon Geronimo doing his usual top 40 music-show, WAVA where he and Mike O'Mearareplaced Charlie and Harrigan on "The Morning Zoo!" and now WJFK  where theirantics are legendary.Mike O'Meara spent most of his youth sitting in bean-bag chairs inhis parents basement listening to Iron Butterfly, Boston, and Pink Floyd.Later, he found his way into radio where he worked a couple of CountryStations, and eventually, into WAVA in Arlington, Virginia.Don first joined WAVA (Wave-Uh) in '84 where he did afternoon drive.His son Bart was just born, and constantly called home to talk to his wife,Freda, during the show.  Mike worked as, no joke, the Wave-Uh Van-driver.His job was to schlepp the promotions department's van to and fromappearances.  That's where the two met.They used to yukk it up in the hallways of "The Stinky Station," (andmind you, it DID smell bad) so much that the program director decided to canhis Morning Zoo Show with Charlie and Harrigan in favor of Don & Mike.The Morning Zoo show aired from December of 1985 until June of 1992on WAVA.  Although everything stated above is true, Don and Mike love to tell thefollowing story of how they met:Don was being driven home in heavy traffic in his stretch limou, when heheard a familiar voice eminating from the side of the road.  When Donrecognized the voice belonging to the legendary Sammy Davis jr., he toldFrank (his driver) to stop the car!  To Don's surprise, it was NOT thelegend at all, but a guy, smelling of vomet, BO, and anything else youcould imagine.  Don told this man that his impression was fantastic, andasked him if he'd like to work with Don.  The man was so excited that hepuked all over Don, his upholstery, and a brand new pair of shoes Don waswearing.  This guy was Mike O'Meara, of course.The program directors, over the years, always tried to keep atight rein on them.  "Eleven Songs in a row, not ten, not nine, ELEVEN!"  "Tryand keep the recurring bits at the same times during the day.  If you do CrooksAre Stupid at 9:00, ALWAYS do it at 9:00."  At times, Don & Mike would tryand listen and do what they said, but often, they didn't.  They've beensuspended at least twice in my memory.After a while, Don & Mike came to truly despise program directors fortheir meddling - driving some PD's to tears (Li'l Matt Farber, now workingfor MTV.  His handshake is like a dead fish.  He used to take his shoes offduring meetings and rub his toes.)  They even began a love-hate relationshipwith the Vice-President/General Manager Alan Goodman.Big Al (Your Radio Pal), who was also known as "The Jumpin' Munchkin", wasa balding, annoying little guy whoalways gave nicknames to people he worked with.  I remember he used to alwayssay, "Good Morning Dee!  Good Morning Emm!"Don and Mike hated working at that station.  They gave them nolatitude to do what they wanted, even though their ratings were stellar -sometimes commanding upwards of a 13 share!  They had to get out, but theircontract was very binding.  Their frustrations became apparent several timeswhen they have walked out of broadcasts, been suspended, and blatantlyvocalized their unhappiness.  Some of these setbacks caused "rebirths" ofsorts where Don & Mike would go back to their older styles of broadcastingspawning "The NEW Sound of Don & Mike" and crap like that.  One way, oranother, however, Don & Mike were determined to leave WAVA.Emmiss Broadcasting owned WAVA, but came upon some financial troublein 1992.  Finally, it was reported that WAVA was up for sale.  Salembroadcasting, a Christian Radio organization, bought out the station almostimmediately, but assured the on-air talent that their jobs were assured inthe reorganization.  Even though, Salem didn't own any Top-40 radio stations,they still pretended that they wouldn't change the format to religeous.Well, that was Don & Mike's cue to get out.  They were given offersfrom other radio stations, including Chicago and LA.As an aside comment, when WAVA was being sold, Don and Mike had a job offerfrom KLOS in Los Angeles.  The boys turned it down because they wanted tostay in the Washington, DC area.  They thought that the problems with WAVAwould clear up, and things would be back to normal.  Since they weren'tgoing to take the job, some radio guy (assuming he worked for KLOS at thetime) wanted Don and Mike to hear a few DJ airchecks.  The idea was to gettwo guys who sounded like Don and Mike.  So they both listened to thetapes, and picked a real winner (in true Don and Mike style, of course.).It was so bad that, as a joke, Don and Mike said that they would be perfectfor the job.  This was done purely as a goof.  These two radio guys whichDon and Mike picked to take the LA job were none other than Mark and Bryan.I have no idea how they became number one in LA, but they did.  At least,until Howard Stern kicked them off the top spot.  That makes me happy,since I like Howard as well, but that's just my opinion.  They were made an offer from WJFK andInfinity broadcasting whereas they would buy out Don & Mike's contracts.Things weren't all rosy at WJFK, either.  Not long before theirchange-over, their producer, Frank Murphy, booked Leslie Nielson for theshow.  At the last minute, Leslie's publicist backed out without explanation.Don & Mike proceeded to rip into Leslie's publicist to the point where shefiled a $15 Million lawsuit against Emmis Broadcasting, Don, Mike, andFrank.  The lawsuit followed them to WJFK where it ended in an undisclosedsettlement.Then, finally, in 1993, Don & Mike were syndicated by Infinity. 6.00  Mike O'Meara's Voices 6.01  Charly StuangstabilacCharly was born, 42 years old, on the anniversary of D&M's first showtogether, December 15, 1985.  Now, turning 51, he's still one of the mostpopular characters on the show.  He is described as 6'5", 250lbs, Mr.Clean-bald, and wears Bib-overalls.  He lives in Gaithersburg where he sharesa duplex with his brother Matthew, and his friend Huggybear.  If anybody hasever seen Full Metal Jacket, and remembers the character of 'Private Pyle,'can imagine what Charly looks like.Charly was married to Baklava Souvlaki, a woman he met at the Nut-Hutseveral years ago.  Their sex-life was reported as amazing.  Charly andBaklava, eventually, split up, but not without producing his only son, CharlyJr.  Charly Jr. grew up unbelievably quickly, and immediately attended somemilitary academy.  Charly and Baklava have since patched things up, but wehaven't heard from her in quite some time.  Incedentally, Baklava's voice wasmasterfully created by our own Diana Silman.  Charly also has a sister,Charlene, with whom Charly does not get along with.  Charlene's voice isperformed by Sherri Liquor.  Even though Charly is 52, Mike seems tomis-calculate all the time.  Don asks, "Charly, how old are you again?"  ButCharly can never get it right, always being off by a few years.  Maybe heshould just say he's 39, eh?Charly has starred in his own hit-TV show on Fox called,appropriately, "Charly's Place."  He has held down several jobs includingvarious duties at Don's house, construction worker, janitor, privateinvestigator, ice-cream taster, highway-maintenance engineer, and was also anurse for the used-to-be fattest man in the world "Hambone."  Consideringhis extensive resume, you would never think that Charly hasn't yet graduatedfrom Gonzaga High-School in downtown Washington, DC.6.02  My Cousin LuigiDon's cousin Luigi came over from Italy just a couple of years ago,and hasn't yet picked up the language.  Although, if you listen carefully,you might pick out the gist of what he's saying.  By far, the funniest voicein Mike's repertoire.6.03  Buddy SurrellFrom the Dick VanDyke show, Buddy needs a squeegee to wipe his face whenhe's  done talking.  He always has Vietnam flashbacks, and can never rememberwho he's talking to after coming out of them..6.04  Raymond BurrBig Ray is well known for his Ironsides role, as well as hispreoccupation with chocolate (See 7.00.)6.05  Telly SavalasWho loves ya, Telly?  Mamma-Savalas does.  Calls at least once-a-weekfrom Heaven to give Don an update on the goings on up there.6.06  Arnold SchwarzeneggerArnold has a problem with phonetic spelling, but has a beautifulsinging voice.  A tasty lick on the Don & Mike cafe'.6.07  Sammy Davis Jr.Originally, Mike's most perfect voice.  Sammy grabbed Don's attentionyears ago, when they met.  See 7.00 (In)Famous Stories.6.08  Nick NolteExcellent.  Has awful breath, and is always "Looking for my littledog!"  Usually accompanies Don's Richard Dryfuss' "CALL 911!!"6.09  Lucille BallSometimes, this voice is rehashed for any female heavy-smoker.Smokes menthols.6.10  Ken BeatriceWMAL (AM-630, in Washington, DC) radio sports-talk DJ.  Very funnyvoice, if you have ever heard Ken's show.  Always ends up the same way, "BYE,NOW!!"6.11  Joe JacobyPumpkin-head Joe, former Washington Redskin, is so large that theRedskins had to contract out to get a helmet built for his super-sized head.No - No - No - Yeah!  My wife enjoys them!  I'm turning into Frankenstein!6.12  Elvis Aaron PresleyBack when Don&Mike and Major Bill Smith were having a bit of a tiff,Mike was working on his INCREDIBLE Elvis voice.  Elvis had apparently calledD&M through the Major, and sounded slurred, and slow.  Mike picked up on itimmediately (See 7.06.)6.13  Major Bill SmithWell, y'all know the Maj's on the level.  Another greatMike-voice.  Likes to eat Corn on the Cob, spam and German Potato Salad!6.14  Alan GoodmanVP/General Manager (former) of WAVA-FM 105.1 in Washington, DC.Flawless, and always funny.  Did some classic bits including the string of"Alan Goodman" movies:  'Goodman: The Movie", "Goodman: The Lucky Man","Goodman: The Prophecy", and "The Last Temptation of Alan Goodman."  (See 5.00.)6.15  Rusty FordFormer production director of WAVA.  Has to be heard to be believed.Because nobody knows who Rusty is, anymore, Mike doesn't do the voice.  Butwhen he did it, it was GREEAAAAAAT!6.16  Maurice ButkusNo longer a voice used by Mike.  Maurice appeared as the sportsreporter for Don & Mike at WAVA.  He was very effeminate, and blatantly ahomosexual character.  It was decided that Maurice had to go as to not createanimosity from the homosexual audience.  Also doubled as the fashionreporter.6.17  Rush LimbaughThis impersonation has actually gotten rave reviews from the 'rhoidsufferer, himself!  Always suffering from 'inflamed hemmerhoidal tiss-yooo,'this man frequents the D&M airwaves.  Rush must sit on a donut for comfort.6.18  RobBay SpiewakUncanny!  Even Rob's grandfather can be fooled!  Loves his KrispyKreme donuts with raspberry filling.  (see 3.02)6.19  Hop-SingAnother great stereotypical voice, Joe!  Loves that gong, and doesDon's laundry.  He is always interested in "sex book, Joe?"6.20  StimpyNot the cartoon character, but one of the former employees of WJFK, where D&Mbroadcast. His most famous line: THAT'S B.S. ROB! It's HOT HOT HOT!6.21  Forrest GumpNot a very good impression, but funny! Watch out for the darkside of Forrest.Other voices:Bono (From U2), Roger Rabit, Grandpa and Homer Simpson, Lefty Driesel, HarvMoore (WPGC-AM 1580 Morning Mayor in Washington, DC.  Is Don's boyhood idol.),Bullethead (Gordon Liddy), Floyd the Barber, Suzanne Pleshette, Fabio, MichaelEisner, Kate Mulgrew, (Capt. Janeway from Star Trek:Voyager) who has a fascinationwith "Polaric Radiation", Cerf (way too mellow DJ that worked with Don & Mike atWAVA and WJFK) and Mr. Cartoon (which always gives Mike a migrane while doing it.) 7.00  (In)Famous Stories 7.01  Raymond Burr StoryDon and Mike have a friend in the law enforcement community thatraids and seizes photographs of people in 'peculiar circumstances.'  One ofthe photos showed a much younger Raymond Burr lying on the floor with ayounger man squatting under him doing his business IN RAY'S MOUTH!  Hence,his fascination for 'chocolate.'Wharff!7.02  Danny Thomas StoryD&M always refer to him and glass table-tops, and give away the word 'COPROPHELIA.'For those who have not looked up the word, the long and short of it is, acopropheliac enjoys fecal matter.  As for what "Eggs, Danny-Thomas-Style"are, I couldn't hazard a guess..  He enjoyed watching people do their businesson glass table tops while he was lurking underneath.7.03  Aunt Lola StorySuffice to say, Don's Aunt Lola was a bit drunk at a familygathering, and cornered a teenage Donny in a walk in-closet, and gave him thetongue.  Aunt Lola died of a liver disease.7.04  Don's UncleDon's mother had a baby but then gave it to her mother (Don'sgrandmother) and she raised him, so Don's Uncle is really his half-brother.His family tried to hide it from him, but couldn't.  Don is now going todivorce his parents because they won't fess up to the information Don hasfigured out...7.05  Superjock StoryLarry Lujack worked at WLS in Chicago with Donny when he was about16 years old.  Lujack had a bit of an attitude, and a huge ego.  He woulddemand that the staff, including Don, call him Superjock.  Also, after-hours,the DJ had the 'buzzer-button' to let people in and out of thebroadcast-building.  So, the story goes, one evening, Larry Lujack, a bunchof Engineers, and Donny were working in the Air-Studio, when Don decided toleave.  When he got to the door, he realized that it was locked.  He lookedinto the security camera and said, "Hey, Larry, let me out!"  Out came a DJPuker voice, "Not until you refer to me as Superjock."  Don huffed, anddecided he would wait.  Well, Don waited for about 2 1/2 hours before hefinally gave in, and called Loojack "Superjock."  As it turns out, it was only15 minutes before another jock relieved Larry, and he pointed out that Don couldhave waited, and that guy would've let him out.  Needless to say, he was laughedat for being so stupid as to not figure that out.  Since then, Don has told thestory many times, including when Don & Buzz (Then Mike Ellston --Hey, anotherDon & Mike Show?!) worked with Lujack, and was actually threatened  with alawsuit to stop telling the story.7.06  Major Bill (R.I.P.) and ElvisMajor Bill Smith (God rest his soul) believes that Elvis is alive,or at least, that's what he'll tell you.  In truth, Don and Mike have beenable to weasel it out of him that he really doesn't believe the big E'salive at all.  He has appeared on numerous talk-shows including D&M's, JoneRivers' and Geraldo Rivera's.Once, Major Bill had someone, whom he believed was the real Elvis,call Don & Mike.  Neither of them really believed it was him, but Mike pickedup on the phony-Elvis's voice, and called Major Bill back pretending to beElvis.  He actually got the ol' Maj to believe that it was really him!  Thatwas the cause of one of the first real fights D&M and Major Bill got into.Lately, however, Major Bill seems to be being taken advantage of bysomeone he calls "The Kid."  It seems that the ol' Maj has been sending moneyto Elvis through The Kid -- about $100,000 a YEAR for the past few years.Don and Mike wanted to put a stop to this immediately, and was able toconvince Major Bill to stop it.  It's too bad there will be no more.7.07  Why Frieda has all the money (The Porsche Story)Back in LA when Donnie was beginning his "big-time" radio career at KIIS-FM,Don used to have to drive this stinking moped to and from home and theradio studio.  He got a bit caught up in the LA lifestyle, and decided hewould go out to a dealership and buy a great big Porsche.  Unfortunately, hewould have to try and keep it a secret from his wife because she wouldn't likehim spending that kind of money.  Infact, they didn't have that kind of moneyto spend.  So, Don used to park about a mile away from his house, and drivethe moped home.  Well, Frieda caught him getting into (or out of, Iforget) the Porsche, and demanded an explanation.  They argued ratherheatedly, and decided they would try and take the car back.Donnie and his child bride drove the Porsche back to the dealershipwhere the salesmen greeted him with "Hey, Donnie!  How's the car, eh?"Don, sheepishly, passed the keys over to them and said, "I can't keep thecar.  I'm giving it back."  The sales guys laughed nervously and replied,"You can't do that.  It's yours!"So, they sued 'im!7.08 The Pat Benetar StoryBack in 1979 Pat Benetar was on a record tour promoting her latest.According to Don, they met one night in a limo with Charlie Kendal, she started to kiss him, and basically, Don gave her the "Thebest night of her life."Cerf (a way too mellow, fellow DJ that worked at WAVA and WJFK) also had a wild bout of sex with Pat, but that did not occur until later.Don found out about it later when Cerf overheard Don talking about it and commented that he had also performed the dirty deed.All of this was flatly denied by Ms. Benetar when she called to promote a concert recently.7.09 Lauren TewesAh, but if we only had the time...The following is scrapped together from discussions on alt.fan.don-n-mike. Mostly from MartinB:Apparently Don was invited to a party at Lauren Tewes' house (he was livingin L.A. at the time.) If I'm not mistaken he was at a ball game (baseball) at the time and left his car at the stadium to go to the party. Once he got there he found himself surrounded by "Hollywood types" including Lauren Tewes who is (was) a coke-head. There were drugs all over the house...mounds of coke on the coffee table etc and Don got so freaked out by it that he hitthe door running and didn't slow down 'til he found a pay-phone and calledFrieda to come and rescue him.          8.00  Terms and Definitions 8.01  DBR  - Deep ball rub8.02  Jag  - From the football team "The Jaguars."  Don thoughtit sounded like a cool put down, i.e. "You Jag-off!"8.03  Jagillooly  - Perturbation of Jag (See above) and Jeff Gillooly.Another put down.8.04  Photo-mat  Said when the boys are looking at pretty girls, or are inan uncomfortable situation.8.05  Beve  - Italian for 'Drink!'  Used by RobBay.8.06  "Your finger smells like butt!"Mike had, in his sleep, scratched himself in the itchy eye (See 8.10), and thenext morning, Mike affectionately stroked fiance' (now wife) Laura's hair.  Shemade the initial exclamation.8.08  "Paint your Bald Spot?"A classic tape from the Larry King radio show where a listener asked about oneof his TV appearances where he interviewed John Candy, and he had less hairthan in a more recent interview.  The caller repeated the question over andover until, finally, Larry couldn't take it anymore.  "Aah, sick!"  Heexclaimed.8.09  "I'm a PRO-FESSIoNAL!  Look it up in the book!"Another classic tape from Larry King.  If you haven't heard it, tape theCavalcade of Comedy (network listeners may hear it at the top of the show.Locals will have a better chance at hearing it between 2:00 & 2:30.)Unbelievable!  The tape was made by Aquaman of local DC station WHFS who did itmany years ago, and mixed in some music from Planet of the Apes for dramaticeffect.  It has spawned many quips that you might hear anytime in the show,such as "I'm lost..", "It's way up there..",  and "..and don'tworryabouttheclub..",a slur that is almost unintelligible.And now, the complete transcript, and sound, of the now infamous tape of Larry King! The Larry King Rave Out I got one more question, ah I'm a student of print journalism, and I justwanted to know, ah, what advice do you have for ah ah young people comingup into the field.  Like, I uh, a lot of ah prof-profess-professors are tellingus how hard it is to get into the field for us, I'd just like to know, sinceyou're in the field if you had any advice on that.  Ferinstance, experience, is that important?Uh huh, sure.Is that the probably the most important, ah element?Well it's way up there.It's way up there?  Anything, anything else?  Anything you can-Pressure under fire..Done this before..I don't want it to be his first ahsurgery.N'kayApplied himself well..Mmm-hmmmThese are the things I'd have confidence in the young MD.Okay.  I'm talking about journalism field.I'm lost, what do you mean?J-Journalism.  I'm like..I'm I'm a student of Journalism at a college.  And Iwas just wondering the most important aspect of getting into journalism.Not the medical field.  I think you're exhausted from thirty nights.I am exhausted after thirty nights.  No no person, even those of us who aresuperhuman.  Even those of us with ah herculean appetites for the diverseand the bizarre.  Even those of us who ah, who've shown an aptitude to ah..to aaaaaahhh..fight the good fight, and stay the good long battle.  Eventhose of us can get tired.  And your boy is tired after thirty consecutivenights.  I've a half an hour to go, and I'm gonna do that half hour becauseI'm a pro.  That's what pros do.  I'm a PRO-fessional.  Look it up in thebook.Oh-kay..That's what we do, we're pros.  We're never rude, and we don't cop out.  Wedon't tell you that we're ill, or thatwe're looking for the farmhouse in the middle of the desert, or that we'reparched.  We don't tell you that maybe the check didn't come through thismonth, or where the hell does it go anyway, if you're a guy who's left 16forwarding addresses.Oh-kay.So, what do you do, what is the answer?  Yeah, you're a little perturbed, now.Kinda worried about the club?The club?No, don't worry about the club, worry about maybe..JACKY might worry..NAH,don't worry.  Okay, just cool it..Life is a breeze.  'Course some breezes, asyou know, are a hundred and ten miles an hour and get promoted upto hurricanes, I just thought I'd pass that along.  We're go-speaking ofpassing along, we're gonna pass along, now to the newsroom, the MutualNewsroom, high atop the overlooking downtown beautiful downtown studios ofRosslyn Virginia, Washington DC..The Mutual Newsroom will get us up to dateon the news headlines and we'll come back with a little more Open PhoneAmerica and we'll have our salute to my man Duke Ziebert by taking himto one ah of his favorite places, one of mine too - town of COOPERStown,New York.  This is the Larry King show in Washington, aaaand we'll beright back. 8.10  Itchy Eye  Absolutely unknown!  Probably can guess, how-ever if you imagine D&M laughing at somebodyasking to have his itchy-eye scratched.(Refers to scratching your anus. A sign ofbeing old or having bad hygene)  We all do it at some point.8.11  TeabaggingThis refers to oral sex.  Dipping ones balls in someone's mouth.  Kind of likethe motion that a teabag would make, the balls being the teabag itself.8.12  QueegRefers to G. Gordon Liddy."Queeg" was the name of the Captain of a U.S. destroyer/minesweeper inthe film "The Caine Mutiny."  He's played by Humphrey Bogart, and this isa classic movie, well worth watching.  Basically, Queeg is animcompetent, paranoid nut case, who gets the ship into danger so the crewhas to mutiny.Don & Mike refer to Liddy as "Queeg" because he talks a little bit likethe character, and apparently has over-reacted in a big way to some oftheir antics.  Watch the movie and all will become clear. 9.00  Games People Play / Recurring Bits 9.01  Low Budget Jeopardy!Opening:"And now it's time for everybody's favorite feature 'LowBudget Jeopardy!'  And now, I'd like to open the door to see which one ofMike's psychotic personalities will be the announcer.."Door opening sound, and Mike's alter ego comes in.  Long discourseusually follows, and then commercial break.Mike's alter ego will say, "Now entering the studio is" contestant1's occupation, and city of residence.  "Please say hi to " name ofcontestant 1.  Repeats for contestant 2.  "And now entering the studio isthe host of Low Budget Jeopardy, and remember DON'T SCREW WITH LQ!  Let'shave a big hand for Alex Trebec Geronimo!"Contestants make usual greetings.Don goes over the rules of the game which include, "Always call meAlex, or as we're playing the game, call me LQ - Lord Quizmaster, alwayscall him " Mike's alter ego's initials, unless otherwise stated.Rules:Two players call in, one is chosen to start off with the firstanswer, unless one is a girl to whit LQ uses the "We like girls more thanboys, so you get to go first" clause.The first player chooses a category.  There are 5 categories with 3answers in each.  Each player, once a category is chosen, MUST complete theentire category before going on to another category.  This is more for LQ'ssanity than anything else.Once the category is chosen, the dollar amount is chosen.  The dollaramounts go from $1 to $2 to $3.  Again, LQ's rules state that the player mustgo from the lowest to highest dollar amounts so as to not confuse LQ.  Theanswer is given by LQ, and the player must come up with the question matchingthe answer.Example:  The category is Celebrity Bra Sizes.  The question is 'HollyHunter."  The player must respond with "What is 34B?"The player MUST state his/her response in the form of a question.Otherwise, the response is ignored, and the second player has a chance tosteal.  To steal the right to choose the next answer, and to win the dollaramount of the category, the first player must answer incorrectly, AND thesecond must answer correctly.When all of the categories are depleted, the scores are tabulated,and the game moves to final jeopardy.  Here, LQ "physically forces [theplayers] to bet it all.."  The players are given a category and a singleanswer.  The players are then given about 30 seconds to come up with thecorrect question, again, in the form of a question.LQ, then wishes them good luck, and puts the contestants on hold,where someone answering the phones will take down the contestants' answers,and relay them on paper to LQ.  Meanwhile, Mike's alter ego tells theaudience what the losers will receive as a consolation prize.  Usuallysomething bogus like 'Rush Limbaugh's Rush to Excellence Suppositories.'Then, he will announce, "Back to Low Budget Jeopardy with Alex TrebecGeronimo."LQ will bring the contestant back where they will give theirresponses on the air.  The responses MUST match what they gave the phonescreeners moments ago, or they will be disqualified.  A correct answer willdouble the cash score, an incorrect answer will knock the player down to zero.The player with the highest dollar value will win, and have $25 addedto their score.  The loser will receive many other gifts which Mike's alterego will announce - each item separated by "But wait..there's more" fromLQ.  In the event of a tie, both players will return during the next game fora rematch.  The players will both get to keep their winnings.  In the eventboth players are knocked down to zero, then two new LBJ contestants will bechosen for the next game.The loser is always asked to "Don't go away mad, just go away."9.02  The Grey Poupon GameA player on the car phone must pull along side someone else inanother car, and ask them, while on the phone AND on the air, the following:"Pardon me, but would you have any Grey Poupon?"The player must speak THOSE words exactly.  Any deviation counts as adisqualification.  If the respondent replies with "But of course.." then theplayer wins a valuable prize.9.03  Honk For CashThe dreaded words 'Honk For Cash' are feared because the game rarelyworks out.  The player must have a car phone, AND A CAR, The player pullsinto a 'Left Turn Only' lane with a light.  The effect is best if the playeris the first or second person in line at the light, and during heavy traffic.Once the light has turned green, the player must put his phoneoutside his car window, and sit silently for 30 seconds.  For everyaggravated honk heard on the phone, the player usually gets cash.If the player speaks during those 30 seconds, or is otherwise deemedas a fraud, he is disqualified.9.04  What My Wife Doesn't Know Won't Hurt HerThis game has been modified, depending on sex, to include "What MyHusband Doesn't Know Won't Hurt Him."  Players call in with deep dark secretsthat they haven't told their respective spouses, yet.  Those with the darkestand juiciest stories get to call their spouses, and tell the story.  Usually,big arguments arise, which makes great radio.9.05  Can You Get To Ten?One of the greatest games ever created.  Don and Mike come up with 10big lies that the players have to tell, on the air, to their parents.  Theplayers must go from the first lie in order to the last.  If the parentbelieves him or her, the player wins.An example game would have lies similar in style to the following:1  Oh a whim, decided to take a flight to Las Vegas.2  Once there, I thought I might go out for a few drinks3  You won't believe it, Wayne Newton was there!4  He was falling down drunk.5  We got to talking, and really struck up great conversation.6  He passed out!7  I decided to drive him back to his hotel8  When we got there, he came to, and invited me into his hot tub.9  We got in the tub, together.10 We had glorious three-way sex.The game is especially funny if the contestant is male.  Also, D&Mhave been known to drag out the comedic value of the bit by not getting backon the phone, and letting the parent know that this was all staged.9.06  The Donny CountdownThere's a little radio station playing inside Don's head, and sincethere aren't any Radio Stations in Washington DC that play any good musicconsistently, Don comes up with what he believes are the top 20 songs of thetime period (Week, Day, whatever).  Hosted by Donny, Buzz, Sherri, andanother Mike O'Meara Personality.  Rush Limbaugh makes a good guest-host.9.07  RobBay Dials for TransvestitesMr. Spiewak calls 1-900 numbers, usually Hot-Transvestite numbers,and pretends he's a pre-operative transsexual named 'Delores.'  Deloresdoesn't like being laughed at.  Probably, the funniest bit to date!9.08  Charly-gramsOnly as Charly can, Charly will call somebody during a specialholiday, usually at the request of a listener, and wish them a HappyBirthday, or other festive greeting.  A mere description does not give thisbit justice!  It is another must-hear!9.09  Who Would You Do?Someone would ask the men in the room, or on the phone, if they couldonly have sex with one or another of two or more choices, which would youchoose.  i.e. Who would you do, Rosanne or Delta Burke?  The answer, Rosanne,of course..9.10  The Phonebooth ChallengeDon would announce the location of a phone booth in a couple ofcities, and call them several minutes later.  The location (city) with themost people congregated at a single phone booth will win valuable prizes.9.11  Phonebooth OlympicsContestant will wait at a predetermined phonebooth for Don & Mike tocall.  Don would then point out the location of another phonebooth close by,and have the contestant sprint over to the other location - sometimes SEVERALlocations.9.12  Portable Phone DestructionContestant would try and find the most entertaining method ofdemolishing his/her portable phone.  The destruction with the most'character' wins valuable prizes.  Good contestants have driven cars overthem, burned them with kerosene, smashed them with hammers, sawed them inhalf with power-saws, ran over them with lawnmowers, but the best one was aguy who swallowed his phone! (headset phone and he had to guzzle pepto-bismolto get it to go down)9.13  Spoons in the DryerContestants are encouraged to put many NOISY things in thedryer, sometimes, even their phones.  The dryer with the most interestingsounds crashing through them wins!  Good contestants have had shards ofglass, spoons, and bowling balls in the dryer.9.14  Send us your Balls!Double Entendre for contestants to send Don & Mike their golf-balls,beachballs, soccer balls, etc. with their names, addresses and so on fordrawings for valuable prizes.9.15  The Don & Mike BowlWas flag football for charity (the Have a Heart Campaign forabused kids) with former and current Redskins.  Last year raised $50,000,and this year was softball because Don broke his hand (FINGER!), anddoesn't wanna get hurt.9.16  Eat the Apple Game!One of D&M's famous bits that can only be done successfully onlocation.  Couples are chosen out of the audience, and the female(usually) places an apple, WEDGES it, you know, right THERE!  The male,usually, gets down on his knees and munches on the apple all the wayaround.  The couple with the quickest 'eat' wins a valuable prize.9.17  Home-Made jingle contest!Listeners are encouraged to send in jingles and D-n-M judge them andpick the best.  To the winner goes a thousand dollars.  There have been threeso far and they were great.  You can hear old entries in the cavalcadesome days.9.18  Highway Love ConnectionSomeone, usually with a celluar phone (D&M will let someone slide on apayphone depending on their mood), will go to a disclosed/popular locationlooking for love.  The caller will give their description of themselves,including their likes/dislikes/personality/occupation/the type of personthey're looking for, etc.  The idea is for someone to listen for the location,and if they like what they hear, they will go and meet the caller.  D&Mwill usually give them a dinner together, and some cheesy outing.  Some ofthese dates have been successful.9.19  Slam-O-RammaRelated to "Spoons in the dryer" (See 9.13).  The object of the game isnoise, noise, and more noise.  A caller will be sure to have lots of itemsin his refridgerator, items which will make a lot of noise.  A good examplewould be glass bottles, or anything breakable..  The person with the loudestsound will win.  D&M will go for the breakage sound.  One guy from KS made hisfridge shudder, shake, rattle and roll for 14.9 seconds.  Although most thinkit was a fake, I guess it's possible if you repeatedly slam the door.9.20 The Vibrator OlympixThis is a game where women call up, hoping to impress Don and Mike with thesound of their vibrator.  The caller is usually asked what the name of thevibrator is.  Sometimes, men will call up with their partner's vibrator.Don and Mike usually speculate that it is really the man's vibrator, butthat he won't admit it.  The object is to find the mostloud/annoying/interesting vibrator sound.  This person usually wins thisparticular contest.9.21  The "My Two Dicks" songDon wrote this after talking about the Bewitched television, show, StarringDick Sargeant and Dick York as Daren Stevens.  It'll make sense as you readthem.Sung to the theme to BEWITCHEDThey're my two Dicks, oh yes they're my two DicksFirst there was York, such a dickThen I changed to Sergeant, hey what a trickI love two Dicks, they're great to have aroundI'm always smiling -- with two Dicks why frown?I'm the witch with the most fun -- can't you seeJust one more Dick--and I'd have threeThey're my two Dicks, oh yes they're my two DicksAnd come what may, I'm proud to tell you thisI'd pass on a love-filled night with the New York Knicks'Cause I'm the witch with two dicks!9.22  Strip TriviaOne of the most beloved games that Don & Mike play.  In this game, the boys trollthe phones for contestants.  They will break in to whatever they're doing totake calls from women, but will take 5 seconds to fill up the roster of men forthe game.  Once assembled in the studio, Don will read questions out of TheTrivial Pursuit book.  The women are ,of course, in the studio with the boys,while the men go over to Buzz's studio with Robbay.  Everyone is introduced tothe listening audience, and then the game begins!Each member has to have five articles of clothing on to start.  As Don asksquestions, people will remove clothing depending on whether the answer iscorrect or not.  If it is, the next person will get a shot.  If it isn't, thenthat person must remove one article of clothing.  The object of the game is tokeep going around until all the people are naked except the one person who isleft clothed.  That is your winner.  All the naked people must run out of theroom to the tune of some sexy sauntry music, where their close await them.During the game, the boys are treated to women doing the "bra thing/trick",while the men (also viewing the nudity of the opposite sex) will be sprayedwith Lysol as they take their clothes off.  The idea is that men really stink,so it is needed.  Robbay usually handles the spraying duties.  Sometimes, thewomen do little dances/flashes for the guys as they are either leaving the room,or while they are topless.  Some of the women are comfy with their nudity,thus will hang around for a few extra seconds.  All the testosterone in thebuilding (as well as listening to the radio) always enjoys this.  (Fill up thebathtub!)  Other times, Don & Mike will not get to look at all because the womenrun out of the room so fast to pick up their clothing.  (What a shame!)9.23  The I Love You Drive-through GameEach car phone contestant must drive through a fastfood drive-through window, andall they are allowed to say is, "I love you!"  If the person on the other endresponds with, "I love you, too!", then you will win.9.24  Bitch, bitch, bitch!Look out guys!  After hearing this game, you'll wonder where your gun is to avoidthat kind of commotion about you by your SO.Don & Mike get women to call and bitch about their husband/boyfriend.  The bestbitch wins.  (enuff said.)9.25  It's all RelativePeople call up and answer questions posed by the boys about the caller's relative.They then call the relative in question, and if that relative answers/matcheswhat the callers' responses were, he/she wins.9.26  The Bark-off for CashSimply put, Don & Mike get the owners of dogs to call up and make their dogsbark.  $1 per bark will be had, and the caller with the most barks will winthe amount of barks combined.9.27  Yo-Ho, Momma!A caller will give D&M a number of their Mom (or whom ever may answer the phone),and all the caller is allowed to say is, "Yo-Ho, Momma!" (or whatever D&M tellthem to say.  The object is to keep the person called on the phone for 60 seconds.If they hangup, then you lose.  If D&M are amused, they may keep you going for 5 minutes before they break into let you know that y9u were successful.9.28  Kill, Maim, or TortureSimilar to the above game.  A caller will tell D&M whom they'd love to kill,maim or torture in their family.  D&M then call a relative and pose the samequestions.  If the relatives' answers/responses match, then the game is won.9.29  Guess The WhoopieD&M ask a caller "When was the last time your parents made love/filled theirmarrital obligations?"  If the Mom or Dad gets the date within 24 hours ofthe callers' guess, then you have a winner.9.30  The Don & Mike CommandmentsIn late 1993 Don & Mike were issuing daily commandments as part of acalling contest.  Here is that list:1)      Buzz is Mike Elsten.2)      Bitchy women equal foxes.3)      Good looking guys equal morons.4)      Good Morning (insert city name), is a good idea for the name of a        TV show.5)      Nobody's home.6)      People piss Don off.7)      Be nice to mom.8)      I wish we were on TV.9)      All French women have hairy underarms.10)     Women with hairy underarms are unattractive.11)     Joe Jacoby is God.12)     People who love Hairy Anderson are stupid.13)     Jim J. Buttocks has good cheek bones.14)     Going through tapes on carts is a good idea.15)     Jurassic is a good new word.16)     Everybody hates Hairy Anderson.17)     Advertisers are greedy bloodsuckers.18)     Don't trust Roger.19)     Dennis Murphy is a mad viking.20)     You can't get VD from a toilet seat.21)     Billy Reed is not a man.22)     If it smells like cologne, leave it alone.23)     Push on the vagina.24)     Stop the 'Stop the Insanity' Lady.25)     Buzz Burbank made a funny.26)     Mike O'Meara-he ain't no circus clown.27)     God is an American.28)     God speaks American English.29)     Mike O'Meara had to ice down his genitals.30)     If you can tea bag, you can come to work.31)     You can get sicker from a baby than you can from a toilet seat.9.31 Tube the TellerOnly contestants with small cellular phones can play. The contestant drives up to a bank with aDrive-Up and a pneumatic tube (it's really important, and someone usually tries to do it with aDriveUp drawer). The contestants tells the teller what's going on, that they are going to send theirphone through the tube and to say "Hello" when the phone gets there. The real trick is that the phonehas to stay on-line (so to speak). We are treated to the sound of the phone being beaten to a pulpby the journey, and the waves of static that are generated from all of the metal and machinery. 10.00  Other Information 10.01  Contacts1-800-636-1067 STUDIO1-800-636-6410 FAX1-703-691-1607 INFO LINE1-703-691-1900 Switchboard to WJFK.

If you can laugh at yourself, laugh at others,have a good time, and to not be a tight-ass/sensative about every little thing,then the show is just for you.  Also, a childish atitude/6th grade humor/personalitywouldn't hurt, either. Other Sites Here are other dudes and dudettes who dig Don and Mike and have created tributes to the Radio Gods.

That, or blowing up Communists. Man, 1991 really screwed up my life's plans...Anyway, I must compliment you on an amazing web site. The Don and Mike section is amazing, and your resume is top-notch. I hope in about twenty years mine looks half as good. At my current pace, it'll probably be half the size, too.Just one little addition though, please. Could you include some mention of Buddy the Parrot? One of my good friends is Big Don O'Brien (of Brian and O'Brien fame) and through him, I got to meet the Don in the D & M show. Anyway, Big Don and I lived in Ocean City for a while, where I was his trusty radio sidekick/monkeyboy/roommate at 95.9 The Coast. He would always talk about Buddy the Parrot, at least, when he wasn't smoking a cigarette.When the two Dons and I were sitting on the beach this summer, with the young Bart in the background, they started laughing about Buddy the Headless Parrot. Both Dons had tears in their eyes.When Don G. got off vacation, Big Don called into the D&M show, and they laughed about Buddy AGAIN. Here's the problem--all I know of this story is that some damned parrot lost his widdle head. Do you have any information that could help me out? Big Don won't tell me anything, except listen to D&M around Christmas.Any info/related stories/juicy dirt would be greatly received.Raymond L.

Now it's pretty darn boring.Hope you folks are all doing well.the10pin@aol.com Subj:  D&MDate:  Wed, Nov 8, 1995 7:07 PM EDTFrom:	7498947@mcimail.com (Jeff Rodriguez)To:	voxtalent@aol.comThanks for providing a ray of hope to one who has not heard D&M in 5 months since moving to Dallas from D.C.

They've kept DnM on the weak signaled WCMB (and the rest of the previous CMB programming in tact) for fear of another Harrisburg station grabbing them.  For as bad as IMX's ratings were, they (DnM) were beginning to grab major afternoon numbers right before the sale.JC Subj:  Good thing it wasn't Alpo!Date:  Tue, Nov 7, 1995 5:50 PM EDTFrom:  dmorgan@eagle1.eaglenet.comTo:	voxtalent@aol.comDear Don,Hi Baby! I have lots of sympathy for you! I don't think people realizewhat dogfood is really made of. I have a story to tell you. About 5 years ago we were opening a can of dogfood (Alpo) by the way and much to our surprise inside was a whole chicken foot, skin, nails and all. You can just imagine the shock. We were goingto consult the company or sue but unfortunately we couldn't becauseof the way they wrote up the ingredients. It stated "chicken part". Well that definitely falls under the category of chicken parts. But don'tworry Don, our dog "Tippy" lived for 17 years. That's 119 to you andme. And she didn't die of food poisoning, she died of liver disease andold age.  So don't worry you still have a few good dog years left in you!Sincerely, Debbie Morgan, Hollywood, MDP.S. I tried to call and tell you the story, yesterday, but some rude screener withsome accent I couldn't understand hung up on me.P.S.S. I love you guys, you entertain me everyday after work.Oh and I shouldn't forget...Hi Mike, Hi Buzz, Hi Sherry and if that wasyou Robbe' that hung up on me then I won't say hi, but if it wasn't...well then...Hi to you too!

New! The Third Annual Don and Mike Bowl Don and Mike From "Washingtonian" Magazine (Early '94). They described Don as a little boywhose mother dressed him up for the interview and this picture. Mike on theother hand was a "vision of hip propriety" (college guy). Good article and funnystory of how Mike pissed off a fellow motorist in the parking lot of therestaurant by stealing her spot. He rushed in to where Don and the interviewerwere, followed shortly by the woman whom he had just stolen the spot from. Rightafter this picture was taken, big scene, great press, Mike acted like a wimp. Shari Shari posed for a "Washington Post Weekender" article about "Glamour Shots" aplace where you go in, get made up and dressed up and have your picture taken.

WE CAN: PREPARE UNIQUE FORMULATIONS "….. I was so very pleased to find a pharmacy which could make the medication that I had been taking for years. My doctor wanted me to continue to take it, but I could not find it anywhere. The Pharmacist at the Professional Compounding Pharmacy made my medication by using the pure ingredient chemicals. My husband and I are grateful to have found such a pharmacy. Samantha Dochs Mpls., MN "…..My Doctor came up with a very special formula that he had read about in a Medical Journal. He was so sure that it would help my condition, but he did not know of a Pharmacy that would be able to make it. The formula had over ten different chemicals. My Doctor was happy and so was I when I found out that you could make my medicine. It is working great and I thank you. Greg Idels Mpls., MN CHANGE DOSAGES AND STRENGTHS "….. I needed a special strength of a medication based on my blood levels. This strength was not available from any pharmaceutical manufacturer. The Professional Compounding Pharmacy made me a capsule of the exact strength that my Doctor ordered. I believe the pharmacist really saved my life. Tony Arnet St. Paul, MN "…..when one cannot swallow pills or capsules, it gets very difficult to take medication. I was so sick and the medication I was to take was available in tablet form only. My Doctor told me to check with the Professional Compounding Pharmacy to see if the pharmacist could make the medication into a liquid so I could swallow it. I called the pharmacist and he told me of course they could. I was able to take the exact medication my Doctor ordered for me and swallow it. It even tasted good. Thank-you, Professional Compounding Pharmacy. Scott Wright Rosemount, MN CHANGE FLAVORS AND COLORS "…..my son would not take his antibiotic no matter how or what I tried to do to make him take it. My next door neighbor suggested I go to the Professional Compounding Pharmacy in Minneapolis, that they could help me. I did. The pharmacist there changed the flavor of my son’s antibiotic to rasberry. (my son’s favorite flavor). They had over 45 different flavoring agents. My son now takes his antibiotic without fighting with me. Bev Loktor Richfield, MN "…..I am allergic to certain dyes. I react very badly to certain ones. Well, my Doctor gave me a prescription for a medication that I needed. When I went to the pharmacy it was the exact color that I was allergic to. I asked the pharmacist if it was available in a different color. He said " no that it only came that way." I did not know what to do. I knew that I needed that exact medication but without the dye and that my Doctor wanted me to start taking it right away. The pharmacist suggested I contact the Professional Compounding Pharmacy. I did and they were able to make my medicine in a capsule with the exact medication that my Doctor ordered without the color. …… Scott Tenaka Eden Praire, MN ELIMINATE PRESERVATIVES "….. My Doctor told me he thought that I was allergic to the Preservative in my eye drops. I needed to find a preservative free eye drop. The Professional Compounding Pharmacy prepared a preservative-free sterile eye drop for me. I have no reactions to it and I use it several times a day. Tina Busher Mpls, MN MAKE COMBINATION MEDICATIONS "…..my brother was in a hospice situation, but we decided to bring him home instead. He was taking a lot of pills. Eleven tablets at one time. Some were the same but he had to take several of them to get the amount that he needed to take. By the time he swallowed all of them he was almost always ready to vomit. The Pharmacist at the Professional Compounding Pharmacy suggested that they make capsules of the eleven tablets that my brother was taking so he would not have to take so many at once. The pharmacist was able to reduce the number he had to take to 3 capsules. Thanks to the Professional Compounding my brother was able to spend his last few day much more comfortable.
