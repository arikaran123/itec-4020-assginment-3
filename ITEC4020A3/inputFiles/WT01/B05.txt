Anyone with an electric, hybrid electric or solar electric motorcycle, sedan, utility vehicle, or mass transit vehicle. Energy storage systems may include batteries, fuels cells, flywheels, and on-board generators using liquid or gaseous fuel. The Race: How It Work & Scoring: Each day, the vehicles will be required to drive 60-70 miles. At the stopovers, cars may drive extra miles to accumulate "Tour Miles. "Tour Miles' is the sum of distance run within a given time frame, minus distance penalties for arrival time variations and rule infractions, as well as distance credits for successfully completed optional laps. The scoring system makes efficiency and driving range the key to winning. Speed is a factor, however, as there is a restricted amount of driving time. Range capabilities, and efficiency will be measured and acknowledged. 1994 Defending Champtions: Production Category: Pennsylvania Electric Transp Council with a Ford Ecostar using an ABB NaS battery American Commuter: Solectria Corporation, Wilmington, MA, in a Solectria RS using an Ovonics Nickel Metal Hydride battery Solar Racing Category: Salisbury High School, Salisbury, CT, and Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA Open Category: Schiller Power Group, of Germany and Team New England, Cambridge, MA.

NOTES ON TODAY'S COMPETITION: Crowd Estimates: The final day of the American Tour de Sol saw crowds turnout in each race location. An estimated 1,300 people were on hand as vehiclesleft Dover, NH for the final leg of the five day race. Nearly 3,000 peoplegreeted the winning vehicles as they crossed the finish line in downtownPortland, ME. The crowd roared loudest as a local high school entry fromFalmouth, ME arrived. Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course overcast, dry roads. Special Events or Occurrences: First vehicle across the finish line was theSolectria Sunrise, the same car that set the event range record of 238 mileswithout charging in yesterday's competition. Of the nearly four dozenentrants, only a few (3) were unable to reach the end of the race under theirown power. "This has been the most successful events we've ever had," saidrace director Nancy Hazard. "Vehicle performance has been outstanding and thepublic reaction has been overwhelming wherever we went." Race officialsestimate more than 45,000 people turned out to view vehicles along the raceroute and at public displays along the way. Preview of Next Day: All the competing vehicles will be on display throughoutthe day in downtown Portland. Tomorrow, Saturday, vehicles will be on displayand will compete in local events as part of the Maine Solar Blast Festival.

H.S.in Lexington, MA brought out more than 1,500 people despite some earlyshowers. Later, in Exeter, NH a huge, cheering crowd estimated at nearly3,000 people greeted the race teams. Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course overcast, wet roads, challenging forsolar vehicles. Special Events or Occurrences: Exeter is a tiny town in Southern NH (pop.about 9,000) but nearly 3,000 people visited the midday display and startingline. "There were so many people crowded around every vehicle, you couldhardly see any of the vehicles," said Nancy Hazard, race director. ATdS Technical Director Dr. Rob Wills reports that special measurements are beingdone as vehicles recharge. The measurements are part of an electricutility-sponsored research program to prepare local electric companies forincreased demand for power as electric cars become more common. "The electriccompanies know that electric vehicles are on the horizon," said Wills. "Theywant to make sure they know how to handle them properly right from thebeginning." In addition to the large crowds, Exeter, NH had a bandstand andlive music. Race vehicles had to be carefully guided through crowds ofdancing youngsters as they began their afternoon trip to Dover, NH. Preview of Next Day: After spending the evening in Dover, NH, nearly fourdozen race vehicles will be on display Friday morning in Dover. At 10 a.m.,cars will race the final leg to downtown Portland, ME. After crossing thefinish line, there will be a public display at Monument Square throughout theafternoon. Vehicles will be on display and compete in events at the MaineSolar Blast on Saturday.

"There is no doubt," says technical director Dr.Robert Wills, "that the people working in electric vehicles are making greatstrides each year as measured by their vehicles' performance in this event." Hundreds of school children visited the electric and solar vehicle display inKeene. For the first time in event history, youngsters sought autographs fromrace team members. College and high school teams were especially popular withkids. "We were amazed to see children chasing after drivers to getautographs," said race director Nancy Hazard. "It was so exciting to see ourteams treated like celebrities. They were all surprised and pleased at theattention." Youngsters gathered around race teams and spent nearly two hoursasking questions about cars, batteries, solar-power and environmental issues. Largest crowds gathered around the futuristic-looking solar-powered racingcars. Preview of Next Day: Thursday, displays in Lexington, MA; Exeter, NH; andDover, NH. Because of the number of race "legs" on Thursday, several teamswill have an opportunity to set range and distance records. Friday, nearlyfour dozen vehicles are expected to cross the finish line in downtownPortland, ME.

Email to NESEA, care of: GrohPR@aol.com Environmental and Energy Fact Sheets NESEA Fact Sheets Electric Vehicle Backgrounder History: The history of electric cars is longer than that of internal combustion vehicles. The first electric car was built in Scotland in 1837, by Robert Davidson. EV's were widely produced in the 1880's when the lead acid battery was perfected. 2,000 taxi cabs were manufactured for New York's Fifth Avenue Coach Co. 1892 - First production electric car created a sensation when exhibited in Chicago. 1899 - Belgian-built electric racing car "La Jamais Contente" (Never Satisfied) set a world land speed record of 68 mph. In 1902 that record was broken by a gasoline powered car, and the gas car has retained that record. 1910 - electric vehicle's first heyday and were a favorite of the women. They were clean, quiet and easy to start. 1913 - twenty companies were producing 6,000 electric vehicles and trucks per year. By 1930, the introduction of the electric starter, and Ford's Model T had virtually eliminated electric vehicle companies. 1973 - Oil Embargo and a resurgence of interest in electric vehicles. 1976 - Congress passed the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research and Development Act over protests from Detroit, and the veto of then President Gerald Ford. By 1977, Japan had 13,000 EV's in operation, Great Britain had 70,000 and the United States had 3,000 with projections of 25 million by the year 2000. Gas prices were then lowered and the electric car declined again. The 1980's saw the resurgence of the electric car as races such as the Tour de Sol in Switzerland started in 1982, and the World Solar Challenge in Australia in 1987. Characteristics and Technology: Travel at normal road speeds. Acceleration comparable to gasoline cars. Range 60-150 miles on a single battery charge. 1991 - US Advanced Battery Consortium formed by GM, Ford, Chrysler, EPRI, and US DOE to do battery research. Battery breakthroughs announced almost weekly! Leading contenders for near-term include: Advanced Lead Acid, Nickel Iron, Nickel Cadmium, Nickel Metal Hydride, Sodium Sulfur. Farther term possibles include Lithium Polymer, Zinc Bromine, Aluminum Air batteries etc. Hydrogen fuel cell technology has the capability of increasing vehicle range to 300 miles, rapid recharge times, and is completely pollution-free if the hydrogen is produced from a pollution-free renewable energy source. Flywheels made of lightweight materials and magnetic bearings claim promises of 300-600 mile ranges for cars. Today in the USA: Five companies are producing EVs in the U.S. on a one-by-one basis (Solectria, Electric Vehicles of America, Solar Car Corp., Solar Electric Engineering, Sebring Automotive). Numerous other companies are converting existing gasoline cars to electric propulsion. The big three are producing 50-100 EVs for the utility fleet market in 1993. GM's Impact III, Chrysler's TEVan, Ford's Ecostar panel truck. Various European and Japanese car companies (BMW, VW, Nissan, Toyota, etc.) are positioning themselves to offer electric cars by the mid 1990s for the market created in California and the Northeast by Clean Air Legislation. Latest announcements include electric hybrid prototypes by Volvo and Mercedes Benz. Two companies are producing electric buses: Specialty Vehicles and Electra Car. Hydrogen prototypes: Energy Partners has a hydrogen fuel cell car on the road. Hydrogen fuel cell prototype buses have been produced by Ballad, and H-Power. Two EV dealerships have opened in California - Green Motor Works and Pacific Electric Vehicles, which carry the Danish Kewet and the Danish City El respectively. In July 1993, the U.S. Department of Defense invested $25 million in five EV consortia throughout the country. Further investment is expected for R & D, education and demonstration programs. NESEA Fact Sheets The Automobile, Energy and the Environment Oil and Transportation: Transportation uses 63% of all the oil used in this country (Source: US DOE/EIA-1989). U.S. oil is imports exceeded 50% in 1994 for the first time in history. The earth will run out of affordable oil in 43-46 years if we continue to use oil at the same rate as today. (We use 21.7 billion barrels/yr, of the 1000 billion barrels estimated in reserves) [Source: U.S. Department of Energy / Energy Information Association, Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquid Reserves, 1989.] The Environment: Burning 1 gallon of gasoline yields 22 lbs. of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. Air pollution has been named the #1 health threat to Americans by the American Lung Assn. Transportation causes up to 60-90% of urban air pollution, and 55% of the air pollution in the Northeast. Transportation produces the following percentages of overall air pollutants in the U.S.: 30% of U.S. carbon dioxide - the greenhouse gas. 76% of carbon monoxide - causes suffocation and becomes the greenhouse gas. 41% of nitrous oxide (NOx) - creates ground level ozone and becomes nitric acid. 38% of hydrocarbons (methane and volatile organic compounds, VOC's) - creates ground level ozone and becomes hydrochloric acid, a major source of acid rain. 5% sulfur oxide (SOx) - becomes sulfuric acid, a major source of acid rain. 23% particulate emissions - causes respiratory diseases. 25% of CFC emissions - destroys outer atmospheric ozone which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Electric vehicles (EVs) have zero emissions at the tail pipe. If electricity for EVs is produced in today's power plants in the NE, emissions are reduced by 27% If electricity for EVs is produced by wind, and solar technologies, EVs are pollution-free. (Source: Steering a New Course, by Deborah Gordon, Union of Concerned Scientists, 1991) Economics: Oil imports are the cause of 1/3 of the trade deficit (1994) The U.S. spent $600 million each day during the war in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. plans to spend a total of $159.8 million in 1991 on developing renewable sources of energy which could eliminate our need for imported oil. Other "hidden" costs associated with gasoline powered transportation: Health care costs....................................................... $93 billion/yr (79 cents/gal used)Lost productivity due to traffic congestion.......................... $73 billion/yr (62 cents/gal)Traffic accidents and fatalities......................................... $72 billion/yr (61 cents /gal)Military protection of oil in Mid East (pre war)..................... $12 billion/yr (37 cents/gal)(Source: Steering a New Course, by Deborah Gordon, Union of Concerned Scientists, 1991) Renewable energy is clean, creates jobs in the U.S., and keeps U.S. money at home. Other proposed Alternatives: Cars that run on ethanol, methanol and compressed natural gas produce less emissions than conventional automobiles, but savings are only in the 20-50% range, and do not appreciably reduce carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas. (Source: Environmental Action, July 1989) Electric rail can reduce emissions by 50-90%. (Source: Mass Transit: Clean Air Alternative, a report by the American Public Transit Assn.) Increased fuel efficiency standards are helpful, but gains are negated by increased vehicle miles traveled. NESEA Fact Sheets Legislation and the EV Market in the Northeast 1990 Clean Air Act: The Clean Air Act states that only the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) can promulgate regulations for engine emissions. Each state whose air violates the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) must submit a state implementation plan which include programs for reducing pollution from "mobile" sources e.g. automobiles, and "stationary" sources, e.g. factories or power plants. California Clean Air Requirements: California's new rules require an increasing percentage of an auto maker's fleet to meet progressively tighter emission standards. Four different categories of low emission vehicles (LEV) are defined and given production goals. Electric vehicles are defined as zero-emission vehicles - the cleanest possible. 2% of the cars manufactured and offered for sale must be zero-emission vehicles by 1998. The percentage of EVs is increased to 5% in 2001, 10% in 2003, and 70% in 2010. National Energy Strategy, 1992: Continues to promote fuel efficient cars by targeting: Improved fleet fuel efficiency. Development of cost effective alternative transportation fuels. Increased overall transportation system efficiency. The above is accomplished by retiring older cars, and accelerating R&D on alternative fuels and cars. Energy Policy Act: 1992 (EPAct) Applicable Federal Fleets: 25% of new car purchases must be alternative fueled vehicles. This increases to 33% in FY'97, 50% in FY'98, 75% in FY '99. State Fleets: Must begin purchasing light duty alternative fueled vehicles beginning in 1996. Starting at 10%, this increases to 15% in '97, 20% in '98, 50% in '99, 75% in 2000. Municipal and private fleets: Will be required to buy alternative fueled fleets beginning in 1999 if suitable vehicles and infrastructure are available. The Northeast: All Northeast States, with the exception of Vermont, are currently in violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Ozone, and most states have one or more carbon monoxide non-attainment areas (Automobiles contribute 50-75% of the pollutants in the Northeast). Massachusetts and New York have zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates in place and are preparing to implement the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program. A recent ruling by the EPA, on request by the Ozone Transport Commission, encourages Northeast states to begin development of state plans that will require much lower and/or zero emission vehicles throughout the region by the end of the century. The purchase and use of electric vehicles by private sector "fleets" and by individuals will be a key component of the Northeast states plans to reduce automobile emissions and protect public health. NESEA Fact Sheets Glossary of Terms Efficiency - the efficiency of an electric car is measured in miles per kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity, which typically costs 8-12 cents. Efficiency usually refers to the amount of energy drawn from the battery to enable the car to drive down the road. Typically, an electric sedan can drive 4-9 miles on one kwh. Utility vehicles such as vans and pick-ups drive 1-5 miles on one kwh. Motor scooters, one person solar racing cars can achieve driving efficiencies of 18-26 miles per kwh, or 250 miles for $1.00. Efficiency depends on the weight and aerodynamics of the car, and the efficiency of the motor and drive train. Other efficiencies which are not considered above, but are looked at by the NESEA Energy Challenge, include electrical generation, electrical distribution, charger and battery efficiencies. Electric Vehicle (EV) - a car, bus, van, or motorcycle with an electric motor which is powered by electricity stored in a battery, flywheel or fuel cell. EV - see electric vehicle Flywheel - a mechanical device that stores energy by spinning an object at very high speeds. Fuel Cell - battery-like unit that converts a fuel, such as hydrogen or methanol directly to electricity. Grid, or Electric grid - network of transmission lines, substations, distribution lines, and transformers used in transmitting electricity from power plants to users. Grid Power - electricity generated and distributed by a large electric utility company. Grid Charged - charged from electricity generated by a large electric utility company. Hybrid Electric Cars - a car that has both an electric motor and a small fossil fuel powered internal combustion engine generating electricity, or flywheel, or fuel cell. The fossil fuel powered generators run at constant speed so they are very efficient, usually complying with the ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) specifications set by California. LEV - Low Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Non-polluting - does not produce substances commonly recognized as harmful to humans or the earth. Common air pollutants are carbon dioxide, sulfurous oxides, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, and CFC's (see FACT SHEET: Transportation, Energy and the Environment) Photovoltaics, or PV - a device that converts light directly into electricity. Photovoltaics produce direct current or DC current and are sometimes referred to as solar cells, photovoltaic cells, or PVs. Production Prototype - a product, or car, which is being considered for mass production. PV - see photovoltaics. Range - the distance an electric car can travel before the batteries need to be recharged. Solar - of, derived from, or relating to the sun. Produced or operated by the action of the sun's light or heat. Electricity generated directly from the sun's light = solar electricity. Heat generated by the sun = solar thermal energy. Solar thermal energy may ultimately be converted to electricity. Some people consider wind a form of solar energy. Solar Car, Solar/electric Car, or Solar-assisted Electric Car - an electric car whose batteries are charged wholly or partially by electricity produced by photovoltaic cells which are installed on the car. PV panels can produce enough electricity to travel from 5-250 miles per day. The range is dependent upon the size (sq. ft) and efficiency of the PV cells, and the efficiency of the car itself. Commuter cars typically gain 5-15 miles per day, while some racing cars can travel 250 miles on a sunny day. Solar Electricity - electricity which is produced by the light from the sun. The photovoltaic cell is the mechanism used for the electrical generation. Solar Cells - see photovoltaics. Torque - a force that produces, or tends to produce rotation and the measure of the effectiveness of that force.

Therace begins Monday May 22 in Waterbury, Connecticut. The winning vehicleswill cross the finish line in Portland, Maine five days later. This year'srace features entries from major automakers (Ford), a celebrity race team(headed by actor Dennis Weaver), top student teams and entries from as faraway as Japan and Germany. The American Tour de Sol ends on Memorial Day weekend and provides aninteresting contrast to the Indy 500 race run on the same weekend. "At thesame time Indy cars are roaring to victory in the national spotlight," saysNancy Hazard of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, "these electriccars are quietly revolutionizing auto technology. They can help ease theUnited States trade deficit by cutting oil imports and create jobs here athome. At the same time, they keep the country cleaner and can cut the cost oftreating air pollution-related illness. This isn't some starry-eyed dream -the technology is available today!" One of the key goals of the American Tour de Sol is to show that these new vehicle technologies are viable. "A major concern about electric cars hasbeen their driving range," says Hazard, "but after more than ten thousandmiles of daily commuter use in Vermont, the state's electric vehicle projecthas yet to log one complaint tied to vehicle range." Over the six-yearhistory of the American Tour de Sol, range records have been consistently setand broken. In last year's event, a Ford Ecostar traveled 189 miles and aSolectria Force traveled 214 miles, both without recharging. Both of thesecompanies have electric vehicles available on the market. Nearly fifty vehicles will run through two days of testing in Waterburyprior to the race start. Along the route, there will be nearly a dozen localstops where the race cars will be displayed to the public. Once the race endsin Portland, another day is set aside for displays and exhibits. Vehiclescompeting this year include solar-powered racers, practical commutervehicles, production cars already on the market, hybrid vehicles which useelectric motors in combination with an auxiliary generator, and specialvehicles such as buses, motorcycles and scooters. Speed, range and efficiency are all factored into the scoring system.Vehicles that travel the farthest and use the least electricity per mile havethe advantage. In fact, one of the many prizes offered is called the "NESEAEnergy Challenge." This prize is given to the vehicle that uses the leastamount of energy to drive the entire 300 mile course.

Two vehicles competing in the nationalchampionship American Tour de Sol road rally broke event records late onThursday, one day before the end of this annual competition. One teamrepresents a top electric vehicle manufacturer, the other a small high schoolin Connecticut. A four-seater sedan built by Solectria Corporation of Massachusetts traveleda record 238 miles without stopping to recharge during day four of the fiveday race. The car, known as the Sunrise, is a pre-production prototype whichthe company is developing for the U.S. market. It is powered by advancednickel metal hydride batteries manufactured by Ovonic of Troy. MI. [This picture was taken in Lexington and as you can see, it's hard to see it due to the number of people admiring it.] Another event record was set by a team of veteran electric vehicle buildersand designers from Bolton (CT) High School. Their vehicle, called the SolarBolt, traveled 143 miles, a record performance for a vehicle powered only bycommon, lead-acid batteries - the same type of batteries used to startregular gasoline powered cars. The Bolton High School students have built andraced electric vehicles for three years and broke the record they setthemselves in last year's race. "We have been waiting all week for this to happen," said race technicaldirector Dr. Rob Wills. "In pre-race testing we were all impressed by thesevehicles and knew they had the capability of breaking records. Today, thesuspense ended." Groups of drivers and race officials stood and cheered asthe two vehicles returned to a display area set up in Dover, NH. Both record-setting vehicles are entered in the Discovery Channel CommuterCategory, designed for practical, commuter-style electric vehicles capable ofcarrying more than one passenger. "We wanted to show that we can produce an electric car with range, comfortand affordability - and the Sunrise is that car," said Solectria spokespersonMark Dockser. "When the electric vehicle mandates go into effect in 1988, wewant to give buyers the option they've been looking for."

First vehicle across the finish was the Sunrise, a pre-productionprototype car built by Massachusetts-based Solectria Corporation which, oneday earlier, had set the event record, traveling 238 miles withoutrecharging. The Sunrise was also the overall top finisher in the week-longAmerican Tour de Sol national championship road rally for electric and solarelectric vehicles. The second top finisher was a Solectria-built Force GT raced and sponsoredby a team from the Virginia Power Company. The third finisher and also thetop finishing utility vehicle in the event, was a Ford Ecostar sponsored andraced by Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities. Both the Force GT and theEcostar are currently in production and available on the market. Among students entries, the top scoring vehicles were from Mt Everett HighSchool in Sheffield, MA, Bolton (CT) High School and the Salisbury School inConnecticut. The Mt. Everett vehicle was the top hybrid vehicle, one thatruns on electricity and also carries an on-board generator to rechargebatteries while on the road. The Bolton High School entry was the top scoring student entry in theDiscovery Channel Commuter Category - the largest category in the AmericanTour de Sol. This vehicle, called the Solar Bolt, also set an American Tourde Sol record for vehicles powered by common, lead-acid batteries bytraveling 143 miles without recharging. The other top student entry, built by students of the Salisbury School, wasthe winning solar racing vehicle in this year's event. The solar racers aredesigned with large "wings" covered with solar cells. These vehicles, builtspecially for competition, run entirely on sunlight. "This was the top field of electric vehicles we've ever had in the AmericanTour de Sol," said race technical director Dr. Rob Wills. "There is no doubtin my mind that what we've seen develop here is a technology and an industrythat can effectively meet transportation and environmental needs." Dr. Willssaid race officials were particularly impressed by the Solectria Sunrise."This may be the one everybody's been waiting for.

A week-longseries of tests found the top-ranked electric vehicles twice as energy efficient as even the best gasoline-powered subcompact cars. Testing was done during the annual American Tour de Sol electric vehicle race in May. During that event, four dozen vehicles - electric, solar and hybrid electric - raced more than 300 miles through the Northeast in road-rally style. They were joined by a "control" car - a 1995 Geo Metro sedan, one of the best mileage cars produced in the U.S. The gasoline-powered Metro traveled 35.8 miles per equivalent gallon while another Geo Metro, converted to electric power by Solectria Corporation in Massachusetts, turned in an incredible 65.2 miles per equivalent gallon. "This is the first time anyone has done a head-to-head test like this," according to race director Nancy Hazard. "We now know the electric cars make sense for energy conservation as well as environmental quality." The top performer in the entire race was a four-seater, pre-production prototype vehicle also built by Solectria. This car, called the Sunrise, achieved a record 70.7 miles per equivalent gallon - a performance that exceeds President Clinton's challenge to triple the fuel efficiency of the present automobile by the year 2004. The Sunrise also won the first annual "NESEA Energy Challenge" award. Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) offered the prize for the most efficient vehicle in each of four categories: two-seater and four-seater sedans, utility vehicles (truck or van) and motorcycles. "Although we have been collecting efficiency data for the past six years at the American Tour de Sol, this is the first time we had the equipment necessary to compare energy use of electric, hybrid electric, and conventional gasoline vehicles," said Dr. Robert Wills, technical director of the race. "After collecting the data, we used crude oil as a benchmark and adjusted for the losses involved in refining gasoline or producing and transmitting electricity. We call this the 'well to wheels' efficiency of the vehicle." The 1995 Geo Metro was chosen as a control vehicle because it is state-of-the-art and very efficient and it is often used as the basis for electric conversions. During the American Tour de Sol, it traveled 45 miles to the gallon which translates to 35.8 miles per equivalent gallon after adjusting for losses incurred when making gasoline from crude oil. To translate energy use of the electric vehicles to equivalent miles per gallon, the efficiency of a similarly state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant (51 percent efficient) and transmission losses of 7.5 percent were used. In other words, a gallon of crude oil turned into gasoline gets you 35 miles down the road. But turning the same gallon of crude oil into electric vehicle power and you travel 70 miles down the road. Other award winners included the Ford Ecostar, the most efficient utility vehicle, which drove 58.7 miles per equivalent gallon. The motorcycle prize went to the Schiller Group from Germany whose pre-production prototype, the Erange, traveled 245 miles per equivalent gallon. This year's three hybrid vehicles where less efficiency than was hoped for, but the expected broad field of hybrids in next year's event should demonstrate the potential of this technology. The "NESEA Energy Challenge" was created to bring attention to the importance of using the least energy possible to power our transportation system which accounts for 62 percent of the oil usage in the United States. Improving the efficiency of automobiles can substantially cut our trade deficit, one-third of which is caused by imported oil.

It was a perfect spring day Sunday at Library Park in Waterbury CT.The event promises to be more interesting than ever, with a bus, severalcustom made cars, 3 hybrid powered cars, a car constructed by an ELEMENTARY(!) school team, plus cars from Japan, the Czech Republic, and Canada in the race. But, I arrived before most of the cars were here, so I started my interviewswith Jay Tarler who was working on the charging panel that was donated byGeneral Public Utilities, General Electric and Northeast Utilities to NESEAlast year. This panel has a capacity of over 600 amperes, 3-phase (delta).There are 4 subpanels and 81(!) plugs. Most of the plugs are rated either 120volts at 20 or 30 amps or 240 at 15, 20, and 30 amps, plus a couple of 3-phase 50 amp outlets used last year by the Chrylser mini-vans. All the outlets are protected by Ground Fault Interrupters (GFIs). This year, each car's charger will be connected to it's own Watt-hour meter, they can measure exactly how much energy was delivered to each car. Each car also has its own Watt-hour meter on the leads to the motor, so the energy actually delivered to the motor will also be measured. In this way, the total energy used for charging can be compared to the energy that actually results in propelling the car and thus the efficiency of the charging/storage/controller system can be calculated. Inaddition, the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA, the sponsor ofthe race) has issued what American Tour de Sol (ATdS) Director Nancy Hazardcalls the "NESEA Energy Challenge". The idea is to quantify the amount ofenergy (measured in equivalent barrels of oil) it takes to move different carsdown the road. This metering will let them calculate a "wells to wheelsenergy (measured in equivalent barrels of oil) it takes to move different carsdown the road. This metering will let them calculate a "wells to wheelsefficiency rating" for traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles,pure Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (HEVs). Bob Goodrich, who built the original ATdS charging panels, now retiredfrom Northeast Utilities, will be doing the calculations, which will includeestimates for the efficiency of the power plant (modeled as a modern turbineoil-fired plant), the transmission line loss, etc. The results will be in apaper to be presented at the Sustainable Transportation/Solar and ElectricVehicles conference this fall. The efficiency study is funded by the ElectricPower Research Institute (EPRI). In addition to the vehicle systemefficiency measures, there is an additional test, funded by a grant from theElectric Vehicle Research Network, that looks at the "quality" of theelectricity at the charging station. Of particular interest is the so-called"charger harmonics". At last year's race, several cars wound up not gettingfull charges because the circuit breakers kicked out. The culprit was rumoredto be the "harmonics", essentially electrical noise created by the charger onthe electric line, that caused the breakers to trip. Look for more on allthis later. Ah, but you probably really wanted to hear about cars! The Solar Bolt, number 61 from Bolton High School, Bolton CT, is thereturningLead-Acid battery Champion. In the 1994 ATdS, this car did 141.7 miles on asingle charge on a 120 Volt, Trojan T145 battery, Advanced DC motor and aCurtis controller. Tom Aitkin and Brad Koerner said that, in fact, theCurtiscontroller died a couple of days ago, and they have replaced it with the new500 amp Curtis. Other than that, it is the same electrical system, includingthe same batteries. The only modification is an extension to the belly pantoclose an air-gap. The car itself is adapted from a 1974 Fiat, found rustingin the woods. Another returning vehicle, after skipping last year's race is number 83, theSol Survivor III by the ConVal Solar Race Car Team which will be in the SolarRacing category. (No plugging in allowed!) Paul Waterman, and advisor to thehigh school team from Dublin, NH, said that they haven't been idle. Last yearthe car climbed Mt. Washington in the "Race to the Clouds". The car has beenmuch improved. It now has a second motor as a result of the hill climbingexperience, better instrumentation to aid in energy management, and a studentteam with each member performing specific functions; mechanics, electricals,cooks, first aid, etc. The car body is somewhat modified from two years ago,with a larger spoiler (topped with solar cells) that is moved rearward quite adistance so as not to shadow the solar cells on the roof. There are alsosolar cells on the hood, and a panel that is carried in the car that can beset up at each stop to collect some extra rays. The solar panels total 680watts. The energy system charges 60 Volts of GNB sealed gel-pack batteries.The two motors are each 6 Horse Power (HP) brushed DC motors which drive thewheels through a two-speed transmission. Top speed is somewhere above 50mph,but the most efficient speed is closer to 30 mph. And when it climbed MtWashington, it made about 25 mph. Larry Dussault is the editor of the Great Lakes Electric Auto Association (GLEAA) and the Great Lakes Electric Auto News (GLEAN), although he claimstheGLs now stand for GLobal, since they have over 3,000 members from around theworld. He and Michael Beebe are here from Ohio with the ZeeVee 88, number67.Why 88? "8 hours to recharge, and we are looking for 80 miles to a charge."The car has a Honda Civic frame, with an added integrated roll cage aroundthedriver, a custom fiberglass body, two seats, convertable hard-top, and agrossweight of 2300 pounds (with driver). The 120 Volt Genisis battery systemconsists of 3 strings in parallel (30 of the 26 amp-hour units!). The Curtis500-amp controller drives an Advanced DC motor. It is for sale! A mere$30,000 will get you this beautiful, bright red car. 513 599-1233. Michael Beebe earns at least some of his living by testing vehicles. He andBob Batson gave a very compelling pair of safety talks at the ST/SEVconference last fall. At the ATdS this year, Michael and Gary Carr are goingto judge the high school cars and hand out safety plaques for the best. Michael Orr is also here from Ohio, with number 73, the Electric Fiero,sponsored by the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Co. It is a gold 1986 PontiacFiero, converted using 9-inch Advanced DC motor, 12 12-Volt sealed GNBbatteries, Curtis 1231 500-amp controller, and a Michael's on custom designedcharger, "because it was cheaper." The adaptation is very clean. The trunkis still there (as much as a Fiero trunk ever was ;-) ), the motor is bolteddirectly to the transmission, and all the original gauges still work. "Thecar still has all its crashworthiness and safety." Stop speed is 75 mph, anda range of "40 miles in a hilly area." (That is going to be quite achallenge considering some of the legs of the race are over 65 miles.) Number 93, Helios the Heron II, comes from the Riverside School inLyndonvilleVT, an elementary school, grades 4 through 8, of 43 students. I spokewith Anna Van Fleet, one of the students. The new car looks nothing like thecar this school entered in the ATdS last year (and which never actually ran)but in fact it shares a skeletal frame, the motor, and battery from theoriginal. The whole school got involved with the project again, and a fewarelucky enough to come along for the race. Forest Reider, in the 7th grade,said, "The car has 6 16 Volt solar panels made from used solar cells (whichare brown instead of the usual blue)." "(It also has) 9 12-Volt batteries, amotor that requires 120 volts. It took us 5 million, billion, quadrillionrivets and a lot of time, a lot of Bondo, and a lot of duct tape," accordingto Anna. According to the flyer handed out by the students, the parts ofthisyear's car come from a Ford Festiva, which the students "ripped apart."Shocks, struts, steering linkage and column. The motor chain drives thesingle rear wheel. Since none of the students is old enough to drive, thecaris driven by their Latin/English/Phys-Ed teacher Karen Budde. When I saw the car, it was moving under its own power, although itwas making a popping sound (that sounded sort of like back-firing(?)) and bythe time it climbed the small hill up the grass to the testing area, thefrontwheels were leaning in a most disconcerting manner. A bolt through the wheelhub was not holding properly, but did not break or strip. Number 70 is the SUN-BUNNY, is a converted VW Rabbit. The project by theFall Mountain High School in Alstead, NH. Aaron Blake told me that it has a144 Volt system made of Deka Dominator batteries, the 500 amp Curtiscontroller, and the 9-inch Advanced DC motor. The car has been on the road 3days, so this is the first real test of its capabilities. Why so late, ifthey started working on the project in October? "We got our money on April20th. So we got the call that our grant was accepted and cut POs (purchaseorders) 2 seconds later," Aaron told me. Number 64 is the Kineticar II, returning again from Connecticut SolarElectricRacing Team/Nougatuk Valley Community Technical College (CSERT-NVCTC). ArthurGagnon told me that this has the same battery pack as last year, and theagingseems to have helped. They also added sway bars that have improved theirstearing performance. Again we have 20 6-Volt batteries, 400-amp Curtiscontroller, and an 9-inch Advanced DC motor. Number 74 is the Lightning Volt from Parkland High School/Leigh County Vo-Tech. This bright red, shiny S-10 conversion is actually the same one thatraced in the 1994 ATdS. Jeromia Jarecke and Monique Polk told me that theteam put a lot effort into body work, including a sun roof (added whensomeonesanded through the roof), a new interior, slightly more efficient solarpanels, and a laptop to plot data from the Watt-hour meter as they drive.They also added regenerative braking by putting a magnetic clutch on themotorwhich engages a belt drive to an alternator. When going down a hill, theydown-shift to get the motor spinning really fast, engage the clutch and putabout 11 amps back into the batteries. Number 89, Envirocycle III is from Central Conneticut State University(CCSU).Dave Kohlen, Evan Anozine, Alfred Yeats and Glen Dobbs told me about thismotor cycle that started life as a Szuzuki JS6R-1100 that now runs on 72Voltsprovided by lead-acid gel-cell batteries. They power an 11 HP Uniq brushlessDC permanent-magnet motor that drives the rear wheel through a grip-notchtoothed belt. They expect a range of about 100 miles, with a maximum speedof75 mph, although they have geared it for most-efficient speed of 35 to 40mph.They don't really know what they are going to get because the bike arrivedwith 5 miles on it. The students designed the bike during the fall andactually started building it during the spring semester. The frame isaugmented with steel to help take the extra 300 pounds of the batteries. CCSUarrived with their "traditional" portable building. This huge trailer comescomplete with a small machine shop and, new this year, some bunk beds. Inthepast, the chargers have not always worked properly during the overnightcharging, so now they will station someone at the charging station to dealwith any problems that arise overnight. David Fabricatore represents the Connecticut Commuter Electric VehicleDemonstration Program. They are going to have 5 Solectria Force cars to test for commuter uses within the state. This 18 month project will havevolunteers using the cars for commuting and carpooling. In the ATdS, theyhave two Forces. Number 50 is powered has the Electrosource Horizonbatteries. It was finished up Friday night and driven to Waterbury bySolectria this morning. It is a 156 Volt system with 14,400 Watt-hours ofcapacity. Number 51 is running a 156 Volt pack of Interstate wet-cellbatteries, to deal with the 70 mile days in the race, and will be driven bystudents from the Ethel Walker school in Simsbury. (In the project, number51will be running Sonnenschein gel-cell batteries which do not requiremaintenance, but don't have quite as much range.) The above is copyright Michael H. Bianchi.

Various tid-bits: The electric bus did not run the first leg, as planned. With it's very limited range and speed, it was decided that it will only start running today; at least that is my unofficial understanding. The "Wild Cherry" motor bike run by the WE'RE IT team was not ready at the start. They were having trouble with their DC-DC converter and wiring. The Electric Fiero had problems with 3 overheating batteries and decided to quit after about 30 miles. They are going to try again tomorrow. The Envirocycle III didn't have enough torque to climb a long hill at the beginning of the course. The Solar Flyer blew a tire. The support vehicle for the Polytech Charger, number 75, (which I haven't written about yet), had an old fashioned vulcanizing patching kit, and Solar Flyer was able to continue on its way. Wooster's Charge (also not reported on yet) made it all the way, but had problems with their brakes overheating. After those long hills to climb, there were long hills to decend, at 20 to 35 mph. They stopped, cooled their brakes with water, and then continued to the finish. At one point I saw the Ottowa Orange trailer, but could not see the car. I thought they might be in the trailer, but a few miles down the road there was Ottowa Orange, going along just fine. They made it all the way to the finish line. I saw the Mach .05 sitting at the side of the road, and thought they might be in trouble, but they said they were just collecting some sun to boost the batteries a bit more. I don't know if they made it all the way. By the way, Mach .05 is 38 mph, which was the top speed of the car last year. Now it can do 47.2 mph according Jason Butterfield, a team member. The ERANGE motor bike was about 5 miles from the finish, at the side of the road, resting their batteries. I think they eventually crossed the finish line. The above is copyright Michael H. Bianchi.

Greenwich High School's Solar Flair I is number 68, returning for the thirdyear. Mark Smith described it as having a 9-inch Advanced DC motor powered by20 6-Volt Trojan T145 batteries through a Curtis 1221 controller, in a 1978Volkswagon Rabbit body with a Rabbit diesel transmission. This year they haveadded a radio (take care of the important things :-), replace the speedometer,and added hold-down straps for the batteries. And watchnext year for their all solar car. Becky Guartha is one of the students from Mt. Everett High School's Project e-(pronounced "E Minus"). This Chevy S-10 conversion is the same vehicle asraced last year, but it is not the same. As Becky described it, what wasonce a purely plug-in-to-charge electric vehicle is now a series hybrid. Theyhave added a propane-fueled 22 horsepower (12 kW) Kohler internal combustionengine that drives a Fisher 3 phase, 12 kW, 120 volt, 92 amp generator. (Theengine/generator system is sold by Solar Car Corporation in Melbourne,Florida.) It either idles or is manually throttled up to charge the batteriesor take up some of the motor load while underway. The projected range is 300to 500 miles on a 10 gallon tank of propane. There are 20 6-Volt batteriesand the motor is a 28 HP Advanced DC. A 30 amp alternator with electricclutch adds regen braking. Becky and Rachele Batacchi are the school's first female navigator anddriver team. Rachele spoke about having to watch the amp meter and thetachometer to decide when to shift for best efficiency. Jake Dupont is a mechanic on the team. He said that when thebatteries are fully charged a regulator detects that and automaticallythrottles back the engine to idle to prevent overcharging. The Ecovox is from Dartmouth University is number 95. Jeff Braciak describedthis series hybrid vehicle, meaning that only the batteries drive the wheels.The batteries are charged by a 1.4 kW Honda generator which was converted toethanol from a tank that I guess is about 1 gallon. The driver has a singleswitch to start and stop the generator. The 120 Volt AC output is run througha diode bridge and voltage regulator to get it to the 72 Volts DC needed tocharge the batteries. The car body looks like one you would see on a solar car. It is athin tappered tube, about 12 feet long, with two wheels in the front and asingle driven wheel in the rear. The electric motor is a 7 HP brushless DC,supplied by 6 small Sears DieHard tractor batteries. Before the race, theelectric drive had gone about 200 miles, and the generator system had about 50miles. It can do 45 to 55 mph. During inspection the Ecovox had a ground fault which took a couple ofhours to isolate and repair. RHAM is number 76, from Rham Science and Technical High School. John Dudek isthe faculty advisor and this car is back for (at least) its third year.What's different this year? The battery pack has been increased from 96 Voltsto 120. Same old controller, same old motor. (Presumably a Curtis 400 ampand an Advanced DC 9-inch.) Last year, John was praising the `BATT juice'battery additive (from B.A.T Technologies) that he was using in his batteries.He felt they were giving him something extra. This year, he added the extrabatteries late, and so did not have time to get the additive into the newones, thus they are running with a mixed system: new batteries withoutadditive plus old batteries with. But the new batteries will get "juiced"after the race. Why? "Because we got 23.76 kiloWatts out of a 96 Volt systemlast year, with Trojan T145s," says John. Ottawa Orange II is number 37 again this year, basicly the same chassis andsolar panel arrangement as last year, but with some differences. Josh Ike,James Merriweather, and Randy Mahar told me they increased the battery packfrom 32 Volts to 74 Volts, using Advotech batteries. They also replaced thewooden plank which is the flexible element of the front wheels suspension inthe 3-wheeled vehicle, and put in a new braking system. The solar panel hasbeen increased to 1300 Watts and the instrumentation has been localized so thedriver can easily see every gauge. The box tubing frame is the same as lastyear, although the mylar fabric cover is now thicker, and the nose is moreaerodynamic to reduce drag. This 800 pound vehicle has been tested up to 65mph, and the range has been tested at 200 miles(!). The first day of testing,Saturday, the solar panel was cutting out as it flexed while being driven. Bythe time they figured out what was wrong, almost all the stores were closed.At the last minute, they found some curtain rods (the rectangular cross-section sheet metal types) and used them to brace the outside edges of thepanel against the lower frame of the car, forming your classic triangularbrace. The team was 13 students with specialties of mechanical, electrical,body, design, business, and coordinator. The project was completed for anestimated cost of $20,840. (Many of the student vehicles have handouts withthe vital statistics, participants, advisors, sponsors, etc. The OttawaOrange II is one of the best. It is also dedicated to Dwakeely S. McMillan,February 20, 1976 - March 12, 1995.) Erik Wachtmeister is the co-president of the team that built Photon, number86, which won the Tour de Sol racing class in the 1994 ATdS. "This year thefront wheels have been redone completely. They are two inches taller, havenew rims, new centers, new tubes that are Kevlar reinforced and are racingslicks. There is a better seat which is more comfortable, the lights are moreaerodynamic, we now have two rearview mirrors instead of one, and have riggedup a helmet communication system between the driver and the chase vehicle. Wenow have more a more accurate reading of the power consumption that is hookedup to a computer that periodically saves the information" for later analysis.A fan on the back helps keep the motor cool. The battery is a 84 Volt pack built from 7 Sears DieHard deep cycleRV/Marine batteries. The 8 HP brushless DC motor and controller are made bySolectria. The frame is welded aluminum tubing covered with a vacuum bagmolded body made of 6 pieces. The body skin is two layers of Kevlar with afoam core. The front suspension is off a Yamaha Blaster ATV, the rearsuspension is off a Yamaha 176 motorcycle. The solar panel is made up of 8modules of 20 Volts and 60 Watts each. All the above is the same as lastyear. The team was made up of 30 students, with 5 faculty advisors. Varioussubteams tackled the improvements listed above. For example, the new seat wasdone by underclassmen. Angelo Esposito built Fulmine, number 69, after helping Scott Isgar build his"Solar Delivery" Volkswagon Vanagon conversion that raced in the ATdS last 65Angelo Esposito built Fulmine, number 69, after helping Scott Isgar build his"Solar Delivery" Volkswagon Vanagon conversion that raced in the ATdS lastyear. Fulmine is a conversion of a 1980 Hundai donated to him. The primaryreason for doing the conversion was to let Angelo experiment with his owntransmission design. After about 700 miles of testing, he removed thetransmission and gave it to a machine shop to build as a final product, whichis in the works right now. Just for the race, he reinstalled the originalHundai transmission. The battery pack is 10 12-Volt Deka Dominators type8GHD, huge beasts which weigh 161 pounds each! The car has an overallweight of 3500 pounds and can carry 600 pounds. These drive a 400 amp Curtiscontroller which in turn drives a 9-inch Advanced DC motor. Angelo is hopingfor 100 to 120 miles range. Robert Larsen from Argonne National Lab is the boss of Spencer Quang andNicole LeBlanc, who were doing the safety test. Argonne is doing severalthings new this year. DOE, through Argonne, provided free ampere-hour metersfor all the student-built vehicles this year, and worked very hard with NESEAto be sure that almost all the rest of the vehicles would also have them. Theresult is that the energy consumption readings will be much easier to acquireand compare. (Two years ago, I remember watching the testing teams goingslightly crazy trying to figure out how they were going to connect the amp-hour meters in for a quick [well, it was supposed to be quick] energy usemeasurement, and the various owners worrying that the act of installing andremoving the wiring and shunt would somehow mess up their car!) On top ofthat, they encouraged NESEA to instrument the charging station for bothpower consumption and power quality, which will now allow them to do a muchbetter job of performing from-the-wall-plug-to-the-wheel energy use analysis.(In the past power quality has meant power factor and power factor hasbeen measured as the phase angle between the voltage and current waveforms.[Shades of Electric Machines 101!] As we will see later, it is nowmuch more complex than that, and a very real problem in EV charging.In particular, some charges induce huge voltage and current spikes on theAC line, call "harmonics" that can cause real problems.) Bob does not believe there has ever been such a large group of EVs connectedto one charging station, although the APS 500 races have also been a learningexperience. Another purpose is to start educating the teams and the EV 81to one charging station, although the APS 500 races have also been a learningexperience. Another purpose is to start educating the teams and the EVcommunity to be aware of these issues and how important it is to have veryefficient chargers. Bob says they have seen chargers with efficiencies ashigh as 90% and as low as 30%; a huge variation. Again this year they have 8 data collection memory modules that theywill be putting into selected cars, as they did at the 1994 ATdS. Thesemodules record second-by-second data such as motor current and voltage,battery current and voltage, plus there is a Global Positioning System (GPS)receiver that lets them collect position, velocity and acceleration from theGPS link. I asked Bob what he thought of the field this year. In general hethought the overall quality of the cars is very much better this year. TheSolectria prototype Sunrise is of particular interest, because it pointstowards the future. Bob is also one of the designated drivers of the most polluting car inthe race. A Geo Metro LSI sedan, number 10, is being driven in the race andbeing timed as if it were a race vehicle. (The Metro is the base vehicle formany conversions, including those that Solectria and BAT Technologiesproduce.) By using this car as a control vehicle, they will have a very goodbenchmark for the NESEA Energy Challenge, looking for the car with the bestoverall energy efficiency and hence the highest oil-well-to-wheel-wellequivalent miles-per-gallon of oil. The results of this and other tests willbe presented at the Sustainable Transportation Conference in Providence RIthis fall and then at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) conferenceabout 5 weeks later. Speaking of papers, the DOE has been writing EV and Hybrid-EV papersover the years and many are published through the SAE, which has an excellenton-line search system. Contact the SAE for more information. Bob also had high praise for NESEA's organization and operation of theATdS. "As far as we are concerned, this is biggest bang for the buck that DOEgets. I hope that budget considerations will allow us to be a major sponsorin future years." Number 49 is ERANGE, is a motor scooter built by Helmut Schiller and WolfgangWoitowicz, who built the CityCat that won the Open Category in the 1994 ATdS.ERANGE claims a range over 100 miles, speed up to 50 mph, weighs 300 pounds,is 100% recharge in 30 minutes, and an efficiency of over 35 miles perkiloWatt-hour. The power comes from 3 12-Volt Horizon batteries delivering3.4 kiloWatt-hours. This scooter uses the next generation of the motor usedon the CityCat. This permanent motor, which boasts 95% efficiency, uses alow-voltage, high-amperage disk armature that uses copper plates instead ofcopper wires. The permanent magnets provide the stator (non-rotating) fieldand the armature has 8 brushes and 129 fields on the commutator which givesvery, very smooth acceleration. The controller is a pulse-width modulatedtype of their own design, but for the ATdS they are using a Curtis controllerbecause that way they can easily get a spare. As I understand it, theirintention is to offer a power-train package (motor, controller, andinstrumention) that would be licensed exclusively to a scooter manufacturer tocreate a line of electric scooters and 3-wheeled vehicles.

Hehas overall responsibility for the technical rules that the cars must meet andthe inspection process that verifies their compliance. But Rob is also heavily involved in the electrical usage measurementsbeing taken as the plugged-in vehicles charge every night. I posted earlierabout the NESEA Energy Challenge tests, where they are collecting data tocompare how far a vehicle goes when a gallon of oil taken from the ground isused to power a gasoline vehicle and when a gallon of oil is used to power anelectric vehicle. Rob mentioned that they are also looking at the energy usage throughthe night. The assumption that electric vehicles will charge at night is agood one, but if the vehicle is plugged in the moment it gets home, it willdraw it's heaviest load early in the evening and tapper off over the night.And if that's you and me and the girl next door all coming home in our EVs,then that presents a significant early evening load. So, they should get somevery interesting data on kiloWatt-hours used for charging, measured every 15minutes, for 50 cars at once, as part of the oilwell-to-wheels research. Rob spoke at length about the Power Quality measurements. Years agowhen the loads on electric transmission systems were mostly motors, lightbulbs, resistive heaters (that is mostly inductive and resistive loads), thepower drawn from the grid had the same shape (waveform) as the voltage fromthe grid; both were sinusoidal. And the current was pretty much in phase withthe voltage, that is it had a `good power factor'. (When the power factor is`good', a watt measured with a watt meter, which essentially multipliesinstantaneous voltage times instantaneous current, represents the amount ofenergy that is actually being delivered by the grid to the load. When thepower factor is bad, the current leads or lags the voltage, and the watt-meterdoesn't reflect the amount of energy being delivered.) You still have thesame amount of current, the same amount of heating in the wires, and the samelosses from the current, but the electric company cannot collect money for it.It is then called `reactive power' or `imaginary power'. The common fixeswere applied at the power plant or by putting capacitors on the lines af thesubstations. Life in recent years has gotten more complicated. In large officebuildings up to 30% of the loads can be the plug-loads of computers and thingslike that which only take their energy at the peak of the voltage waveform.So, instead of having a sinusoidal current waveform, you have something thatlooks like a little bump and only happens for a part of the cycle. Thosecurrent bumps, because they are not pure sine waves, have lots of harmonics,mostly at 3 and 5 times the voltage frequency, which is 180 and 300 Hertz (inpower systems that operate at 60 Hz). Transformers have higher losses athigher frequencies, so it is necessary to derate transformers designed forpure sinusoidal loads when they are faced with these spikey loads. What's this got to do with EVs? Well, we were seeing chargers popping20 amp circuit breakers when the normal, average current reading meters saidthey were only drawing 15 amps. But with a special true RMS current meter,which gives the equivalent heating value of the current, we were seeing 25amps. And the waveforms involved were very, very spikey with a sharp currentpeak at the most positive and most negative parts of each voltage cycle;probably only 15 degrees of conduction in each 180 degree portion of thecycle. Electric utilities are concerned about this not only because it cancause overheating, but it can also cause distortion in the voltage waveformthat can cause problems in other equipment on the same circuit, as far back asthe step-down transformer on the pole!. Another related problem is caused by the 3-phase power distributionsystems used by utilities. In a wye-wired system, if the loads on the 3 legsof the distribution power was equal, the current in the neutral would be zero.Because of this effect, systems were commonly designed with the neutral legundersized by about 20%, to save the expense of copper that "never would beused"; a practice allowable by the electrical code. Many old buildings arewired that way. But when people started using lots and lots of computers theneutral started to get overloaded and hot! The reason is that while the firstharmonic waveforms, the 60 Hz waveforms, add to zero in the neutral when theloads are in balance, but the third harmonic waveforms sum additively creating3 times the original current in the neutral leg. So new power systempractices in buildings require the neutral conductor to be larger than thephase conductor, and power transformers now come in harmonic or non-linearratings to accommodate the extra neutral conductor load. While simple battery charges may cause the same problem as computers,it doesn't have to be so. The traditional fix is to use ferro-resonanttransformer. An additional winding on the transformer is used to control thespikes and produces a rather triangular current waveform. Modern power supplies and battery charges now use high frequencyPulse-Width Modulation (PWM) techniques that can align their current waveformsto the voltage waveforms and are called "power factor correcting powersupplies." So, during the overnight charging of the cars in the race, there willbe a harmonic analyzer, made by Basic Measuring Instruments (BMI) fromCalifornia (Sunnyvale?), looking at the entire charging station. They willcollect data on overall power, power factor, and harmonic spectrum of eachphase of the main feed at hourly intervals, and also watch how the voltageon the feed changes as they bring on individual car chargers. During the racethey will also measure every individual charger and capture its harmonicspectrum. There is a wide variety of chargers here, from Solectria's whichare pretty well power factor corrected, to a number of old ferro-resonantchargers, to some that are straight rectifier chargers, to some that are SCRcontrolled and phase-angle controlled that can have poor power factor but stillhave reasonable waveform. The biggest part of the problem is the spikeywaveform, because that is what causes transformer and neutral overheating. There is a UL/IEEE standard, number 519, that says that you shall nothave more than 5% harmonic distortion which means 95% of the current goinginto a load must be in-phase, fundamental current. A couple of good sources of articles on these topics are the magazinescalled "The Electrical Inspector's Journal" and also "Electrical Apparatus"which has great articles by one Richard Nailen. I asked Rob which cars had caught his attention (before the race hadactually started). He said the 3 hybrids where very interesting, because hewanted to see how they did in the NESEA Energy Challenge. Hybrid design isnot simple, but we are already hearing 80-to-90 miles per gallon numbers fromother races. Until the `silver bullet' battery appears on the market, hybridsmay well be the path to the future. The above is copyright Michael H. Bianchi.

Solectria is also represented byat least a couple of their E-10 pickup trucks (conversions of the Chevy S-10)and no fewer than 4 Forces (conversions of the Geo Metro and Metro LSI). I asked him what the state of the Universal Motor Controller (UMoC,pronounced "You-Mock"). He announced this all-software controlled controllerdesign a couple of years ago, and I have been asking where it was in itsdevelopment every time I run into him or any of the engineers from Solectria.As it turns out, the first beta version has shown up here at the American Tourde Sol (ATdS) in Tom Hopper's "Hopper EV", number 94. Tom swapped out thebrushless DC motor and controller and has installed the UMoC and an ACinduction motor. James says that Tom wants to eventually go back to thebrushless DC motor, but when he does, he will be able to simply reprogram anErasable Programmable Memory (EPROM) through the serial port on thecontroller. In fact, that is the "universal" part of the UMoC. The idea isthat the operational logic for controllers for all sorts of motors (brushedDC, brushless DC, AC induction) of all sorts of power ranges could be built ina single, mass produced (and hence inexpensive) logic unit which would beattached to a power unit suitable to the task at hand (low, medium, highpower; single or multi-phase). James expects that the Solectria trucks willhave the UMoC by the end of the year. He also expects it to be for sale tothe EV conversion market in the fall. The Sunrise is the all composite vehicle that Solectria announced atEVS-12 last December. The car is bright yellow with a tan "skirt" around thebottom fifth of the side and back. It is very rounded and very smooth 2 door,4 passenger car that weighs 1694 pounds; gross weight capacity is 2376 poundsgiving a 682 pound payload. It has one 42 kW nominal/50 kW peak AC inductionmotor and front wheel drive. It has the Ovonic nickel metal hydride batteryand James says that their goal is to break 200 miles per charge during therace. (They in fact did that on Thursday with 228.1 miles on a charge. Thatis the NESEA number from Friday morning's data sheet. James was saying thatit was 238. Both maybe right if James drove farther after the official lapwas completed, but the NESEA number most likely to be quoted since it wasrefereed.) I had heard that even the springs were composite, but that is not thecase. "We haven't gone to the very extremes," says James, "but we are tryingto take weight out as practically as possible without going to too many highcost methods." They already had a pretty light drive train, but managed toshave some more weight off it. The body is a mix of all different compositesand plastics, some aluminum and a tiny, tiny bit of steel. One of the tricksfor keeping weight down is to make parts serve two and three purposes. So afender may also serve as insulation and as an interior panel. The goal is to build a comfortable four passenger vehicle with veryhigh efficiency. The people who are interested in making this happen likeBoston Edison, the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC), and ARPAthink that a tiny car is not going to be as salable as mid-sized or full-sizedcar, which the Sunrise is. The vehicle in the race is a prototype to learn if these things canactually be done and made to work. As such, there are some peculiarities inthis car that would not exist when it is done for real. For instance, theroof has simulated solar cells on it, although a solar panel sits on the reardeck under the rear window and powers an air circulating fan. The doorwindows do not roll down, so air conditioning is absolutely a must. TheHughes MagnaCharge paddle socket was not yet in place under the license platein the rear, although the 110 VAC and the 220 VAC charging plugs were. (Iunderstand that the Sunrise is actually being charged using the MagnaChargesystem, but obviously not in the final configuration. The MagnaCharge peoplehave been following us throughout the race.]) The body appears seamless, withthe only lines being those around the small hood, the small trunk lid, and therather large doors. There are no strips of chrome to hide the fact that twobody panels are mating. It is actually made of several pieces, but "the goalis to keep the part count down because that keeps the joints and the weightdown and hopefully makes it simple to build as opposed to making millions ofparts cheap and having it expensive to build." "Steel is good, it has beenproven to be safe, even in electric vehicles, but these materials can getbetter safety with considerably less weight." The Sunrise is using the same control system as was in the SolectriaForce. The drive train was developed for this project, but it is now beingput in the new Force cars. A lot of work went into making the interior veryquite (I suspect because you don't have the engine noise to mask all theother noises sources) and also into making the doors work exactly right. Thedoors "slam" differently from most cars, because the are so much less massive.But the mate to the door opening perfectly and latch with the slightestpressure. James indicated that it took a lot of work to get that just right,but of course it is absolutely essential to give a quality look and feel tothe car. Looking under the hood is almost disappointing. Things are souncluttered and simple it doesn't look complicated. (Of course that is good,but it is so much easier to be impressed by all the stuff under the hood of ahigh-power car.) The usual Solectria controller is there, the usual lookingSolectria motor, although with a special dual shock dampener that isolatesmotor vibration from the body, and the other few support components such asthe power brake pump and the DC-DC converter for the 12 Volt loads. All the batteries are in a tunnel that runs down the center of the carand between the left and right passengers. A cooling fan forces air down thetunnel when the batteries get warm, and turns off automatically when they cool. I tried to draw a comparison between this and the GM Impact. Jamesimmediately said, "no. This is a much bigger car." The aerodynamic shapesare similar, but the fact that the Impact is 2 passenger and the Sunrise is 4puts them in very different classes. There is no separate bumper, but James said that the car will meet theDepartment of Transportation tests, including the 5 mph bumper where no damagethat costs money can be inflicted. The second Sunrise is being built now and it will be crash tested thissummer. The third will be built as refined prototype based on what is learnedfrom the first two. James made very clear that he was indebted to his sponsors. BostonEdison, NAVC and ARPA. Their interest in this and other related projects,such as earlier drive train projects, accelerated this work considerably.Nick Karditsas is from Ovonic, the company that provided the Nickel MetalHydride batteries in the Sunrise. It is an advanced battery for EVs,developed under funding of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium.Nickel Metal Hydride batteries have an energy density of about 75 Watt-hoursper kilogram, as compared to 25 Wh/kg for lead acid batteries. The Sunrisehas a 25 kWh pack composed of 18 10-cell, 12 Volt, 120 amp-hour modules in asingle Volt string. Beyond that, the power train is the usual Solectria ACinduction motor system. The charger uses the Hughes MagnaCharge inductivecoupler system. An unusual aspect of NiMH batteries is that the discharge chemistry isactually slightly endothermic; the chemistry actually > cools < the batteryas it discharges. According to Nick, the effect is apparent at a C/6 (20ampere) rate.

But Greg pointed out that since the car hasclimbed Mount Washington, the hills on the route were no problem. In fact,what was going on was they were budgeting their energy very carefully sincethis was the longest route the car has ever driven. They made it all the waythrough the route. Number 72 is Sungo from New Hampshire Technical Institute and is back for (atleast) the third year. Spencer Allen explained that this year the wiring hasbeen improved, a new steering box has improved the handling, fixed problemsthey had had with their solar panel and added new instrumentation, and upgraded the batteries up to 120 Volts. Sungo is the only car this year withseparate motors for each of the rear wheels, each with a separate controller.The brushless DC motors from Solectria have an electronic differential to keepthe rear wheels coordinated when under way. The controllers also have alow/high torque switch, which changes the motor wiring from wye to delta.They claim the car has 100+ mile range, 75 mph top speed, carries two people +200 pounds of luggage, has a 96 Watt solar array and 10 Trojan 27TMH deep-cycle marine batteries with 9600 Watt-hour capacity. It weighs 1365 pounds. They won the efficiency award for the Discovery Commuter class one dayat 9 miles per kiloWatt-hour. Sunpacer from Cato-Meridian High School in Cato NY is number 92, back for the3rd or 4th year. According to Kevin Malda, this year it has new solar cells,and a cleaned up electrical system. They experimented with regenerativebraking but it was not operational at the start of the race. The system is 32Volt system of Deka Dominator batteries driving a 6 HP series Advanced DCmotor through a Sevcon controller. Mellisa Downs with the Darmouth Ecovox team explained what caused the groundfault that caused difficulties during pre-race testing. It was in the 12 Voltsystem, which is not as big a deal as when it is in the traction system, andrewiring the 12 Volt driver's meter so that the grounds were isolated fixedthe problem. Mellisa worked on putting the batteries in, installing theethanol tank, and the fire extinguisher system. Mike Fabio (no relation) is with the Electric Hare built by the FalmouthWattsmen from Falmouth ME. The first day they milked the car into the finishline because the had trouble charging. Their K&W transformerless charger hasvery spikey waveforms that kept tripping the circuit breakers. A fix was tolower the charging rate to about 10% of the maximum rate, which leaves themundercharged for the race, and worried. The vehicle is a Volkswagon Rabbit converted with the kit from ElectroAutomotive, and one that is very neatly done. The 21 kWh batteries are fromUS Battery, the motor from Advanced DC, and the Controller from Curtis. (AndMr. Gigi does their hair.) The conversion is very, very clean and these guyswere the hit of Portland ME, showing up on the local TV shouting, "Now we'regoing to Disney World!." Project e-, the propane fueled hybrid S-10 conversion, had a problem on thefirst day because the had a valve leak that caused them to run out of fuel,although it did not prevent them from finishing. I had forgotten to ask earlier if, when they added the generator, didthey remove any of the batteries. After all, that is one of the motivationsfor using the engine driven generator; you can get by on fewer batteries.Rachele Batacchi said that they kept all the batteries they had in their non-hybrid version. This proved useful here because they were able to run 16miles just on the batteries. The team is also plugging in each night, so thefuel is used strictly for range extension. At least a couple of people took the scenic route the first day (read "gotlost"). I know that Genesis I missed a turn, and Hopper EV decided to visitthe Interstate 84, which took him 11 miles out of the way. (The racegenerally avoids the interstates, toll roads, and other high-speed roads. The40 mph minimum speed on such roads precludes many of the solar racers fromusing them. Hopper EV had no problem there.) Hopper EV had a more serious problem. For some reason, not well understood,it blew 3(!) chargers at the end of Day 1. The guess was that there was somekind of feedback coming from the controller that was interacting badly withthe charger. By disconnecting the controller and rebuilding one of thechargers Tom Hopper was able to get a charge and run the Day 2 leg late, butwith no difficulty. Number 53, the Elfa Electra, turned in very good performance. Thomas Faul wasexpecting a 50 mile range and first day they managed 69 miles with no problem. Dr. Fred Whitridge is a self-made man. He holds an honorary doctorate that hebestowed upon himself, as a gag "to keep the NESEA people from going to crazywith thier beaurocracy and their rules. For example, rule 12.1.6 says youshall carry electrolyte neutralizer at all times. So Dr. Fred and his partnerDr. Rob have been wearing a box of Arm and Hammer baking soda on their armeverywhere they go, figuring they will the only ones left in the race becauseall the other teams only have their baking soda in the car and will hence bedisqualified. When not racing, Fred is an investor in Greenwich CT. Fred's car is number 60, the Millenium Falcon, by the Blue Sky Club, agroup from the Yale School of Management class of 1983 that have workedtogether on a number of projects, some gags, some real that try to addresssome societal concern such as pollution. The car is a 1985 VolkswagonCabriolet that at 97,000 miles was blowing a lot of oil. "My 8-year-old and Idid the conversion, starting with Mike Brown's (Electro Automotive) kit, whichhas been modified almost beyond recognition." It uses an 8-inch Advanced DCmotor, Curtis 1221B ("no problems when mounted on a 2-inch heat sink with afan"), and a 96 Volt pack of Trojan T145s, with a trailer added just for therace holding an additional 24 Volts. It also has a radio and a heater. The car was finished in May, 1994, and is used for daily commuting.It accumulated 3800 miles in that year. Fred told a story where he went away on business and called home tosee how things were going. When he asked his 8-year-old what he had beendoing, he said, "driving around in the electric car." "You and who?" "Me and Mom." "But Mom doesn't know how to drive the electric car." "I taught her." Number 71 is the S-15 Truck from Minuteman Science-Technology High School inLexington MA. David Pichulo expained it to me. He worked on the controlboard and did the fund racing. The conversion is based on the design that BobBatson of Electric Vehicles of America does. The car is actually named"George", but that name never shows up on the standings. They started the carin March when a teacher suggested it as a project. They got a lot of thingsdonated, including the GMC S-15 Sierra from the Conservation Division from thetown of Lincoln MA, who will get the EV truck at the end of the race. Theyfinished working on the truck the Saturday before the race and so the 20Trojan T145 batteries are very new and haven't quite gotten up to fullcapacity, so they didn't finish the first few days. It weighs 3500 pounds.About 40 people from the shop class worked on it. The above is copyright Michael H. Bianchi.

Nancy Hazard, director of the ATdS, said she wouldlike to create a new category for "practical, solar-electric, 2-seater,autonomous car" to compete with Sol Survivor III. Sol Survivor III was recognized as having the most outrageous paint job.(Hot pink and electric blue.) Sofix Design was acknowledged as the car with the most batteries and the most electrical connections to trouble-shoot.  (180 nickel-zinc batteries.) The Old Timer Award to the only car that has been in every ATdS:  SuntechThe Most Inches Of Ink (press coverage):  Electric Hare from Falmouth, ME. The Tough Luck Award:  Wild Cherry. This scooter came from Austin TX, and had problems that ended with a burned out motor that they were unable to replace. The Best T-Shirt and Strangest Arrest Award:  Mach .05.A Maine citizen tried to make a citizen's arrest of Mach .05 for being"illegal in the state of Maine" for driving too slowly. The Bullwinkle Award for the Recognition of the Largest Non-Human Life Form Encountered During the American Tour de Sol:  Fulmine. Angelo Esposito, from Staten Island NY, saw a full-sized moose during the race.(Welcome to Northern Exposure, Southeast) Rob Wills commented that it is sometimes too easy to see Solectria as acorporation and separate from the student racing community.  But he remindedthe audience that it was born in a hole-in-the-wall lab at MIT, and he hopedthat, especially the younger people such as the Helios team, would rememberthat fact.  Someday some of them would form their own car companies, or work for a car company, "and help make beautiful cars." Personal comments:         The Sunrise, a static model just 6 months ago, showed itself to be avery real contender and I think points the way to at least a portion of thefuture.  I suspect I will someday tell folks about when I first saw the Sunrise-a very real contender and a vehicle that I think points the way to at least a portion of thefuture.         2 high school projects, Project e-, a hybrid, and Solar Bolt,a lead-acid battery car, are in overall positions 4 and 5, ahead of some ofthe PRODUCTION cars.  The Tempest, a college hybrid, also placed up amidstthe PRODUCTION entries.         Personal projects, such as Genesis I and Millenium Falcon did very welloverall.         And Helios the Heron may have come in (almost) dead-last, butthe kids were wonderful and I would not be surprised to see some of them go onto do really marvelous things in the future. So that's it.  I hope you folks have found this as interesting as I did.The American Tour de Sol is a place where you can see Electric Vehicles ina wide variety of forms, on the hoof, dealing with the real world prettymuch as we find it.

Palaetiology: The Historical Sciences Palaetiology: ``The term `palaetiology' was coined in 1837 byEnglish philosopher, historian, and educator William Whewell (1794-1866)to refer to those sciences which have as their object the reconstructionof the past based on the evidence of the present. Whewell's twoexemplary palaetiological sciences were geology and comparativephilology, but he recognized that many different disciplines hadpalaetiological divisions.'' [Robert J. O'Hara, Palaetiology on theDarwin-L Web Server.] I am convinced, for reasons which I hope will eventually be made clear on this web server and elsewhere, that law, like language, can only be understood by taking a palaetiological approach--that law, and especiallyour Common Law, can only be understood by studying how it has evolvedover the centuries. We can only understand the past by studying the "evidence of the present" and we can only understand the present by understanding how we came to be where we are right now. I am convinced that we can only understand the present by understanding the past.

Peter Junger, a twenty-fiveyear veteran of the law school faculty, filed a federal civil rightsaction this morning in the United States District Court in Cleveland. The suit names the Department of State and the secretive NationalSecurity Agency, which administer federal regulations limitingProfessor Junger's ability to teach. The case involves federal regulations which restrict the export ofmilitary arms. Under federal law, computer software which encodesmessages to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet can bedeclared a military export. The regulations are so strict that evendiscussing the technical aspects of such software in the presence offoreign nationals may be a felony, punishable by up to ten years inprison. Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuseson the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans toturn away any foreign students who register for the course this fall,largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach, and towhom. The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of State,in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security Agency, theorganization charged with eavesdropping on foreign governments. Under the restrictions, Junger may not teach foreign students abouteven simple software capable of encoding messages. Such software isvital to maintaining the privacy of communications and financialtransactions on the Internet, and Junger believes that lawyers need tounderstand how it works in order to prepare to practice in anincreasingly technological world. The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available onthe Internet and elsewhere. "It's not as though we are talking aboutclassified information," explained Gino Scarselli, one of threelawyers representing Junger in the case. "The material at issue inthis case can be found in any university library, but the regulationsmake no exceptions for even the most basic software," Scarselli noted. The lawsuit does not challenge the government's right to restrictaccess to classified information. Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin FrancisO'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in FirstAmendment issues. As Vasvari explained, the suit presents importantFirst Amendment questions about the government's ability to regulateacademic life. "These regulations allow the government to dictate whata professor may and may not teach, even though the material involvedposes no threat to national security," Vasvari explained. The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federallicense to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government isviolating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits thegovernment from licensing expression. Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role inthe economic development of the Internet, the case is being closelywatched by industry leaders in the Silicon Valley. Scarselli hasworked closely with attorneys affiliated with the San Francisco basedElectronic Frontier Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger andhis lawyers have been in frequent contact with founder John Gilmore,formerly of Sun Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as atechnical advisor in the case.WT01-B05-54IA044-000801-B011-386http://samsara.law.cwru.edu:80/comp_law/jvc/nat.press.rel.html 129.22.184.108 19970118132827 text/html 6766HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 13:31:55 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6595Last-modified: Sat, 10 Aug 1996 02:12:48 GMT National Press Release Press Release Law Professor Sues Federal GovernmentOver Computer Privacy Issues Federal Civil Rights Action Seeks Injunction Against StateDepartment And National Security Agency Cleveland Scholar Attacks Prohibition On Discussing Cryptographic Software With Foreign Students And Colleagues For Immediate Release Cleveland, Wednesday, August 7, 1996 For More Information Contact: Raymond Vasvari (216) 522-1925 Gino Scarselli (216) 291-8601 More Information Will Be Available at: URL: http://samsara.law.cwru.edu A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict his ability to teach a course in computer law. Peter Junger, a twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States District Court in Cleveland. The suit names the Department of State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach. The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military technology. Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet, is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control. The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by defining "export" to include discussing technical information about non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students registered for Professor Junger's course. In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup, an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts. These and similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for fear of violating the ITAR. Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which the ITAR was promulgated. Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach, and to whom. The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign governments. Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign students about even simple software capable of encoding messages. Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to practice in an increasingly technological world. The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available on the Internet and elsewhere. "It's not as though we are talking about classified information," explained Gino Scarselli, one of three lawyers representing Junger in the case. "The material at issue in this case can be found in any university library, but the regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software," Scarselli noted. The lawsuit does not challenge the government's right to restrict access to classified information. Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in First Amendment issues. As Vasvari explained, the suit presents important First Amendment questions about the government's ability to regulate academic life. "These regulations allow the government to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari explained. The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited expression from permissible speech. The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing officials broad discretion in restriction speech are unconstitutional. Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being closely watched. Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor in the case. At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the internet. Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with foreign persons or from publishing that information. Lawyers for Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction. Junger's course begins in the fall semester, later this month.WT01-B05-55IA044-000801-B011-409http://samsara.law.cwru.edu:80/comp_law/jvc/pressrel2.html 129.22.184.108 19970118132856 text/html 12310HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 13:32:42 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 12138Last-modified: Wed, 02 Oct 1996 09:14:36 GMT Junger v.

Christopher Set for Wednesday, November 20 Cleveland, Ohio, Tuesday, October 1, 1996 For Immediate Release For More Information Contact: Raymond Vasvari (216) 522-1925 Gino Scarselli (216) 291-8601 Or see URL: http://samsara.law.cwru.edu/comp_law/jvc/ Cleveland, Ohio, Oct. 1 -- Lawyers for Professor Peter D. Junger todayfiled a brief and a motion for summary judgment in Junger v.Christopher, the case challenging the licensing of the communication of``cryptograhic software'' that is pending before Judge Donald C. Nugentin the Federal District Court here. Junger seeks an injunction against the enforcement of provisions ofthe International Traffic in Arms Regulations that require him to getthe permission of the State Department's Office of Defense TradeControls (the "ODTC") before he can communicate information aboutcryptographic software to foreign persons, ``whether in the UnitedStates or abroad.'' The penalty for failing to get such permissionbefore disclosing the information can be as great as a fine of onemillion dollars and imprisonment for ten years. These provisionseffectively prevent Junger from admitting foreign students to thecourse that he teaches about Computers and the Law at Case WesternReserve Law School in Cleveland, Ohio, and keep him from publishinghis course materials and articles containing cryptographic software,or explaining what it does, how and where to get it, and how to useit. The challenged licensing scheme threatens the long-run viability ofthe United States software industry and, according to a blue-ribbonpanel of the National Research Council, already costs that industry atleast ``a few hundred million dollars per year ..., and allindications are that this figure will only grow in the future.'' Theregulations have been extensively criticized by industry and bills torepeal or limit them are now pending in Congress. Junger's legal challenge is not based, however, on the economic damagethat the ITAR's cryptographic licensing scheme imposes on the softwareindustry and the nation's economy, but rather on the unconstitutionalrestraints that it imposes on anyone who wants to speak or writepublically about any computer program that has, in the words of theITAR, the ``capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality ofinformation or information systems.'' Junger does not challenge theconstitutionality of requiring one to get a license before exporting aphysical cryptographic device: ``It isn't unconstitutional for theOffice of Defense Trade Controls to damage the computer industry andour economy by requiring export licenses for cryptographic hardware,but information about cryptographic software is, as the NationalResearch Council has pointed out, `pure knowledge that can betransported over national borders inside the heads of people or vialetter.' Requiring the permission of the government before one cancommunicate knowledge is unconstitutional. Such a prior restraint is,in fact, the paradigmatic example of a violation of the FirstAmendment.'' THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT PLAINTIFF MUST APPLY FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BEFORE HE CAN CHALLENGE THE REQUIREMENT THAT HE APPLY FOR SUCH PERMISSION In motions and briefs submitted August 21st, the government has askedthe court to dismiss the lawsuit, or in the alternative, to grant thegovernment judgment prior to trial. The government makes the initial argument that Junger lacks standingto claim that the provisions of the ITAR requiring him to get a formallicense or other permission from the ODTC before he publicallycommunicates information about cryptographic software, including thecontents of the software itself, are unconstitutional. And it alsoargues that that claim is neither ``ripe'' nor ``colorable'', becauseJunger has not applied to the ODTC for such permission. Junger takes the position that as a law teacher who venerates theFirst Amendment it would be as improper for him to request the federalcensors for permission to speak and publish as it would be for himopenly violate the law. As he puts it: ``My duty is to challengethese unconstitutional regulations, not to give in to them nor toviolate them in an act of civil disobedience.'' His lawyers point outin their briefs that few propositions of constitutional law are betterestablished than the rule that a plaintiff does not have to submit toan unconstitutional restraint on speech and on the press beforechallenging it in court. ``Those arguments by the government are rather strange,'' says GinoJ. Scarselli, one of Junger's lawyers, ``they seem to be based ontheir argument that cryptographic software is actually hardwarebecause it is functional.'' And then he adds, ``Of course, thatargument is also rather strange.'' THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT SOME OF THE MATERIAL AT ISSUE IS EXEMPT UNDER THE ITAR The government also contends that some of the information at issue maybe exempt from the ITAR's licensing requirements as technical datathat is in the ``public domain'' because it is available to the publicthrough ``fundamental research in science and engineering'' or through``sales at newsstands and bookstores.'' ``That hardly is a defense,'' says Scarselli, ``since it is quiteclear that the government will not concede that all of the informationthat Professor Junger wants to be able publish and discuss is in thepublic domain. And to make matters worse, the only way that ProfessorJunger can actually find out whether the government will treatparticular information as being exempt from the formal licensingrequirements is to apply to the ODTC for what it calls a CommodityJurisdiction Determination, which in reality is just another form oflicense.'' ``It is not as if I am engaged in fundamental research in science andengineering.'' Junger adds. ``What I want to publish and discuss hasto do with the political and legal issues that are raised by computertechnology, including, of course, cryptography. ``For just one example, since lawyers have a legal and ethical duty toprotect the confidences of their clients, I am convinced that lawyerswho use electronic mail or other computer technologies to communicatewith their clients, or to store information supplied by their clients,are in some circumstances ethically, and perhaps even legally,required to use cryptography to maintain the confidentiality of thatinformation. And yet I cannot publically explain to law students andlawyers--and lawyers cannot publically explain to their clients--howto obtain and use effective cryptographic software without firstgetting the government's permission to disclose that information.And, of course, if the cryptographic software really is effective,then there is little or no chance that the government will permit itsdisclosure.'' THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT CRYPTOGRAPHIC SOFTWARE IS NOT PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT IS FUNCTIONAL There is no law in the United States that forbids or regulates the useof cryptography. Yet the government argues that the information intexts containing cryptographic software, including recipes forcreating such software, can be used in a computer to preserve secrecyand confidentiality, and concludes that cryptographic software is``conduct'' and ``functional'' and is thus not a text that isconstitutionally protected as speech. Junger's lawyers, on the other hand, say that his claims do not relateto the conduct of running a cryptographic program on acomputer--conduct that is not regulated by the ITAR, after all--andthat he only challenges the restraints that the ITAR impose on thecommunication of information about how to carry on such legal conduct. ``Expressive conduct is exactly what is protected by the FirstAmendment,'' says Raymond Vasvari, another of Junger's lawyers. ``Andif that expression were not functional, if it were not effective,there would be no need to protect it. The government's argument turnstwo hundred years of First Amendment jurisprudence on its head.'' ``The government's arguments about software being conduct andfunctional are striking examples of the sort of confusion thatpervades the whole area of Computers and the Law,'' Junger says.``Trying to clear up such confusion is my major goal in my course inComputers and the Law. In fact, when I started teaching that coursein 1993, I wrote some cryptographic software to assist my students ingrasping the distinction between software as a text that can becommunicated, and that is protected by copyright law and the FirstAmendment, and software as a process that runs in a computer's centralprocessor that can be protected by patents, but not by copyrights. Ifit weren't so frustrating, it would almost be funny that I cannotpublish that software because of the prior restraints imposed by thedefendants' interpretation of the ITAR, even though it is perfectlylegal for me, or for any one else, including `foreign persons,' toactually run such software on a computer. The government's confusionis so extensive that an agent of the ODTC has actually told me thatsoftware, cryptographic software, is actually hardware.'' ``It is quite clear to me,'' Junger adds, ``that the State Departmentand the National Security Agency and other elements in the executivebranch of the government are attempting to restrain the communicationof information about cryptographic software not only abroad, but alsowithin the United States, because they do not want us actually to beable to use cryptography to preserve the privacy of our thoughts andour communications. It is as if the government required one to get alicense before explaining how to make or use an envelope, even thoughit did not forbid the use of envelopes themselves. After all, allthat cryptographic software is is a way of making electronicenvelopes.'' ORAL ARGUMENT SCHEDULED Junger v. Christopher has been placed on a fast track by Judge Nugent.On September 5 he established a briefing schedule: the plaintiff'sbrief was due and was filed today and the government's response is dueon Friday, October 18. Oral argument is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20. Judge Nugent's decision is expected before the first of the year. BACKGROUND ON THE LITIGATION Litigation is expensive. Professor Junger and his volunteer lawyerswere only able to bring the suit because of a generous gift by ananonymous donor of $5,000 that was used to create the ITAR LegalAttack Fund. Additional donations by Professor Junger and others haveincreased that fund to more than seven thousand dollars. Scarselli and Vasvari are lawyers in private practice in Cleveland whohave dedicated much of their professional lives to the protection ofFirst Amendment freedoms. The third lawyer on the team is KevinO'Neill, a law professor at Cleveland State University and the formerlegal director of the Ohio Chapter of the American Civil LibertiesUnion. --30--WT01-B05-56IA044-000801-B011-424http://samsara.law.cwru.edu:80/comp_law/jvc/complaint.html 129.22.184.108 19970118132907 text/html 26643HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 13:32:59 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 26471Last-modified: Thu, 31 Oct 1996 00:30:44 GMT Junger v.

This is an action for declaratory and injunctive reliefbrought by a law professor to protect his rights and the rights ofothers to teach, publish and otherwise disclose unclassifiedcryptographic information to foreign students and other foreignpersons without first obtaining a license or approval from thegovernment. The plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of specificprovisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR,""the regulations"), 22 C.F.R. §§ 120 et seq., thatrequire a license or approval from the government before "exporting"cryptography and seeks to enjoin the defendants from using, orthreatening to use, such provisions to restrict him and others fromdisclosing cryptographic information. JURISDICTION,VENUE AND PARTIES 2. This action arises under theFirst and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and theconstitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Declaratory relief issought under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. The jurisdiction of thisCourt is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. 3. Theplaintiff resides in the Northern District of Ohio. Since this is asuit against officials and/or agencies of the federal government,venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). 4. The plaintiff,Peter D. Junger, is a citizen of the United States and a professor oflaw at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland,Ohio. 5. The individual defendants are members of the executivebranch of the government of the United States. The individualdefendants are sued as officers or employees of the United Statesacting under color of law in their official capacities. 6. WarrenChristopher is the United States Secretary of State. 7. WilliamJ. Lowell is the Director of the Department of State's Bureau ofPolitico-Military Affairs, Office of Defense Trade Controls("ODTC"). 8. Lt. General Kenneth A. Minihan is the Director ofthe National Security Agency ("NSA"). 9. The defendants and theirrespective agencies (also referred to as "the government") areresponsible for the interpretation and administration of the ITARprovisions at issue in this complaint. BACKGROUND 10. The plaintiff teaches a course entitled"Computers and the Law" at the Case Western Reserve University LawSchool ("CWRU Law School"). The plaintiff has offered this course inthe fall semester of each year since 1993 and is scheduled to offer itagain this fall. 11. In May 1993, the plaintiff wrote a shortencryption program that he intended to use in his class the followingfall. 12. On numerous occasions beginning on or about May 7,1993, the plaintiff contacted the Department of Commerce, Departmentof State, the ODTC and the NSA to determine whether his program wassubject to export regulations. To the best of plaintiff's knowledgeand information, any answer that the plaintiff received, or may havereceived, from the persons he contacted is not binding on theirrespective agencies and thus cannot be relied on by the plaintiff oranyone else. 13. The plaintiff has prepared, and continues toprepare, materials for his computer law course. These materialsinclude (i) a casebook, which the plaintiff is currently revising foruse in class this coming fall, (ii) handouts supplementing andextending the information contained in the casebook and (iii)duplicates of some of those materials and additional materials thatwill be available on the plaintiff's World Wide Web ("WWW," "Web")server at http://samsara. law.cwru.edu or other WWW servers linked tothe plaintiff's server. 14. These materials referred to in theabove paragraph currently include, or will include, the source code,algorithm and representations of machine code for the encryptionprogram initially created by the plaintiff in May 1993 along with thesource codes, application programs and algorithms for othercryptographic systems, including the Diffie-Hellman key distributionprotocol, the Hellman-Merkle public-key "knapsack" system (U.S. PatentNumber 4,218,582) and the RSA and RC4 algorithms. The materials willalso contain information on how to obtain and how to use programsimplementing the DES, triple-DES, or RSA algorithms, such as theencryption program "Pretty Good Privacy" ("PGP"). The cryptographicinformation1 included in theplaintiff's materials, other than his program, was taken from publicsources, including materials published in books, journals and oninternet. 15. For fear of violating ITAR, the plaintiff hasrefrained from disclosing his program and other cryptographicinformation to foreign persons other than some Canadian students thathe allowed to enroll in his computer and law class in 1994 under thebelief that disclosure to Canadians was exempt from ITAR. For the samereason, the plaintiff has not disclosed his program and othercryptographic information at faculty discussions in the presence offoreign colleagues and, other than the Canadian students in 1994, hehas not allowed foreign students to enroll in his computer and lawclass. The plaintiff has required, and continues to require, thatstudents taking the class certify that they are citizens of the UnitedStates or admitted to permanent residence in the United States. 16. In class, the plaintiff has disclosed, and will continue todisclose, cryptographic information, including source codes,representations of machine code, and information on how to use andwhere to obtain functioning encryption programs to his students. Forclass this coming fall, the plaintiff will require students toparticipate in exercises that require them to obtain and have somehands on experience with cryptographic software. 17. In discussions on the internet, the plaintiff has been forced tobe very careful not to disclose cryptographic information to foreignpersons for fear of violating ITAR. Thus, for example, on or aboutAugust 22, 1994, after Paul Leyland of Oxford University ComputingServices in Oxford, England, posted a short encryption program writtenin the "C" programming language and which performs the same encryptionfunction as the plaintiff's program, to the sci.crypt.researchnewsgroup, the plaintiff could not respond, as he wished, by postinghis program to the newsgroup. Moreover, when the plaintiff sentMr. Leyland an email message requesting permission to includeMr. Leyland's program in his course materials, the plaintiff could notdisclose his program or Mr. Leyland's program to Mr. Leyland withoutviolating ITAR. 18. The plaintiff wants to publish his coursematerials as a text book and has begun writing a law review article onITAR and cryptography that will include his program and othercryptographic information. For fear of violating ITAR, the plaintiffhesitates to publish his course materials and any law review articlethat contains cryptographic information. 19. For fear ofviolating ITAR, the plaintiff has refrained from making his coursematerials available to others with whom he would like to shareinformation. Thus, on or about May 29, 1996, Peter M. Gerhart, whowas then the Dean of CWRU Law School, requested a copy of theplaintiff's course materials for a colleague in the People's Republicof China. The plaintiff was forced to deny this request since thematerials contained information that could not be sent to Chinawithout a license or other permission from the ODTC. 20. None ofthe cryptographic information that the plaintiff seeks to teach,publish or otherwise disclose is classified information, and all ofit, other than the plaintiff's program, is available in books,libraries and on the internet. 21. The plaintiff has beeninformed and believes that the defendants have taken the position thatsoftware that contains no cryptographic routines whatsoever, but whichcould be modified to include cryptographic routines, (also referred toas "crypto with a hole") is subject to regulation under ITAR. 22.The plaintiff is required to register for a fee with the ODTC andobtain a license or approval before he can lawfully "export" hisprogram or other cryptographic information that is not specificallyexempted under ITAR. 23. The definition of "export" in 22 C.F.R. § 120.17 includes"sending or taking a defense article out of the United States in anymanner," 22 C.F.R. § 120.17(a)(1), "[d]isclosing (including oralor visual disclosure) or transferring technical data to a foreignperson, whether in the United States or abroad, 22 C.F.R. §120.17(a)(4), and "performing a defense service on behalf of, or forthe benefit of, a foreign person," 22 C.F.R. § 120.17(a)(5).2 24. Cryptographic software isclassified as a "munition" under Category XIII of the United StatesMunitions List ("USML"), 22 C.F.R. § 121.1, and, thus, a "defensearticle" under 22 C.F.R. § 120.6. 25. At least some, if notall, of what is included under the definition of "cryptographicsoftware" is included under the definition of "technical data" in 22C.F.R. § 120.10, which is also listed on the USML under CategoryXIII and, thus, is a defense article. The furnishing of cryptographicsoftware and cryptographic technical data to foreign persons may alsoconstitute a "defense service," as defined in 22 C.F.R. §120.9. 26. Under 22 C.F.R. Part 122, a person who intends toexport a defense article or provide a defense service "on behalf of,or for the benefit of, a foreign person" must register with the ODTCfor a fee of at least $250.00 even if that person is not in thebusiness of manufacturing or exporting defense articles or defenseservices. 27. Under 22 C.F.R. Parts 123-25, a person must obtaina license or written approval from the ODTC before exporting a defensearticle, defense service or technical data unless some specificexemption applies. 28. Thus, absent some exemption, a personmust register with the ODTC and obtain a license or written approvalfrom the ODTC before exporting cryptographic software and/or technicaldata. 29. The public domain exemption in 22 C.F.R. § 120.11and the exemption for general scientific, mathematical or engineeringprinciples in 22 C.F.R. § 120.10(a)(5) do not exempt all of thecryptographic information that the plaintiff seeks to disclose. 30. 22 C.F.R. § 127.1 makes it is unlawful toexport or attempt to export from the United States any defense articleor technical data or to furnish any defense service for which alicense or written approval is required ... without first obtainingthe required license or written approval from the Office of DefenseTrade Controls. 31. Under the provisions of ITARreferred to in the paragraphs above, the defendants can require alicense or government approval prior to the dissemination of privatelydeveloped, unclassified cryptographic software and/or technical datato any foreign person within the United States and to anyone, withoutlimitation, outside the United States. CLAIMSFOR RELIEF Count One: Prior restraint 32. The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to31 as if fully rewritten. 33. The plaintiff has been, and is,compelled to exclude students who are "foreign persons" from hiscomputer law course because it would be a violation of the ITAR forhim to disclose cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technicaldata that is not specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign studentswithout first applying for and obtaining a license or approval fromthe ODTC. 34. The plaintiff is prohibited from disclosingcryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical data that is notspecifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students, lawyers,professional colleagues and all other foreign persons without firstapplying for and obtaining a license or approval from the ODTC. 35. The plaintiff is prohibited from publishing his course materialsand law review articles that contain cryptographic software and/orcryptographic technical data that is not specifically exempted underITAR if the course materials and law review articles are available toforeign persons within the United States or available outside theUnited States without first applying for and obtaining a license orapproval from the ODTC. 36. The plaintiff is prohibited frompublishing cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical datathat is not specifically exempted under ITAR on the internet withoutfirst applying for and obtaining a license or approval from theODTC. 37. The plaintiff must register for a fee with the ODTCbefore disclosing cryptographic software and/or technical data that isnot specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students and foreigncolleagues or publishing cryptographic software and/or technical dataon the internet. 38. ITAR's restrictions on the export of"cryptographic software" and "technical data" without a license or thegovernment's approval have chilled the plaintiff's speech and havecaused him to restrict his research and censor his publications andcommunications with foreign persons. 39. There is no provision ofITAR that allows for judicial review of ODTC decisions. 40. Theprovisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above constitute aprepublication registration and licensing scheme, and thus a priorrestraint on free expression, in violation of the First Amendment tothe United States Constitution. Count Two:Overbreadth and Vagueness 41. Theplaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 40 as iffully rewritten 42. The provisions of ITAR referred to in theparagraphs above, as written and as interpreted by the defendants,control a substantial amount of speech. The provisions in questiongovern all disclosures of cryptographic software and all disclosuresof cryptographic technical data that are not specifically exempted,including disclosures of unclassified information. 43. Theprovisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above, as written andas interpreted by the defendants, have been drafted and applied insuch a confusing way that the plaintiff cannot be sure whatcryptographic information is exempt from ITAR and what requires alicense or written approval from the ODTC. As a result, theplaintiff's speech has been, and continues to be, chilled. 44.The provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above, as writtenand as interpreted by the defendants, have been drafted and applied insuch a confusing way that persons other than the plaintiff cannot besure what cryptographic information is exempt from ITAR and whatrequires a license or written approval from the ODTC. The plaintiff isinformed and believes that, as a result, the speech of others hasbeen, and continues to be, chilled. 45. To the best ofplaintiff's knowledge and information, there are no published criteriaor standards available to him or the public on which the defendantsbase their decisions to grant or deny licenses for the export ofcryptographic information other than guidelines for the export of massmarket encryption software. 46. The provisions of ITAR referredto in the paragraphs above are overbroad and vague, facially and asapplied to the plaintiff's conduct, and are thus unconstitutional inviolation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United StatesConstitution. Count Three: Restrictions onAcademic Freedom and Political Speech 47.The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 46 asif fully rewritten. 48. The provisions of ITAR referred to in theparagraphs above restrict the plaintiff's rights to teach, researchand publish unclassified cryptographic information in whatever mannerhe chooses and to whom he chooses. 49. The provisions of ITARreferred to in the paragraphs above also restrict and the rights ofthe plaintiff and others, particularly foreign students and foreignprofessors within the United States, to receive and discussunclassified cryptographic information. 50. A knowledge ofcryptography is important for understanding and evaluating governmentefforts to establish key escrow systems, such as the Clipper Chip,that have significant consequences for individual rights. Thus,cryptographic information is a matter of public debate, and in thecontext of a public debate, restrictions on cryptographic informationare restrictions on political speech. 51. The provisions of ITARreferred to in the paragraphs above are not narrowly drawn, and thegovernment does not have a compelling interest to regulate allunclassified cryptographic information. 52. The provisions ofITAR referred to in the paragraphs above are unconstitutionalrestrictions on academic and political speech in violation of theFirst Amendment . Count Four: Freedom ofAssociation 53. The plaintiffrealleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 52 as if fullyrewritten. 54. The provisions of ITAR referred to in theparagraphs above require that the plaintiff apply for, and obtain, alicense or approval from the government before allowing foreignstudents to enroll in his class, before allowing foreign professors toattend faculty discussions where cryptographic software and othercryptographic information is discussed and before postingcryptographic software and/or other cryptographic information on theinternet where it may be available to foreign persons. 55. Theprovisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above restrict therights of the plaintiff and U.S. citizens and permanent residents tofreely associate with foreign persons to discuss cryptographicinformation and further restrict the rights of foreign persons withinthe United States to discuss cryptographic information withU.S. citizens and permanent residents. 56. The plaintiff andanyone else intending to disclose cryptographic information for whicha license is required, other than those exporting mass encryptionsoftware, must identify each and every recipient of the information,including every foreign persons within the United States who receivesthe information, in order to obtain a license from the ODTC. 57.By requiring the identification of all recipients of cryptographicinformation, the defendants are compelling the disclosure of foreignpersons who pose no threat to national security and with whom theplaintiff and others communicate. 58. It is practicablyimpossible for the plaintiff to name each recipient of cryptographicinformation that receives the information from the plaintiff's website or FTP server. 59. The provisions of ITAR referred to in theabove paragraphs violate the plaintiff's and other's freedom ofassociation rights under the First Amendment. Count Five: Separation of Powers 60. The plaintiff realleges and incorporates hereinparagraphs 1 to 59 as if fully rewritten. 61. The provisions ofthe ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above allow the defendants tocontrol the dissemination of cryptographic information within theUnited States and on the internet. 62. The authority of thedefendants to implement and enforce ITAR is based on § 38 of theArms Export Control Act ("AECA"), 22 U.S.C. § 2778. 63. TheAECA does not authorize the registration or licensing of disclosuresof unclassified cryptographic information within the United States,including disclosures of unclassified cryptographic information on theinternet. 64. By requiring registration and a license prior tothe disclosure of unclassified cryptographic software or cryptographictechnical data within the United States, the defendants are engaged incontrolling the exchange of cryptographic information between personswithin the United States, including the dissemination of cryptographicinformation on the internet. The defendants have therefore adopteda de facto policy of restricting the domestic dissemination ofunclassified cryptographic information which has the direct effect ofrestricting the availability of cryptographic software within theUnited States. 65. Congress, and not the Executive, isconstitutionally responsible for formulating and determining domesticpolicy on cryptography and for placing restrictions on theavailability of cryptographic software within the United States. 66. Congress has not delegated its responsibility referred to in theparagraph above to the President or the defendants. 67. Bydesignating unclassified cryptographic software and technical data asdefense articles, the defendants are regulating information andexpression as defense articles. 68. Section 2778(h) of the AECAprecludes judicial review of the designation of items as defensearticles. 69. To the extent that the AECA authorizes thedefendants to regulate disclosures of unclassified cryptographicsoftware and cryptographic technical data within the United States,§ 2778(h) of the AECA unconstitutionally deprives the Judiciaryof its responsibility to review potential restrictions on informationand expression. 70. Thus, the defendants act in violation of theconstitutional doctrine of separation of powers by regulatingunclassified cryptographic information in violation within the UnitedStates. PRAYER FORRELIEF WHEREFORE, the plaintiff demandsthat judgment be entered against the defendants. Specifically, theplaintiff demands such declaratory, injunctive and other relief asfollows: (1) A declaration that the provisions of theInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. §§ 120 etseq., referred to in the paragraphs above that require registration anda license or government approval before the "export" of unclassified"cryptographic software" and "cryptographic technical data," as those termsare defined in ITAR, are unconstitutional in violation of the First andFifth Amendments and the constitutional doctrine of separation ofpowers. (2) A declaration that, to the extent that the Arms ExportControl Act, 22 U.S.C. § 2778, authorizes the regulation ofunclassified cryptographic software and cryptographic technical data withinthe United States, § 2778(h) is unconstitutional in violation of theconstitutional doctrine of separation of powers. (3) Preliminaryand permanent injunctions enjoining the defendants from interpreting,applying, and enforcing the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22C.F.R. §§ 120 et seq., to require that the plaintiff andhis students register or obtain a license or approval from the defendantsbefore disclosing to any person or persons by speech, publication or anyother means or by any medium, any unclassified information aboutcryptography, whether or not that information is included within thedefinition of "software" or "technical data" as those terms are defined inITAR. (4) A permanent injunction enjoining the defendants frominterpreting, applying and enforcing the International Traffic in ArmsRegulations, 22 C.F.R. §§ 120 et seq., to require that anyperson or persons register or obtain a license or approval from thegovernment before disclosing to any other person or persons by speech,publication or any other means or by any medium, any unclassifiedinformation about cryptography, whether or not that information is includedwithin the definition of "software" or "technical data" as those terms aredefined in ITAR; (5) An award of attorney fees pursuant to theEqual Access to Justice Act, costs and such other relief as the Court deemsproper.

After all, most courses in law school are about so many things that they are not really about any particular thing, while those courses, like Law and the Chicken,1 for example, that are about some one thing, are clearly about that thing, and need no further explanation. But the course in Computers and the Law is not about everything under the sun (and is not even about everything that the instructor's whim might lead him2 to discuss). On the other hand, the course in Computers and the Law is not really about computers, but rather about what we3 make of them, or do with them, or can do with them---and how we do it. That is, Computers and the Law is not about a ``thing''---not about anything---like a computer, but rather about a process---about a ``doing''---like the process that we, rather infelicitously,4 call computing. And, of course, the course is also about the law, but that too is not a tangible thing that just sits there like a bread box or a lump of iron, for the law too is a process, something that we, especially we lawyers, do. One of the things that I am striving to teach---or, rather, to assist the students in understanding---in the course in Computers and the Law5 is the importance of being able to distinguish between the tangible computer, sitting there like a lump of plastic and hardware on the desk, and the things that we do with computers---the processes that we run on computers. But this distinction between the tangible thing and the intangible process is not the major theme of the course. It is, after all, not that difficult in most cases to tell the dancer from the dance.6 And even if the distinction between the computer and what it does is not always that easy to make, one is not likely to confuse the two in practice.7 The critical distinction has to do, not with computers themselves, not with the hardware, but with the so-called software,8 the programs that run on a computer. That distinction is the distinction between software as a text9 and software as a process.10 That distinction---which is also, when one gets right down to it, the distinction between the law in books and the law in action11---is the major subject of the course, and thus of this article. 2 The Importance of Distinguishing Between Text and Process The distinction between between software as text and software as a process is critical to an understanding of how the law of copyright applies---or should apply---to computer programs.12 That distinction, or one very similar, is also critical to an understanding of how patent law applies to computer programs.13 The distinction, however, has its greatest importance---at least for a course in Computers and the Law offered in the United States---when one tries to understand how the First Amendment of the federal constitution applies to computer programs. 2.1 The First Amendment and Computer Programs Once one recognizes the distinction between software as a text and software as a process, one would think that the question of how the First Amendment applies to computer programs could easily be resolved: the First Amendment, like the Copyright Act,14 quite obviously protects software as a text, but not as a process, and, of course, it does not protect the tangible, kickable hardware.15 The difficulty that people have with this distiction, however, appears to lie in recognizing it at all, rather than in figuring out how the First Amendment (or, for that matter, the Copyright Act) applies once the distinction has been made. People seem to believe that software is software, a program is a program, and they just do not see that it makes any difference whether it---whatever ``it'' may be---is being communicated as a text or run as a process. Before we go on and examine why it is difficult for many lawyers and law students---and others---to recognize this distinction, it probably would be best to point out that the issue of whether the First Amendment protects software is not a purely academic matter. At least one sort of software, ``cryptographic software'' very broadly defined,16 is subject, at the time I write these words, to a licensing scheme under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (hereinafter the ``ITAR'') that would, I submit, clearly be unconstitutional were it to be applied to more traditional texts like political pamphlets or Harlequin romances or Playboy magazine. I will discuss this licensing scheme and the particular problems that it presents hereafter17, but at this time I want to bring your attention to two statements that President Clinton made in an Executive Order and in an accompanying Memorandum to the Vice President ordering the transfer of the administration of this licensing scheme from the State Department to the Department of Commerce: Because the export of encryption software, like the export of other encryption products described in this section, must be controlled because of such software's functional capacity, rather than because of any possible informational value of such software, such software shall not be considered or treated as ``technology,'' as that term is defined in section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996)[.]18 and Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically be transformed into object code, and because export of such source code is controlled because of the code's functional capacity, rather than because of any ``information'' such code might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption product, and not as technical data or technology, for export licensing purposes.19 2.2 Functional Capability Versus Informational Value The distinction that President Clinton attempts to make in the Executive Order between the ``functional capability''---or the ``functional capacity''---of the software, on the one hand, and its ``informational value''---or ``the `information' . . . [it] might convey''---, on the other, is pretty much the distinction between the process---the execution of instructions contained in the software---, on the one hand, and the text containing those instructions, on the other. Quite clearly,20 the President makes this distinction because he recognizes that the First Amendment protects the communication of information, even information about cryptography, but does not so clearly protect, and arguably does not protect at all, the process of running a cryptographic program on a computer.21 The problem that the Administration faces can be easily, if not succintly, stated.22 They23 want to be able to eavesdrop on communications throughout the world and to read any stored information, which is difficult to do if the communications and the information are encrypted.24 So they would like to outlaw the use of encryption, which they probably cannot do within the United States because Congress will not go along with it,25 and which they could not do, even if Congress went along with it, in any effective manner outside of the United States. But the Administration---the Executive Branch---does have the authority to regulate exports, both as a matter of its own inherent authority26 and under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act27 (``AECA'') and the Export Administration Act,28 (``EAA'') even if the latter act has expired and is no longer actually in force.29 So the solution would seem at first glance to be to forbid the export of devices that are capable of encrypting communications and information, i.e., that are, in the words of the ITAR, capable of ``maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information or information systems''.30 But that solution will not work---and not only because there are many foreign enterprises that are capable of making dedicated cryptographic devices and that would be delighted not to have competition from United States firms---for the fact of the matter is that any general purpose computer---even the old 8088 laptop, which is not nearly powerful enough to run MSWindows and which has a dysfunctional battery to boot, that I keep by the telephone and use as an address book---is capable of being programmed to maintain secrecy and confidentiality. Every programmable computer is a potential cryptographic device. And, though the Administration may be willing to forbid the export of a few high-end super-computers, it is not willing to---and probably as a political, if not a legal, matter is not able to---forbid the export of all computers. That, after all, would almost certainly have disastrous consequences for the economy of the United States. So, if it is not possible to forbid the the export of computers that are capable of running cryptographic programs, why not just forbid the export of the programs themselves, i.e., of information about how to use a computer as a cryptographic device?31 There are, however, a couple of objections to this approach, though the first is easily solvable by an Administration that believes that among its inherent powers is that of Humpty Dumpty to have words mean only what they want them to mean.32 The first objection is that ordinarily it is only tangible goods---tangible devices, like computers---that are exportable. The solution, of course, is to define ``export'' so that it includes the communication of information, even the communication of information within the United States if the communication is to a foreign person---or to a public that inevitably includes foreign persons---as being an export.33 So that takes care of the first problem.34 But the other problem is trickier, because it is not just a matter of definitions. The difficulty is that the government's requiring one to get a license before communicating information publically---before publishing information---is the classic example of an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.35 ``But,'' says our President, ``I am not forbidding the communication of information, I am just forbidding the communication of the functionality.'' As if one could communicate anything other than information. As if the information that may be ``conveyed'' by software is anything other the way it functions. Still I am quite sure that, at least in this instance, the President is being sincere. Those who are not familiar with the way that computers work---and some of those who have that familiarity---just don't get it. And I am afraid that that group includes the President.36 But sincere incomprehension of what it is that computers do---even when coupled with a sincere dislike of the whole infra dig idea of ever having even to touch a computer37---hardly is sufficient justification, as a legal matter, for denying the protection of the First Amendment to the authors and publishers38 of computer programs, especially when it is not only cryptographic software that would be deprived of First Amendment protection were the courts to accept this argument from ignorance. If the government can forbid the communication of the text of computer programs that have the capability of ``maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information or information systems''39 then it would seem that it could forbid the communication of the text of any computer program whose use it finds objectionable.40 2.2.1 On Not Getting It The question naturally arises, if the distinction betweeen programs as text and programs as process is as clear and as important as I claim, why is it that so many don't get it? The short answer, of course, is that they don't get it because they haven't taken my course in Computers and the Law.41 A better answer is that most of those who fail to grasp the distinction between a program as a text and a program as a process42 have never knowingly43 read or written a computer program. There is an old story about the professor who admitted, with some embarassment, that he did not know how a radio worked. One of his students, surprised at such ignorance, said: ``But that's easy. You just push the on switch and then turn the dial to the station that you want to hear.'' OK. So you know how to turn a computer on, and slip in a floppy disk, and use the mouse to click on the icon for whatever word processor it is that you use.44 But that does not mean that you know anything about computer programs or programming. Surely that is enough to explain why the ordinary computer user does not grasp the distinction between programs as texts and programs as processes. 2.2.2 What Do Digital Programmable Computers Do? My course in Computers and the Law45 is not about all forms of computers, for it does not deal with slide rules and abaci and so-called ``neural-nets''. It is only about digital, programmable computers. Now to the ordinary user46 of such a computer, the terms ``digital'' and ``programmable'' may sound familiar, but they are not likely to be very meaningful, since the user seldom comes across data in digital form and has neither the occasion nor the ability to do any programming. So one of the first things I to do in the course is to introduce the students to those concepts and even try to give them a little hands-on experience, which is not that easy in a course with no lab component.47 Fortunately one can run simple computer programs in one's head and simulate their operations on a blackboard, stepping through the instructions one by one.48 One can also explain about digits, using one's fingers or some marks on a blackboard as an example. And one can explain enough about logic gates---with a little hand-waving and the use of some truth-tables---to let the students understand enough about how computers manipulate digits for the purposes of the course.49 The first case that we deal with in the course,50 Gottschalk v. Benson,51 supplies the motivation for studying this material. It holds that an algorithm,52 even one that specifies a process53 that runs on a computer, cannot be patented, and computer programs are basically algorithms written as a set of instructions to a computer.54 So Benson appears to hold that computer programs cannot be patented,55 which is a good reason for trying to figure out what computer programs are and what they do. Benson serves as a good introduction for another reason: it is an excellent demonstration of the operations that are actually performed by a computer: the rearrangement of signs---of the binary digits ``1'' and ``0''---that we interpret as symbols. The algorithm in Benson specified a method for converting binary coded decimal number symbols into the corresponding binary coded number symbols.56 In other words, a program implementing the algorithm would contain a set of instructions that, when implemented, would cause a computer that was fed a certain pattern of one's and zero's to spit out another pattern of such binary digits, patterns that we can treat as symbolizing---as representing---numbers, or. if we wish, as representing letters or the key to a secret code. All that digital computers do, all that they can do, is receive a pattern of ones and zeros, which we may choose to interpret as being the binary representation of a number, and then, in accordance with the instructions57 that comprise their program, produce a pattern---a string of one and zeros---, which we may also choose to interpret as a binary representation of a number, or as an English phrase, or as one of the innumerable names of God. And nota bene that both the input and the output are simply a text, text that contains a number, or an English phrase, or a computer program, or some of the innumerable names of God. Now, as you have probably noticed, I do not seem to be able to do a good job of explaining these matters in this article. It is much easier to actually demonstrate the points at a blackboard, by stepping through the algorithm and showing how, if one just follows the instructions, one pattern gets converted to another. I must confess, however, that I have never been able to actually step through the Benson algorithm and get the right result. I am not very good at that sort of thing, and anyway we have computers to do jobs like that.58 So I solved that problem by writing a program59 that implements a much simpler algorithm---in fact, the simplest useful algorithm that I have ever come across---an algorithm for encrypting a plain text message by using a one-time pad. The program itself is very short, the actual machine code is only 111 bytes60 in length. The source code in assembly language is much longer, but that is mainly because it contains a lot of comments explaining how it works. And the instructions for using the program are also given as comments in the source code. I include the program in my course materials61 so that my students can read it62 and then in class we step through63 the instructions---just the three or four critical instructions64---and observe how they cause a byte taken from the plain text---from the unencrypted message---to be twiddled65 together with a byte taken from the one-time pad and the result to then be put in the file that contains the encrypted text. Besides the source code in assembly language, the materials also include a hexidecimal66 representation of the program's machine code, the product of running the source code through an assembler program.67 I do not expect the students to read this text---few people can actually read 8086 machine code---but I do require them to input it, hexidecimal digit by hexidecimal digit, using the primitive hexidecimal editor included in the MSDOS utility known as DEBUG, and to save it as a file known as TWI.COM. TWI.COM is thus an actual working version of my little encryption program. The students can get further hands-on experience by running it. Initially I supply them with a plain text68 and a key, i.e., a one-time pad.69 Using TWI.COM and the key to decrypt the secret message contained in the text produces another copy of the TWI.COM program. A little more experimenting with the program should be enough to convince one of the contra-intuitive fact that, if one has a text that is n bytes long, with the approriate key one can demonstrate that that text contains any other text of the same length. Thus, for example, one can show that the first few lines of Hamlet contain the secret message: ``This here play was written by me, the Earl of Oxford'', and that the electronic edition of Alice in Wonderland is actually an encrypted version of the help-file included in MicroSoft Windows 95.70 And by these means I hope that the students in my course in Computers and the Law do obtain a working knowledge of what programs are, and understanding of the nature of programs both as text and as working processes. 2.2.3 Reading and Writing Computer Programs The Jargon File contains the following three definitions: program: n. 1. A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error messages. 2. An exercise in experimental epistemology. 3. A form of art, ostensibly intended for the instruction of computers, which is nevertheless almost inevitably a failure if other programmers can't understand it.71 The first of these definitions defines ``program'' from the point of view of a user; the third defines the term from the point of view of a programmer.72 From a programmer's point of view, a program is a text that the programmer writes that, though it contains instructions that are intended ultimately to be run on a computer, must be comprehensible at least to its author and normally also to other programmers. If the programmer does not understand how the program works, then one can be pretty sure that it won't work at all, and even if it does work, the programmer will never be able to modify it or improve it. If one is going to write a program successfully, one has to be able to step through the program in one's own head. If one cannot do that, one can hardly expect to know what the program will do or how it can be debugged. Most programs of any significance, moreover, are written by a team of programmers or, if they are written by a single author, are part of a larger project. So it is not only the original author who has to be able to read and understand the program, it is all the other programmers on the team. Those whose job it is to maintain the program and get it to work with other programs also have a need to read it and understand it. Even if the original author never reads the program, all the support personnel who maintain it are going to have to read it.73 It is only the poor user who cannot read it and usually does not have access to it. And that is why users are so often losers.74 Writing programs hardly differs from writing other functional texts. It is very much like legal drafting75, or writing technical manuals or instructions on how to assemble a lawn mower, or preparing tables of useful information like the values of the sine of x for varying values of x or the opening and closing prices of all issues of stock sold on the New York Stock Exchange for each day of the last three years, or compiling the white pages of a Telephone Directory or a book of recipes entitled ``How to Cook a Seagull''. But surely no one76 would argue that a book containing mathematical tables or a sheet of paper containing the instructions for assembling a lawn mower or a cookbook is not a text entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, just because it is functional. Consider that book of mathematical tables. In the good old days BC77 one would use it to find the value of \sin x for whatever value of x you were interested in. Today you would probably use a computer program to calculate that value.78 Thus the computer program and the book of mathematical tables have exactly the same functionality.79 The book and the computer program are both texts, while looking something up in the book or running the computer program is a process. As you may recall, President Clinton in his Memorandum to the Vice President stressed that the new Commerce Department regulations licensing the ``export'' of cryptography applied to source code ``[b]ecause source code can easily and mechanically be transformed into object code, and because export of such source code is controlled because of the code's functional capacity, rather than because of any ``information'' such code might convey[.]''80 This passage succinctly, if rather cryptically, restates an argument that has repeatedly been made by the government's lawyers in cases---including the one I brought81---challenging the constitutionality of those provisions of the ITAR that treat the publication, or other disclosure to foreign persons, of cryptographic software as an ``export'' that is subject to the licensing requirements of the ITAR and of the Arms Export Control Act.82 The problem that the government has in those cases, or at least in Karn83 and Bernstein,84 that inspired this argument is that the cryptographic programs at issue in those cases were written---and would, if the plaintiffs prevail in those suits, be published---not as working programs that would actually run on a computer, but as ``source code'' written in a fairly high level computer language known as ``C''.85 Such source code is written by human beings86 in the C ``language'' and is intended to be read by other human beings87 as well as to be compiled into so-called ``object code'' or ``machine code'', instructions represented as binary numbers that can actually be executed by the computer (and that are more difficult for a human being to understand, and much more difficult for for a human being to modify, than the corresponding instructions in the source code.) Thus, before the government could argue---or at least assert---that it was imposing its licensing requirements on the program's functionality rather than on its text---or on the information contained in its text---, it had to argue---or at least assert---that source code, which clearly does and is intended to convey information to other human beings, has ``functional capability''. And, of course, source code does have functional capability, but so does a book of legal forms or a cookbook. You copy out a form on a xerox machine, fill in the blanks with your ball point pen, and then sign it in front of witnesses and---voila!---there you have a new will. You compile the source code of Paul Leyland's program in two lines of C,88 which might not be quite as easy a job as President Clinton claims, feed it a chunk of plain text and a one-time pad, and---voila!---out pops an encrypted message. You clean the seagull, place it in a large pot with two pounds of parsnips, a large onion, and a pint chicken broth, add a number two can of kidney beans and a bay leaf, place a cover on the pot, and leave it to simmer for four hours, just as the recipe says, and, after two hours---oops!---the whole mess explodes and you have a good cause of action against the cookbook's author who never told you that you should open that can of beans. The fact that the source code can be compiled into object code does not make that source code less of a text. I am, after all, writing this text in the form of LaTeX source code and it is only after I ``easily and mechanically'' transform that source code by running it through the LaTeX program to create a .dvi file---which is not what I would call humanly readable---, and easily and mechanically transform that .dvi file by running it through the DVIPS program to create a PostScript file---which is nearly as hard to read as the .dvi file---, and then send that file to a PostScript printer that ``easily and mechanically'' prints out the hard-copy version of this article, all nicely typeset, that there is a text in the form that you are reading it. Yet all those various forms---the LaTeX file, the .dvi file, the PostScript file, and the hard-copy version---are texts, and are really all the same text, since they all contain the same information, viz., this article.89 And the fact that the object code---the machine code---is not easily humanly readable does not keep it from being a text. In fact, in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.90 the court held that object code is not only a text, but a ``literary work'' and copyrightable as such.91 And the fact that machine code is difficult to read does not mean that it is never read; quite the contrary. If one wants to find out how a program works, and one does not have access to the source, then all one can do is decompile or disassemble the machine code, which one can do mechanically, if not easily, and get back something that more or less resembles the original source code without any comments or helpful mnemonic labels. And then one can read that decompiled or disassembled machine code and find out how the program works. This ability to decompile or disassemble the machine code has generated some interesting legal issues, for software publishers that only supply machine code versions of their programs often claim both that the machine code is protected by copyright and that it is protected as a trade secret. But if one can decompile the machine code and figure out how it works, it is not much of a secret is it?92 Now frankly I would not be too upset if the courts were to grant less constitutional protection to machine code than to source code. That would mean that almost all the programs that I use would still be constitutionally protected since they are supplied in source code form.93 And it would mean that that the commercial programs that are supplied by outfits like Micorsoft without source code would not be protected. There would be a certain justice in that result. But I do not see how it could be constitutionally justified. Microsoft's programs are, when they are being sold to some unfortunate user, texts, and just because those texts may be badly written and quite unreadable and contain little functional capability does not mean that they should not be protected as texts. I mean, if we insisted that texts be readable, then few law review articles would be entitled to constitutional protection. 3 Copyright The distinction between text and process, which is, or so I contend, critical to an understanding of computers and the law, is made most clearly in the law of copyright. Thus the Copyright Act provides: Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.94 Although the term is not used, it would be hard to find a better definition of ``text'' than ``a work of authorship''. The Copyright Act also provides: In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.95 And there we have the specific statement that copyright protection does not extend to a ``process.'' But there we also come across a problem with my claim that the major distinction is between texts, or works of authorship, on the one hand, and processes, or procedures and methods of operation, on the other, for the Copyright Act lumps processes and similar concepts together with ideas, concepts, principles, and discoveries, which, though they are clearly not texts, are as clearly not what most of us mean by the term ``processes''. In the law of copyright the traditional distinction has not been between texts and processes, it has been between ideas and the expression of ideas. Thus, for example, in Mazer v. Stein96 the Supreme Court said: ``Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea---not the idea itself.''97 There is, however, a couple of good reasons for my not treating the idea/expression dichotomy as fundamental. In the first place, that distinction applies only to copyrights, and not to First Amendment or to Patent rights. In the second place, if one takes the distinction seriously, one is likely to get bogged down in serious metaphysical problems:98 I mean, how on earth can one have an idea without expressing it? How can one tell the idea from its expression? If we were only discussing copyright law we could say that the fundamental distinction is between texts and whatever it is---idea, system, or process---that the text might be said to contain. It is only when one tries to find a distinction that applies to copyright, to patent, and to First Amendment law, that the text/process dichotomy seems to be the fundamental distinction. I am not, after all, claiming that this distinction actually exists in some sort of Platonic reality, I am only suggesting that it is a useful tool when one tries to understand the subject matter of my course in Computers and the Law. In that context, the major issue in copyright law has to do with distinguishing between protecting a computer program as a text99 and not protecting it as a process.100 The Supreme Court has never considered this issue and the circuits have not treated it consistently. In Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.101 the Third Circuit held that Franklin's copying of the Apple II operating system102 was an infringement of Apple's copyright, despite the clear language of the statute that the protecion of copyright does not extend to systems and methods of operation. On the other hand, in Lotus Development Corporation v. Borland International, Inc.103 the First Circuit held that Borland's copying of the ``computer menu command hierarchy'' in Lotus 1-2-3 was not an infringement of Lotus's copyright, because the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure. There is obviously an exam question or two lurking there. 4 Patents Patent protection, unlike copyright protection, expressly covers processes. Thus the Patent Act provides: Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.104 On the other hand, the Supreme Court has read several exceptions into this list of patentable subject matters. The matters that cannot be patented include ``ideas'' and ``phenomena of nature''. And in Gottschalk v. Benson105 the Court held that an algorithm for use in a computer program could not be patented, perhaps because an algorithm is an idea or a natural law, like magnetism,106 but more probably because an algorithm, although a process, is a mental process---one that one can, at least in theory and perhaps very slowly, run in one's head.107 On the other hand, in Diamond v. Diehr108 the Court held that a patent was not invalid just because it claimed a mathematical formula and called for the use of a computer as part of an invention that otherwise fell within the scope of patentable subject matter.109 And the Federal Circuit of late has taken to acting as if it had overruled Benson.110 One question that we took up in the course is whether the patent that was issued on the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is valid.111 A more interesting question though is whether one can get both a patent on a computer program claimed as a process and a copyright on the same program claimed as a text. 5 The ITAR and I A major concern of mine, that kept intruding into the course, even when perhaps it was inappropriate, is the problem that the ITAR causes me. Since it expressly forbids the disclosure of cryptographic software, including algorithms, to foreign persons within the United States or abroad and defines cryptographic software as including software with the capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality, unless one first obtains a license---a so-called Commodity Jurisdiction Determination---from the Department of State, I have been unable to publish my course materials and make them available on my world wide web server, because they include the text of my little encryption program and of Paul Leyland's similar program in two lines of C and of the RSA source code and of the reverse-engineered RC2 and RC4 programs, and information about where one can get the Pretty Good Privacy encryption program---a practicable public key encryption program. Not being able to supply the world with the text of the Pretty Good Privacy Program, because it has the capability when run of protecting one's privacy, raises a particularly tricky legal issue, since I am convinced that any lawyer who uses e-mail or the world wide web to communicate with his clients has the ethical---and perhaps in some cases the legal---duty to make it possible for them to effectively encrypt their communications. How can one have a duty to use the process of encryption---to use cryptographic software---when communicating with one's clients and at the same time have a duty not to disclose the text of that software to one's clients? I think that that is more than just a potential exam question. Footnotes 1 This may not be a good example, for any course that must deal with both the Sick Chicken Case (A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935) (holding that the ``Live Poultry Code'' adopted under the authority of the National Recovery Act amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by Congress)) and the Causby Case (United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946)) (holding that it was a taking of property for which compensation was required under the Fifth Amendment when the government flew its bombers so low over the Causby's dwelling and chicken farm that as many as six to ten of their chickens died in one day of fright)) should probably be placed in the category of courses that are about many different things. It seems that ``the Chicken'' is just a placeholder for all the innumerable legal problems that may arise involving chickens. 2 Nota bene that this is not a sexist usage; I am the instructor and I am masculine. One of the most useful lessons to be learned from studying computers is the necessity of precision, for computers always do what you tell them to do (or, if your instructions are ambiguous, crash), even if what you said is not what you meant. In my experience, the skills of a legal draftsman and those of a computer programmer are identical; studying one leads to mastery of the other. 3 Sentient beings, intentional beings, human beings, or whatever. 4 The words ``computer'' and ``computing'' have an unfortunate connotation when applied to machines, since computation is an act that can be performed only by intelligences, and---for all practical purposes in so far as we know---only by human intelligences. In fact a ``computer'' was originally, as the Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary puts it: ``One who computes; a calculator, reckoner; spec. a person employed to make calculations in an observatory, in surveying, etc.''. (I happen to know this from personal experience, not from just reading the dictionary, since the teacher under whom I studied plain geometry in high school spent his summers working as a computer for an oil company, and I myself, one summer when I was working as a gravity observer on an oil exploration crew up in the North West Territories, was drafted into spending a few evenings working as the computer's assistant.) It is rather as if we were to call a typewriter simply a ``writer'' and then assume that it---rather than a human author---actually does the writing. To make matters worse, the type of machine that we call a ``computer'' is used for much more than merely computing, it is also used for word processing and data processing and language translation and any other process that involves the manipulation of symbols---or, rather, of signs. The French, I think, made a better choice when they elected to call computers ordinateurs. 5 And as my computer writes this I realize that I should change the course name to ``Computing and the Law'', a change that I hope can be implemented before it is offered again next Fall. 6 Though it hardly helps that at the level of ultimate reality there is no difference between the dancer and the dance, or, rather, that there is no dancer and no dance, but only the dancing itself, just as it is. Or at least that is what the Buddha---so I have heard---teaches. In the course in Computers and the Law I am not trying to proclaim the Buddha Dharma, but rather only to teach the plain old everyday sort of law---i.e., dharma---that is the usual subject of law courses in law schools in the United States. (I am not even trying to teach about computers except to the extent that that is necesary to understand the legal problems that arise from the computing process; I am neither a computer scientist nor a Buddhist priest). I do not believe that in the United States the solution, or even the posing, of legal problems should---or constitutionally can---turn on the teachings about the nature of reality that are proclaimed by any particular religion. And that is perhaps the greatest difficulty with teaching about computers and the law. How can one distinguish between the dancer and the dance, or the words and the song, without sinking into the slough of religion and metaphysics? 7 It should be noted, however, that the Office of Defense Trade Controls in the United States Department of State confused---or tried to confuse---computers with their functioning when it adopted that portion of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that treats software---which it insists is ``functionality''---as something like a computer that can actually be exported. See infra Section 5. 8 The first definition of ``software'' given by the OED 2d is: ``The programs and procedures required to enable a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system''. This sounds harmless enough, but the OED also quotes the following example of the term's use, a passage that suggests, correctly, that its use is often infelicitous: ``1965 Hollingdale & Tootill Electronic Computers 192 The cost of developing and making the computer itself (the hardware) is matched by the cost of making programming schemes for it (often, regrettably, termed software).'' The term ``software'' is misleading to the extent that it suggests that software is---computer programs are---the same sort of ``ware'' as the hardware, i.e., the computer, upon which it runs. To dispel this confusion it is perhaps enough to note that the term ``wetware'' is often used by cognitive scientists to refer to the (usually human) brain: it is unlikely that anyone could actually believe that computers and brains and computer programs are all the same sort of ``thing'', although many a cognitive scientist at least tries to believe that the wetware, the brain, is just a sort of complicated computer on which the programs that we call the mind are running. But this distinction between hardware and software just involves the distinction between physical objects, on the one hand, and processes, on the other. If you want to give a cognitive scientist a hard time, just ask him where the programs of the brain are stored when they are not running---and then ask him what the programs are stored as. That is a good question: What are our thoughts stored as when we are not thinking them? As a text? The OED 2d defines ``ware'' as: ``A collective term for: Articles of merchandise or manufacture; the things which a merchant, tradesman, or pedlar, has to sell; goods, commodities. '' And in this context the distinction, or lack thereof, between hardware and software takes on considerable legal significance: are computer programs goods that are covered by the Sales Article of the UCC and subject to sales tax? See ???. Or are they processes or services? 9 Which, for just one example, can be copyrighted. See infra text accompanying Note 94. 10 Which cannot be protected by copyright. See infra text accompanying Note 95. 11 Thus attempts to regulate the distribution of software texts on the grounds that they are functional processes are the equivalent of an attemp to regulate the distribution of legal form books because the forms are functional and may be used to consumate a sale---or institute a lawsuit against the government. For an actual example of a failed effort to regulate the publication of a legal form book, see In re New York County Lawyers' Association v. Dacey, 21 N.Y.2d 694 (1967) (holding that it was not the unauthorized practice of law for a non-lawyer to publish a book containly chiefly legal forms and entitled ``How to Avoid Probate''). 12 See infra Section 3. 13 See infra Section 4. 14 See infra text accompanying Notes 94 & 95. 15 Except to the extent that the process itself, or the hardware, might be a part of ``the press''---the process of producing and publishing texts---that is specifically protected by the First Amendment. 16 The ITAR lists ``Cryptographic (including key management) systems, equipment, assemblies, modules, integrated circuits, components or software with the capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information or information systems'' as an item on the United States Munition List [22 CFR § 121.1 Category XIII(b)(1)] that cannot be ``exported'' without a license and it also defines ``software'': Software includes but is not limited to the system functional design, logic flow, algorithms, application programs, operating systems and support software for design, implementation, test, operation, diagnosis and repair. [22 CFR § 121.8(f)]. 17 See infra Section 5. 18 Executive Order No. ??? , November 15, 1996. Here is the definition of ``technology'' set out in section 16 of the Export Administration Act (``EAA''), as well as the definition of ``good'': As used in this Act --- (3) the term ``good'' means any article, natural or manmade substance, material, supply or manufactured product, including inspection and test equipment, and excluding technical data; (4) the term ``technology'' means the information and know-how (whether in tangible form, such as models, prototypes, drawings, sketches, diagrams, blueprints, or manuals, or in intangible form, such as training or technical services) that can be used to design, produce, manufacture, utilize, or reconstruct goods, including computer software and technical data, but not the goods themselves . . . . 50 U.S.C. App. 2415 ``Technology'' is also defined in Part 772 of the Export Administration Regulations (``EAR'') as `` Specific information necessary for the `development', `production', or `use' of a product.'' EAR Part 772 also defines ``software'' as ``A collection of one or more `programs' or `microprograms' fixed in any tangible medium of expression''. Part 722 also defines ``Program'' as ``A sequence of instructions to carry out a process in, or convertible into, a form executable by an electronic computer'' and ``microprogam'' as ``A sequence of elementary instructions, maintained in a special storage, the execution of which is initiated by the introduction of its reference instruction into an instruction register''. The requirement in the EAR's definition that a ``program'' must be ``fixed in any tangible medium of expression'' is identical with the beginning of requirement of the Copyright Act that for a work to be entitled to copyright protection it must be ``fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device''. [17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (emphasis added)] 19 Memorandum From President Clinton to the Vice President, dated November 15, 1966, Paragraph 4. 20 Quite clearly since the same distinction has repeatedly been made by the government in response to the legal challenges brought by Karn, Bernstein, and myself to the constitutionality under the First Amendment of the licensing restrictions on the ``export'' of cryptographic software contained in the ITAR. See infra text accompaning Notes 83, 84, and 81. 21 For a discussion of the constitutionality of a law prohibiting the use of cryptography, particularly ``unescrowed strong cryptography'', see Froomkin, The Metaphor Is the Key: Cryptography, the Clipper Chip, and the Constitution, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 709 809-882 (1995). It should be noted that a ban on the use of cryptographic software would raise many constitutional issues that would not necessarily be implicated by a ban on the use of other sorts of software. 22 But not easily solved, at least not in a way that is satisfactory to the Administration. 23 There is quite clearly a division within the Administration as to what the most important goals should be when it comes to regulating cryptography. Part of the problem for the Administration is that they cannot agree; some of them---although I admit that this appears unlikely---may even assign a high value to the freedom of speech and of the press that is protected by the First Amendment. 24 [Stick in definition of encryption, from Schneier or Froomkin ???] 25 And because the courts might well find such a law unconstitutional. See Froomkin supra Note 21. 26 See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936). 27 [get cite ???] 28 [get cite ???] 29 [get cite ???] 30 See supra Note 16. 31 There is no need to discuss here the issues that arise when the export of a tangible device is forbidden and the disclosure of information about how to use that device is also forbidden. For such a case, see United States v. Edler Indus., 579 F.2d 516 (1975). It should be noted, however, that the cases, like Karn, infra Note 83, Berstein, infra Note 84, and Junger, infra Note 81, in which the government argues that under the ITAR information about cryptographic software can be subject to licensing because cryptographic software itself is subject to licensing, do not fit into this category of cases, because crytographic software itself is not a tangible device, no matter how much the government tries to confuse the issue. 32 ``When I use a word,'' Humpty Dumpty said in a rather a scornful tone, ``it means just what I choose it to mean---neither more nor less.'' ``The question is,'' said Alice, ``whether you can make words mean different things.'' ``The question is,'' said Humpty Dumpty, ``which is to be master---that's all.'' [get cite ???] 33 Thus the ITAR defines ``export'' as: Export means: (1) Sending or taking a defense article out of the United States in anymanner, except by mere travel outside of the United States by a person whosepersonal knowledge includes technical data; or (2) Transferring registration, control or ownership to a foreign person ofany aircraft, vessel, or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List, whetherin the United States or abroad; or (3) Disclosing (including oral or visual disclosure) or transferring in theUnited States any defense article to an embassy, any agency or subdivision of aforeign government (e.g., diplomatic missions); or (4) Disclosing (including oral or visual disclosure) or transferringtechnical data to a foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad; or (5) Performing a defense service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, aforeign person, whether in the United States or abroad. . . . . 22 CFR § 120.17. ``Technical data'' is defined in the ITAR as: Technical data means, for purposes of this subchapter: (1) Information, other than software as defined in § 120.10(d), which is required for the design development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance or modification of defense articles. This includes information in the form of blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, instructions and documentation. (2) Classified information relating to defense articles and defense services; (3) Information covered by an invention secrecy order; (4) Software as defined in § 121.8(f) of this subchapter directly related to defense articles; (5) This definition does not include information concerning general scientific, mathematical or engineering principles commonly taught in schools, colleges and universities or information in the public domain as defined in § 120.11. It also does not include basic marketing information on function or purpose or general system descriptions of defense articles. 22 CFR § 120.10. You may have noticed that despite the reference in § 120.10(1) to § 120.10(d), there is no § 120.10(d). The government's lawyers argue, however, that this is a typographical error and that the reference is actually supposed to be to § 120.10(4), so that § 120(1) expressly excludes from the definition of technical data the software that is expressly included in that definition by § 120(4). (For the definition of software that is contained in § 121.8f, see supra Note 16.) Now you may find that that is totally confusing; I certainly do. When I tried to find out about the ``typo'' from an agent of the National Security Agency, who worked at the Office of Defense Trade Contros and whose job it was to answer questions about the application of the ITAR to cryptography, her only answer was: ``That's your government at work.'' ``Defense serice'' is defined in the ITAR as: Defense service means: (1) The furnishing of assistance (including training) to foreignpersons, whether in the United States or abroad in the design,development, engineering, manufacture, production, assembly, testing,repair, maintenance, modification, operation, demilitarization,destruction, processing or use of defense articles; or (2) The furnishing to foreign persons of any technical datacontrolled under this subchapter (see § 120.10), whether in theUnited States or abroad. 34 Unless someone points out that the statutes under which the President is acting---the AECA and the, now defunct, EAA---do not authorize this verbal gimmick. 35 See Near v. Minnesota, [???]. 36 And probably the Vice President as well, even thought he has been televised while publicly ``chatting'' at a computer terminal. 37 After all, that is why one has secretaries. 38 And even speakers. Voice recognition software has gotten to the point where instructions, at least simple ones, can be given to computers orally---and, more importantly, to the point where computers will honor such oral instruction. So we now have spoken software. I suppose that I should add that though I believe that spoken software is as much entitled to First Amendment protection as written software, I do believe that the law can constitutionally forbid one from saying, loudly, and very clearly and distinctly, ``COM PU TER RE FOR MAT HARD DISK NOW'' in a workplace crowded with lots of voice sensitive computers. On the other hand, I do believe that my writing and publication of this text---this footnote---, even though it contains, in written form, the oral instructions necessary to get a properly programmed computer to wipe its hard disk clean, is protected by the First Amendment. Once again: one has to distinguish between the process---which it may be a crime to run---and the text---which is fully protected by the First Amendment. 39 See supra Note 16. 40 Even if---as is the case with cryptographic software---it makes no effort to regulate the use of the program. 41 Or, if they have, because I failed in teaching it. 42 That runs on a computer, or in a brain, or wherever. 43 They have very likely used a word processor of some sort, but that does not mean that they are aware of the fact that the text that they type in, with all its hidden codes used to specify italics or indented paragraphs and things like that, is actually a program that the word processor converts into instructions to the printer that in turn cause the printer to print out a nicely laid out page of text. 44 I must admit that I cannot do that; I have never seen an icon that I could understand. That is partly why. when I use a computer, I use an operating system that allows me to type in my instructions, rather than one with a a so-called WIMP interface. I learned, after all, how to type, and how to read and write, years ago. ``WIMP'', by the way, is an acronym formed from ``Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device''. The Jargon File defines a ``WIMP envionment'' as: A graphical-user-interface-based environment, as described by a hacker who prefers command-line interfaces for their superior flexibility and extensibility. 45 And consequently this discussion. 46 The term ``user'', often spelled ``luser'' and pronounced ``loser'', is rather a term of contempt when used by someone who actually knows something about computers. There is some merit to this position, even if it is rather unkind. For the user is often a loser when he struggles to make his computer do something that it is supposed to do, and ends up buying an expensive ``upgrade'' that does not work either. One question that comes up in a course in computers and the law that perhaps does not directly involve the distinction between text and process is, why there is so little litigation about defective software, when most computer programs---especially those sold as commodities---really don't work very well. 47 It would be most helpful, but I fear quite unprecedented, if computer centers at colleges and universities---instead of offering the latest network hardware and a few courses in the trivia of word processing or how to cruise the internet---would actually make available to students and faculty the sort introduction to computers and computing that I got as a practicing lawyer in the mid-sixties when some of us---who felt that we ought to know something about those new gadgets that so many of our clients were installing---snuck into the IBM Executive Computer Concepts Course. That course was for comptrollers and financial vice-presidents of large corporations who were thinking about acquiring their company's first real computer. Besides the never stated goal of selling some computers, the major effort of the course was directed toward giving us---all those high-powered corporate types and one rather junior lawyer---enough of an understanding of how computers work to keep us from being hornswaggled by the programmers and engineers who would actually run our new machines. It was, I think, the roughtest course I ever took, even if everyone was guaranteed to graduate in the top ten percent of the class. It was also one of the most effective. We were first introduced to a simulated model of a 1950's computer---back in the days before any programming language had been invented---and a card punching machine. (Do you remember those old ``Don't Bend Fold or Mutilate'' punched cards?) Our first assignment was to punch a pack of cards containing the instructions---written in so-called ``machine language'' as a binary number, that is, as a string of one's and zero's---that would cause the computer to calculate the then present value of the thirty-eight dollars that were paid for Manhattan back in the seventeenth century. The calculation seemed to work all right when the interest rate was set at two or three percent---although, since the answer was printed out as a rather large binary number, none of us really could be sure. But when we tried to get the computer to calculate the present value with an interest rate of six percent, the answer we got was just plain wrong. At six percent the number we were calculating grew too large to be held in the computer's accumulator, so the computer just threw away the high digits. At that point the financial types looked rather uncomfortable and I had visions of all sorts of interesting law suits dancing in my head. And all of us knew then far more about the things that computers do than do most of the users of today. And the next day they invented assembly language. Now that, I think, is the sort of course that every college student should be required---or at least have the opportunity---to take. I fear, however, that such a course will never be offered by academic computer centers. I mean, if they offered such a course, they might not be able to hornswaggle us so easily. 48 This process of stepping through the program---or the segment that is causing one difficulties---in one's head is often the key to debugging a badly behaved program. 49 The problems that we study in the course do not involve any detailed understanding of logic gates. 50 Other than trial court decisions in Bernstein and Karn that touch on the issues of why I cannot publish my class materials or permit foreign students to take the course. See infra Section 5. 51 409 U.S. 63 (1972). 52 ``A procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem is known as an `al-gor-ithm.''' 409 U.S. at 65. ``Algorithms: Precise rules for transforming specified inputs into specified outputs in a finite number of steps''. Donald E. Knuth, 2 The Art of Computer Programming, Seminumerical Al-go-rithms 699 (2d ed., 1981). 53 The Patent Act provides that to be eligible for patent protection, an invention must be either a process, an article of manufacture, a composition, or a machine. See 35 U.S.C. § 101. 54 Thus the ITAR specifically includes algorithms in the definition of ``software''. See supra Note 16. 55 But see infra Section 4. 56 Thus the binary coded decimal representation of the number ten is the pattern of binary digits---the ``bit'' pattern---00010000, while the binary coded representation of that number is 00001010; the algorithm in Benson specified a series of steps by which a computer when given the first pattern as input would produce the second pattern as output. It is worth looking again at the pattern 00010000. If we interpret it as a binary coded decimal number then its value is, as I just said, ten, but if we interpret it as a binary coded number then its value is sixteen. The computer may rearrange the patterns, but it is we who interpret them. 57 And those instructions also take the form of a pattern of one and zeros that can be interpreted as a binary number. 58 I might also add in my defense that the algorithm in Benson seems at points to be rather ambiguous, something that no algorithm should ever be. 59 In 8086 assembly language using the MASM assembler. 60 In the ASCII code that is most often used to represent Roman characters in a computer, each character is eight binary digits long (though only seven of those binary digits are meaningful). Binary digits are usually called bits, and eight bits are called a byte. 61 And, since it is an encryption program capable of maintaining secrecy and confidentiality, that---that and the fact that the materials include other cryptographic software and technical data---prevents me from publishing my materials by posting them on my world wide web site or making them available in ``hard'' copy, without first obtaining a license from the State Department under the ITAR. But there will be more of that hereafter. See infra Section 5. 62 As a text. The only things that one can read are texts. 63 Stepping through the program is a process. 64 The rest have to do with opening a file and incrementing pointers to keep track of where we are and things like that that are just housekeeping and not really part of the algorithim that the program implements. 65 Since I want to publish this and have neither the time nor the inclination to apply for a license---which is called a Commodity Jurisdiction Determination---under the ITAR from the State Department, I am not able here to explain exactly how that ``twiddling'' is done, though I do, of course, explain it in my class, which foreign students are not permitted to take. 66 Decimal numbers include the ten digits 0 through 9; hexidecimal numbers, on the other hand, include the sixteen digits, 0 through 9 and then A through F. Thus fifteen is written as ``15'' in decimal notation and as ``F'' in hexidecimal notation, while sixteen is written as ``16'' and ``10'' respectively. Hexidecimal numbers are used by computer programmers in preference to decimal numbers because the hexidecimal numbers from zero to fifteen can be represented exactly by four binary digits. There thus is no need to have a program, like the one in Benson, to convert a hexidecimal coded representation of a number into a binary coded representation. 67 The input to the assembler is the text containing the source code code; the output of the assembler is the text containing the machine code, the text that contains instructions in the form that the machine will implement when they are fed one by one into the machine's central processing unit. 68 An article about my problems with the ITAR that I posted some years ago on the RISKS e-mail discussion list that I have made available on my world wide web server at URL: http://samsara/comp\underline law/myrisks.txt. 69 I had considerable difficulty in making a machine readable copy of the key available to the students since I felt that I could not safely post it on the web server. After all, if one knows how my program works, and that is not hard to figure out if one knows anything about computers, or about logic, and if you have access to both the plain text and the one-time pad, then you can easily decrypt the plain text and come up with a working copy of the TWI.COM program. So I would need to get permission from the State Department before publically disclosing both the plain text and the one-time pad. 70 This raises some interesting evidentiary problems, doesn't it? 71 The Jargon File, URL: http://ww.ccil.org/jargon/. The Jargon File is a dictionary of computer jargon that was originally maintained at MIT. 72 The second footnote defines ``program'' as that term is likely to be viewed as a philosopher. The use of TWI.COM program described supra in Section 2.2.2 is, I suppose, an example of experimental epistemology. In this article I have, however, tried to avoid the use of philosophical terminology. You may have noticed, for example, that I have not once, until now, referred to the distinction between a sign and a signifier or used the word ``semiotic''. 73 The reason that most software that is sold as a commodity works so badly is that it typically is not sold with humanly readable source code, and the support personnel at the vendor's hot-line typically do not have access to the source either---and probably could not understand it even if it were available. 74 See supra Note 46. I do not want to be a loser, under the malicious control---at least it usually feels like its malicious---of some software publisher or system administrator. That is one of the reason why on my computers I run an operating system called Linux, which comes with all its source code, and application programs like the GNU EMACS editor and the LaTeX typesetting program that also come with source code. (The other reasons are that these programs are free, are more powerful, and are much better supported than are their commercial counterparts.) 75 See supra Note 2. The only difference is that in practice, programmers have to be much more precise than legal draftsmen. Common sense, and sometimes a judge, may prevent a poorly drafted contract---or governmental regulation like the ITAR---from causing havoc. But computers do not have common sense and notoriously do what one tells them to do, not what one intends them to do. There are many computer programs that check other computer programs for ambiguities, bad syntax, and inconsistencies. It would be a worthwhile project to see if these programs could be modified to critique drafts of legal instruments. 76 Other than perhaps Judge Bork and a few others who believe that the First Amendment only protects political speech. 77 Before Computers. 78 An early IBM computer was affectionately known by the acronym CADET, which stood for ``Can't Add, Doesn't Even Try''. The CADET computer could not perform any arithmetical calculations, it just looked the answers up in a table that was stored on its drum, which was an early storage device shaped like a drum rather than a disk. 79 Except that the program probably contains more, and more accurate, information. 80 See supra text accompanying Note 19. 81 Junger v. Christopher, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Case No. 1:96 CV 1723. 82 See infra Section 5 83 Karn v. United States Dep't of State, 925 F. Supp. 1 (1996). 84 Bernstein v. U.S. Dep't of State, 922 F. Supp. 1426 (1996). 85 C is [t]he name of a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement Unix; so called because many features derived from an earlier compiler named `B' in commemoration of its parent, BCPL. . . . C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying according to the speaker, as ``a language that combines all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the readability and maintainability of assembly language''. The Jargon File supra. 86 Though it may be difficult for technophobes---a class that I fear includes many lawyers and most law teachers---to comprehend, computer programmers are human beings too. 87 Quite often programs that are written in C code are not actually intended to be actually compiled and run on a computer; they are just written as a convenient way to present algorithms and to transmit information to other programmers. As I understand it, this was actually the case with respect to the cryptographic source code of the programs at issue in Karn and Bernstein. And sometimes programs are written in C not to be compiled and run, but to demonstrate the author's skill at using that language. My course materials include a one-time pad encryption program in two lines of C written by Paul C. Leyland of Oxford University Computing Services that falls in this category; its art lies in its brevity, but it is not what I would call user friendly. (But then, exactly the same can be said of my little one-time pad program.) Most large programs have many authors, each of whom must be able to read the code written by the others, and those who have the responsibility for debuging and updating the programs normally do so by reading and patching the source code and then recompiling it. Many programs written in C are distributed only in source code form and have to be adapted to the needs of particular machines and then compiled into machine code before they will actually run. See supra text accompanying Notes 71-74. 88 See supra Note 87. 89 At this point you should give thanks that I am not indulging in any philosophical speculations. See supra Note 72. 90 714 F.2d 1240, 1249 (3d Cir. 1983), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 1033 (1984). 91 For a little more on this subject, see infra Section 3. 92 A company named RCA Data Seccurity, which holds patents that supposedly cover several encryption algorithms, also published two encryption programs---RC2 and RC4---that were supposedly trade secrets. Yet someone, no one knows quite who, was able to decompile the machine code for RC4 and reverse engineer the program and produce an implementation of that program in C, which was then posted anonymously to an e-mail list on the Internet. And a year later someone did the same wtih RC2. There was a lot of fussing and gnashing of teeth, but neither of these incidents produced any litigation. (I cannot, of course, tell you how to get those ``reverse engineered'' programs because of the requirements of the ITAR, even though the programs are publically available on the internet.) 93 See supra Note 74. The definition of source code would, of course, have to include not only code written in C, but also code written in interpreted languages like Perl that are run directly on the computer without being first converted into a separate program in object code. The only selfish reason that I have to object to the exclusion of machine code from the protection of the First Amendment, since I could distribute my programs---and the other programs that I want to make available, like the Pretty Good Privacy encryption program---in the form of source code, is that few of my students, or other prospective readers, will have the necessary assemblers, compilers, and interpreters to convert the source code into functional object code. The slaves of the machine---and of Microsoft or Apple---seldom can afford those fundamental tools.

Registration does notconfer any export rights or privileges. It is generally a preconditionto the issuance of any license or other approval under thissubchapter.  § 122.2 -- Submission of registration statement.   (a) General. The Department of State Form DSP-9 (RegistrationStatement) and the transmittal letter required by paragraph (b) ofthis section must be submitted by an intended registrant with apayment by check or money order payable to the Department of State ofone of the fees prescribed in § 122.3(a) of this subchapter. TheRegistration Statement and transmittal letter must be signed by asenior officer who has been empowered by the intended registrant tosign such documents. The intended registrant shall also submitdocumentation that demonstrates that it is incorporated or otherwiseauthorized to do business in the United States. The Office of DefenseTrade Controls will return to the sender any Registration Statementthat is incomplete, or that is not accompanied by the required letteror payment of the proper registration fee.   (b) Transmittal letter. A letter of transmittal, signed by anauthorized senior officer of the intended registrant, shall accompanyeach Registration Statement.   (1) The letter shall state whether the intended registrant, chiefexecutive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officersor officials (e.g.  comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or anymember of the board of directors:   (i) Has ever been indicted for or convicted of violating any of theU.S.  criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.27 of thissubchapter; or   (ii) Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license orother approval to import defense articles or defense services from, orto receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of theU.S. Government.   (2) The letter shall also declare whether the intended registrantis owned or controlled by foreign persons (as defined in § 120.16of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is owned or controlledby foreign persons, the letter shall also state whether the intendedregistrant is incorporated or otherwise authorized to engage inbusiness in the United States.   (c) Definition. For purposes of this section, ownership means thatmore than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the firmare owned by one or more foreign persons. Control means that one ormore foreign persons have the authority or ability to establish ordirect the general policies or day-to-day operations of thefirm. Control is presumed to exist where foreign persons own 25percent or more of the outstanding voting securities if noU.S. persons control an equal or larger percentage. The standards forcontrol specified in 22 CFR 60.2(c) also provide guidance indetermining whether control in fact exists.  § 122.3 -- Registration fees.

A DSP-5 isrequired for the reexport of such unclassified defense articles afterincorporation into another article, modification, enhancement,upgrading, alteration or improvement.   (c) Requirements. To use an exemption under § 123.4 (a) or(b), the following criteria must be met:   (1) The importer must meet the eligibility requirements set forthin § 120.1(b) of this subchapter;   (2) At the time of export, the ultimate consignee named on theShipper's Export Declaration (SED) must be the same as the foreignconsignee or end-user of record named at the time of import; and   (3) As stated in § 126.1 of this subchapter, the temporaryimport must not be from or on behalf of a proscribed country listed inthat section unless an exception has been granted in accordance with§ 126.3 of this subchapter.   (d) Procedures. To the satisfaction of the District Director ofCustoms, the importer and exporter must comply with the followingprocedures:   (1) At the time of temporary import-   (i) File and annotate the applicable U.S. Customs document (e.g.,Form CF 3461, 7512, 7501, 7523 or 3311) to read: "This shipment isbeing imported in accordance with and under the authority of 22 CFR123.4(a) (identify subsection)," and   (ii) Include, on the invoice or other appropriate documentation, acomplete list and description of the defense article(s) beingimported, including quantity and U.S. dollar value; and   (2) At the time of export, file with the District Director ofCustoms at the port of exit a Shipper's Export Declaration (Departmentof Commerce Form 7525-V) and include on the SED or as an attachmentthe following information:   (i) the U.S. Customs entry document number or a copy of theU.S. Customs documentation under which the article was imported;   (ii) the following statement: "22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR120.1(b) applicable."  § 123.5 -- Temporary export licenses.   (a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may issue a license forthe temporary export of unclassified defense articles (DSP-73). Suchlicenses are valid only if (1) the article will be exported for aperiod of less than 4 years and will be returned to the United Statesand (2) transfer of title will not occur during the period oftemporary export. Accordingly, articles exported pursuant to atemporary export license may not be sold or otherwise permanentlytransferred to a foreign person while they are overseas under atemporary export license. A renewal of the license or other writtenapproval must be obtained from the Office of Defense Trade Controls ifthe article is to remain outside the United States beyond the periodfor which the license is valid.   (b) Requirements. Defense articles authorized for temporary exportunder this section may be shipped only from [*39301] a port in theUnited States where a District Director of Customs is available, orfrom a U.S. Post Office (see 39 CFR part 20), as appropriate. Thelicense for temporary export must be presented to the DistrictDirector of Customs who, upon verification, will endorse the exitcolumn on the reverse side of the license. In some instances of thetemporary export of technical data (e.g postal shipments),self-endorsement will be necessary (see § 123.22(d)). Theendorsed license for temporary export is to be retained by thelicensee. In the case of a military aircraft or vessel exported underits own power, the endorsed license must be carried on board suchvessel or aircraft as evidence that it has been duly authorized by theDepartment of State to leave the United States temporarily.   (c) Upon the return to the United States of defense articlescovered by a license for temporary export, the license will beendorsed in the entry column by the District Director of Customs. Thisprocedure shall be followed for all exits and entries made during theperiod for which the license is valid. The licensee must send thelicense to the Office of Defense Trade Controls immediately uponexpiration or after the final return of the defense articles approvedfor export, whichever occurs first.  § 123.6 -- Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bondedwarehouses.   Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses areconsidered integral parts of the United States for the purpose of thissubchapter. An export license is therefore not required for shipmentbetween the United States and a foreign trade zone or a Customs bondedwarehouse. In the case of classified defense articles, the provisionsof the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual will apply. Anexport license is required for all shipments of articles on theU.S. Munitions List from foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bondedwarehouses to foreign countries, regardless of how the articlesreached the zone or warehouse.  § 123.7 -- Exports to warehouses or distribution points outsidethe United States.   Unless the exemption under § 123.16(b)(1) is used, a licenseis required to export defense articles to a warehouse or distributionpoint outside the United States for subsequent resale and willnormally be granted only if an agreement has been approved pursuant to§ 124.14 of this subchapter.  § 123.8 -- Special controls on vessels, aircraft and satellitescovered by the U.S. Munitions List.   (a) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of anyaircraft, vessel, or satellite on the U.S. Munitions List is an exportfor purposes of this subchapter and requires a license or writtenapproval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This requirementapplies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is physicallylocated in the United States or abroad.   (b) The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vesselor satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List which is notregistered in the United States but which is located in the UnitedStates constitutes an export. A license or written approval from theOffice of Defense Trade Controls is therefore required. Suchtransactions may also require the prior approval of the MaritimeAdministration, the Federal Aviation Administration or other agenciesof the U.S. Government.  § 123.9 -- Country of ultimate destination and approval ofreexports or retransfers.   (a) The country designated as the country of ultimate destinationon an application for an export license, or on a Shipper's ExportDeclaration where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, mustbe the country of ultimate end- use.

(e) Reexports or retransfers of U.S.-origin components incorporatedinto a foreign defense article to a government of a NATO country, orthe governments of Australia or Japan, are authorized without theprior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls,provided:   (1) The U.S.-origin components were previously authorized forexport from the United States, either by a license or an exemption;   (2) The U.S.-origin components are not significant militaryequipment, the items are not major defense equipment sold under acontract in the amount of $ 14,000,000 ($ 14 million) or more; thearticles are not defense articles or defense services sold under acontract in the amount of $ 50,000,000 ($ 50 million) or more; and arenot identified in part 121 of this subchapter as Missile TechnologyControl Regime (MTCR) items; and   (3) The person reexporting the defense article must provide writtennotification to the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the retransfernot later than 30 days following the reexport. The notification muststate the articles being reexported and the recipient government.   (4) In certain cases, the Director, Office of Defense TradeControls, may place retransfer restrictions on a license prohibitinguse of this exemption.  § 123.10 -- Non-transfer and use assurances.   (a) A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) is required forthe export of significant military equipment and classified articlesincluding classified technical data. A license will [*39302] not beissued until a completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Officeof Defense Trade Controls.

(b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83for the export of any other defense articles or defense services.   (c) When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense articleor defense service to a non-governmental foreign end-user, the Officeof Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of issuing thelicense that the appropriate authority of the government of thecountry of ultimate destination also execute the certificate.  § 123.11 -- Movements of vessels and aircraft covered by theU.S. Munitions List outside the United States.

Such avessel or aircraft may not enter the territorial waters or airspace ofa foreign country before returning to the United States, or carry ascargo any defense article, without a temporary export license (FormDSP-73) from the Department of State. (See § 123.5.)  § 123.12 -- Shipments between U.S. possessions.   An export license is not required for the shipment of defensearticles between the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,and U.S.  possessions. A license is required, however, for the exportof defense articles from these areas to foreign countries.  § 123.13 -- Domestic aircraft shipments via a foreign country.   A license is not required for the shipment by air of a defensearticle from one location in the United States to another location inthe United States via a foreign country.

In such cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an exportlicense application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the original ImportCertificate, which must be provided and authenticated by thegovernment of the importing country. This document verifies that theforeign importer complied with the import regulations of thegovernment of the importing country and that the importer declared theintention not to divert, transship or reexport the material describedtherein without the prior approval of that government. After deliveryof the commodities to the foreign consignee, the Department of Statemay also require U.S. exporters to furnish Delivery Verificationdocumentation from the government of the importing country. Thisdocumentation verifies that the delivery was in accordance with theterms of the approved export license. Both the Import Certificate andthe Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter bythe foreign importer.   (c) Triangular transactions.

(a) Certain proposals to foreign persons for the sale ormanufacture abroad of significant military equipment require eitherthe prior approval of, or prior notification to, the Office of DefenseTrade Controls.   (1) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior approvalrequirement. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls isrequired before a U.S.  person may make a proposal or presentationdesigned to constitute a basis for a decision on the part of anyforeign person to purchase significant [*39315] military equipment onthe U.S. Munitions List whenever all the following conditions are met:   (i) The value of the significant military equipment to be sold is $14,000,000 or more; and   (ii) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of anyforeign country other than a member of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan; and   (iii) The sale would involve the export from the United States ofany defense article or the furnishing abroad of any defense serviceincluding technical data; and   (iv) The identical significant military equipment has not beenpreviously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale underthe Foreign Military Sales Program of the Department of Defense, toany foreign country.   (2) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior notificationrequirement.  The Office Defense Trade Controls must be notified inwriting at least thirty days in advance of any proposal orpresentation concerning the sale of significant military equipmentwhenever the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through(iii) of this section are met and the identical equipment has beenpreviously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale underthe FMS Program to any foreign country.

For example, a presentation whichdescribes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, andprobable availability for delivery would require prior notification orapproval, as appropriate, where the conditions specified in paragraph(a) of this section are met. By contrast, the following would notrequire prior notification or approval: Advertising or other reportingin a publication of general circulation; preliminary discussions toascertain market potential; or merely calling attention to the factthat a company manufactures a particular item of significant militaryequipment.   (c) Satisfaction of requirements. (1) The requirement of thissection for prior approval is met by any of the following:   (i) A written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controlsapproving the proposed sale or agreement or approving the making of aproposal or presentation.

(g) License for technical data. Nothing in this section constitutesor is to be construed as an exemption from the licensing requirementfor the export of technical data that is embodied in any proposal orpresentation made to any foreign persons.  § 126.9 -- Advisory opinions.   Any person desiring information as to whether the Office of DefenseTrade Controls would be likely to grant a license or other approvalfor the export of a particular defense article or defense service to aparticular country may request an advisory opinion from the Office ofDefense Trade Controls. These opinions are not binding on theDepartment of State and are revocable. A request for an advisoryopinion must be made in writing and must outline in detail theequipment, its usage, the security classification (if any) of thearticles or related technical data, and the country or countriesinvolved. An original and seven copies of the letter must be providedalong with seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerningthe defense article or defense service.  [*39316]  § 126.10 -- Disclosure of information.   (a) Freedom of Information. Subchapter R of this title containsregulations on the availability to the public of information andrecords of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter Rapply to such disclosures by the Office of Defense Trade Controls.   (b) Determinations required by law. Section 38 of the Arms ExportControl Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) provides that certain informationrequired by the Department of State in connection with the licensingprocess may generally not be disclosed to the public unless certaindeterminations relating to the national interest are made inaccordance with the procedures specified by that provision.Determinations required by section 38(e) shall be made by theAssistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs.   (c) Information required under part 130. Part 130 of thissubchapter contains specific provisions on the disclosure ofinformation described in that part.   (d) National Interest Determinations. In accordance with section38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(e)), theSecretary of State has determined that the following disclosures arein the national interest of the United States:   (1) Furnishing information to foreign governments for lawenforcement or regulatory purposes; and   (2) Furnishing information to foreign governments and otheragencies of the U.S. Government in the context of multilateral orbilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime,the Australia Group, and CoCoM).  § 126.11 -- Relations to other provisions of law.   The provisions in this subchapter are in addition to, and are notin lieu of, any other provisions of law or regulations. The sale offirearms in the United States, for example, remains subject to theprovisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations administeredby the Department of the Treasury. The performance of defense serviceson behalf of foreign governments by retired military personnelcontinues to require consent pursuant to Part 3a of thistitle. Persons who intend to export defense articles or furnishdefense services should consequently not assume that satisfying therequirements of this subchapter relieves one of other requirements oflaw.  § 126.12 -- Continuation in force.   All determinations, authorizations, licenses, approvals ofcontracts and agreements and other action issued, authorized,undertaken, or entered into by the Department of State pursuant tosection 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, or underthe previous provisions of this subchapter, continue in full force andeffect until or unless modified, revoked or superseded by theDepartment of State.  § 126.13 -- Required information.

(b) In addition, all applications for licenses must include, on theapplication or an addendum sheet, the complete names and addresses ofall U.S.  consignors and freight forwarders, and all foreignconsignees and foreign intermediate consignees involved in thetransaction. If there are multiple consignors, consignees or freightforwarders, and all the required information cannot be included on theapplication form, an addendum sheet and seven copies containing thisinformation must be provided. The addendum sheet must be marked at thetop as follows: "Attachment to Department of State License From(insert DSP-5, 61, 73, or 85, as appropriate) for Export of (insertcommodity) valued at (insert U.S. dollar amount) to (insert country ofultimate destination)." The Office of Defense Trade Controls willimpress one copy of the addendum sheet with the Department of Stateseal and return it to the applicant with each license. The sealedaddendum sheet must remain attached to the license as an integral partthereof. District Directors of Customs and Department of Defensetransmittal authorities will permit only those U.S. consignors orfreight forwarders listed on the license or sealed addendum sheet tomake shipments under the license, and only to those foreign consigneesnamed on the documents.  Applicants should list all freight forwarderswho may be involved with shipments under the license to ensure thatthe list is complete and to avoid the need for amendments to the listafter the license has been approved. If there are unusual orextraordinary circumstances that preclude the specific identificationof all the U.S. consignors and freight forwarders and all foreignconsignees, the applicant must provide a letter of explanation witheach application.

Anysuch prohibition is referred to as a debarment for purposes of thissubchapter. The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-MilitaryAffairs shall determine the appropriate period of time for debarment,which shall generally be for a period of three years.   (b) Grounds. (1) The basis for a statutory debarment, as describedin paragraph (c) of this section, is any conviction for violating theArms Export Control Act (see § 127.3 of this subchapter) or anyconspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act.   (2) The basis for administrative debarment, described in part 128of this subchapter, is any violation of 22 U.S.C. 2778 or any rule orregulation issued thereunder when such a violation is of such acharacter as to provide a reasonable basis for the Office of DefenseTrade Controls to believe that the violator cannot be relied upon tocomply with the statute or these rules or regulations in the future,and when such violation is established in accordance with part 128 ofthis subchapter.   (c) Statutory Debarment. Section 38(g)(4) of the Arms ExportControl Act prohibits the issuance of licenses to persons who havebeen convicted of violating the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in§ 120.27 of this subchapter.  Discretionary authority to issuelicenses is provided, but only if certain statutory requirements aremet. It is the policy of the Department of State not to considerapplications for licenses or requests for approvals involving anyperson who has been convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Actor convicted of conspiracy to violate that Act for a three year periodfollowing pursuant to this policy. A list of persons who have beenconvicted of such offenses and debarred for this reason shall bepublished periodically in the Federal Register. Debarment in suchcases is based solely upon the outcome of a criminal proceeding,conducted by a court of the United States, that established guiltbeyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with due process. Theprocedures of part 128 of this subchapter are not applicable in suchcases.   (d) Appeals. Any person who is ineligible pursuant to paragraph (c)of this section may appeal to the Under Secretary of State forInternational Security Affairs for reconsideration of theineligibility determination. The procedures specified in § 128.13of this subchapter are applicable in such appeals.  § 127.8 -- Interim suspension.   (a) The Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls isauthorized to order the interim suspension of any person when theDirector believes that grounds for debarment (as defined in §127.6 of this part) exist and where and to the extent the Directorfinds that interim suspension is reasonably necessary to protect worldpeace or the security or foreign policy of the United States.  Theinterim suspension orders prohibit that person from participatingdirectly or indirectly in the export of any defense article or defenseservice for which a license or approval is required by thissubchapter. The suspended person shall be notified in writing asprovided in § 127.6(c) of this part (statutory debarment) or§ 128.3 of this subchapter (administrative debarment), whicheveris appropriate. In both cases, a copy of the interim suspension orderwill be served upon that person in the same manner as provided in§ 128.3 of this subchapter. The interim suspension order may bemade immediately effective, without prior notice. The order will statethe relevant facts, the grounds for issuance of the order, anddescribe the nature and duration of the interim suspension. No personmay be suspended for a period exceeding 60 days unless proceedingsunder § 127.6(c) of this part or under part 128 of thissubchapter, or criminal proceedings, are initiated before theexpiration of that period.   (b) A motion or petition to vacate or modify an interim suspensionorder may be filed at any time with the Under Secretary of State forInternational Security Affairs. After a final decision is reached, theDirector of the Office of Defense Trade Controls will issue anappropriate order disposing of the motion or petition and willpromptly inform the respondent accordingly.  § 127.9 -- Applicability of orders.   For the purpose of preventing evasion, orders of the AssistantSecretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, debarring a personunder § 127.6 and orders of the Director, Office of Defense TradeControls, suspending a person under § 127.7 may be madeapplicable to any other person who may then or thereafter (during theterm of the order) be related to the debarred person by affiliation,ownership, control, position of responsibility, or other commercialconnection.  Appropriate notice and opportunity to respond to chargeswill be given.  § 127.10 -- Civil penalty.   (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs,Department of State, is authorized to impose a civil penalty in anamount not to exceed that authorized by 50 U.S.C.

This civil penalty may be either inaddition to, or in lieu of, any other liability or penalty which maybe imposed.   (b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may make:   (1) The payment of a civil penalty under this section or   (2) The completion of any administrative action pursuant to thispart 127 or 128 of this subchapter a prior condition for the issuance,restoration, or continuing validity of any export license or otherapproval.  [*39319]  § 127.11 -- Past violations.   (a) Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, licensesor other approvals may not be granted to persons who have beenconvicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in§ 120.27 of this subchapter or who are ineligible to receive anyexport licenses from any agency of the U.S.  government, subject to anarrowly defined statutory exception.

(3) It is possible that the activity in question-despite voluntarydisclosure-might merit penalties, administrative actions, sanctions,or referrals to the Department of Justice for consideration as towhether criminal prosecution is warranted. In the latter case, theOffice of Defense Trade Controls will notify the Department of Justiceof the voluntary nature of the disclosure although the Department ofJustice is not required to give that fact any weight. The Office ofDefense Trade Controls has the sole discretion to consider whether"voluntary disclosure," in context with other relevant information ina particular case, should be a mitigating factor in determining what,if any, administrative action will be imposed. Some of the mitigatingfactors the Office of Defense Trade Controls may consider are:   (i) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had properapplication been made;   (ii) Why the violation(s) occurred;   (iii) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation;   (iv) Whether the person or firm has instituted or improved aninternal compliance program to reduce the likelihood of futureviolation(s);   (v) Whether the person making the disclosure did so with the fullknowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management. (If not,then a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure as covered inthis section.)   (4) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they berelied on, to create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits,privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by anyperson, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, orother matter.   (c) Notification.

(3) Factors to be considered include, for example, whether theviolation(s) were intentional or inadvertent; the degree to which theperson or firm responsible for the violation(s) making the disclosurewas familiar with the [*39320] laws and regulations; and whether theviolator was the subject of prior administrative or criminal actionunder the AECA. In addition to immediately providing writtennotification, persons, firms, companies and organizations are stronglyurged to conduct a thorough review of all export- related transactionswhere possible violation(s) are suspected.   (d) Documentation. (1) The written disclosure should be accompaniedby copies of those documents that substantiate it. Where appropriate,the documentation should include, but is not limited to:   (i) Licensing documents (e.g., license applications, exportlicenses and end- user statements);   (ii) Shipping documents (e.g., shipper's export declarations,airway bills and bills of lading);   (iii) Any other relevant documents must be retained by the personmaking the disclosure until the Office of Defense Trade Controlsrequests them or until a final decision on the disclosed informationhas been made.

Certifications made by a firm, corporation orany other organization should be executed by someone with theauthority to do so.   (f) Oral presentations. It is generally not necessary to augmentthe written presentation with an oral presentation. However, if theperson making the disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, arequest for one should be included with the written presentation.   (g) Voluntary disclosures should be sent to:   Compliance Analysis Division, PM/DTC, SA-6, room 200, Office ofDefense Trade Controls, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs,U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602.

(b) Supplementary reports must be sent to the Office of DefenseTrade Controls within 30 days after the payment, offer or agreementreported therein or, when requested by the Office of Defense TradeControls, within 30 days after such request, and must include:   (1) Any information specified in § 130.10 required orrequested to be reported and which was not previously reported; and   (2) The Defense Trade Control license number, if any, and theDepartment or Defense contract number, if any, related to the sale.  § 130.12 -- Information to be furnished by vendor to applicantor supplier.   (a) In order to determine whether it is obliged under § 130.9to furnish the information specified in § 130.10 with respect toa sale, every applicant or supplier must obtain from each vendor, fromor through whom the applicant acquired defense articles or defenseservices forming the whole or a part of the sale, a full disclosure bythe vendor of all political contributions or fees or commission paid,by vendor with respect to such sale. Such disclosure must includeresponses to all the information pertaining to vendor required toenable applicant or supplier, as the case may be, to comply fully with§§ 130.9 and 130.10. If so required, they must include theinformation furnished by each vendor in providing the informationspecified.   (b) Any vendor which has been requested by an applicant or supplierto furnish an initial statement under paragraph (a) of this sectionmust, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, furnishsuch statement in a timely manner and not later than 20 days afterreceipt of such request.   (c) If the vendor believes that furnishing information to anapplicant or supplier in a requested statement would unreasonably riskinjury to the vendor's commercial interests, the vendor may furnish inlieu of the statement an abbreviated statement disclosing only theaggregate amount of all political contributions and the aggregateamount of all fees or commissions which have been paid, or offered oragreed to be paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by the vendor withrespect to the sale. Any abbreviated statement furnished to anapplicant or supplier under this paragraph must be accompanied by acertification that the requested information has been reported by thevendor directly to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The vendormust simultaneously report fully to the Office of Defense TradeControls all information which the vendor would otherwise have beenrequired to report to the applicant or supplier under thissection. Each such report must clearly identify the sale with respectto which the reported information pertains.   (d)(1) If upon the 25th day after the date of its request tovendor, an applicant or supplier has not received from the vendor theinitial statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, theapplicant or supplier must submit to the Office of Defense TradeControls a signed statement attesting to:   (i) The manner and extent of applicant's or supplier's attempt toobtain from the vendor the initial statement required under paragraph(a) of this section;   (ii) Vendor's failure to comply with this section; and   (iii) The amount of time which has elapsed between the date ofapplicant's or supplier's request and the date of the signedstatement;   (2) The failure of a vendor to comply with this section does notrelieve any applicant or supplier otherwise required by § 130.9to submit a report to the Office of Defense Trade Controls fromsubmitting such a report.  § 130.13 -- Information to be furnished to applicant, supplieror vendor by a recipient of a fee or commission.

The Administration has released, and is seeking informalcomments on, a draft of the new Commerce Department regulations onencryption exports. The new regulations create a new category of controls --"EI" (which stands for "encryption items"). The regulationsdivide these encryption items into 5 categories and createdifferent licensing schemes for each. Certain mass-market encryption software may be released, aftera one-time review, from normal EI controls and made eligible formass market treatment (which includes eligibility for all theprovisions of the Export Administration Regulations applicable toother software). "Recovery" encryption software and equipment will beeligible for a license to export and reexport in unlimitedquantities to all non-embargoed destinations. Applications forkey recovery and key escrow products must identify a satisfactorykey recovery agent with established security policies adequate to safeguardkeys or other escrowed material. 56-bit DES or equivalent non-recovery encryption items will beeligible for 6-month export and reexport licenses after an initialreview of the item and the submission of a satisfactory keyrecovery plan demonstrating a commitment to develop key recoveryproducts and services. Licenses can be renewed for additional sixmonth periods depending upon the applicant's adherence tobenchmarks set out in the original plan. All licenses issuedunder this category will expire after December 31, 1998. All other encryption items may be eligible for"encryption licensing arrangements." These arrangements arelike the distribution arrangements currently available forencryption items at the State Department. Such arrangements mayallow exports and reexports of encryption software and equipmentin unlimited quantities to all non-embargoed destinations, butapplications must specify the sales territory and classes ofend-uers. Such arrangements may also impose certain reportingrequirements. Encryption items not approved for an encryptionlicensing arrangement may still be granted individual licenses ona case-by-case basis. Encryption "technology" (e.g. technical data) may belicensed for export and reexport on a case-by-case basis. As expected, the usual Commerce Department rules on foreignavailability and de minimis content will not apply to encryption items.Similarly, controlled software will not be eligible for"publicly available" treatment, even if the source codeor object code is published in a book or other media. Other notable provisions of the new regulations include a"grandfather" provision for existing State Departmentlicenses and arrangements; detailed rules concerning Internetdistribution of encryption software; and a broad definition of"recoverable" encryption which includes items thatallow access to unencrypted data without necessarily requiringaccess to the keys.

AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the ExportAdministration Regulations (EAR) by exercising jurisdiction over,and imposing new combined national security and foreign policycontrols on certain encryption items that were on the United StatesMunitions List, consistent with Executive Order 13026 and aPresidential Memorandum, both issued by President Clinton onNovember 15, 1996. On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan tomake it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption productsto protect their privacy, intellectual property and othervaluable information. The plan envisions a worldwide key managementinfrastructure with the use of key recovery and key escrowencryption items to promote electronic commerce and secure communicationswhile protecting national security and public safety. To providefor a transition period for the development of this keymanagement infrastructure, this rule permits the export andreexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent encryption itemsupon issuance by BXA of an initial license valid for six months,if an exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and marketrecoverable encryption items and to help build the supportinginternational infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardwareand software. EFFECTIVE DATE: (THIS RULE IS EFFECTIVE: DATE OFPUBLICATION). ADDRESSES: Written comments (six copies) should be sentto: Nancy Crowe, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of ExportAdministration, Department of Commerce, 14th Street andPennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room 2705, Washington, D.C. 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James A. Lewis, Officeof Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls, Telephone: (202)482-0092. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 15, 1996, the President issued a Memorandumdirecting that all encryption items controlled on the U.S. MunitionsList, except those specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted,or modified for military applications, be transferred to theCommerce Control List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026(15 November 1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additionalprovisions with respect to controls on such encryption items tobe imposed by the Department of Commerce. The Executive Orderalso provides for appropriate controls on the export and foreign disseminationof encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List thatare placed on the Commerce Control List. In issuing theMemorandum the President stated: Encryption products, when used outside the United States, canjeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover,such products, when used by international criminal organizations, canthreaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well asthe safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation ofencryption products must be controlled to further U.S. foreignpolicy objectives, and promote our national security, includingthe protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad. This initiative will make it easier for Americans to usestronger encryption items to protect their privacy, intellectualproperty and other valuable information. It will support thegrowth of electronic commerce, increase the security of theglobal information infrastructure, and sustain the economic competitivenessof U.S. encryption product manufacturers during the transition toa key management infrastructure. Under this initiative,non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalentstrength will be permitted for export and reexport after aone-time review of the item and if the exporter makes satisfactorycommitments to build and market recoverable encryption items andto support an international key management infrastructure. Thispolicy will apply to hardware and software. The relaxation of export and reexport controls onnon-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalentstrength will last until January 1, 1999. The temporaryrelaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption policyinitiative designed to promote electronic information security and publicsafety. The initiative carries out important foreign policy andnational security concerns identified by the President. Exportcontrols on cryptographic items are essential to controlling thespread aborad of powerful encryption products which could beharmful to critical U.S. national security, foreign policy and lawenforcement interests. This initiative will preserve suchcontrols and foster the development of a key managementinfrastructure necessary to protect important national security,foreign policy and law enforcement concerns. This interim rule implements the Administration's policy onencryption exports. This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations(EAR) by imposing national security and foreign policy controls ("EI" forEncryption Items) on certain information security systems andequipment, cryptographic devices, software and componentsspecifically designed or modified therefor, including recoverable encryption software,and related technology ("encryption items")."Encryption items" do not include encryption items specificallydesigned, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications(including command, control and intelligence applications). Suchitems remain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to becontrolled by the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls.EI controls apply to encryption software, including recoverableencryption "software" transferred from the U.S. MunitionsList to the Commerce Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November15, 1996 (61 FR 58767). This interim rule also amends the Export AdministrationRegulations to require a license for exports and reexports to all destinations,except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EIreasons. The licensing policy is as follows: (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Certain encryption software that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) may be released from "EI" controls and thereby made eligible for mass market treatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR and 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information. Note that the one-time review is for a determination to release encryption software in object code only. Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. (2) Recovery encryption software and commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including encryption equipment designed or modified to use recoverable encryption software, may be released from "EI" controls and thereby made eligible for license exception RSE after a one-time BXA review. License exception RSE is valid for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. Requests for key escrow and key recovery encryption items will receive favorable consideration provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to new Supplement No. 4 to part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or other escrowed material/information as described in new Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA and are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR and any license conditions. If the exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to part 742. In addition, the key recovery or key escrow system must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on continued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement 5. (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting recoverable items and services. License applications from manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will be approved for export and reexport by the Department of Commerce upon the issuance of an export license valid for six months after an initial BXA review of the item and the submission of a satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the steps the applicant will take during the two-year transition period beginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, or market encryption items and services with recoverable features. Any subsequent renewal is not automatic, and will depend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan submitted for the initial license application. This relaxation of controls will last until January 1, 1999. The plan that is submitted with applications for the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements in new Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that BXA will accept requests for export and reexport of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, and other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. BXA will authorize exports and reexports of such items only in instances where a license has been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The authority to so export or reexport will be for a time period ending on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends. (4) All other encryption items. (i) Encryption licensing arrangement. This arrangement is intended to continue without change the regulatory treatment of the distribution and warehouse arrangements currently permitted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Applicants may submit license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address. (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-case basis. (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Note that all "EI" encryption items are not subjectto any mandatory decontrol or licensing requirements based onforeign availability provisions of the EAA or the EAR In section1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states: I have determined that the export of encryption products described in this section may harm national security and foreign policy interests even where comparable products are or appear to be available from sources outside the United states, and that facts and questions concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products cannot be subject to public disclosure or judicial review without revealing or implicating classified information that could harm United States national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly, section 4(c) and 6(h)(2) - (4) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA") ..., all other analogous provisions the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export controls on such encryption products. This interim rule amends part 768 of the EAR, ForeignAvailability, to make clear that the provisions of that part donot apply to encryption items transferred to the Commerce ControlList. This interim rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to excludeencryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the CommerceControl List pursuant to E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996)from the de minimis provisions for items exported fromabroad. This rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to reflect thatcertain encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN5D002 that has been transferred to the Department of Commercefrom the Department of State by E.O. 13026 will be subject to theEAR even when publicly available. Such encryption software inboth source code and object code remains subject to the EAR andis not eligible for publicly available treatment even if publishedin a book or any other writing or media. This rule also amendspart 740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR to reflectthat encryption software will not be eligible for "massmarket" treatment under the General Software Note or forexport as beta-test software under License Exception BETA unlessreleased from EI controls through a one-time BXA review (refer to newSupplement No. 6 to part 742). Note that License Exception TMP isavailable for temporary exports and reexports of encryption itemsexcept under the provisions for beta-test software. Software andtechnology that was controlled by the Department of Commerce priorto [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE] are not affected by this rule and willcontinue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment.Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to [INSERT EFFECTIVEDATE] will continue to be eligible for mass market treatmentunder the General Software Note, and License Exception TSU formass-market software. For purposes of this rule, "recovery encryptionproducts" refer to encryption products (including software)which allow law enforcement officials to obtain under properlegal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of theuser, the plaintext of encrypted data and communications. Such recoverableproducts fulfill the objectives of the Administration's encryptionpolicy. Other approaches to access and recovery may be defined inthe future. This interim rule also amends part 742 of the EAR to reflectthe new combined national security and foreign policy controls imposedby this rule, and adds a new Supplement No. 4 to part 742 titled"Key Recovery or Key Escrow Products Criteria" thatincludes product criteria, a new Supplement No. 5 to part 742titled "Key Recovery or Key Escrow Agent Criteria" that includesinterim requirements for key recovery agents, a new SupplementNo. 6 to part 742 titled "Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Requestfor a Mass Market Software Product that contains Encryption"that includes the criteria for the one-time review ofclassification requests for release of certain encryptionsoftware from EI controls, and a new Supplement No. 7 to part 742titled "Review Criteria for Exporter Key Recovery or Key EscrowDevelopment Plans." This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 of theEAR for classification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR toreflect the Department of Justice role in the review ofencryption license applications, amends the record keeping provisionsof part 762 of the EAR, adds new definitions to part 772 of theEAR, and amends the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 topart 774) by adding new EI controls under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and5E002 for commodities, software and technology that are placedunder Commerce Department jurisdiction by E.O. 13026. In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements onquantities shipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters,in order to allow the United States to fulfill the reportingrequirements of the Wassenaar Arrangement. The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals oftechnology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separateFederal Register Notice. This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because thetransfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions Listto the CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, theprovisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, andcontract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition ofcontrols. U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvalsissued by the Department of State prior to (INSERT DATE OFPUBLICATION) may ship remaining balances authorized by such licensesor approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing ShippersExport Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs,citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department licensenumber. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms andconditions, including the expiration date, existing at the timeof issuance of the State license. Any reports required for distributionand other types of agreements previously authorized by theDepartment of State, valid at the time of this publication, shouldbe henceforth submitted to the Department of Commerce. Export violations,including the terms and conditions of export, shall hereafter constitutea violation of the EAR. Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the ExportAdministration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congresson (DATE OF REPORT), notifying the Congress of theDepartment's intention to impose controls on certain informationsecurity systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, softwareand components specifically designed or modified therefor, andrelated technology that will be controlled on the CCL and thatwill be subject to new control procedures. Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August20, 1994, the President invoked the International EmergencyEconomic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extentpermitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR inExecutive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, notice of August 15,1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August 14, 1996 (60 FR 42527). Rulemaking Requirements 1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of E. O. 12866. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, unless that collection of information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0694-0088. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military and foreign affairs function of the United States (Sec. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this interim final rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or by any other law, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) are not applicable. However, because of the importance of the issues raised bythese regulations, this rule is issued in interim form andcomments will be considered in the development of finalregulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interestedpersons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views. The period for submission of comments will close (INSERTDATE 45 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION). The Department willconsider all comments received before the close of the commentperiod in developing final regulations. Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, buttheir consideration cannot be assured. The Department will notaccept public comments accompanied by a request that a part orall of the material be treated confidentially because of itsbusiness proprietary nature or for any other reason. TheDepartment will return such comments and materials to the personsubmitting the comments and will not consider them in the developmentof final regulations. All public comments on these regulationswill be a matter of public record and will be available forpublic inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness,the Department requires comments in written form. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, whichwill also be a matter of public record and will be available for publicreview and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Governmentor foreign governments will not be made available for publicinspection. The public record concerning these regulations will bemaintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of InformationRecords Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce,14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.20230. Records in this facility, including written publiccomments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulationspublished in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code of FederalRegulations. Information about the inspection and copying ofrecords at the facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo,Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer,at the above address or by calling (202) 482-5653.

Note that the educationalinformation provisions of this section do not apply to encryptionsoftware in both source code and object code controlled underECCN 5D002 for "EI" reasons on the Commerce ControlList (refer to Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). 19. Supplement No.1 to Part 734 is amended by revising the introductory paragraph to read as follows: SUPPLEMENT NO. 1 TO PART 734 - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -TECHNOLOGY AND SOFTWARE SUBJECT TO THE EAR This Supplement No. 1 contains explanatory questions andanswers relating to technology and software that is subject tothe EAR. It is intended to give the public guidance inunderstanding how BXA interprets this part, but is onlyillustrative, not comprehensive. In addition, facts orcircumstances that differ in any material way from those setforth in the questions or answers will be considered under the applicableprovisions of the EAR. Exporters should note that the provisionsof this supplement do not apply to encryption items transferredfrom the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant toE.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767). See 742.15 of theEAR. This Supplement is divided into nine sections according totopic as follows: * * * * * PART 740 - LICENSE EXCEPTIONS 20. Part 740 is amended by redesignating 740.8 through 740.15 as 740.9 through 740.16 and by adding a new 740.8 to read as follows: 740.8 Recoverable software and equipment (RSE). (a) Scope. License Exception RSE authorizes the exportand reexport of certain recovery encryption software and equipment. (b) Eligible software and equipment. Eligible items arerecovery encryption software and equipment controlled under ECCNs 5A002or 5D002 and released from "EI" controls as a result ofa one-time BXA review. You may initiate this review by submittinga classification request for your product in accordance withparagraph (d) of this section. (c) Eligible destinations. License Exception RSE isavailable for all destinations except Country Groups E:1 and E:2(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), Iran, Syria, and Sudan. (d) Additional eligibility requirements. Classificationrequests for recovery encryption software and equipment must meetthe following criteria: (i) Key recovery and key escrow products must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 of the EAR; (ii) Key recovery agents must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742 of the EAR; (iii) Key recovery agents must implement the security policies and key recovery/key escrow procedures identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742 of the EAR; (iv) Key recovery agents must comply with all applicable EAR Record keeping requirements, including record retention requirements; and (v) Key recovery agents must carry out the key holding obligations as approved by BXA, and any violation of any of the key holding obligations shall also constitute a violation of the EAR. Note that the key recovery agent's continuing compliance with key recovery agent requirements and key safeguard procedures is a condition for use of License Exception RSE. The exporter or reexporter, whether that person is the key recovery agent or not, must submit a new classification request to BXA if there are any changes (e.g., termination, replacement, additions) to the previously approved key recovery agent. * * * * * 21.

(Refer to Section 748.3(b) of the EAR for information on item classifications regarding a one-time BXA review for release from EI controls.) PART 742 - [AMENDED] 24. Part 742 is amended by adding a new 742.15 to read as follows: 742.15 Encryption items. (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for all destinations, except Canada, for ECCNs having an "EI" under the "Control(s)" paragraph. Such items include: encryption commodities controlled under ECCN 5A002; encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002; and encryption technology controlled under ECCN 5E002. (Refer to part 772 of the EAR for the definition of "encryption"). For encryption items previously on the U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexport under a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any other authority of the State Department, U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals issued by the Department of State prior [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE] may ship remaining balances authorized by such licenses or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs, citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department license number. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions, including the expiration date, existing at the time of issuance of the State license. Violations of such authorizations, terms and conditions constitute violations of the EAR. Any reports required for distribution and other types of agreements previously authorized by the Department of State, valid at the time of this publication, should be henceforth submitted to BXA at the following address: Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls Bureau of Export Administration Department of Commerce 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Room 2705 Washington, D.C. 20230 (b) Licensing policy. The following licensing policies apply to items identified in paragraph (a) of this section. Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Certain encryption software that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) may be released from "EI" controls and thereby made eligible for mass market treatment after a one-time review. To determine eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR and 748.3(b)(2) of the EAR for additional information. Note that the one-time review is for a determination to release encryption software in object code only unless otherwise specifically requested. Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recovery encryption software and commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including encryption equipment designed or modified to use recoverable encryption software, may be released from "EI" controls and thereby made eligible for license exception RSE after a one-time BXA review. License exception RSE is valid for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. Requests for recoverable products which allow law enforcement officials to obtain, under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of the encrypted data and communications will receive favorable consideration. Key escrow and key recovery encryption items which will receive favorable consideration provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to new Supplement No. 4 to part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or other escrowed material/information as described in new Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA and are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR and any license conditions. If the exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to part 742. In addition, the key recovery or key escrow system must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on continued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement 4. (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting recoverable items and services for export. (i) License applications from manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will be approved for export and reexport by the Department of Commerce upon the issuance of an export license valid for six months after an initial review of the item and the submission of a satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the steps the applicant will take during the two-year transition period beginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and market encryption items and services with recoverable features. (For integrators and distributors, refer to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this part). Any subsequent renewal is not automatic, and will depend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan submitted for the initial license. This relaxation of controls will last until January 1, 1999. The plan that is submitted with the application for non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements in Supplement No. 7 to part 742. (ii) BXA will make a determination on such license applications within 15 days of receipt. Export and reexports of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength, under a license approved under the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3), will be authorized for six months from date of issuance of the license, and such authority may be renewed in six month increments extending through December 31, 1998 after BXA reviews and approves a satisfactory progress report related to the ongoing plan submitted by the applicant. For such extensions, the applicant must submit a letter to BXA requesting approval of the progress report and an extension of the validity period of the license not to exceed six months. Licenses approved under this paragraph will not be valid after December 31, 1998. Note that BXA will accept requests for export and reexport of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, and other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. BXA will authorize exports and reexports of such items only in instances where a license has been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The authority to export or reexport under the provisions of this paragraph will be for a time period ending on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends. (4) All other encryption items. (i) Encryption licensing arrangement. Applicants may submit license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address. (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-case basis. (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a case-by-case basis. (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.

SUPPLEMENT NO. 5 TO PART 742 - KEY RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROWAGENT CRITERIA KEY RECOVERY AGENT REQUIREMENTS; SECURITY POLICIES; KEYRECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW PROCEDURES This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department ofCommerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approvalof the export or reexport of key recovery encryption itemscontrolled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Anyarrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the keyrecovery agent must reflect the provisions contained in thisSupplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA and other agencies.This Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recoveryagent personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for alicense to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide,or cause the proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXAsufficient information concerning any proposed key recovery agentarrangements to permit BXA's evaluation, in conjunction withother agencies, of the key recovery agent's security policies,key recovery procedures, and suitability and trustworthiness tomaintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or other escrowed material/information.The key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicantfor the export or reexport license or another party legallyobligated to the applicant to provide escrow services. BXAretains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revokeexport or reexport licenses if BXA, in conjunction with otheragencies, determines that a key recovery agent no longer meetsthese criteria. The requirements related to the suitability andtrustworthiness, security policies, and key recovery proceduresof the key recovery agent shall be made terms and conditions ofthe export or reexport license for key recovery items. BXA shallrequire the key recovery agent to provide a representation thatit will comply with such terms and conditions. Key Recovery Agent Requirements (1) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date and placeof birth, and social security number, individual(s) who: a. are directly involved in the escrowing of key(s) or other escrowed material/information, or b. have access to key(s) or other escrowed material/information, or c. have access to information concerning requests for key(s) or other escrowed material/information, or d. respond to requests for key(s) or other escrowed material/information, or e. are in control of the key recovery agent and have access or authority to obtain key(s) or other escrowed material/information, and must certify that such individual(s) meet the requirementsof subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph. BXA, in conjunctionwith other agencies, reserves the right to determine at any timethe suitability and trustworthiness of such individual(s).Evidence of an individual's suitability and trustworthiness shallinclude: (i) Information indicating that the individual(s): (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or pending criminal charges of any kind; (B) Has not breached fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., has not violated any surety or performance bonds); and (C) Has favorable results of a credit check; or, (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active U.S.government security clearance of Secret or higher issued or updated withinthe last five years.

Before thatindividual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key recoveryagent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets thecriteria set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of thisSupplement. BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, reserves theright to determine at any time the suitability andtrustworthiness of such personnel. (4) If ownership or control of a key recovery agent istransferred, no export may take place under previously issued approvalsuntil the successor key recovery agent complies with the criteriaof this Supplement. (5) Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. ispermitted if acceptable to BXA, in consultation with the host government,as appropriate. (6) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of thekey recovery agent's corporate viability and financial responsibility(e.g., a certificate of good standing from the state ofincorporation, credit reports, and errors/omissions insurance). (7) Key recovery agents shall disclose to BXA any of thefollowing which have occurred within the ten years prior to the application: (i) federal or state felony convictions of the business; (ii) material adverse civil fraud judgments or settlements; and (iii) debarments from federal, state, or local government contracting. The applicant shall also timely disclose to BXA any of theforegoing occurring during the life of the license. (8) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) tobe the security and operations officer(s). (9) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user'sorganization and may consist of one or more individuals.

These safeguardsshould ensure: i) the key recovery agent's structural independence fromthe rest of the organization; (ii) security; and (iii)confidentiality. Security Policies (1) Key recovery agents must implement security policies that assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the key(s) or other escrowed material/information required for decryption. (i) Procedures to assure confidentiality shall include: (A) Encrypting all key(s) or other escrowed material/information while in storage, transmission, or transfer; or (B) Applying reasonable measures to limit access to the escrow database (e.g. using keyed or combination locks on the entrances toescrow facilities and limiting the personnel with knowledge of or accessto the keys/combinations). (ii) Procedures to assure the integrity of the escrow database (i.e. assuring the key(s) and other escrowed material/information are protected against unauthorized changes) shall include the use of access controls such as database password controls, digital signatures, system auditing, and physical access restrictions. (iii) Procedures to assure the availability of the escrowdatabase (i.e. assuring that key(s) and other escrowed material/informationare retrievable at any time) shall include system redundance,physical security, and the use of cryptography to control access. (2) Policies and procedures shall be designed and operated sothat a failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism doesnot compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability ofkey(s)or other escrowed material/information. Security policiesand procedures may include, but are not limited to, multi-personcontrol of access to recoverable keys, split keys, and back-upcapabilities. (3) Key recovery agents shall implement policies that protectagainst unauthorized disclosure of information regarding whose encryptionmaterial is stored, the fact that key(s) or other escrowed material/informationwas requested or provided, and the identity of a requester.Procedures to assure the confidentiality of this informationshall include those described in subparagraph (b)(1)(i). (4) Key recovery agents shall provide to BXA prompt notice ofa compromise of a security policy or of the confidentiality of key(s)or other escrowed material/information. Key Recovery Procedures (1) Key recovery agents shall maintain the ability to make thekey(s) or other escrowed material/information available until notifiedotherwise by BXA. Key recovery agents shall make requested key(s)or other escrowed material/information available, to the extentrequired by the request, within two hours from the time theyreceive a request from a government agency acting under appropriatelegal authority. (2) Key recovery agents shall maintain data regarding keyrecovery requests received, release of key(s) or other escrowed keyrecovery material/information, database changes, systemadministration access, and dates of such events for purposes of auditsby BXA, in conjunction with other agencies. (3) In the event that: (i) the key recovery agent dissolves or otherwise terminates escrowing operations, or (ii) BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, determines that there is a risk of such dissolution or termination, or (iii) BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, determines that the key recovery agent is no longer suitable or trustworthy, the key recovery agent must transfer all key recoveryequipment, key(s) and/or other material/information, key recovery database,and all administrative information necessary to its key recoveryoperations to another key recovery agent approved by BXA, inconjunction with other agencies.

Christensen, Director,Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration, (202) 482-2440.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Background    On September 30, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce submitted to theCongress a report of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC),entitled Toward a National Export Strategy. The report included thefollowing among its goals:    Undertake a comprehensive review of the Export AdministrationRegulations to simplify, clarify, and make the regulations moreuser-friendly.    In November 1993, BXA organized a Task Group, drawn from several ofits offices, to carry out the TPCC recommendation. The Task Grouplaunched its review project by publishing an advance notice of proposedrulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register on February 10, 1994 (59 FR6528). This notice was designed to solicit comments from industry andthe interested public. The ANPRM asked for suggestions concerningimprovements BXA could make to the EAR and described several specificissues on which BXA was particularly interested in receiving publicinput.    Over seven months during the development of a proposed rule withrequest for comments that was published in the Federal Register on May11, 1995, titled ``Export Administration Regulations; Simplification ofExport Administration Regulations'' (60 FR 25268) (hereafter referredto as proposed rule), BXA shared four discussion packages with andsought comments from the Regulations & Procedures Technical AdvisoryCommittee (RPTAC), an advisory committee consisting of industryrepresentatives intimately familiar with the private sector's role inusing the EAR. The packages were also made available to otherinterested members of the public, with the last two being madeavailable electronically on FedWorld. The four discussion packages weredated August 2, 1994, September 29, 1994, January 12, 1995, andFebruary 28, 1995.    The May 11 proposed rule reflected several new features based uponthe comments received from the public pursuant to the ANPRM, and theRPTAC, and BXA's own assessment of how the EAR could be improved. Suchfeatures include:     No license or other authorization would be required forany transaction under BXA jurisdiction unless the regulationsaffirmatively state the requirement. (Existing regulations state thatall exports are prohibited unless an applicable general license hasbeen established or a validated license or other authorization has beengranted by BXA.)     The terms ``general'' license and ``validated'' licensewould be dropped. The term ``license'' would be used to refer only toauthorization issued by BXA upon application. The proposed regulationswould convert the many existing general licenses into a smaller numberof ``exceptions'' to require the obligation to seek a license when theCommerce Control list indicates that the particular item going to thestated country generally requires a license.     The parts of the EAR would be arranged to give the readera logical path to follow.     The affirmative statements of the need to obtain alicense, scattered throughout various parts of the existing EAR, wouldbe consolidated into ten general prohibitions and described in aseparate part. One part would contain the license review policy for alllist-based license requirements; another part would provide for therequirements and review policies of licenses based on the end-use orend-user involved in a proposed export or reexport; and the list-basedlicense requirements would be contained in the Commerce Control List(CCL) indicating the reason for control and the Country Chartindicating the country scope of each reason for control.     The Country Groups used in the existing regulations wouldbe revised in favor of Groups which better reflect post-Cold Warcircumstances.    The CCL would be redesigned to state the reasons forcontrol more specifically within each Export Control ClassificationNumber (ECCN). The redesigned CCL would be used in tandem with a newCountry Chart that would indicate whether a license is required for anyECCN to any country in the world and the reason or reasons for control. Over 80 commenters responded to the proposed rule. Many commentersrecommended that BXA take sufficient time to draft an interim rule toensure ample opportunity to review and discuss with industry theircomments on the May 11 proposed rule, and incorporate them into aninterim rule. BXA has taken the time necessary to thoroughly review,analyze, and discuss industry comments on the proposed rule. Inaddition, BXA conducted 18 town-hall style fora (hereafter referred toas town-hall fora) that reached over 1,000 industry representatives,and met with the RPTAC and other interested[[Page 12715]]public to discuss their comments and concerns in more detail. Following is a detailed part-by-part description of this interimrule, and a review of comments received pursuant to the May 11 proposedrule:Implementation This interim rule will become effective April 24, 1996; however,final compliance with this interim rule is not compelled until November1, 1996. During the period between the effective date and the finalcompliance date of this interim rule, you must comply with theprovisions of either the existing Export Administration Regulations(EAR) (redesignated 15 CFR 768A through 799A by this interim rule)including any amendments thereto that are published in the FederalRegister or the provisions of this interim rule including anyamendments thereto that are published in the Federal Register. Notwithstanding the general effective date of this interim rule,the repeal of the importer statement requirement for General LicenseGCT is effective immediately, and the Special Comprehensive Licenseprovisions in part 752 are effective immediately. For up to March 25,1997, holders of issued and outstanding special licenses may continueto use those special licenses according to their terms and conditionsand according to the special license provisions of the existing EAR. The majority of the commenters requested a 90 day delayed effectivedate plus an additional six to twelve months during which one mustcomply with either the existing Export Administration Regulations orthis interim rule. The cost of changes to internal information systemsand the time to train personnel on the new system were the main reasonscited for requesting a delayed effective date and a transition period.Several large companies said that their computer systems will requiresubstantial reprogramming for the new License Exception group symbols,the new Destination Control Statement (DCS), and the renumbering ofentries on the Commerce Control List in part 774 to conform to theEuropean Union numbering system. Some firms indicated that implementation costs would be reduced ifthey were allowed a span of time in which to implement the changes madeby this interim rule. Costs would be higher if a single implementationdate were required because their information systems departments wouldnot have flexibility regarding scheduling and might be required to hireadditional temporary employees or pay overtime. Many large firms cannotimplement the computer changes on one given day. After receiving theabove comments in writing and during the town-hall fora, BXA madeadditional contacts with several firms. All acknowledge that they canefficiently implement the changes required by this interim rule withinsix months. Since those discussions, BXA has determined to modify theDestination Control Statement (DCS) as noted below to closely followingthe existing DCS widely used by many firms. BXA is hopeful that thisdecision will further reduce the costs of implementation of thisinterim rule. BXA is sensitive to the costs of implementation, and that is thereason this interim rule provides for a rather long implementationperiod. Through this mechanism, BXA hopes to reduce the marginal costsof implementation by reducing necessary overtime, contracting, andtraining beyond that regularly scheduled. BXA will also assist thebusiness community in training for this interim rule. BXA has alreadyannounced a substantial program to conduct training sessions around theUnited States to make it convenient for firms to train their personnel. The new Multipurpose Application Form, BXA-748P, will replace theApplication for Export License (BXA-622P) and the Request for ReexportAuthorization (BXA-699P). It will also serve as an application for theSpecial Comprehensive License. Additionally, the BXA-748P willaccommodate Commerce Classification Requests, thus allowing itemclassifications to be handled electronically. BXA will not accept the new forms listed in this paragraph forapplications and requests received before June 15. BXA will not acceptexisting forms listed in this paragraph for applications and requestsreceived on or after June 15. The existing Form BXA-622P Applicationfor Export License, existing Form BXA-685P, Request for AmendmentAction, and existing Form BXA-699P, Request for Reexport Authorizationwill all be replaced by new Form BXA 748P, Multipurpose Application.The existing Form BXA-622P-A, Commodity Description Supplement will bereplaced by new Form BXA-748P-A, Item Appendix. Existing Form 622P-B,End-user Supplement will be replaced by new Form 748P-B, End-userAppendix. Form BXA-6052P, Statement by Foreign Consignee in Support ofSpecial License Application will be replaced by Form BXA-752P,Statement by Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License. Existing Form BXA-629P, Statement by Ultimate Consignee andPurchaser will be replaced by new Form BXA-711, Statement by UltimateConsignee and Purchaser. However, Form BXA-629P may be used untilNovember 1, 1996. Use of Existing Form BXA 686-P, Statement by Foreign Importer ofAircraft or Vessel Repair Parts and Form BXA 6026-P, Service Supply(SL) Statement by U.S. Exporter will be discontinued on March 25, 1996,because the Aircraft and Vessel Repair Station Procedure at Sec. 773A.8and the Service Supply (SL) Procedure at Sec. 773A.7 of the existingEAR will be replaced by the Special Comprehensive License in part 752of this interim rule. BXA will stop issuing BXA Form-648P, Notification of DeliveryVerification Requirement on June 15, 1996. For licenses issued on orafter that date, the delivery verification requirement will be printedon the license itself.The Knowledge Standard One step is being taken in this interim rule that changes languagein many parts of the EAR, but without changing the intended meaning.Several commenters noted that the proposed rule continued use in theEAR of differing expressions as to knowledge, such as ``know'' or``know or have reason to know''. Three commenters called for theremoval of the term ``reason to know'' and one commenter requested auniform adoption of ``know or have reason to know''. BXA has decided toadopt the term ``knowledge'' (together with variants, such as ``know''or ``knowing'') as the standard usage and defines this term in the EAR.This definition is added to part 772--Definitions. Variants, such as``reason to believe'' are being retained in the EAR where they are usedto follow statutory wording. This definition confirms the intention ofBXA that ``know'' and terms such as ``know or have reason to know'' begiven the same meaning and that this meaning include more than positiveknowledge. This definition is not being applied to part 760--Restrictive Practices and Boycotts, leaving the interpretation of suchterms in this distinct part of the EAR to be independent of exportcontrol usage.Part-by-Part AnalysisPart 730--General Information Part 730 provides a general introduction to the EAR. It is intendedfor the first-time reader and is not regulatory. Seven of the public comments referred to part 730. There was broad[[Page 12716]]support for the listing of other control agencies, together withtelephone and fax numbers for obtaining information. Four commentersnoted that similar information was provided in a supplement to thescope part of the proposed rule, with duplication and someinconsistency. BXA has eliminated that supplement and includes theagency information in this part 730. Three commenters requested thatthe listing be broadened, and noted the absence of reference to certaincontrols of other agencies listed in the existing EAR. This listing hasbeen updated and extended. BXA is not, however, acting on requests toadd more detailed information on controls administered by otheragencies, nor on areas of possible overlap, as this would undulycomplicate this brief introduction to the EAR. Three commenters called for combining part 730 with the Steps partin some way. BXA concluded that a merger of the two parts is notadvisable, as the amount of detail needed in steps would obscure themore general introductory information offered in part 730. Manycomments on the two parts called for flow charts and wiring diagrams.BXA has recently received authorization from the Office of the FederalRegister to include such additional aids, and BXA will develop thosematerials for inclusion in the EAR at a later date. Two commenters questioned the basic, non-regulatory, approach takenin part 730, citing such elements as the Sec. 730.6 reference to thebenefits from multilateral controls and the Sec. 730.8 explanation ofwhy the EAR are lengthy and detailed. BXA continues to believe thatthis kind of introduction to the EAR will be helpful to persons new tothe field.Part 732--Steps By cross-references to the relevant provisions, part 732 describesthe suggested steps for you to determine applicability of (1) the scopeof the EAR described in part 734, (2) each of the general prohibitionsin part 736, (3) the License Exceptions in part 740, and (4) otherrequirements such as clearing the U.S. Customs Service, keepingrecords, and completing license applications. This part 732 describesthe organization of the EAR, informs you of the relationship among theparts and provisions, and describes the appropriate order in which toconsider the various provisions of the EAR by cross-referencing thoseprovisions. Supplement No. 1 to this part 732, contains the ``Know YourCustomer'' Guidance, which has been moved from part 744--ControlPolicy--End-user and End-use Based Control. In this interim rule, BXAhas also added examples of Red Flags referred to in the ``Know YourCustomer'' Guidance. Over thirty commenters referred to the part on steps in theproposed rule, and all but one supported the inclusion of steps toguide the reader. Of these commenters, more than half stated that thesteps part should be relocated so that it could serve as a type ofroad-map in the use of the entire EAR. The proposed rule provided forsteps at part 736 after the parts on scope and general prohibitions.BXA agrees that the steps part is more useful if relocated closer tothe beginning of the EAR. Therefore, in this interim rule, the stepspart is renumbered as part 732; and it precedes the part on scope thatis renumbered as part 734 and the part on prohibitions that isrenumbered as part 736. About one quarter of the commenters on this part urged some type ofrestructuring or reordering of the steps within the part; however, thecomments were varied. Based upon these written comments and asubstantial number of oral comments made during the town-hall fora, BXAbelieves that it is useful to organize the steps in categoriesregarding the scope of the EAR, the ten general prohibitions, theLicense Exceptions, and additional requirements such as keepingrecords, documentation for clearing the U.S. Customs Service, andcompleting license applications. In addition, one commenter urged thatthe steps regarding prohibitions at part 736 make clear the distinctionbetween the first three prohibitions that are shaped by productparameters on the Commerce Control List versus the last sevenprohibitions that address certain types of activities without regard tothe product parameters on the Commerce Control List. Another commonsuggestion was to give greater prominence and clarity to thedetermination of the proper ECCN for items, a process referred to asclassification. This interim rule adopts those recommendations. One commenter suggested that the steps part in the proposed ruleincluded too many cross-references to the other parts and required thereader to flip too many pages. Several other commenters recommendedadditional cross-references in the EAR. BXA believes that the part onsteps should continue to contain cross-references for fundamentalreasons. The part on steps is not a substitute for the language ofother parts of the EAR and the part on steps would be much too long ifit contained a complete explanation or repetition of every otherprovision of the EAR. Rather, it is a type of road-map, guide, orwritten decision tree that helps the reader understand the order inwhich to read the various provisions and to determine which provisionsare relevant to a given transaction or activity. By this means, thepart on steps serves the purpose of describing the relationship amongthe provisions of the EAR, something that was not done in the EARbefore the proposed rule. When these steps are followed in the properorder, the reader will consider those provisions of the EAR necessaryto determine his or her rights and duties. It would be impossible to develop a useful series of steps withoutuse of cross-references to the various provisions of the EAR; however,BXA is sensitive to a reader's understandable desire for steps that maybe read with an easy flow and with no more cross-referencing thannecessary to specify the language that creates regulatory rights andobligations. To this end, where possible, we have inserted briefexplanatory references that give the reader an indication of thesubstance of the referenced provision. One comment made often by thepublic is that the steps part must contain guidance and not createadditional regulatory duties. BXA agrees that part 732 is notcontrolling for purposes of describing the requirements of the EAR; theparts of the EAR referenced in the steps are controlling. For thisreason, part 732 must reference the regulatory provisions in the otherparts of the EAR. An organization of trade associations, supported by several othercommenters, suggested several additional drafting changes to improvethe part on steps. Nearly all of those recommendations are included inthis interim rule.Part 734--Scope This part establishes the rules for determining whethercommodities, software, technology, software and activities of U.S. andforeign persons are subject to the EAR. ``Subject to the EAR'' is aterm used to identify the items and activities that BXA regulates underthe EAR. Those items and activities not so identified are not regulatedunder the EAR. The term ``subject to the EAR'' does not imply that a license isrequired for any particular item or activity. Licensing requirementsare spelled out in other parts of the EAR. The term does define thebounds of the authority that BXA has exercised under the EAR. The termis particularly useful to define the limits of the recordkeepingrequirements, certain denial orders, and the end use and end userobligations related to proliferation controls.[[Page 12717]] This part also provides certain key terms and principles usedthroughout this interim rule. These include definitions for the terms``export'' and ``reexport.'' A comprehensive listing of definitions isincluded in part 772. In addition to a change in designation from part 732 in theproposed rule to part 734 in this interim rule, this interim rule makessubstantial changes in part 734 as a result of comments received on theproposed rule. BXA received 31 comments on this part. BXA has adoptedmany of the recommendations contained in the public comments and theyare reflected in the interim rule. Section 734.1 has been substantially revised. The proposed ruleincluded a list of all the contents to part 734 with specificity. Onecommenter urged that this listing amounted to a table of contents andrecommended deletion. This interim rule follows this recommendationand, and includes an introduction that explains the contents of thispart and how it fits into the overall structure of the EAR. Certain commenters recommended that definitions be included in part772, Definitions, rather than in this part. This interim rule removesthe definitions for the terms ``item'' and ``you'', and moves them topart 772. Because the terms ``export'' and ``reexport'' are so key tothe EAR, these terms have been retained in this section, with certainmodifications. Section 732.2(d) of the proposed rule defined exportsand reexports of technology and software, but did not include adefinition of exports and reexports of commodities. This interim ruleamends the definition of ``export'' and ``reexport'' to apply tocommodities, technology, and software. A number of commenters also noted that, as written in the proposedrule, the reexport in a foreign country of technology by release by oneforeign national to another foreign national could be read to includerelease of foreign-origin technology, with no United States nexus. Thisinterim rule limits this provision to ``items subject to the EAR'' andthereby limits the provision to U.S.-origin technology. This interim rule adds three additional provisions to part 734.Section 734.2(d)(5) reflects the principle that exports that willtransit a country on their way to a third country or are intended to bereexported to a third country are deemed under the EAR to be exports tothe third country. This principle was not included in the proposedrule, except as it relates to Canada (Sec. 732.12 of the proposedrule). Section 734.2(d)(6) reflects the principle that appeared inSec. 732.15 of the proposed rule that an export to a territory,possession, or department of a country is deemed under the EAR to be anexport to that country. Finally Sec. 734.2(d)(7) clarifies thatshipments among the states of the United States and its territories,dependencies, and possessions do not constitute exports or reexports. A significant number of commenters indicated that the provisionregarding Canada in Sec. 732.15 of the proposed rule was misleading andtended to confuse the distinction between the scope of the EAR andlicensing requirements with respect to Canada. BXA agrees, and thisinterim rule omits this provision. The minimal number of instanceswhere licenses are required for Canada is reflected on the CCL and doesnot need to be recited in this part. As noted above, the in-transit andintended reexport principles contained in the Canada provision areretained in this interim rule and are made applicable to alldestinations. Finally, any License Exceptions that apply to Canada arereflected in part 740, License Exceptions. In the proposed rule, BXA invited comments on the implementation ofa de minimis rule for software and technology. In particular, BXA saidthat we were considering a requirement for a one-time report oncalculations under the de minimis rule. Throughout the comment period,BXA made clear at the town-hall fora that there are three criteria ofconcern in carrying out the proposal without a reporting requirement.First, for transfers between related parties, the export price of thesoftware or technology exported from the United States must reflect anarms-length price or fair market value. Second, estimates of futuresales of foreign-made software must be reasonable. Third, selection ofthe scope of foreign technology for measuring U.S.-content must bereasonable. BXA sought comments and suggestions on a one-time report. This wasto determine how to avoid the potential misuse of the above criteriawithout requiring a one-time report. BXA also sought comments onwhether the calculations should be made only under United States-basedgenerally accepted accounting principles. From the outset, BXAconcluded that strict accounting standards would be useful to preventmisuse of the rule through unreasonably low transfer prices for U.S.software or technology transferred to related parties. BXA alsobelieved there is no need to create a new U.S. accounting standard forimplementation of this rule. No commenter offered a solution to avoid misuses in the choiceamortization assumptions for software and the selection of anappropriate universe to measure U.S.-content in foreign commingledtechnology. All comments on the report opposed its requirement.Commenters supported the rule with the hope that the de minimisexclusion might be granted by BXA without requiring a report. However,many of these same firms acknowledge that they and foreign parents,subsidiaries and customers will invariably make de minimis calculationson valuation assumptions most likely to result in a finding that U.S.content is below the relevant de minimis level. The tenor of thecomments also suggests that most commenters did not fully appreciatethat the de minimis relief could not likely be granted without either aone-time report or some other means to avoid the potential misuses ofthe criteria. Some commenters called the report a burden almost as heavy as thelicense requirement. Some of those commenters stated expresses a beliefthat the existing rule is simply not enforced and likely is notenforceable. They also concluded that compliance with the existingcommingled rule is weak. However, some commenters acknowledged thatwithout a report requirement in this interim rule, they wouldnonetheless submit advisory requests before relying on the de minimisexclusions. Such advisory requests would require the same informationas the report required by this interim rule. Therefore for suchcompanies, the report requirement of this interim rule does not addcosts for use of the relief granted by this interim rule. Almost all foreign commenters on the de minimis rule opposed arequirement for U.S. accounting standards. They argued that they shouldbe permitted to use their home-country accounting standards and thatuse of U.S. accounting standards would be too costly. BXA has determined to require a one-time report and to permitvarious accounting standards so long as the export price is notdepreciated or otherwise reduced by accounting conventions. With therequirement of a one-time report, there is far less need for a single,strict accounting standard. The report will require a description of the nature and exportprice of the item exported from the United States, the estimate offuture software sales in units and value along with the basis for thoseestimates within the relevant market category, and a description of thetechnology and its value for[[Page 12718]]purposes of determining the U.S.-content of technology. The report willnot require information regarding destinations and end-users forreexport. BXA has concluded after interagency consultations and review of allthe comments that the so-called amortization problem exists forsoftware and does not exist for commodities. Several commenters haveasked why. Unlike parts incorporated into end products, the cost of U.S.software code will be attributed or allocated to the future sales offoreign-made software incorporating the U.S. code. In making thiscalculation for foreign software, you must make an estimate of futuresoftware sales of that software if it is commingled with orincorporated with the U.S. code. Unless there is a one-time reportrevealing the assumptions of such calculations, foreign firms maymisuse the de minimis rule and make unrealistic assumptions of largefuture sales. Such a misuse can result in U.S.-content that is unfairlyestimated to be below the de minimis level. BXA has concluded after interagency consultations and review of allthe comments that the so-call universe problem exists for technologyand not for commodities. Several commenters have asked why. There is the risk that foreign firms will select excessively largecategories of foreign technology for division into the U.S.-origintechnology content. There is no regulatory criteria or standard that issufficient to describe the scope of foreign technology that must bedivided into the U.S. technology to determine the percentage of U.S.-content. The possible choices of a universe by the reexporter are manyand varied. Some commenters wanted BXA to select one U.S. transfer pricingstandard such as the standard of the Internal Revenue Service found insection 482 of the Internal Revenue Code. One software producerindicated that it will have very difficult decisions to make in thecalculation of U.S.-content for purposes of foreign-made software andasked BXA how it would be done. In this interim rule, we indicate thataccepted accounting standards such as section 482, its implementingrules, and related ruling provide one option the exporter or reexportmay follow. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) is considering uniform transfer pricing rules, and suchinternational standards would present an attractive option in thefuture. However, it will likely be at least a year before they put suchOECD standards in place. Other commenters said that their firms do notmaintain adequate records to perform calculations of U.S.-content. Ofcourse, for such firms, any value-based de minimis rule will notrelieve existing burdens regardless of the report requirement. For decades, all reexport controls under the EAR extended toforeign software and technology incorporating any level of U.S.-content. BXA refers to this as the commingled rule. In 1988, BXAproposed giving some relief from the commingled rule with a type ofshifting of presumptions regarding country of origin after a period oftime. With one exception, commenters opposed that proposed rule andurged a value-based de minimis exclusion. BXA addressed the issue inits February 1994 proposed renewal of the Export Administration Act.That proposal would have compelled a de minimis exclusion from thecommingled rule and reserved the authority of the Executive Branch torequire a one-time report. BXA believes that it is appropriate to put reasonable limits on thereach of U.S. reexport controls for foreign-made software andtechnology. This is to recognize the sensitivities of other nations andto put some outer limits on the obligations of foreign firms doingbusiness with U.S. firms. However, it is not the purpose of thisexercise to eliminate reexport controls on software and technology.Reexport controls remain tools of the EAR to prevent diversion contraryto vital national security, nonproliferation, and foreign policyinterests of the United States. BXA understands that some foreign firms will benefit from therelief offered in this interim rule and will use this relief by filingthe necessary report. For such firms, the de minimis rule and relatedreport is not a new licensing requirement. Rather, it is a means forBXA to assure that the above described three criteria are not misusedin a given set of calculations and assumptions. The report is requiredunder a ``report and wait'' procedure. If the reporting firm does nothear from BXA within thirty days, then the reporting firm maythereafter rely upon its reported calculations, and its foreigntechnology or software described in the filed report is not subject tothe EAR. For those reexporters without the desire or ability to takeadvantage of the de minimis rule, their position under the EAR remainsunchanged in any respect by this interim rule. The commingled rulecontinues to apply as it has for decades. One commenter said that thereport requirement would make enforcement easier for BXA than under theexisting rule. BXA does not believe that to be true. The existing ruleis clear. Reexporters should also be mindful that many authorities forpermissive reexports remain available to overcome reexportprohibitions. The de minimis exclusion from the commingle ruledetermines whether foreign technology or software is subject to theEAR. If certain commingled foreign technology or software is subject tothe EAR, then the general prohibitions and License Exceptions definethe obligations of the holder of that technology and software. This interim rule also makes several changes to Sec. 734.3, ItemsSubject to the EAR. In the proposed rule, foreign made products subjectto the EAR were separately in Sec. 732.4. These provisions dealing withforeign made products are now included in Sec. 734.3, together withother items subject to the EAR. This interim rule consolidates allrelated principles in one section. A number of commenters questioned whether BXA intended to limit thecoverage of items subject to the EAR only to ``U.S.-origin'' items asreflected in Sec. 732.2(a) of the proposed rule. This interim ruleclarifies the intent of the proposed rule and the BXA practice relatedto this issue. Specifically, this interim rule has assertedjurisdiction over all items subject to the EAR exported from the UnitedStates, whether of U.S. or foreign origin, but in practice has limitedother controls, such as reexport controls, over EAR-controlled items tothose of U.S. origin. Section 734.3(a) of this interim rule reflectsthese provisions. Section 734.3 also applies to all covered items inthe United States, and to all such items that are of U.S.-origin,wherever located. This interim rule also specifically states that foreign originitems in-transit through the United States and in U.S. foreign tradezones are subject to the EAR. For any special licensing treatment thatmay be accorded such shipments on their export from the United States,exporters should look at the License Exceptions in part 740. This interim rule makes five changes to the proposed rule that arereflected in the provisions of Sec. 734.3(b), which lists theexclusions from items subject to the EAR. 1. In proposed Sec. 732.3(a)(1), BXA excluded items exclusivelycontrolled for export or reexport by other agencies which maintaincontrols for national security or foreign policy purposes. The agencieswere identified in Supplement No. 2 to proposed part 732. To reducecross-referencing, the agencies are now listed in part 734, and theSupplement has been removed. 2. This interim rule also adds a new provision that excludes fromthe definition of ``items subject to the EAR''[[Page 12719]]items included in ECCN 0A98 in the existing EAR, such as films,records, books, and periodicals. This provision was not included in theproposed rule. Under the existing EAR, items included in that ECCN donot require authorization to any destination. This interim rule has thesame result. 3. Section 732.2(a)(3) of the proposed rule excluded security-classified technology and software from the coverage of items ``subjectto the EAR.'' This provision was based on the theory that classifieditems are controlled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and theDepartment of State's Office of Defense Trade Controls. One commenterobserved that because these agencies control the export of classifieditems as part of their ``exclusive'' jurisdiction, no specificprovision needs to appear for classified items. To avoid confusion,this interim rule omits the reference to classified items. Theprovision is already implicitly included in part 734 because itemscontrolled exclusively for export by another agency are not subject tothe EAR (Sec. 734.3(b)(1)). 4. This interim rule also adopts the term ``publicly availableinformation'' to refer to all information included in General LicenseGTDA of the existing EAR. Such information is listed inSec. 734.3(b)(3). In the proposed rule, the term ``publicly available''applied solely to information that was ``generally accessible to theinterested public in any form''. This interim rule adopts the term``published information'' to represent such generally accessibleinformation. 5. A number of commenters objected to the use of the term ``Not onList'' or ``NOL'' to designate and clear for export those items whichare subject to the EAR but which do not appear on the CCL. This interimrule drops this term, which will be discussed in greater detail underpart 758, General Export Clearance Requirements. However, in responseto written comments and audience comments at the town-hall fora, BXAwill designate such items under ``EAR99.'' This designation, discussedin Sec. 734.3(c) of this interim rule, will be used for classificationand reference purposes only, and will not be required for clearingexports. One commenter recommended that items subject to the EAR bespecifically limited to exports and reexports because BXA's statutoryauthority relates to controlling exports and reexports. This interimrule does not adopt this recommendation because the term ``subject tothe EAR'' defines the scope of EAR jurisdiction. The prohibition onexports and reexports of such items based on BXA's statutory authorityis reflected in part 736, Prohibitions. Finally, this interim rule expands Supplement No. 2 to include arequirement for the submission of a report to be submitted to BXA if anexporter uses the de minimis for technology or software.Part 736--General Prohibitions Part 736 includes ten general prohibitions. These are theprohibitions that may apply to items subject to the scope of the EAR asdescribed in part 734, Scope. General Prohibitions One, Two, and Threeare product controls. The Commerce Control List in Supplement No. 1 topart 774 and the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 are usedtogether to define the product scope and destinations for the licenserequirements of General Prohibitions One, Two, and Three. GeneralProhibitions Four through Ten describe certain activities that are notpermitted without authorization from BXA. Several commenters recommended liberalization of the existingreexport controls. For example, one commenter suggested a license freezone for all members of the former Coordinating Committee on ExportControls (COCOM), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), theNuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Australia Group (AG). BXA notesthat a provision in the Export Administration Act of 1979 compelsindividual validated licenses for items controlled cooperatively bymembers of the MTCR. BXA is aware of the interest of the exportingcommunity in the further expansion of license free zones. However, thisinterim rule is not intended to address such fundamental policydecisions and is not an appropriate vehicle to make such changes. Some commenters urged BXA to create a separate part for reexportcontrols or a separate guideline for reexports. Others supported thisview and indicated that it was convenient for them to photocopy newlydesignated part 774A and send this to firms abroad. BXA believes thatpart 774A of the EAR does not describe all the duties of reexporters;and reliance upon a reading of only that portion of the regulationscould well lead to violations of other portions of the EAR. In responseto these comments, BXA has taken care in this interim rule to indicatewhich requirements of the EAR apply to reexporters and whichrequirements do not. Part 732, Steps contains explicit indications ofapplicability of various provisions to reexporters. As suggested byseveral commenters, part 732, Steps has been substantially expanded topresent a road map for the use of these provisions by reexporters. The foreign-produced direct product control described in GeneralProhibition Three reflects a policy prompted by the Cold War. TheRegulations and Procedures Technical Advisory Committee (RPTAC)recommended that BXA not revise this policy during the drafting periodthat led to the proposed rule. After publication of this interim rule,BXA will initiate a policy review of the foreign-produced directproduct rule. All ten general prohibitions in this part 736 apply to firms abroadunder some circumstances. Part 734, Scope defines the scope of theregulations for foreign as well as domestic firms. The key factors thatmake all ten general prohibitions applicable to foreign firms are thescope of the parts and components rule, the foreign-produced directproduct rule, and the general prohibition regarding reexports of U.S.-origin items. These are described in detail in part 732, Steps; part734, Scope; and part 736, General Prohibitions with specific referencesto reexporters. One commenter asked if we would add a provision regarding theapplicability of License Exceptions to General Prohibition Eightconcerning the unlading of goods in certain countries. The structure ofthis prohibition is that it applies only to exports and reexports thatrequire a license. By definition, if you properly use a LicenseException authorized by the EAR, General Prohibition Eight does notapply. Rather, it is a prohibition against unlading items that areshipped under a license. Exporters and carriers should note that BXAplans to conduct a policy review of the country scope of GeneralProhibition Eight following the publication of this interim rule. Several commenters stated that the proposed rule continued topresent a complex set of requirements, and many commenters suggestedfundamental decontrols and elimination of longstanding regulatoryrequirements. Such recommendations would necessary entail changes tothe general prohibitions. However, the Regulation Reform exercise wasnot intended to address such fundamental policy decisions, and thisinterim rule is not an appropriate vehicle to make such changes. Supplement No. 1 to part 736 on General Prohibitions provides forcertain General Orders. At this time, Supplement No. 1 is reserved.Supplement No. 2 to part 736 provides[[Page 12720]]for three Administrative Orders. These Administrative Orders continuepolices of the existing regulations regarding the technical advisorycommittees, business conduct before BXA, and certain confidentialityprovisions.Part 738--Commerce Control List Overview and Country Chart Part 738 provides an overview of the Commerce Control List (CCL)and the Country Chart. The complete CCL is contained in Supplement No.1 to part 774, while the Country Chart is contained in this part. A significant change to the proposed rule as it relates to the CCLis the modification of the numbering system used to identify ExportControl Classification Numbers (ECCNs) to conform with the EuropeanUnion (EU) numbering system as described in the supplementaryinformation regarding the CCL. This part provides an overview of thenew CCL structure and ECCN numbering system along with a thoroughdiscussion of the components that make up an ECCN. This interim rule eliminates the use of the term ``LicenseAlternative'' and the ``Special Comprehensive License'' reference asdescribed in the proposed rule. In addition, this interim rule adoptsthe revised reasons for control as identified in the proposed rule(i.e., use of the broad term ``FP'' has been discontinued). New``Related Definition'' and ``Related Controls'' sections contained inthe proposed rule have also been adopted in this interim rule. Several commenters described use of the Country Chart columnidentifier in the ``License Requirement'' section of each ECCN as arational model and fundamental to simplifying the task of determininglicensing requirements. This interim rule retains this very valuabletool with few modifications. The Country Chart, as described in the proposed rule, has beenmodified to incorporate columns for destinations eligible for GeneralLicense GCT and GNSG under the existing EAR. General License GCTeligibility is now determined by NS Column 2, while NP Column 1 nowreflects General License GNSG eligibility. NP Column 2 is retained inits original format as reflected in the proposed rule. Accordingly,references to License Exceptions CSR and NSG in the ``LicenseExceptions'' section within each entry on the Commerce Control List donot appear in this interim rule. A few commenters noted that the proposed title to part 738,Commerce Control List and Country Chart implies that the entire CCL iscontained in part 738. The title to this part has been modified tostate this part contains an overview of the CCL structure and itsrelationship to the Country Chart, rather than the actual CCL. Two commenters noted that the cross-reference to part 742, ControlPolicy--CCL Based Controls should be clarified. This interim rulecontains a more descriptive cross-reference to part 742 and is placedin a more appropriate location. A few commenters expressed confusion over the use of UN Column 1.This interim rule removes UN Column 1, because of its limited scope ofcontrol and for added clarity. In addition, this interim rule revisesthe two instances in which the Country Chart is not consulted todetermine license requirements. This interim rule expands the proposedlist of ECCNs in which the Country Chart cannot be used from 5A80D(5A980) to include 1A988, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994, 2B985, 0A983, 0A986, and0A988. This interim rule does not adopt the request made by a fewcommenters that the Country Chart be expanded to incorporate theCountry Group identification as described in part 740, LicenseExceptions. These two lists were developed for separate purposes andallow for systematic licensing determinations (e.g., Country Groups arenot reviewed unless a license is required by the Country Chart). Inaddition, incorporation increases the possibility that readers willmake incorrect license determinations. This interim rule expands the example for using the CCL and CountryChart to illustrate more complex fact patterns, as requested by acommenter.Part 740--License Exceptions Part 740 provides for exceptions from license requirements similarto the General Licenses contained in the existing regulations. Inaddition to License Exceptions for commodities, this part containsLicense Exceptions for software and technology and permissivereexports. Previously, both technical data and reexports had separateparts. License Exceptions for short supply commodities appear in part754. Eligibility for License Exceptions may be based on the item to beexported or reexported, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use of the item, or the end-user. If a License Exception is availablefor a particular transaction, the exporter or reexporter may proceedwith the export or reexport without a license. However, the exporter orreexporter is required to meet all the terms of the License Exception;in using a License Exception, the exporter or reexporter will becertifying that all terms, conditions, and provisions for the use ofthat License Exception have been met. The most significant departure in this interim rule from theproposed rule is the changed relationship between the determination ofthe applicability of a License Exception to a particular transactionand the documenting of that transaction for export clearance purposes.Previously, each License Exception bore a three-character symbol thattransferred directly to shipping documents to certify that thetransaction did not require a license and that it met the terms andcondition of the stated License Exception. In this interim rule, eachthree-character symbol that will be used on shipping documentsrepresents a group of License Exceptions rather than a single LicenseException. This change means that a few symbols will cover a largepercentage of shipments from the United States. Each symbol bears anintuitive relationship to its group of License Exceptions; for example,those based on the Commerce Control List bear the symbol ``LST.'' Somecommenters wished to retain the old General License symbols, but apreponderance of exporters preferred intuitive symbols and expressedthat preference at the numerous town-hall fora held around the country. Many commenters on the proposed rule protested that certainexisting General Licenses--specifically GLR and GTDU--had beenneedlessly fragmented. In this interim rule, these License Exceptionshave been consolidated into Servicing and Replacement (RPL) andTechnology and Software--Unrestricted (TSU), respectively. GeneralLicenses GCT and GNSG in the existing EAR, which appeared as LicenseExceptions CSR and NSG in the proposed rule, have in this interim rulebeen incorporated into the Country Chart in part 738. Changes made in General Licenses in the intervening period betweenpublication of the proposed rule and this interim rule, including G-BETA for beta test software, G-CTP for computers, and a modification ofGCG (shipments to cooperating governments), are reflected in part 740.The former Humanitarian License Procedure, which was included in theEmbargo part of the proposed rule, has become a License Exception forhumanitarian donations.Part 742--Control Policy--CCL-Based Controls If you have determined that a license application must be filedafter reviewing the Country Chart in part 738 and the Commerce ControlList (CCL) in part 774, this part 742 provides the licensing[[Page 12721]]policy that BXA will apply in reviewing your application. This partcontains licensing review policies for all items listed on the CCLexcept items controlled for ``short supply'' reasons or to implement``U.N. Sanctions.'' It consolidates most of newly designated part 785A,Special Country Policies, portions of newly designated part 776A,Special Commodity Policies and all the CCL-based controls described innewly designated part 778A, Proliferation Controls. It also includescontrol policies for items included on the CCL but not reflected in theCountry Chart. Specifically, these items are high performancecomputers, implements of torture, and communications interceptingdevices. Part 742 does not include controls and licensing polices that applyto exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (currently, Cuba,Libya, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and the Bosnian-Serb controlled areasof Bosnia-Herzegovina), except a description of anti-terrorism controlsapplicable to Iran (Sec. 742.8) and other terrorist-designatedcountries (Supplement No. 2 to part 742). Part 746, Embargoes and OtherSpecial Controls, covers the licensing policies for embargoeddestinations. This part is structured to assist exporters to easily retrievelicensing information related to the reason for control for each itemlisted on the CCL. Each ``Reason for Control'' column on the CountryChart in part 738 has a counterpart section in part 742. The sectionsin this part appear consecutively in the same order as the columns onthe chart, reading from left to right. In addition, each section issimilarly structured:--Paragraph (a) lists the licensing requirements as stated on the CCL;--Paragraph (b) provides the licensing policy for specific controls onthe CCL;--Paragraph (c) describes any contract sanctity dates that apply toparticular controls; and--paragraph (d) provides information concerning any multilateralcooperation that may apply to a particular control. BXA believes that the structure and organization of this part is asignificant improvement over the existing EAR. It enables an exporterto retrieve specific licensing information relevant to each ECCN on theCCL without having to review extraneous material. Changes were made in Sec. 742.1, Introduction, to accuratelydescribe the structure of this interim rule. Paragraph (c) was added tomake clear that controls on embargoed destinations, other than anti-terrorism controls, are covered in part 746, Embargoes and OtherSpecial Controls and do not appear in this part 742. Paragraph (d)generally describes anti-terrorism controls maintained by BXA.Paragraph (e) reminds the reader that items not listed on the CCL arenonetheless subject to the end-use and end-user provisions described inpart 744, Control Policy--End-user/End-use Based. In addition, this interim rule contains changes that implementregulations which were issued by BXA but were not reflected in theproposed rule. The interim rule also reflects changes made in responseto public comments on the proposed rule. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959,imposing a virtual embargo on exports of any goods, technology ordevices to Iran and on certain reexports of U.S.-origin goods ortechnology. (The Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control(OFAC), has principal responsibility for implementing E.O. 12959.)Because of the virtual embargo on exports to Iran, provisions dealingwith Iran, except anti-terrorism controls, have been shifted to part746, Embargoes and Other Special Controls. In this interim rule,Sec. 742.8 describes anti-terrorism controls on exports and reexportsto Iran that BXA continues to maintain while the comprehensive embargoadministered by OFAC is in effect. This interim rule also includes new anti-terrorism controls onSudan, described in Sec. 742.10 and in Supplement No. 2 to part 742.The Department will also publish these controls in the format of newlydesignated part 785A and related parts. The items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons to Sudan include explosive device detectors, whichhave been moved into a new ECCN. The anti-terrorism control onexplosive device detectors also applies to Syria and Iran. Since the publication of the proposed rule, the Department hasissued a new regulation on exports of specially designed implements oftorture (60 FR 58512). This regulation moved specially designedimplements of torture from Export Commerce Control Number (ECCN) 0A82Cto a new ECCN, 0A83D, and required a license to all destinations,including Canada. The changes made by that regulation are reflected inthe interim rule. Proposed Sec. 742.7 (Crime Control) is revised toeliminate references to implements of torture, and a new Sec. 742.11(Specially Designed Implements of Torture) is added to this interimrule. The President announced a revision of U.S. export controls oncomputers on October 6, 1995 that affects the supercomputer controlscontained in part 742 (Sec. 742.12) of the proposed rule. TheDepartment published the revised regulations on January 25, 1996 (61 FR2099). Section 742.12 has been retitled ``High performance computers''in this interim rule and describes the license requirements andlicensing policies applicable to four ``tiers'' of countries.Supplement No. 3 to part 742 describes licensing safeguard conditionsthat may be imposed on exports of high performance computers to certaindestinations. Twelve commenters included comments on part 742 in theirsubmissions. A number of commenters pointed out technical mistakes andomissions in part 742. These are corrected in this interim rule.Following is a discussion of other comments submitted. Two commenters questioned the appropriateness of continuingcontrols on exports to members of a given multilateral control regimeof items controlled by that regime. No License Exceptions are availablefor items controlled for missile technology reasons because a provisionin the Export Administration Act requires individual validated licensesto all destinations. Section 742.2(a)(2) of this interim rule statesthat licenses are not required for exports of the listed chemicals toAustralia Group member countries. This interim rule revisesSec. 742.3(a)(1) to inform the exporter that no license is required forexports of certain nuclear proliferation controlled items to NuclearSuppliers Group (NSG) member countries. Finally, this interim ruledescribes, in Sec. 742.4(a), a new national security control level,denoted by ``NS Column 2'' in the Country Chart, which indicates thatno license is required for exports to Country Group A:1 and cooperatingcountries. One commenter noted that proposed Supplement No. 2, listingcountries that are party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation ofNuclear Weapons and to the Treaty for the Prohibition of NuclearWeapons in Latin America, required updating. Because the list ofcountries party to these treaties is constantly changing, BXA decidedto remove this Supplement rather than risk publishing an inaccurate oroutdated list. BXA will maintain and make available to interestedpersons a current list of the countries party to these treaties. One commenter suggested that part 738, Commerce Control ListOverview; part 742, Control Policy--CCL Based[[Page 12722]]Controls; and part 774, The Commerce Control List be combined, sincethey all concern the Commerce Control List. BXA did not adopt thisrecommendation. Each of the three parts provides a view of controlsfrom a different vantage point: Part 738 by country; part 742 by typeof control; and part 774 by type of item. BXA believes thatconsolidating the three parts into one would make the interim rule moreunwieldy and difficult to use. Two commenters recommended that contract sanctity provisions beestablished for nuclear nonproliferation, national security, regionalstability, crime control or computer controls. BXA did not establishcontract sanctity in this interim rule. Decisions on contract sanctitydates are made when new controls are imposed. This interim rule doesnot impose any new controls. Accordingly, no changes have been made incontract sanctity provisions. Two commenters stated that Sec. 742.2(d) (chemical and biologicalweapons), Sec. 742.4(d) (national security) and Sec. 742.5(d) (missiletechnology) incorrectly state that U.S. controls are consistent withmultilateral agreements. BXA does not agree with this comment. The onlychange that BXA is making in this interim rule is to reserveSec. 742.4(d). On December 19, 1995, the United States and twenty-sevenother countries, including its NATO allies and Russia, agreed toestablish a new multilateral export control arrangement. The WassenaarArrangement for Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-useGoods and Technologies (``Wassenaar Arrangement'') is expected to beoperational later in 1996. Any EAR changes that may be needed to carryout the Wassenaar Arrangement will be made at the appropriate time. A commenter suggested that License Exception NSG be extended toSouth Korea, Taiwan and Mexico. License Exception NSG has been removedin this interim rule. Instead, items on the CCL with ``NP Column 1'' inthe Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section of anECCN do not require a license to NSG member countries. The commenter'ssuggestion has not been adopted by BXA for Taiwan and Mexico becausethe regulations simplification initiative was not intended to makesubstantive changes in license requirements. However, recent regulatorychanges have extended such treatment to South Korea, and that change isincorporated into this interim rule. One commenter questioned why ECCN 5A80 (communications interceptingdevices) of the proposed rule is not included in Sec. 742.7 (CrimeControl). These items are regulated under separate statutory authorityand licensing criteria. Items controlled under Sec. 742.7 are thoseagreed to pursuant to section 6(n) of the Export Administration Act.Controls on communications intercepting devices are maintained inaccordance with the Omnibus Crime Controls and Safe Streets Act of1968, and are therefore separately controlled under Sec. 742.13.Part 744--Control Policy--End-User/End-Use Based This part contains prohibitions against exports, reexports, andactivities related to certain end-uses and end-users. Specifically,Sec. 744.2 prohibits exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR,without a license, if at the time of the export or reexport you knowthat the item will be used in nuclear explosive, or other safeguardedor unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Section 744.3 prohibits the exportor reexport, without a license, of certain items to be used for missileend-uses. Similarly, Sec. 744.4 prohibits the export or reexport ofitems with certain chemical and biological weapon end-uses. Next,Sec. 744.5 prohibits the export or reexport of items to be used forspecified nuclear maritime end-uses. Section 744.6 places restrictions on certain proliferation-relatedactivities of U.S. persons. For purposes of this prohibition the term``U.S. person'' means citizens, permanent resident aliens, or protectedindividuals as defined in the immigration laws; any juridical personorganized under the laws of the United States or any U.S. jurisdiction;and any person physically in the United States. This part also containsprohibitions against exports, reexports, and certain transfers tospecified end-users. Section 744.7 imposes restrictions on certainexports to and for the use of certain foreign vessels or aircraft, andSec. 744.8 places restrictions on certain exports to all countries forLibyan aircraft. Commenters urged BXA to publish a positive list of items and limitthe applicability of the nonproliferation related end-use restrictionsto items on such a positive list. In addition, commenters asked BXA topublish certain names of end-users as to which individual exportershave been ``informed'' that a license is required by reason ofSec. 744.2(b), Sec. 744.3(b), Sec. 744.4(b), and Sec. 744.6(b). BXA isworking within the Administration toward these objectives; however,these are major policy initiatives, they are not part of this interimrule, and they are not necessary to achieve the goals of theRegulations Reform exercise. Commenters suggested that under Sec. 744.2(b) the discretion of BXAto inform an exporter of the trustworthiness of certain end usersshould be a duty of BXA rather than an option of BXA. The U.S.Government will retain this discretion because of the overridinginterests in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gatheringand the interests in law enforcement objectives that on occasionrequire flexibility on the part of the government. One commenter urged BXA to make clearer the treatment of technologythat historically was authorized for export under General License GTDA.In the proposed rule, BXA excluded such information from the scope ofthe EAR. That approach is retained in this interim rule and clarifiedin the steps that have been added to part 732, Steps to suggest methodsfor using part 734, Scope of the EAR. Items not subject to the scope ofthe EAR are not subject to any prohibition of the EAR. Section 744.2(b) contains provisions designed to standardize theprocedure for informing exporters that a particular party may presentan unacceptable risk of diversion contrary to nuclear policies. Somecommenters applauded this addition, and one opposed it. BXA willmaintain this provision because the procedural discipline it providesshould prove useful for both BXA and exporters. This provision does notchange BXA's substantive authorities under the EAR. One commenter suggested additional cross-references to the licensereview policies for items subject to, for example, missile technologycontrols identified on the CCL based upon product parameters ratherthan a prohibited end-use. In the proposed rule and in this interimrule, the license review standard for applications required by reasonof the product parameters designated on the CCL are listed in part 742,Control Policy--CCL Based Controls. The license review standards forlicense requirements defined by end-uses described in part 744 arecontained in part 744. Because of the criticism of some commenters thatthe proposed rule contained too many cross-references, BXA hasconcluded in this instance that additional cross-references are notadvisable. This interim rule continues existing policy regarding the countryscope of the nuclear end-use prohibition. A new Supplement No. 3 isadded to the part and referenced at Sec. 744.2(a) to exempt designatedcountries from this prohibition, and those are the same countries thatare exempt under the[[Page 12723]]existing EAR. This is a change from the proposed rule. One commenter suggested that BXA remove from Sec. 744.6 words thatindicate defined activities are prohibited in the United States. Thisinterim rule accepts this recommendation. One commenter complained thatSec. 744.6 applies to less than all countries in Country Group D:1. Theexclusion of Romania and China is consistent with current policy, andis maintained in this interim rule. BXA recognizes that such policydecisions make the use of the Country Groups and the EAR itself morecomplex. BXA hopes reviewing of provisions of the EAR in the orderrecommended by the steps in part 732 will minimize this problem. BXAintends to further address such issues in the future. However, policymaking in export controls will always present trade offs for exporterswhen petitioning the government for fairness and precision of exportcontrol policy on the one hand versus simplicity and ease ofadministration for the public on the other. The proposed Sec. 744.6(a)(2) prohibited certain U.S. personactivities related to nuclear explosives devices. It was removed fromthis interim rule because such activity is prohibited under theInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 120-130), whichregulate defense services for all destinations.Part 746--Embargoes and Other Special Controls Part 746 of the proposed rule contained controls for Cuba, Libya,Iraq, North Korea, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia andMontenegro), indicating where jurisdiction was divided between BXA andthe Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Italso contained controls implementing U.N. sanctions resulting inadditional EAR controls on Rwanda. Controls on Iran, embargoed because of Executive Order 12959 of May6, 1995, have been added to part 746 in this interim rule. With thesuspension of the embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbiaand Montenegro), controls on that country, as well as on certain areasof Croatia and Bosnia-Herzgovina, have been shifted to a Supplement topart 746. Commenters pointed out that ECCN 0A95, which released foodand medical supplies to Libya from reexport control, was unaccountedfor in the proposed rule; that oversight has been corrected. The formerHumanitarian License Procedure, which was included in the Embargo partof the proposed rule, has become a License Exception for humanitariandonations and is in part 740 of this interim rule. Finally, this part includes Supplements containing generalinformation on embargoes and sanctions administered by other federalagencies.Part 748--Applications (Classification, Advisory, and License) andDocumentation Part 748 describes the procedures for submitting licenseapplications, classification requests and advisory opinions. Thisinterim rule places information from throughout the existing EAR intoone part. It is intended to provide the reader with all informationnecessary to submit an application to BXA. This interim rule adopts use of the new Form BXA-748P for thesubmission of license applications and classification requests, but notadvisory opinions. Most commenters favored the use of one form for bothexports and reexports. This interim rule clarifies the definition ofadvisory opinions and states they must be submitted in writing vialetter. Commenters were evenly split regarding the proposal to requireuse of Form BXA-748P for advisory opinions. One commenter proposedadopting the form for use when submitting end-user requests. Thissuggestion along with one recommending the elimination of unit andtotal price boxes are not adopted in this interim rule. A number ofcommenters also queried whether BXA intends to republish the FormsSupplement contained in the existing loose leaf EAR subscription. BXAwill republish the Forms Supplement in the subscription to the EARoffered by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The FormsSupplement is not published in the Code of Federal Regulations. Sections in part 748 have been redesignated to better describe eachsection's contents. The addresses in Sec. 748.2 and Sec. 748.14 havebeen placed in one section. Procedures for submitting applicationselectronically have been placed in a separate section for easieraccess. For continuity, the unique license requirements for specificitems or transactions have been placed in a separate Supplement No. 2to this part. This change will allow readers to determine quicklywhether the unique requirements apply to their transaction, and if not,to continue quickly with sections relating to support documents.Instructions for completing Form BXA-748P contained in Supplement No. 1to part 748 have been clarified in response to comments posed by boththe public and BXA employees. On the suggestion of one commenter, a reminder that informationsubmitted under the Export Administration Act will be treated inaccordance with provisions stated in section 12(c) of the act has beenadded in this interim rule in Sec. 748.1(c). The section on license application support documents has beenrevised to eliminate one step in the decision tree. The questionscontained in Sec. 748.10(a)(3) in the proposed rule have been combinedinto one question in this interim rule. Some commenters noted thatexceptions for obtaining support documents have decreased in certaincircumstances. The changes announced in the proposed rule were duelargely to the changing export control environment and proliferationcredentials of various countries. Accordingly, this interim rule adoptsthe requirements contained in the proposed rule with a fewmodifications. This interim rule also adopts the two year validityperiod for the Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. A few commenters noted that though the development of decisiontrees will assist in determining support document requirements, BXAshould consider the development of a matrix or chart similar to thatcontained in part 775 of the existing rule. Though a chart has not beenincluded in this interim rule, BXA will explore development of a newmatrix/chart based on the support document decision tress in this part.This interim rule also eliminates the last letter in the Export ControlClassification Number contained in the existing rule. This letter hadbeen used previously to designate support document requirements, but isno longer necessary. A few commenters requested additional guidance on what constitutesan emergency and clarification of validity periods as they relate tolicenses approved under emergency processing. This interim ruleclarifies the validity period by cross-referencing the appropriatesection in part 750, but does not provide additional language to beused by applicants when submitting emergency requests. In order toretain the emergency nature of these requests, this interim rule doesnot adopt the suggestion by one commenter to increase the validityperiod from 30 to 60 days for applications involving reexports. Commenters were evenly split regarding the elimination of Form BXA-685P for amendments with a few stating the elimination of this form islong overdue. This interim rule adopts the intent to eliminate FormBXA-685P along with Form BXA-648. Changes not[[Page 12724]]listed in Sec. 750.7(c) will require the submission of a Replacementapplication. One commenter stated the time period for the return ofDelivery Verifications to BXA was reduced with elimination of Form BXA-648. The existing rule states the time frame as ``a reasonable timeafter the last shipment'' while the instructions contained in theexisting Form BXA-648 stated the time frame as ``90 days after the lastshipment''. This interim rule eliminates this inconsistency byestablishing a 90 day time frame. Form BXA-711 along with its written counterpart is adopted in thisinterim rule. Commenters stated the ability to use a form or letter wasa good idea.Part 750--Application Processing, Issuance and Denial Part 750 describes the processing procedures and time frames forclassification requests, advisory opinion requests and licenseapplications. Once an applicant has prepared documents in accordancewith part 748, this part describes how the application will be handledby BXA. The time frames detailed in this interim rule are drawn fromExecutive Order No. 12981 of December 6, 1995 and the draft 1994 ExportAdministration Act bill written by the Clinton Administration. This interim rule provides a detailed description of therelationship between all agencies and departments involved in thelicense review process as well as a description of the interagencydispute resolution process. This part also addresses actual issuance,validity periods, denial, revocations, suspensions, transfers,duplicates, and shipping tolerances. This interim rule also eliminates the proposed exceptions to thelicense processing time frames and limits all license applications to a90 day processing time frame. A number of commenters maderecommendations for revising the time frames for the processing oflicense applications as well as the types of applications subject toCongressional notification. This interim rule incorporates theprocessing time frames provided in Executive Order No. 12981.Accordingly, recommendations to establish different time frames havenot been adopted. In addition, congressional notification requirementsfor crude oil and refined petroleum products have not been adoptedsince they no longer apply to the types of licenses reviewed by theDepartment. Most commenters supported the clarification of the licenseprocessing system and time frames. These commenters agreed that BXA hasmet the goal of making the process more transparent for the exporter. A number of commenters requested that applicants be given theopportunity to express their views during the license escalationprocess. These commenters also requested clarification of the term``registration'' to include language that would require prompt actionby BXA upon receipt of a license application. Both of theserecommendations have been adopted in this interim rule. One commenter suggested that part 756, Appeals, be combined withthis part 750 since most appeals involve license applications. Thisrecommendation was not adopted because the appeals process is open toall administrative actions, not only those relating to licenseapplications. One commenter recommended simplification in the provisions forshipping tolerances. While this recommendation has merit and may beconsidered at a later date, it was not adopted in this interim rule.Part 752--Special Comprehensive License Part 752 describes the provisions of the Special ComprehensiveLicense (SCL). The SCL consolidates the activities authorized under theProject, Distribution, Service Supply, Service Facilities, Aircraft andVessel Repair Station Procedure, and Special Chemical Licenses, andprovides for additional flexibility to BXA in shaping appropriate SCLsand internal control programs (ICPs). For example, the Project Licenseand Service Supply Procedure authorize exports and reexports tocountries of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the People'sRepublic of China, but the Distribution License, which includes anextensive mandatory ICP that is not required for the Project License orthe Service Supply Procedure, does not allow exports and reexports fordistribution in these countries. This interim rule conforms item andcountry eligibility under the SCL. All items subject to the EAR arealso eligible for export and reexport under the SCL, except a fewspecified items. Form BXA-686P, Statement by Foreign Importer ofAircraft or Vessel Repair Parts, which was used for certain exportsunder the Aircraft and Vessel Repair Station Procedure, and Form BXA-6026P, Service Supply License Statement by U.S. Exporter, are not usedunder the SCL. BXA received fourteen comments on part 752. Overall, severalcommenters stated that the SCL is a significant improvement over theexisting special license eligibility because it provides broaderauthority to allow exports of items such as software and technology. Five commenters suggested that existing special license holdersretain the right to use existing special licenses until they expire,but apply for amendments to take advantage of the increased item andcountry scope of the SCL. This interim rule makes the SCL effective March 25, 1996. Allexisting special licenses will expire on March 25, 1997, unless thespecial license expires before that time by its own terms. BXA will notgrant extensions to existing special licenses. Existing special licenseholders who want to take advantage of the SCL benefits, must apply foran SCL according to part 752. BXA will not accept amendments tooutstanding special licenses. Eight commenters provided comments on item scope for the SCL. Mostcommenters stated that the proposed rule would not authorize exportsunder the SCL of items eligible for a License Exception. The proposedrule allowed exports under the SCL of all items subject to the EAR,including items eligible for a License Exception. However, to preventconfusion, the interim rule specifically states in Sec. 752.1 that youmay apply for an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license describedin part 748 or a License Exception described in part 740. Two commenters stated that the SCL should not exclude any itemsbecause it defeats the purpose of the SCL, which is designed to allowgreater flexibility in return for increased monitoring of each shipmentby the SCL holder and consignees. One commenter added that otheragencies have the right to review the applications for an SCL, andrestrictions may be placed on a license on a case-by-case basis.However, two commenters stated that there should be no ad-hocrestrictions, adding that the only item restrictions should be thosepublished in the Federal Register, which would be applicable to allcompanies. This interim rule retains the list of items not eligible for theSCL in Sec. 752.3 to ensure that potential applicants are aware of thefew item restrictions before they consider applying for an SCL. If BXAdetermines that an item must be added to the list to protect nationalsecurity, nonproliferation, or foreign policy interests, or determinesthat an item need no longer be prohibited under the SCL, BXA willpublish a change in the Federal Register, at which time the change willbecome effective and apply to all SCL and potential SCL holders. Another commenter was concerned about the general policy of denialfor[[Page 12725]]exports to destinations in Country Group D:2 of items controlled fornuclear nonproliferation reasons, and suggested that the SCLspecifically state that items controlled for nuclear nonproliferationreasons be authorized on a case-by-case basis provided that theexporter has appropriate controls in place to screen for proscribedend-uses or end-users. The Internal Control Procedures (ICPs) requiredfor most activities authorized under the SCL include screening elementsfor proliferation end-uses. This interim rule revises the policy ofdenial language found in Sec. 752.3(b) of the proposed rule to a policyof case-by-case review. In addition, this rule retains the discretionto deny or limit the export or reexport of all items, including thosecontrolled for nonproliferation reasons. Most commenters applauded the expansion of country scope to includethe newly independent states and Russia. However, several commentersrequested clarification that the SCL is eligible for countries such asSlovenia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Croatia, which are eligible underexisting special licenses . One commenter stated that when BXA declaresa country ineligible to receive items under the SCL, BXA shouldsimultaneously list the country in the EAR, and remove it from allSCLs. It is not BXA's intent to roll-back special license countryeligibility. This interim rule therefore clarifies that all countriesare eligible to receive items under the SCL except Cuba, Iran, Iraq,Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. If BXA determines that additionalcountries should become ineligible to receive items under the SCL, itwill publish the change in the Federal Register, and notify all SCLholders. Four commenters suggested consolidating Sec. 752.2 into one genericparagraph that describes the representative activities. Anothercommenter stated that the SCL should not prohibit the export of serviceparts or upgrades as long as it does not exceed the limits of the SCLparameters. Section 752.2 is intended to provide illustrative examplesof the types of activities that may be approved under the SCL. It isnot intended to be an inclusive list, and other activities may beapproved on a case-by-case basis. This interim rule revises Sec. 752.2to provide a general description of the types of activities that BXAmay approve the under the SCL. These activities fall under the generalcategories of ``service'', ``end-user'', ``distribution'', and``other'' activities. Four commenters provided comments on the requirement for a letterof assurance for exports under the SCL of certain technology. Onecommenter stated that the SCL expands the scope of the existing letterof assurance required for exports under General License GTDR because itwould require the letter of assurance from each new recipient overseas.One commenter specifically requested that the letter of assurance berequired from only one party overseas. The proposed rule did not expandcurrent policy. Under the existing EAR, any transfers of technical datacovered by a letter of assurance would require such assurances from anynew recipient of the technology. Two commenters indicated thatassurances are not required for exports of technology under a validatedlicense. But, if an assurance must be required, the assurance should beincluded in the SCL certifications. This interim rule removes the letter of assurance requirement fromSec. 752.5. BXA intends to review requests to export controlledsoftware and technology under the SCL on a case-by-case basis, andimpose conditions or restrictions as appropriate. Depending upon thelevel of software or technology requested for export under the SCL,this may include restrictions on reexport of software or technology, orexports of direct products of the technology. Comments on Sec. 752.5, steps you must follow to apply for an SCL,focused on the comprehensive narrative statement. Many commentersstated that much of the information required in the comprehensivenarrative statement is already required on Form BXA-748P, MultipurposeApplication, or Form BXA-752, Statement by Consignee in Support ofSpecial Comprehensive License. Five commenters specifically requestedthat the requirement to state the ratio and dollar volumes ofcontrolled items to those not subject to the EAR be removed, because itis impractical to calculate and fundamentally unreliable. BXA agreesthat SCL applicants should not be required to repeat information in acomprehensive narrative statement that is also required on Form BXA-748P or Form BXA-752. Therefore, this interim rule includes majorrevisions to the comprehensive narrative statement requirements,limiting that statement to the information that is not requiredelsewhere. This interim rule also removes the requirement to list theitems eligible for a License Exception that will be exported under theSCL because the ICP requirements assure that appropriate controls arein place to prevent diversion. One commenter stated that the application stage was too early toprovide BXA a copy of the proposed ICP, and to do so conflicts with thecertification requirements that an ICP must be in place upon approvalof the SCL. This interim rule retains, under Sec. 752.5(c)(3), therequirement that applicants and consignees submit ICPs at the time ofapplication. This information is necessary for BXA to determine whetherto approve the items, activities, or countries requested on the SCLapplication, or to modify your proposed ICP depending upon the natureof the request. One commenter stated that BXA should not require an SCL holder toinform all consignees of license conditions. Certain conditions mayonly have relevance to one or two consignees. BXA agrees, and hasclarified in Sec. 752.9(a)(4) to state that the SCL holder must informall relevant consignees of all license conditions prior to making anyshipments under the SCL. Four commenters objected to the language thatrefers to prior reporting of exports of certain items, which is wasincluded in Sec. 752.9(a)(4). This interim rule retains this language.Exporters should note that the list of the special conditions that maybe placed on your SCL included in this section only provides examples,and such conditions may not be included on your SCL. Section 752.11 describes the elements of the Internal ControlPrograms (ICPs) that the SCL holder and consignee must implement uponapproval of the SCL to assure that exports and reexports are not madecontrary to the EAR. Two commenters stated that the ICP requirementsincluded in the proposed rule should be clear and defined, notgeneralized. Three commenters suggested that EPCI screening be limitedto certain countries. Two commenters requested that BXA clarify whenthe parties to the application must submit the ICP to BXA. Onecommenter also requested that upon publication of the SCL, BXA publishguidelines that further define ICP requirements. This interim rule also restructures Sec. 752.11 to consolidate theelements of all three ICPs into one list, and to remove the differentlevels of ICPs. This simplifies the text, and makes it more user-friendly. This interim rule does not place country limits on screensagainst customers who are known to have, or suspected of having,unauthorized dealings with specially designated regions and countriesfor which nonproliferation controls apply. Any such limits must beapproved by BXA, and are dependent upon the specific nature of your SCLrequest. This interim rule also includes information inSec. 752.11(a)(2) on where you may obtain[[Page 12726]]guidelines to assist you in developing an adequate ICP. This interim rule also makes several other editorial changes topart 752 to consolidate provisions and simplify the text. Section752.10, Changes to the SCL, has been revised to clearly define therequirements for changing an SCL. Detailed instructions on how tocomplete Forms BXA-748P, Multipurpose Application, and Form BXA-752,Statement by Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License, andother forms related to applying for an SCL are included in supplementsto part 752. The servicing provision in Sec. 752.4(b) has been revisedto conform with the standard used throughout the EAR. This provisionprohibits you from servicing, under the SCL, any item when you knowthat the item is owned or controlled by, or under the lease or charterof, entities in countries not eligible for the SCL, or any nationals ofsuch countries. Finally, the recordkeeping provisions of Sec. 752.12have been clarified by providing the appropriate cross-references topart 762, which applies to all transactions subject to the EAR.Part 754--Short Supply This part implements section 7 of the EAA and similar provisions inother laws that authorize or require restrictions on exports forreasons dealing with adequacy of supply of commodities in the UnitedStates, as opposed to reasons based on foreign policy, nationalsecurity, or nonproliferation considerations. Specifically, this partimplements controls on exports of crude oil restricted under the EAAand a number of other laws; on exports of petroleum products producedor derived from the Naval Petroleum Reserves; on exports of western redcedar as required by provisions in the EAA; and on exports of horses bysea for the purpose of slaughter. It also provides information relatingto two provisions contained in EAA section 7: The registration ofagricultural commodities for exemption from short supply controls, andthe filing of petitions for the imposition of controls on recyclablemetallic materials. Consistent with the revised structure of the proposed and interimrules, this part contains all of the requirements that apply uniquelyto commodities controlled for short supply reasons. It sets forth allof the licensing requirements, licensing policy, License Exceptions,and other unique requirements that apply to commodities controlled forshort supply reasons on the CCL. Short supply controlled commoditiesare identified with ``SS'' under ``Reason for Control'' in eachrelevant ECCN on the CCL. Other requirements of the EAR that are notunique to short supply controls, such as recordkeeping in part 762,also apply to items covered by this part. Six commenters provided comments on this part. A number ofrevisions have been made to implement the recommendations contained inthe comments. Additional revisions were made to incorporate the heavyCalifornia crude oil rule published in the Federal Register but notincluded in the proposed rule. Commenters recommended that the definition of ``crude oil'' inSec. 754.2 be moved to the front of this section from paragraph (g).The definition of ``crude oil'' is now included in paragraph (a). Section 754.2(b) deals with licensing policy for crude oil. It hasbeen revised significantly to distinguish BXA's licensing policy forshipments of crude oil which have already been found to be in thenational interest, by Presidential decision or otherwise, e.g., crudeoil from Cook Inlet or California heavy crude, and those which will beapproved if BXA makes the necessary findings on a case-by-case reviewof applications. In the proposed rule all crude oil applications wouldbe reviewed by BXA and approved if the crude oil was not subject tocertain statutory restrictions and BXA made a finding that the exportwas in the national interest and consistent with the purposes of theEnergy Policy and Conservation Act. In this interim rule, paragraph(b)(1) of Sec. 754.2 lists the exports that have already been found tobe in the national interest and paragraph (b)(2) lists the exports forwhich BXA must make the necessary findings. Section 754.2(b)(2) also reflects a revision relating to the kindsof transactions that BXA will find to be in the national interest. Theproposed rule had cited examples of crude-for-crude and crude-for-product exchanges that would be found to be in the national interest.The language of the proposed rule, however, could have been interpretedas limiting the national interest to these examples. The interim rulemakes clear that the cited exchanges are only examples. This interim rule also adds a new paragraph (g) to Sec. 754.2,reflecting regulations that were published in the Federal Register (60FR 15669, March 27, 1995). Finally, this interim rule creates two new License Exceptions whichapply to the exports of crude oil. Section 754.2(h) implements a newLicense Exception SS-SPR, intended to permit the export of foreignorigin oil stored for emergency use by a foreign government in theStrategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR). License Exception SS-SPR permitsthe export even if the foreign origin oil is commingled with other SPRoil, provided that the Department of Energy certifies that the crudeoil being exported is of the same quantity and of comparable quality asthe foreign origin oil imported by the foreign government for storagein the SPR. Section 754.2(i) of this interim rule creates a new LicenseException, SS-SAMPLE, to permit limited quantities of crude oil foranalytical or testing purposes. This revision implementsrecommendations included in the public comments. Under this LicenseException you may ship up to ten barrels of crude oil to any one end-user annually, up to a cumulative limit of 100 barrels per exporterannually. This License Exception codifies a BXA licensing policy forsample shipments that has been in effect for several years. Thislicensing policy has been included in BXA's annual report to theCongress, but has not been reflected in the EAR. Such de minimis sampleshipments have no measurable effect on U.S. oil supplies. Section 754.3 of this interim rule reflects a significant change inthe way that the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA)restriction on non-crude oil products are implemented. The NPRPAprohibits the export of petroleum origination or derived from the NavalPetroleum Reserve (NPR), unless the President approves the export.Under existing EAR, licenses are required for all petroleum products,and General License G-NNR authorizes shipments of all such product ofnon-NPR origin or derivation. The proposed rule continued this approachand provided License Exception SS-NPR. Commenters noted that if all NPR crude oil produced in fiscal year1994 were refined, it would amount to less than one percent of all thecrude oil refined in the United States. The commenters recommended thatthe existing approach be changed to require a license only forpetroleum products which were NPR produced or derived. BXA adopted thisrecommendation and this provision reflects the change. The relevant ECCNs on the CCL have been revised to apply only topetroleum products that were produced or derived from the NPR or becameavailable for export as a result of an exchange of any NPR produced orderived commodities. With this change, General License SS-NNR is nolonger necessary and is removed.[[Page 12727]] Section 754.4, unprocessed western red cedar, has been reorganizedconsistent with a recommendation included in the comments. In theproposed rule, Sec. 754.4(a)(2) contained instructions for filing alicense application, and preceded provisions on license policy andexceptions. A commenter noted that an exporter will first look forlicensing policy and license exceptions before looking for informationon how to fill out a license application. The commenter observed thatthere is no point in instructing the exporter how to complete a licenseapplication if subsequent text informs the exporter either that alicense will not be approved or is not necessary. This interim ruleadopts this comment and has restructured Sec. 754.4 accordingly.Part 756--Appeals This part describes the procedures applicable to appeals fromadministrative actions taken by BXA. An administrative action is anyaction (not including an administrative enforcement proceeding) takenunder the EAA or EAR with respect to a particular person, includingdenial of a license application, return of a license application forother than procedural deficiencies or additional information, orclassification of an appellant's item. Essentially, any person directlyand adversely affected by an administrative action would be allowed toappeal to the Under Secretary for Export Administration forreconsideration of that administrative action. No substantial comments were received on this part 756. Onecommenter suggested the possibility of combining this part with part748, Applications. This interim rule does not adopt the suggestion. With the exception of minor editorial revisions and clarifications,the provisions of part 756 remain unchanged from the proposed rule.Part 758--General Export Clearance Requirements This part deals with requirements imposed on exporters and othersregarding the movement of items subject of the Export AdministrationRegulations (EAR) out of the United States. The purpose of this part isto assure that the movement of items subject to these EAR conforms tothe requirements of the export license or other authorization for theirexport. This part imposes specific responsibilities on the differentpersons involved in export transactions to ensure compliance with otherprovisions of the EAR and of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations(FTSR) (15 CFR Part 30), including exporters, freight forwarders,exporters' agents, carriers and all other persons. It prohibits anyperson from engaging in certain proscribed conduct. This part governssome of the same conduct that is governed by the FTSR. This part imposes specific responsibilities for assuring thatShipper's Export Declarations (SEDs), bills of lading and air waybillsare accurately filled out and are consistent with the export license orother authorization for the export to which they correspond. Itrestricts the conduct of exporters, forwarders, carriers and others toassure that the delivery abroad of items subject to the EAR is inaccordance with the terms of the export license, exception to thelicensing requirement or other authorization. In some cases, it imposesduties on parties to the transaction to return the items to the UnitedStates or take steps to prevent them from entering the commerce of aforeign country. The proposed rule made several changes to this part. Approximately25 commenters made comments on the proposed part 758. A majority of those who commented on part 758 recommended that weeliminate the requirement to place the symbol ``NOL'' on ShippersExport Declarations (SEDs) for transactions involving items not on theCCL. Most of those commenters suggested that we adopt a single symbol``NLR'' for all transactions where the export does not require alicense either because it is on the CCL but does not require a licenseto the destination in question or because it is not on the CCL. Severalcommenters went further and recommended that we authorize the use ofthe symbol ``NLR'' for transactions that are authorized by a LicenseException instead of requiring that the License Exception symbol belisted on the SED. We adopted the suggestion to eliminate the symbol``NOL''. However, this interim rule includes a designator (EAR99) foritems that in the proposed rule were subject to the EAR but not on theCCL, that will be used by BXA in responding to classification requestsand by exporters for their management systems. The designator will notbe used on SEDs. We have also reduced the number of License Exceptionsymbols from which parties filling out SEDs must choose. As noted abovein the discussion of License Exceptions, we have created a small numberof symbols for various groups of License Exceptions, and it is thesesymbols for groups of License Exceptions that must appear on the SED. Several commenters suggested that the choice of Destination ControlStatements (DCSs) in the proposed rule was unduly complex. In addition,some commenters suggested that the proposed rule on DCSs did not makeit clear that the most restrictive DCS could be used for anytransaction. This interim rule adopts a single simplified DCS. A number of commenters raised the issue of what information shouldbe shown on SEDs for items which in the proposed rule were not subjectto the EAR, but which in the existing EAR are eligible for generallicense GTDA. In response to these comments this interim rule createsan optional designator TSPA which exporters may use on SEDs forsoftware or technology that the proposed rule and this interim ruledefine as outside the scope of the EAR. The proposed rule eliminated some information about authority andstatus of forwarding agents and procedures for correcting SEDs on thegrounds that those points are covered in the FTSR (15 CFR part 30) andincluding them in the EAR was redundant of the FTSR. Some tradeassociations recommended that we retain these procedures. We did notadopt this suggestion because the FTSR applies to all exports from theUnited States including those subject to the EAR and those that arenot. These procedures need to be in the FTSR because exporters who haveno transactions subject to the EAR must follow them. Retainingduplicate language in a regulation that applies to only a portion ofthe exports from the United States would be redundant and creates theburden of keeping two different sets of regulations identical wheneveramendments are adopted. Two commenters suggested that proposed Sec. 758.1 was too long andportions were redundant. They suggested breaking it up into severalsections. We did not adopt this suggestion in this interim rule. Thesection has been shortened because of the elimination of the NOLprovisions. Several commenters suggested that the use of the word ``you'' inthe proposed rule under Sec. 758.1(a)(1) shifted responsibility fromexporters to forwarders. This interim rule does not change thatlanguage. The proposed rule, by its terms makes those who obtainlicenses from BXA or rely on License Exceptions in their exporttransactions responsible for the proper use of that license or LicenseException. This is a reasonable policy and is retained in this interimrule. Two commenters proposed that forwarding agents not be required tokeep a record of the delegation of authority to them unless the[[Page 12728]]responsibility to do so was delegated by the exporter. This interimrule does not adopt this suggestion. The proposed rule and this interimrule conform with the existing EAR and with the FTSR on this issue. Two commenters stated that the use of the phrase ``exporter and theperson submitting the document'' in the proposed Secs. 758.3(e) and758.3(l)(1) expands the scope of the persons making representations tothe U.S. Government to include forwarders in instances where theexisting EAR does not impose responsibility on forwarders. We acceptedthis recommendation. This interim rule adopts language from theexisting EAR. However, other sections of this interim rule, like theexisting EAR, impose liability on forwarders who makemisrepresentations to the government. Two commenters recommended that the HTSUS numbers be permitted onSEDs in lieu of Schedule B numbers. We did not adopt thisrecommendation in this interim rule. The FTSR (15 CFR part 30) whichgovern all exports from the United States require Schedule B numbers.To the extent that there are differences between the HTSUS and theSchedule B numbers, errors in compiling foreign trade statistics wouldoccur if either classification numbering system were permitted forexports subject to the EAR. One commenter recommended that this rule eliminate theresponsibility of exporters and forwarders who file summary monthlyreports in lieu of SEDs to ensure that carriers place the destinationcontrol statement on bills of lading and air waybills. We did not adoptthis suggestion. The proposed rule and this interim rule follow theexisting EAR which was designed to assure that exports made under theprivileged monthly procedure were totally in compliance with the EAR. Two commenters recommended that the regulations impose a limit onthe time that the Government may hold up export shipments forinspection. We did not adopt that suggestion because it was beyond thescope of the regulations reform exercise. Input from a number of othergovernment agencies would be necessary to develop a rational timelimit. One commenter recommended that when the government orders a carrierto return or unload a shipment that the government be required tonotify the exporter. We did not adopt this suggestion. In some casesthe exporter may be the target of an investigation and a notificationrequirement could jeopardize legitimate law enforcement activities.More than one agency has authority to order return or unloading anddeveloping a rule would require the coordinated input of severalagencies. That coordination would be beyond the scope of theregulations reform exercise. One commenter recommended that we require that exporters show theExport Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the SED for all exports.We did not adopt this suggestion. Although exporters need to determinethe proper ECCN in order to determine whether they need an exportlicense, requiring them to show that number on SED's for all exportswould unduly increase the paperwork burden. To assist in defining parties to an export transaction, oneassociation recommended we adopt as a guide a Power of Attorneyutilized by Customs. We did not adopt this recommendation. The EARdefines parties to a transaction in an adequate manner. Parties totransactions additionally are free to adopt any Power of Attorneyarrangement that addresses pertinent roles and is not inconsistent withthe EAR or other applicable regulations. One commenter questioned the proposed requirement to place thevarious EAR authorizations for each item being exported under itscorresponding line item description. This commenter pointed out thatthe FTSR requires that same information to be placed in blocks 21 and22 on the SED form or continuation sheet. This interim rule adopts theFTSR procedure and eliminates the requirement to repeat theauthorization under the line item description. This same commenter also recommended that the ``Conformity''provisions in Sec. 758.4(c)(2)(iii) be changed to allow a name of aparty other that the licensee/shipper on the SED to be shown on thebill of lading as shipper. We did not adopt this recommendation. Theseprovisions are designed to assure that new parties are not introducedin transactions contrary to the EAR and that exports are completed inan orderly and legal manner. Additionally, the situation described maybe appropriately addressed in the application for license process, byshowing the foreign subsidiary as exporter/licensee and the UnitedStates affiliated/related company as agent for the exporter. Two commenters recommended eliminating the proposed rulerequirements concerning commodity descriptions on the SED(Sec. 758.3(g)(2)(ii)) and the requirement that a copy of thecommercial invoice with a DCS be sent to the ultimate consignee(Sec. 758.6(c)(4)). They claimed that these were new requirements. Wedid not adopt the recommendations in this interim rule because theproposed rule merely retained the requirements of the existing EAR.Part 760--Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts This part revises the existing part 769. The recordkeepingrequirement found in Sec. 760.5(b)(8) of this interim rule requires therecipient of records relating to a reportable boycott request to keepthose records for five years after receipt of the request. The existingEAR Sec. 769.6(b)(8) requires the recipient of records relating to areportable boycott request to keep those records for three years afterreceipt of the request. Two sections that were reserved in the existing EAR (769.5 and769.7) have been removed. As a result of this change, Sec. 769.6 in theexisting EAR has been renumbered as Sec. 760.5 in this interim rule. Inaddition two grace period provisions in the existing EAR have beenremoved. They are; Sec. 760.2(f)(11) (along with its accompanyingexample xi) in which certain actions to implement letters of creditprior to the expirations of grace periods and Sec. 769.8 whichestablished a grace period for agreements entered into on or before May16, 1977 could be complied with. The last such grace period expired onDecember 31, 1978. Supplement No. 14 which relates to U.S. sanctionsagainst South Africa that have been repealed has also been removed andsubsequent supplements renumbered. A new Supplement No. 16 interpreting antiboycott policy in light ofrecent developments in Jordan has been added by this interim rule. None of the changes made to this part by this interim rule werepublished in the proposed rule.Part 762--Recordkeeping In this interim rule, this part has been reorganized and revised toeliminate the requirement that regulated persons obtain BXA approvalprior to destroying original documents and replacing them withelectronic, magnetic, photographic or other images. This interim rulealso makes it clear that persons required to keep records may alwayskeep the records in the form in which that person receives or createsit. It extends the recordkeeping period to five years to coincide withthe applicable statute of limitations and sets standards of legibilityand retrievability for reproductions that are kept in lieu oforiginals. Several commenters objected to the extension of the recordkeepingrequirement to five years in the[[Page 12729]]proposed rule. This interim rule adopts the five year record retentionperiod. A record retention period that coincides with the applicablestatute of limitations is needed to promote effective enforcement. Inaddition, such a retention period benefits firms that comply with theregulations because the EAR require that those who export under aLicense Exception justify the use of that exception. Such persons willneed the records of the transaction to do so. Three commenters suggested that recordkeeping requirements beeliminated for certain categories of exports that do not require alicense from BXA. We did not adopt this suggestion. Many transactionsthat are subject to the EAR do not require a license from BXA.Comprehensive records are necessary for effective enforcement andadministration of the EAA and EAR. One commenter objected to a requirement in the proposed rule thatrecords which are the subject of a request for production of records bythe government may not be destroyed even if the record retention periodhas otherwise expired. This provision is a requirement under theexisting EAR and is retained in this interim rule. Enforcement andcompliance efforts would be undermined if parties were allowed todestroy records after they have been notified that those records arewanted in connection with an audit or investigation. Several commenters recommended that we eliminate the specificrequirements for legibility and retrievability of reproduced recordsthat are kept in lieu of originals that appeared in the proposed rule.We did not adopt this suggestion. This interim rule does not impose anyrequirements of legibility on original records. However, standards oflegibility and retrievability are necessary when the originals aredestroyed and copies are retained in lieu thereof. BXA will continue toreview this issue to ascertain if the standards might be simplifiedwithout compromising record integrity. Two commenters recommended that the EAR specifically state thatrecords of certain activities of U.S. persons in connection with theproliferation controls described in Secs. 734.2(b)(7) and 744.6 aresubject to the recordkeeping requirement. Although the proposed rulestated that all transactions that are subject to the EAR are subject tothese recordkeeping requirements, we adopted this suggestion to makemore explicit the fact that activities subject to the proliferationcontrols are covered.Part 764--Enforcement Eleven of the commenters dealt with part 764. This interim rulemakes numerous changes to the proposed rule based upon these comments. This interim rule accepts the suggestion of one commenter andrevises Sec. 764.2(e) expressly to limit the offense of acting withknowledge of a violation to actions that are connected with an itemthat is the object of the violation of the EAA or EAR. Section 764.2(j) is revised to remove from the list of violations anumber of actions characterized as ``trafficking and advertising exportcontrol documents''. BXA accepted the suggestion that some of therestrictions on the creation of an interest in a licensed transactionare inconsistent with normal trade practice in financing and insuringexports. BXA is eliminating other parts of this section as unnecessarybecause limitations on license transfer and use are effectively coveredby other EAR provisions, such as Sec. 750.10, and concerns regardingdisclosure of a person's relationship to a transaction are covered byprovisions such as Sec. 764.2(g). This interim rule limitsSec. 764.2(j) to the offense of license, other export control documentsor other alteration. Some commenters called for distinguishing between ``substantive''and ``minor'' violations. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXAconcludes that such distinctions are not feasible or appropriate withrespect to the type of activity covered by the EAR. Some commenters urged BXA to list factors that would mitigatesanctions for violations. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA notesthat its practice shows that it is open to the consideration of a widerange of mitigating factors, and it does not believe that a listing ofsuch factors is needed to enhance compliance or to ensure thatsanctions will be appropriate. Some commenters called for BXA to include in the EAR acomprehensive denial list that would include the names not only ofpersons denied export privileges by BXA, but of persons covered bydenial orders or designations by other agencies. This interim rule doesnot contain such a list. BXA cannot make its regulations an officialrepository of legal action by other agencies. BXA will work with otheragencies to try to improve coordination of and access to the lists. This interim rule describes certain measures such as licensesuspensions and temporary denial orders and places them in a newSec. 764.6, entitled ``protective administrative measures''. Thesemeasures are not punitive, but are intended to protect against activitycontrary to the purposes of the EAR. Although these measures wereincluded in the existing EAR and in the proposed rule, they were notall in a single section. Placing these measures in a single sectiondistinguishes them from the sanctions which are covered elsewhere inpart 764.Part 766--Administration Enforcement Proceedings Five commenters specifically addressed part 766. Three of thesecommenters addressed substantially the same points. Three commenters called for changes to protect the interests ofpersons BXA seeks to add to a denial order on the basis of relationshipto the respondent. This interim rule makes three such changes. Itrevises Sec. 766.23 to clarify that prevention of evasion is the basisfor making an order applicable to a related person, to provide morespecifically and uniformly for notice to persons that BXA seeks to havenamed as related, and provides that such persons may oppose or appealnot only the issue of relationship, but also whether the order isjustified to prevent evasion. These commenters suggested, further, thatrelated persons be allowed to challenge the order on the merits, thatis, as to whether or not there has been a violation or a temporarydenial order is necessary in the public interest in order to prevent animminent violation. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA believesthat it is proper to limit contests on the merits to respondents, as itis the alleged conduct of respondents that is the basis for the order. One commenter expressed concern that having the Under Secretarydecide appeals from Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decisions inenforcement proceedings raises doubts about impartiality, due processand fairness. This commenter called for direct appeal from the ALJ tothe U.S. Court of Appeals. No such change has been made, as it would becontrary to specific EAA provisions and to general administrative lawpractice that makes final agency action subject to judicial review. AnALJ decision cannot be final agency action under 50 U.S.C. app. 2412(c)or (d). Moreover, BXA believes that its conduct of administrativeproceedings has been marked by fairness and the careful observance ofdue process. Three commenters called for stating that ``clear and convincingevidence'' is required to sustain an administrative enforcement case.BXA did not adopt this suggestion. The EAA (50 U.S.C.[[Page 12730]]app. 2412(c)) makes the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556)evidence standard (``reliable, probative, and substantial'')applicable. BXA does not believe that any different EAR standard isneeded. Three commenters called for detailed provisions on how muchevidence is needed to support a summary decision under Sec. 766.8. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA concludes that the use ofthe standard ``there is no genuine issue as to any material fact'' isproper and sufficient. Another commenter stated that Sec. 766.24(b) should be revised todefine the ``imminent violation'' criterion for issuance of a temporarydenial order as requiring a showing of imminence both in nearness oftime and in likelihood of occurrence. BXA did not adopt thissuggestion. BXA retains its longstanding definition from the existingEAR, consistent with the legislative history of the 1985 amendments tothe EAA, that either time or probability imminence will support theissuance or renewal of a temporary denial order. This interim rule adopts many improvements in drafting clarity andprecision that were suggested in the comments, along with numerousothers that BXA developed. This interim rule revises Sec. 766.7 to makedefault procedures available in antiboycott proceedings. There were nopublic comments suggesting this change, but it makes the procedures forimposing administrative sanctions and other measures in antiboycottcases more consistent with other proceedings under the EAR. Finally,BXA decided to remove from this interim rule one provision thatappeared in the proposed rule even though no comments on it werereceived. This interim rule eliminates a provision from Sec. 766.18 ofthe proposed rule that would have barred reference in a settlementorder to a finding of a violation, as the content of such an order isconsensual. This deletion makes this interim rule consistent with theexisting EAR.Part 768--Foreign Availability Part 768 reflects the provisions described in part 791A of theexisting EAR. It implements section 5(h) of the Export AdministrationAct (EAA) and contains procedures and criteria relating todeterminations of foreign availability for national security controlleditems. It is substantively unchanged from the existing part 791A. Thisrevised version contains several technical changes, such as use of theterm ``claimant'' instead of ``applicant,'' intended to make part 768easier to read and understand. Only three commenters mentioned this part in their submissions,possibly because the Federal Register notice soliciting comments hadstated that BXA did not intend to make any significant changes in thispart. One commenter questioned why Cuba is included in the definition of``controlled countries'' for foreign availability purposes underSec. 768.1(d) and not for general purposes by inclusion in CountryGroup D:1, as described in Supplement No. 1 to part 740. Cuba is a``controlled country'' pursuant to determination made by BXA undersection 5(b) of the EAA. (See Export Administration Annual Report 1994,at II-8.) Country Group D:1 does not include countries subject to broadbased embargoes, such as Cuba and North Korea, even though they arecontrolled countries. This interim rule adds a clarifying notationstating that since virtually all exports to Cuba and North Koreacurrently are subject to an embargo, the foreign availabilityprocedures do not apply to these two controlled countries. A similarnotation is included in Supplement No. 1 to part 740. Another commenter suggested that Sec. 768.7(d) be revised toclearly reflect the provision of section 5(f)(3) of the EAA that ``theSecretary shall accept the representations of applicants * * *supported by reasonable evidence, unless contradicted by reliableevidence * * *''. BXA did not make any revisions because Sec. 768.7paragraphs (c), (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this interim Rule alreadyimplement this provision. One comment suggested that the provision in Sec. 768.7(f)((1)(i)(C)for submitting foreign availability determinations to COCOM or asuccessor regime was unnecessary and should be deleted. When COCOMceased functioning on March 31, 1994, the United States and othermember countries agreed to maintain the control lists that were inplace at that time until a successor regime was in place. A change hasbeen made in this interim rule to reflect BXA's intention to conductany necessary consultations with former member countries. Another commenter questioned why foreign availability procedures donot apply to foreign policy controlled items. Foreign availability isalways taken into account whenever foreign policy controls are imposed,expanded, or extended. Because the purposes of foreign policy controlsvary, strict procedures for conducting assessments have not been deemedto be warranted. Finally, one commenter suggested that part 768 berevised to reflect the expanded role of the Strategic Industries andEconomic Security Office's Economic Analysis Division in consideringunfair impact, effectiveness of controls, and foreign availability, andto discuss how exporters may contribute to this work and analysis. BXAwill consider such an addition to the EAR in future revisions.Part 770--Interpretations Part 770 contains certain interpretations concerning commodities,software, technology, and de minimis exceptions for chemical mixtures.These are designed to clarify the scope of the controls. BXA intends toadd interpretations to this part over time to aid you in interpretingthe EAR. Since the publication of the proposed rule, BXA has issuedcertain interpretations on the application of the de minimis exclusionfor certain mixtures of chemicals. Those interpretations are added topart 770 in this interim rule. Some commenters suggested that the part numbers of this chapter andothers will overlap with the part numbers of different chapters inearlier versions of the EAR and therefore BXA should use both odd andeven numbers for the parts of this interim rule. BXA does not believethat using only even numbers for the parts of this interim rule willcause confusion. BXA further believes that is it useful to retain onlyeven numbers in this interim rule so as to leave room for future partsthat cannot now be anticipated. Certain commenters urged BXA to add interpretations of certainissues; and BXA will review those recommendations for inclusion in thefuture. Commenters also asked BXA to include an interpretation of thephrase ``specially designed.'' BXA is not responding to thisrecommendation due to pending criminal enforcement action and for otherreasons. This part contains certain interpretations regarding the de minimiscontent of certain chemical mixtures. These reflect amendments to theEAR adopted after the publication of the proposed rule.Part 772--Definitions This part defines terms as used in the EAR. In response to comments, this interim rule combines the definitionspart from the proposed rule with the multilaterally-agreed definitionsfound on the Commerce Control List that are found in Supplement No. 3to Sec. 799A.1 of the existing EAR. These definitions may bedistinguished from other definitions by the fact that they appear inquotation marks.[[Page 12731]]Part 774--The Commerce Control List On May 11, 1995, BXA published an advance notice of publicrulemaking in the Federal Register, (60 FR 25480), soliciting commentsfrom industry and interested public on whether and how to conform thenumbering system used to identify items controlled by the ExportAdministration Regulations, or Export Control Classification Numbers(ECCNs), with the numbering system used by the European Union (EU) toidentify such items. BXA received a total of eighteen responses to the May 11 notice.Ten commenters responded directly to this notice, while the remainingcommenters included comments on the May 11 notice with their commentson the proposed rule. Additional verbal comments were also provided atthe town-hall fora conducted throughout the United States by BXA. Overall, industry supports harmonizing the U.S. ECCN system withthe EU numbering system. The following is an analysis of the responsesto the five questions posed by BXA in the Federal Register notice,followed by other general comments.1. Should the U.S. Harmonize the ECCNs With the EC Numbers andEncourage Other Countries To Adopt a Uniform Numbering System? Most commenters stated that they were very supportive of adoptingthe EU numbering system. Four stated that if such a change were to bemade, there should be a grace period during which either the ECCN or EUnumber could be used. One of these commenters stated that the graceperiod should be six months, and another stated that a minimum of ninemonths should be allowed for a smooth transition to the new system. Onecompany stated that it would be less costly to plan for such a changenow rather than sometime in the ``years ahead''. Another commenterstated that although the initial computerization of the new numberscould be costly, they will be able to use the information to processexport declarations electronically, which will make processing theinformation much more timely. One foreign-based company stated that they do not supportconverting the ECCNs to the EU numbering system because the U.S.-basedECCN automatically shows that the item is U.S.-origin, and that thereare just too many discrepancies between the items controlled by ECCNsand the corresponding EU numbers. Another commenter who does notsupport conversion to the EU numbering system stated that the use of acommon ECCN has little benefit in the export documentation and shouldnot be considered an advantage to exporters. This commenter furtherstated that it was only recently that they incurred costs ofadministering the changes BXA made to the ECCNs to implement theCoordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control's (COCOM) ``CoreList'' in 1991 (56 FR 42824, August 29, 1991), and would not want to doit again. Another commenter stated that the ECCN system is a goodsystem that works and that they see no advantage of a world-wide systemin this area. One commenter, that supported the conversion of ECCNs to the EUsystem, stated that BXA should not require conversion to the EU systemuntil the differences between the existing ECCNs and the numberingsystem used by the EU are resolved, and also until the COCOM successorregime and control lists are finalized and all export destinationsagree to adopt the system. Another commenter echoed this opinion, andadded that the new U.S. ECCNs should only be developed for U.S.-controlled items now controlled by the EU. One commenter stated thatunless the U.S. and EU numbers are identical, there will still be aneed for exporters to classify U.S. and EU separately. BXA agrees that complete harmonization between the new ECCN systemand the EU system is desirable. Without such harmonization, anyresulting list may be confusing for industry and difficult toimplement. For multilaterally controlled items, the new ECCNs describedin this interim rule are renumbered according to the comparable entryon the EU list. The scope of such controls are generally the same onboth lists, however the style of the text may be different. It is important to note that the EU list provides guidance tomember states on the control parameters for items controlled by on theIndustrial List, the International Atomic Energy List, MissileTechnology Control Regime Annex, the Nuclear Supplier's Group, and thelist of items controlled by the Australia Group. Each EU memberpublishes its own national list to implement such controls and anyother unilateral controls. Many national lists are therefore differentfrom the EU list, except for the scope of multilateral controls. TheU.S. also uses discretion in developing its national list, the CCL, fordual-use items. Certain entries on the CCL have been created for thoseitems that are not controlled multilaterally on the EU list. Such itemsare identified an unilateral controls. In those few instances where themultilateral entries differ, the U.S. will ask its trading partners toadopt the CCL.2. What are the Specific Implications If We Change the ECCNs To ConformWith the EC Numbering System? For Example, if You Currently HaveComputer Programs That Aid in Facilitating Exports and Reexports, WhatWill be the Programming Implications for Your Firm if We Make ThisChange? Most of the commenters stated that the reprogramming of computersystems would be a significant undertaking to convert to a EU numberingsystem. One commenter stated that they estimate it would takeapproximately 2 person years of effort and $300,000 to change the database and ancillary associated systems worldwide. The time forperforming this effort would be approximately three to four months. Twocommenters stated that consideration would need to be given to thediversion of human resources from current tasks to the review of entireproduct lines against the proposed new classification numbers. Thiswould involve the review of several thousand product part numbers andthe time required to enter each new EU-based number into the computersystem. Three commenters remarked on the export control personnelretraining requirements requisite to use of the new numbering system.Another commenter stated that changes to their current system would beminimal, but they are now in the process of upgrading relevant programsand processes, and would like to see a change in numbering system now. One commenter stated that they currently give dual classifications(ECCN and EU number) to items on their product matrices, and that thematrices are computerized. Changes to the matrices will be required forthe implementation of the EAR simplification project, so it would bebeneficial if the ECCN harmonization could be carried out at the sametime. BXA is sympathetic to the time and cost involved in implementing anew numbering system. However, as many companies have stated, thebenefits of a global numbering system far outweigh the costs ofimplementing such a system. The new ECCNs identified in this interimrule implement the first steps toward a global control list.[[Page 12732]]3. What Problems Have You Had in the Past in Tracking Two or MoreNumbering Systems for Identical Items Controlled by Two or MoreCountries? One commenter stated that a uniform numbering system wouldeliminate a potential area for misunderstanding or confusion inreferences to a specific item while another stated that the currentneed to track multiple numbering systems adds cost and unnecessarycomplexity to their compliance programs. This latter commenter alsostated that there is added confusion caused by changes on differentdates by different countries to the various lists. Another commenterstated that the lack of correlation between the various lists has madeit all but impossible to develop a computerized correlation between thevarious numbers that may apply to one unique product. This commenteralso stated there is no correlation in the EU numbering system forECCNs designated for unilateral controls.4. What Are the Specific Ways in Which a Uniform Numbering System WouldHelp Your Company? Five commenters responded to this question. One commenter statedthat it would simplify their product matrices, while another two statedthat it would streamline their training procedures. One of thesecommenters also stated that it would also increase their ability tomaintain high levels of export control compliance. Another commenteragreed that standardization would allow the company to avoid buildingand maintaining cross-reference tables as they communicate orderrequirements and status on U.S. export orders with importing foreignentities. Another commenter also cited simplification as the major benefit ofa uniform system, and highlighted the specific benefit of consistencyin classification of items. Only one commenter stated that a uniformnumbering system would not benefit their company, but provided nofurther explanation as to why it would not be beneficial.5. Are There Numbering Systems of Other Countries That You Prefer tothe EC System? If So, State Which Ones and Exactly How You WouldReconcile Any Differences in Scope? Two of the ten commenters supported maintaining the current ECCNsystem. Of the seven commenters that specifically supported a unifiednumbering system, none identified a system other than the EU aspreferable. Four commenters provided additional comments other than thosesupporting the four specific questions posed in the May 11 FederalRegister notice. One commenter, who did not support a conversion to theEU numbering system, stated that the fourth and fifth digits of the EUnumber do not provide any real benefit or added clarity. This commenterfurther stated that the alpha-character used at the end of the currentECCNs has been useful in internal control procedures. For example, an``A'' at the end of a ECCN easily indicates a highly sensitive item,while a ``G'' indicates greater range of exportability. Two commenters, who were supportive of the EU numbering system,also supported the elimination of basket categories. One of thesecommenters stated that the continued use of such categories wouldconflict with the objective of harmonizing the ECCNs with the EU list.Another commenter stated that elimination of the ``G'' level basketcategories was not favorable. One commenter also stated that there should be no interim orintermediate changes to the ECCN numbering system, and future changesto the control list should be effective on the same date in allcountries that are a party to the control regimes using the list. TheEU provides guidance to member states for drafting national controllists. Each state is responsible for implementing changes tomultilateral control lists based upon agreements reached by theWassenaar Arrangement, the Missile Technology Control Regime, theNuclear Suppliers Group, and the Australia Group. BXA will continue toimplement agreements reached by each of the regimes through promptpublication in the Federal Register. Another commenter suggested that if the United States were to adoptthe EU numbering system, BXA should clarify whether new control numbers(not included on the EU control list) represent new controls, and ifso, what items are being suggested for control and the policy basis forsuch controls. A comprehensive cross-reference will be included inSupplement No. 3 to this part. The Supplement will provide cross-references for both new format to old format and old to new, so thatreaders will be able to locate new numbers based on their currentECCNs. In this manner, readers will be able to determine the origin ofall numbers that do not currently appear on the EU list. Further, therevised CCL implements recent multilateral agreements that have not yetbeen incorporated in the EU list, such as the NSG revisions publishedFebruary 1, 1996 (61 FR 3555). Under the new numbering system adopted by this interim rule, itwill be easy to identify whether an item is controlled multilaterally(e.g., for national security, missile technology, nuclearnonproliferation, or chemical and biological reasons) or unilaterally,based upon the third digit of the number. ECCNs having a ``9'' as theirthird digit (i.e., 5A980, surreptitious listening devices) are controlsunique to the United States, just as other countries may have their ownunique controls. Further, Category 10 has been renumbered, and willappear as Category 0 in conformance with the EU list. Titles of thevarious categories have also been revised in conformance with the EU. This interim rule retains one ``basket'' entry (EAR99), referencedat the end of each category in the Commerce Control List, whichcontains all the items that used to be classified under those ECCNsending with ``96G'' and were thus eligible for General License G-DESTto most destinations. Items classified as EAR99 are those items notspecified on the CCL, but still subject to the EAR. Therefore,exporters first must determine that their items are not, in fact, onthe CCL; only then may they classify their items as EAR99. As in the existing EAR, terms enclosed in quotation marks (i.e.,``aircraft'' or ``production'') are those with multilaterally agreeddefinitions that appear throughout the CCL. These definitions, found inSupplement No. 3 to part 799A of the existing EAR, are in this interimrule integrated into part 772 (Definitions). By contrast, definitionsor parameters not enclosed in quotation marks and identified by theRelated Definitions header in individual ECCNs are unique to particularentries, and therefore appear only in those entries. Administrative Exception Notes, denoting ``favorableconsideration'' of licenses for certain items to certain destinationsin the existing Supplement No. 1 to part 799A, became meaningless whenCOCOM disbanded, and they have been removed from the CCL in thisinterim rule. With the harmonization of the CCL and the EU list, most items willneed to be reclassified. Exporter and reexporters may submit requestsfor reclassification beginning on the effective date of this interimrule. BXA will publish a list of those ECCNs where reclassification isnot necessary prior to November 1, 1996.Forms Supplement The new Multipurpose Application Form, BXA-748P, will replace theApplication for Export License (BXA-622P) and the Request for ReexportAuthorization (BXA-699P). It will also[[Page 12733]]serve as an application for the Special Comprehensive License.Additionally, the BXA-748P will accommodate Commerce ClassificationRequests, thus allowing item classifications to be handledelectronically. The BXA-711P replaces BXA-629P, Statement by Ultimate Consignee andPurchaser. A letter from the ultimate consignee or purchaser may now besubstituted for this form, provided the letter contains the sameinformation. The BXA-752P will be required as support documentation forthe Special Comprehensive License, replacing the Statement by ForeignConsignee in Support of Special License Application (BXA-6052P). The International Import Certificate (BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53),the Delivery Verification Certificate (BXA-647P), and the Notificationof Delivery Verification Requirement (BXA-648P) remain unchanged.Applicants will now submit replacement licenses rather than amendmentrequests when their situations change; therefore, the Request forAmendment Action (BXA-685P) will be discontinued. Exporters and reexporters may find instructions for completingforms in part 748, while applicants for the Special ComprehensiveLicense may find instructions in part 752. Applicants must begin using the new forms as of June 15, 1996. Dueto the requirements of electronic submission and processing systems,there will be no transition period during which either version of eachform may be used. Old forms received after the changeover date will bereturned without action to the applicant. Forms may be obtained fromU.S. Department of Commerce District Offices or from: ExporterCounselling Division, Bureau of Export Administration, Room 1099, U.S.Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20230. Telephone (202) 482-4811.Rulemaking Requirements 1. For purposes of Executive Order 12866, this interim rule hasbeen determined to be significant. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person isrequired to respond to nor shall a person be subject to a penalty forfailure to comply with a collection of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection ofinformation displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. This interimrule contains five new collections of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 35, whichwere cleared by the Office of Management and Budget. The new``Multipurpose Application'' is cleared under OMB Control Number 0694-0088, the ``Special Comprehensive License'' is cleared under OMBControl Number 0694-0089, five year record retention is cleared underOMB Control Number 0694-0096, the one-time report on calculations underthe de minimis rule for software and technology is cleared under OMBControl Number 0694-0101, requests for appointment of a TechnicalAdvisory Committee is cleared under OMB Control Number 0694-0100,miscellaneous activities are cleared under OMB Control Number and 0694-0102. All other collections of information contained in the rulemakinghave been previously approved by OMB. Supplement No. 2 to part 730 ofthe EAR contains a table of the current OMB Control Numbers. The publicreporting burdens for the new collections of information are estimatedto average 45 minutes for the Multipurpose Application, between 20 and40 hours for the Special Comprehensive License, 10 seconds forrecordkeeping, 25 hours for the one-time report, 5 hours for requestsfor appointment of Technical Advisory Committee, and 5 hours forpetitions covered under miscellaneous activities. These estimatesinclude the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding theseburden estimates or any other aspect of these collections ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Larry E.Christensen, Director, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of ExportAdministration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. 3. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, this interim rule doesnot contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrantpreparation of a Federalism Assessment. 4. Pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) and section 13(a) ofthe Export Administration Act, 50 U.S.C. 2401-2420 et seq., thoughprior notice and an opportunity for public comment are provided, suchprocedures are not required for this regulatory action. As such, noInitial or Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required undersections 3 and 4 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and604(a), and none has been prepared. 5. Although the Export Administration Act expired on August 20,1994, the President invoked his authority under the InternationalEmergency Economic Powers Act, through Executive Order 12924, August19, 1994, as extended on August 15, 1995, and determined that, to theextent permitted by law, the provisions of the Export AdministrationAct shall be extended so as to continue in full force and effect andamend, as necessary, the export control system previously implemented,as the Export Administration Regulations, pursuant to the ExportAdministration Act. However, because of the importance of the issues raised by theseregulations, this rule is issued in interim form and comments will beconsidered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, theDepartment encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do soat the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration oftheir views. The period for submission of comments will close May 24, 1996. TheDepartment will consider all comments received before the close of thecomment period in developing final regulations. Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but theirconsideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept publiccomments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material betreated confidentially because of its business proprietary nature orfor any other reason. The Department will return such comments andmaterials to the person submitting the comments and will not considerthem in the development of final regulations. All public comments onthese regulations will be a matter of public record and will beavailable for public inspection and copying. In the interest ofaccuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which willalso be a matter of public record and will be available for publicreview and copying. Communications from agencies of the United StatesGovernment or foreign governments will not be made available for publicinspection. The public record concerning these regulations will be maintainedin the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information RecordsInspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street andPennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20230. Records in thisfacility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizingthe substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied inaccordance with regulations published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Codeof Federal Regulations.[[Page 12734]]Information about the inspection and copying of records at the facilitymay be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export AdministrationFreedom of Information Officer, at the above address or by calling(202) 482-5653.List of Subjects15 CFR Part 730 Administrative practice and procedure, Advisory committees,Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Strategic and critical materials.15 CFR Part 732 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 734 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 736 Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 738 Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 740 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 742 Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 744 Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 746 Embargoes, Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.15 CFR Part 748 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 750 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 752 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 754 Exports, Foreign trade, Forests and forest products, Petroleum,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 756 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Penalties.15 CFR Part 758 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 760 Boycotts, Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.15 CFR Part 762 Administrative practice and procedure, Business and industry,Confidential business information, Exports, Foreign trade, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 764 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade, Lawenforcement, Penalties.15 CFR Part 766 Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential businessinformation, Exports, Foreign trade, Law enforcement, Penalties.15 CFR Part 768 Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.15 CFR Part 770 Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 772 Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 774 Exports, Foreign trade.

In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The EAR areissued by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of ExportAdministration (BXA) under laws relating to the control of certainexports, reexports, and activities. In addition, the EAR implementantiboycott law provisions requiring regulations to prohibit specifiedconduct by United States persons that has the effect of furthering orsupporting boycotts fostered or imposed by a country against a countryfriendly to United States. Supplement No. 1 to part 730 lists thecontrol numbers assigned to information collection requirements underthe EAR by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1995.Sec. 730.2 Statutory authority. The EAR have been designed primarily to implement the ExportAdministration Act of 1979, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. 2401-2420 (EAA).There are numerous other legal authorities underlying the EAR. Theseare listed in the Federal Register documents promulgating the EAR andat the beginning of each part of the EAR in the Code of FederalRegulations (CFR). From time to time, the President has exercisedauthority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act withrespect to the EAR (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706 (IEEPA)). The EAA is notpermanent legislation, and when it has lapsed, Presidential executiveorders under IEEPA have directed and authorized the continuation inforce of the EAR.Sec. 730.3 Dual use exports. The convenient term ``dual use'' is sometimes used to distinguishthe types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered bythe regulations of certain other U.S. government departments andagencies with export licensing responsibilities. In general, the termdual use serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be usedboth in military and other strategic uses (e.g., nuclear) andcommercial applications. In general, the term dual use serves todistinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in military andother strategic uses and in civil applications from those that areweapons and military related use or design and subject to the controlsof the Department of State or subject to the nuclear related controlsof the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Note,however, that although the short-hand term dual use may be employed torefer to the entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also apply to some itemsthat have solely civil uses.Sec. 730.4 Other control agencies and departments. In addition to the departments and agencies mentioned in Sec. 730.3of this part, other departments and agencies have jurisdiction overcertain narrower classes of exports and reexports. These include theDepartment of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), whichadministers controls against certain countries that are the object ofsanctions affecting not only exports and reexports, but also importsand financial dealings. For your convenience, Supplement No. 3 to part730 identifies other departments and agencies with regulatoryjurisdiction over certain types of exports and reexports. This is not acomprehensive list, and the brief descriptions are only generallyindicative of the types of controls administered and/or enforced byeach agency.Sec. 730.5 Coverage of more than exports. The core of the export control provisions of the EAR concernsexports from the United States. You will find, however, that someprovisions give broad meaning to the term ``export'', apply totransactions outside of the United States, or apply to activities otherthan exports. (a) Reexports. Commodities, software, and technology that have beenexported from the United States are generally subject to the EAR withrespect to reexport. Many such reexports, however, may go to manydestinations without a license or will qualify for an exception fromlicensing requirements. (b) Foreign products. In some cases, authorization to exporttechnology from the United States will be subject to assurances thatitems produced abroad that are the direct product of that technologywill not be exported to certain destinations without authorization fromBXA. (c) Scope of ``exports''. Certain actions that you might not regardas an ``export'' in other contexts do constitute an export subject tothe EAR. The release of technology to a foreign national in the UnitedStates through such means as demonstration or oral briefing is deemedan export. Other examples of exports under the EAR include the returnof foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair in theUnited States, shipments from a U.S. foreign trade zone, and theelectronic transmission of non-public data that will be receivedabroad. (d) U.S. person activities. To counter the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction, the EAR restrict the involvement of ``UnitedStates persons'' anywhere in the world in exports of foreign-originitems, or in providing services or support, that may contribute to suchproliferation.Sec. 730.6 Control purposes. The export control provisions of the EAR are intended to serve thenational security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short supplyinterests of the United States and, in some cases, to carry out itsinternational obligations. Some controls are designed to restrictaccess to dual use items by countries or persons that might apply suchitems to uses inimical to U.S. interests. These include controlsdesigned to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction andcontrols designed to limit the military and terrorism supportcapability of certain countries. The effectiveness of many of thecontrols under the EAR is enhanced by their being maintained as part ofmultilateral control arrangements. Multilateral export controlcooperation is sought through arrangements such as the NuclearSuppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the Missile TechnologyControl Regime. The EAR also include some export controls to protectthe United States from the adverse impact of the unrestricted export ofcommodities in short supply.Sec. 730.7 License requirements and exceptions. A relatively small percentage of exports and reexports subject tothe EAR require an application to BXA for a license. Many items are noton the Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to Sec. 774.1 ofthe EAR), or, if on the CCL, require a license to only a limited numberof countries. Other transactions may be covered by one or more of theLicense Exceptions in the EAR. In such cases no application need bemade to BXA.Sec. 730.8 How to proceed and where to get help. (a) How the EAR are organized. The Export AdministrationRegulations (EAR) are structured in a logical manner. In dealing withthe EAR you may find it helpful to be aware of the overall organizationof these regulations. In order to determine what the rules are and whatyou need to do, review the titles and the introductory sections of theparts of the EAR.[[Page 12736]] (1) How do you go about determining your obligations under the EAR?Part 732 of the EAR provides steps you may follow to determine yourobligations under the EAR. You will find guidance to enable you to tellwhether or not your transaction is subject to the EAR and, if it is,whether it qualifies for a License Exception or must be authorizedthrough issuance of a license. (2) Are your items or activities subject to the EAR at all? Part734 of the EAR defines the items and activities that are subject to theEAR. Note that the definition of ``items subject to the EAR'' includes,but is not limited to, items listed on the Commerce Control List inpart 774 of the EAR. (3) If subject to the EAR, what do the EAR require? Part 736 of theEAR lists all the prohibitions that are contained in the EAR. Note thatcertain prohibitions (General Prohibitions One through Three) apply toitems as indicated on the CCL, and others (General Prohibitions Fourthrough Ten) prohibit certain activities and apply to all items subjectto the EAR unless otherwise indicated. (4) Do you need a license for your item or activity? What policieswill BXA apply if you do need to submit license application? The EARhave four principal ways of describing license requirements: (i) The EAR may require a license to a country if your item islisted on the CCL and the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR tellsthat a license is required to that country. Virtually all ExportControl Classification Numbers (ECCN) on the CCL are covered by theCountry Chart in part 738 of the EAR. That part identifies the limitednumber of entries that are not included on the Chart. These ECCNs willstate the specific countries that require a license or refer you to aself-contained section, i.e., Short Supply in part 754 of the EAR, orEmbargoes in part 746 of the EAR. If a license is required, you shouldconsult part 740 of the EAR which describes the License Exception thatmay be available for items on the CCL. Part 742 of the EAR describesthe licensing policies that BXA will apply in reviewing an applicationyou file. Note that part 754 of the EAR on short supply controls andpart 746 on embargoes are self-contained parts that include theavailable exceptions and licensing policy. (ii) A license requirement may be based on the end-use or end-userin a transaction, primarily for proliferation reasons. Part 744 of theEAR describes such requirements and relevant licensing policies andincludes both restrictions on items and restrictions on the activitiesof U.S. persons. (iii) A license is required for virtually all exports to embargoeddestinations, such as Cuba. Part 746 of the EAR describes all thelicensing requirements, license review policies and License Exceptionsthat apply to such destinations. If your transaction involves one ofthese countries, you should first look at this part. This part alsodescribes controls that may be maintained under the EAR to implement UNsanctions. (iv) In addition, under Secs. 736.2(b)(9) and (10) of the EAR, youmay not engage in a transaction knowing a violation is about to occuror violate any orders, terms, and conditions under the EAR. Part 764 ofthe EAR describes prohibited transactions with a person denied exportprivileges or activity that violates the terms or conditions of adenial order. (5) How do you file a license application and what will happen tothe application once you do file it? What if you need authorization formultiple transactions? Parts 748 and 750 of the EAR provide informationon license submission and processing. Part 752 of the EAR provides fora Special Comprehensive License that authorizes multiple transactions.If your application is denied, part 756 of the EAR provides rules forfiling appeals. (6) How do you clear shipments with the U.S. Customs Service? Part758 of the EAR describes the requirements for clearance of exports. (7) Where do you find the rules on restrictive trade practices andboycotts? Part 760 of the EAR deals with restrictive trade practicesand boycotts. (8) Where are the rules on recordkeeping and enforcement? Part 762of the EAR sets out your recordkeeping requirements, and parts 764 and766 of the EAR deal with violations and enforcement proceedings. (9) What is the effect of foreign availability? Part 768 of the EARprovides rules for determining foreign availability of items subject tocontrols. (10) Do the EAR provide definitions and interpretations? Part 770of the EAR contains interpretations and part 772 of the EAR listsdefinitions used. (b) Why the EAR are so detailed. Some people will find the greatlength of the EAR and their extensive use of technical termsintimidating. BXA believes, however, that such detail and precision canand does serve the interests of the public. The detailed listing oftechnical parameters in the CCL establishes precise, objectivecriteria. This should, in most cases, enable you to ascertain theappropriate control status. Broader, more subjective criteria wouldleave exporters and reexporters more dependent upon interpretations andrulings by BXA officials. Moreover, much of the detail in the CCL isderived from multilaterally adopted lists, and the specificity servesto enhance the uniformity and effectiveness of international controlpractices and to promote a ``level playing field''. The detailedpresentation of such elements as licensing and export clearanceprocedures enables you to find in one place what you need to know tocomply with pertinent requirements. Of special importance is thedetailed listing of License Exception criteria, as these will enableyou to determine quickly, and with confidence, that you may proceedwith a transaction without delay. Finally, some of the detail resultsfrom the need to draft the EAR with care in order to avoid loop-holesand to permit effective enforcement. (c) Where to get help.

(a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR arereferences to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part is intendedto help you determine your obligations under the EAR by listing logicalsteps in Sec. 732.2 through Sec. 732.5 of this part that you can takein reviewing these regulations. By cross-references to the relevantprovisions of the EAR, this part describes the suggested steps for youto determine applicability of the following: (i) The scope of the EAR (part 734 of the EAR); (ii) Each of the general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR); (iii) The License Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR); and (iv) Other requirements such as clearing your export with the U.S.Customs Service, keeping records, and completing and documentinglicense applications. (2) These steps describe the organization of the EAR, therelationship among the provisions of the EAR, and the appropriate orderfor you to consider the various provisions of the EAR. (b) Facts about your transaction. The following five types of factsdetermine your obligations under the EAR and will be of help to you inreviewing these steps: (1) What is it? What an item is, for export control purposes,depends on its classification, which is its place on the CommerceControl List (see part 774 of the EAR). (2) Where is it going? The country of ultimate destination for anexport or reexport also determines licensing requirements (see parts738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the CommerceControl List). (3) Who will receive it? The ultimate end-user of your item cannotbe a bad end-user. See General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) inSec. 736.2(b)(4) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for a reference tothe list of persons you may not deal with. (4) What will they do with it? The ultimate end-use of your itemcannot be a bad end-use. See General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User) in Sec. 736.2(b)(5) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-useand end-user restrictions. (5) What else do they do? Conduct such as contracting, financing,and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project (asdescribed in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR) may prevent you from dealing withsomeone. (c) Are your items and activities subject to the EAR? You shouldfirst determine whether your commodity, software, or technology issubject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR concerning scope), andSteps 1 through 6 help you do that. For exports from the United States,only Steps 1 and 2 are relevant. If you already know that your item oractivity is subject to the EAR, you should go on to consider the tengeneral prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR. If your item or activityis not subject to the EAR, you have no obligations under the EAR andmay skip the remaining steps. (d) Does your item or activity require a license under one or moreof the ten general prohibitions? (1) Brief summary of the ten general prohibitions. The generalprohibitions are found in part 736 of the EAR and referred to in thesesteps. They consist, very briefly, of the following: (i) General Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports): Export andreexport of controlled items to listed countries. (ii) General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports):Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporatingmore than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content. (iii) General Prohibition Three (Foreign-produced Direct ProductReexports): Reexport and export from abroad of the foreign-produceddirect product of U.S. technology and software. (iv) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders): Engaging in actionsprohibited by a denial order. (v) General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User): Export or reexportto prohibited end-user or end-users. (vi) General Prohibition Six (Embargo): Export or reexport toembargoed destinations. (vii) General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person ProliferationActivity): Support of proliferation activities. (viii) General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit): In-transit shipmentsand items to be unladen from vessels and aircraft. (ix) General Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms and Conditions):Violation of any orders, terms, or conditions. (x) General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur):Proceeding with transactions with knowledge that a violation hasoccurred or is about to occur. (2) Controls on items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). If youritem or activity is subject to the EAR, you should determine whetherany one[[Page 12741]]or more of the ten general prohibitions require a license for yourexport, reexport, or activity. Steps 7 through 11 refer toclassification of your item on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (part774 of the EAR) and how to use the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 topart 738 of the EAR) to determine whether a license is required basedupon the classification of your item. These steps refer to GeneralProhibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and ComponentsReexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) forall countries except: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea. Forthese countries, you may skip Steps 7 through 11 and go directly toStep 12. (3) Controls on activities. Steps 12 through 18 refer to GeneralProhibitions Four through Ten. Those general prohibitions apply to allitems subject to the EAR, not merely those items listed on the CCL inpart 774 of the EAR. For example, they refer to the generalprohibitions for persons denied export privileges, prohibited end-usesand end-users, embargoed countries (e.g., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, andNorth Korea), prohibited activities of U.S. persons in support ofproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, prohibited unlading ofshipments, compliance with orders, terms and conditions, and activitieswhen a violation has occurred or is about to occur. (4) General prohibitions. If none of the ten general prohibitionsapplies, you should skip the steps concerning License Exceptions andfor exports from the United States, review Steps 27 through 29concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S.Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export controldocuments, and recordkeeping requirements. (e) Is a License Exception available to overcome the licenserequirement? If you decide by reviewing the CCL in combination with theCountry Chart that a license is required for your destination, youshould determine whether a License Exception will except you from thatrequirement. Steps 20 through 24 help you determine whether a LicenseException is available. Note that generally License Exceptions are notavailable to overcome General Prohibitions Four through Ten. However,selected License Exceptions for embargoed destinations are specified inpart 746 of the EAR and License Exceptions for short supply controlsare specified in part 754 of the EAR. If a License Exception isavailable and the export is from the United States, you should reviewSteps 26 through 28 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to befiled with the U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements forexport control documents and recordkeeping requirements. If a LicenseException is not available, go on to Steps 25 through 29. (f) How do you apply for a license? If you must file a licenseapplication, you should review the requirements of part 748 of the EARas suggested by Step 26. Then you should review Steps 27 through 29concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S.Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export controldocuments, and recordkeeping requirements.Sec. 732.2 Steps regarding scope of the EAR. Steps 1 through 6 aid you in determining the scope of the EAR. (a) Step 1: Items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of anotherFederal agency. This step is relevant for both exports and reexports.Determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction ofanother Federal Agency as provided in Sec. 734.3 of the EAR. (1) If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction ofanother Federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. Youneed not comply with the EAR and may skip the remaining steps. (2) If your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction ofanother federal agency, then proceed to Step 2 in paragraph (b) of thissection. (b) Step 2: Publicly available technology and software. This stepis relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine if yourtechnology or software is publicly available as defined and explainedat part 734 of the EAR. Supplement No. 1 to part 734 of the EARcontains several practical examples describing publicly availabletechnology and software that is outside the scope of the EAR. Theexamples are illustrative, not comprehensive. (1) If your technology or software is publicly available, andtherefore outside the scope of the EAR, you may proceed with the exportor reexport. You have no obligations under the EAR and need not complywith the EAR. You may skip the remaining steps. (2) If your technology or software is not publicly available andyou are exporting from the United States, skip to Step 7 inSec. 732.3(b) of this part concerning the general prohibitions. (3) If you are exporting items from a foreign country, you shouldthen proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (c) of this section and the othersteps concerning the scope of the EAR. (c) Step 3: Reexport of U.S.-origin items. This step is appropriateonly for reexporters. For an item in a foreign country, you shoulddetermine whether the item is of U.S. origin. If it is of U.S.-origin,skip to Step 7 in Sec. 732.3(b) of this part. If it is not of U.S.origin, then proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d) of this section. (d) Step 4: Foreign-made items incorporating less than the deminimis level of U.S. parts, components, and materials. This step isappropriate only for items that are made outside the United States. (1) For an item made in a foreign country, you should determinewhether controlled U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials areincorporated as provided in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR. Also, determine thevalue of the U.S.-origin controlled content as provided in SupplementNo. 2 to part 734 of the EAR. (2) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content,you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the CCL, determine thoseitems that would require a license from BXA for reexport to theultimate destination of the foreign-made product if such parts,components, or materials were reexported to that destination in theform received, and divide the total value of the controlled U.S. parts,components, and materials incorporated into the foreign-made item bythe sale price of the foreign-made item. (3) If no U.S. parts, components, or materials are incorporated orif the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are below thede minimis level described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the EAR by reason of the parts andcomponents rule, the classification of a foreign-made item isirrelevant in determining the scope of the EAR, and you should skipStep 4 and go on to consider Step 5 regarding the foreign-produceddirect product rule. (4) If controlled parts, components, or materials are incorporatedand are above the de minimis level, then you should go on to Step 5. (e) Step 5: Foreign-made items incorporating more than the deminimis level of U.S. parts, components, or materials. This step isappropriate only for foreign-made items incorporating certain U.S.parts. If the incorporated U.S. parts exceed the relevant de minimislevel, then your export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You thenshould skip to Step 7 at Sec. 732.3 of this part and consider the stepsregarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and otherrequirements.[[Page 12742]] (f) Step 6: Foreign-made items produced with certain U.S.technology for export to specified destinations. This step isappropriate for foreign-made items in foreign countries. (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on theCCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexportdestination for national security reasons, you should determine whetheryour item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-ProducedDirect Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item issubject to the EAR if it is captured by General Prohibition Three(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), and that prohibitionapplies if your transaction meets each of the following conditions: (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexportdestination for the direct product is Cuba, North Korea, Libya, or adestination in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 ofthe EAR) (reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported toother destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Three); (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct productssubject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used tocreate the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology orsoftware that was subject to the EAR and required a written assuranceas a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the useof License Exception TSR at Sec. 740.3(d) of the EAR (reexports offoreign-produced direct products created with other technology andsoftware are not subject to General Prohibition Three); and (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. Theforeign-produced direct products are subject to national securitycontrols as designated on the proper ECCN of the Commerce Control Listin part 774 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-produced direct productsnot subject to national security controls are not subject to GeneralProhibition Three). (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part740 of the EAR overcomes this General Prohibition Three if all termsand conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter orreexporter. (3) Subject to the EAR. If your item is captured by the foreign-produced direct product control at General Prohibition Three, then yourexport from abroad is subject to the EAR. You should next consider thesteps regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, andother requirements. If your item is not captured by General ProhibitionThree, then your export from abroad is not subject to the EAR. You havecompleted the steps necessary to determine whether your transaction issubject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps. Note that insummary, items in foreign countries are subject to the EAR when theyare: (i) U.S.-origin commodities, software and technology unlesscontrolled for export exclusively by another Federal agency or unlesspublicly available; (ii) Foreign-origin commodities, software, and technology that arewithin the scope of General Prohibition Two (Parts and ComponentsReexports), or General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced DirectProduct Reexports). (However, such foreign-made items are also outsidethe scope of the EAR if they are controlled for export exclusively byanother Federal agency or unless publicly available.)Sec. 732.3 Steps regarding the ten general prohibitions. (a) Introduction. If your item or activity is subject to the scopeof the EAR, you should then consider each of the ten generalprohibitions listed in part 736 of the EAR. General Prohibitions One((Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), andThree (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b) (1),(2), and (3) of the EAR) are product controls that are shaped andlimited by parameters specified on the CCL and Country Chart. GeneralProhibitions Four through Ten are prohibitions on certain activitiesthat are not allowed without authorization from BXA, and theseprohibitions apply to all items subject to the EAR unless otherwisespecified (Sec. 736.2(b) (4) through (10) of the EAR). (b) Step 7: Classification. (1) You should classify your items inthe relevant entry on the CCL, and you may do so on your own withoutthe assistance of BXA. You are responsible for doing so correctly, andyour failure to correctly classify your items does not relieve you ofthe obligation to obtain a license when one is required by the EAR. (2) You have a right to request the applicable classification ofyour item from BXA, and BXA has a duty to provide that classificationto you. For further information on how to obtain classificationassistance from BXA, see part 748 of the EAR. (3) For items subject to the EAR but not listed on the CCL, theproper classification is EAR99. This number is a ``basket'' for itemsnot specified under any CCL entry and appears at the end of eachCategory on the CCL. (c) Step 8: Country of ultimate destination. You should determinethe country of ultimate destination. The country of destinationdetermines the applicability of several general prohibitions, LicenseExceptions, and other requirements. Note that part 754 of the EARconcerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the onlylocation in the EAR that contains both the prohibitions and exceptionsapplicable to short supply controls. (d) Step 9: Reason for control and the Country Chart. (1) Reasonfor control and column identifier within the Export ControlClassification Number (ECCN). Once you have determined that your itemis controlled by a specific ECCN, you must use information contained inthe ``License Requirements'' section of that ECCN in combination withthe Country Chart to decide whether a license is required under GeneralProhibitions One, Two, or Three to a particular destination. The CCLand the Country Chart are taken together to define these licenserequirements. The applicable ECCN will indicate the reason or reasonsfor control for items within that ECCN. For example, ECCN 6A007 iscontrolled for national security, missile technology, and anti-terrorism reasons. (2) Reason for control within the Country Chart. With each of theapplicable Country Chart column identifiers noted in the correct ECCN,turn to the Country Chart. Locate the correct Country Chart columnidentifier on the horizontal axis, and determine whether an ``X'' ismarked in the cell next to the destination in question. ConsultSec. 738.4 of the EAR for comprehensive instructions on using theCountry Chart and a detailed example. (i) An ``X'' in the cell or cells for the relevant country andreason(s) for control column indicates that a license is required forGeneral Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received),Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-ProducedDirect Product Reexports). (See Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)of the EAR). (ii) If one or more cells have an ``X'' in the relevant column, alicense is required unless you qualify for a License Exceptiondescribed in part 740 of the EAR. If a cell does not contain an ``X''for your destination in one or more relevant columns, a license is notrequired under the CCL and the Country Chart. (iii) Additional controls may apply to your export. You must go onto steps 12 through 18 described in paragraphs (g) to (m) of thissection to determine[[Page 12743]]whether additional limits described in General Prohibition Two (Partsand Components Reexports) and General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports ) apply to your proposed transaction.If you are exporting an item from the United States, you should skipStep 10 and Step 11. Proceed directly to Step 12 in paragraph (g) ofthis section. (3) License requirements not on the Country Chart. There are twoinstances where the Country Chart cannot be used to determine if alicense is required. Items controlled for short supply reasons are notgoverned by the Country Chart. Part 754 of the EAR contains licenserequirements and License Exceptions for items subject to short supplycontrols. A limited number of ECCNs contained on the CCL do notidentify a Country Chart column identifier. In these instances, theECCN states whether a license is required and for which destinations.See Sec. 738.3(a) of the EAR for a list of the ECCNs for which you donot need to consult the Country Chart to determine licensingrequirements. (4) Destinations subject to embargo provisions. The Country Chartdoes not apply to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea; and forthose countries you should review the embargo provisions at part 746 ofthe EAR and may skip this step concerning the Country Chart. ForAngola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Rwanda, and Serbia and Montenegrothe Country Chart provides for certain license requirements, and part746 of the EAR provides additional requirements. (5) Items subject to the EAR but not on the CCL. Items subject tothe EAR that are not on the CCL are properly classified EAR99. For suchitems, you may skip this step and proceed directly with Step 12 inparagraph (g) of this section. (e) Step 10: Foreign-made items incorporating U.S.-origin items andthe de minimis rule. (1) Parts and components rule. The followingconsiderations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same stepsnecessary to determine whether a foreign-made item incorporating U.S.parts, components, or materials is subject to the EAR. If your foreign-made item is described in an entry on the CCL and the Country Chartrequires a license to your export or reexport destination, you shoulddetermine whether the controlled U.S.-origin commodities, software, ortechnology incorporated into the foreign-made item exceeds the deminimis level applicable to the ultimate destination of the foreign-made item, as follows: (i) A 10% de minimis level to embargoed and terrorist-supportingcountries; or (ii) A 25% de minimis level to all other countries. (2) Guidance for calculations. For guidance on how to calculate theU.S.-controlled content, refer to Supplement No. 2 to part 734 of theEAR. Note that certain rules issued by the Office of Foreign AssetsControl, certain exports from abroad by U.S.-owned or controlledentities may be prohibited notwithstanding the de minimis provisions ofthe EAR. In addition, the de minimis exclusions from the parts andcomponents rule do not relieve U.S. persons of the obligation torefrain from supporting the proliferation of weapons of mass-destruction and missiles as provided in General Prohibition Seven (U.S.Person Proliferation Activity) described in Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of theEAR. (f) Step 11: Foreign-produced direct product. The followingconsiderations are appropriate for items abroad and are the sameconsiderations necessary to determine whether a foreign-produced directproduct is subject to the EAR under Step 6 in Sec. 732.2(f) of thispart. (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on theCCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexportdestination for national security reasons, you must determine whetheryour item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-ProducedDirect Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item issubject to this general prohibition if your transaction meets each ofthe following conditions: (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexportdestination for the direct product is Cuba, Libya, North Korea, or adestination in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 ofthe EAR) (reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported toother destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Threedescribed in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR); (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct productssubject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used tocreate the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology orsoftware that was subject to the EAR and required a written assuranceas a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the useof License Exception TSR described Sec. 740.19 of the EAR (reexports offoreign-produced direct products created with other technology andsoftware are not subject to General Prohibition Three); and (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. Theforeign-produced direct products are controlled for national securityreasons indicated in an ECCN on the CCL (reexports of foreign-produceddirect products not subject to national security controls are notsubject to General Prohibition Three). (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part740 of the EAR overcomes General Prohibition Three (Foreign-ProducedDirect Product Reexports) if all terms and conditions of a givenLicense Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter. (g) Step 12: Persons denied export privileges. (1) Determinewhether your transferee, ultimate end-user, any intermediate consignee,or any other party to a transaction is a person denied exportprivileges. (See part 764 of the EAR). While it is not a violation ofGeneral Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) (Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR)to fail to check the Denied Persons List prior to a transfer, it isnonetheless a violation of the EAR to engage in any activity thatviolates the terms or conditions of a denial order. General ProhibitionFour (Denial Orders) applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. bothitems on the CCL and within EAR99. (2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Four(Denial Orders). The prohibition concerning persons denied exportprivileges may be overcome only by a specific authorization from BXA,something that is rarely granted. (h) STEP 13: Prohibited end-uses and end-users. (1) Review the end-uses and end-users prohibited under General Prohibition Five (End-Useand End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part 744 ofthe EAR. Part 744 of the EAR contains all the end-use and end-userlicense requirements, and those are in addition to the licenserequirements under General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports),Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-producedDirect Product Reexports). Unless otherwise indicated, the licenserequirements of General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User)described in part 744 of the EAR apply to all items subject to the EAR,i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99. Moreover, the requirementsof General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) are in addition tovarious end-use and end-user limitations placed on certain LicenseExceptions. (2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Five(End-Use and End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part740 of the EAR. (i) Step 14: Embargoed countries and special destinations. If yourdestination for any item is Bosnia-Herzegovina,[[Page 12744]]Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Rwanda, or Serbia andMontenegro, you must consider the requirements of part 746 of the EAR.Unless otherwise indicated, General Prohibition Six (Embargo) appliesto all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and withinEAR99. You may not make an export or reexport contrary to theprovisions of part 746 of the EAR without a license unless: (1) You are exporting or reexporting only publicly availabletechnology or software or other items outside the scope of the EAR, or (2) You qualify for a License Exception referenced in part 746 ofthe EAR concerning embargoed destinations. You may not use a LicenseException described in part 740 of the EAR to overcome GeneralProhibition Six (Embargo) (Sec. 736.2(b)(6) of the EAR) unless it isspecifically authorized in part 746 of the EAR. Note that part 754 ofthe EAR concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is theonly location in the EAR for both the prohibitions and exceptionsapplicable to short supply controls. (j) Step 15: Proliferation activity of U.S. persons unrelated toexports and reexports. (1) Review the scope of activity prohibited byGeneral Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation Activity)(Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR) as that activity is described inSec. 744.6 of the EAR. Keep in mind that such activity is not limitedto exports and reexports and is not limited to items subject to GeneralProhibition One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and ComponentsReexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports).Moreover, such activity extends to services and dealing in whollyforeign-origin items in support of the specified proliferation activityand is not limited to items listed on the CCL or included in EAR99. (2) Review the definition of U.S. Person in part 744 of the EAR. (k) Step 16: In-transit. Shippers and operators of vessels oraircraft should review General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit) todetermine the countries in which you may not unladen or ship certainitems in-transit. General Prohibition Eight applies to all itemssubject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99. (l) Step 17: Review orders, terms, and conditions. Review theorders, terms, and conditions applicable to your transaction. GeneralProhibition Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions) prohibits theviolation of any orders, terms, and conditions imposed under the EAR.Terms and conditions are frequently contained in licenses. In addition,the ten general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR) and the LicenseExceptions (part 740 of the EAR) impose terms and conditions orlimitations on your proposed transactions and use of LicenseExceptions. A given license or License Exception may not be used unlesseach relevant term or condition is met. (m) Step 18: Review the ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and GeneralProhibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur). License requirementsunder the EAR are determined solely by the classification, end-use,end-user, ultimate destination, and conduct of U.S. persons. SupplementNo. 1 to part 732 of the EAR is intended to provide helpful guidanceregarding the process for the evaluation of information aboutcustomers, end-uses, and end-users. General Prohibition Ten (KnowledgeViolation to Occur) prohibits anyone from proceeding with a transactionwith knowledge that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about tooccur. It also prohibits related shipping, financing, and otherservices. General Prohibition Ten applies to all items subject to theEAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99. (n) Step 19: Complete the review of the general prohibitions. Aftercompletion of Steps described in this section and review of all tengeneral prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR, including cross-referencedregulations in the EAR, you will know which, if any, of the ten generalprohibitions of the EAR apply to you and your contemplated transactionor activity. (1) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to yourexport from the United States, no license from BXA is required, you donot need to qualify for a License Exception under part 740 of the EAR.You should skip the Steps in Sec. 732.4 of this part regarding LicenseExceptions and proceed directly to the Steps in Sec. 732.5 of this partregarding recordkeeping, clearing the U.S. Customs Service with theappropriate Shipper's Export Declaration, and using the requiredDestination Control Statement. (2) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to yourreexport or export from abroad, no license is required and you shouldskip all remaining Steps. (3) If one or more of the ten general prohibitions are applicable,continue with the remaining steps.Sec. 732.4 Steps regarding License Exceptions. (a) Introduction to Steps for License Exceptions. If your export orreexport is subject to the EAR and is subject to General ProhibitionsOne (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), orThree (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), consider the stepslisted in paragraph (b) of this section. If your export or reexport issubject to General Prohibitions Four (Denial Orders), Seven (U.S.Person Proliferation Activity), Eight (In-Transit), Nine (Orders,Terms, and Conditions), or Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur), thereare no License Exceptions available for your export or reexport. Ifyour export is subject to General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User),consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject toGeneral Prohibition Six (Embargo), consult part 746 of the EAR forapplicable License Exceptions. (b) Steps for License Exceptions. (1) Step 20: Applicability ofGeneral Prohibitions. Determine whether any one or more of the generalprohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of the EAR apply to your exportor reexport. If no general prohibition applies to your export orreexport, then you may proceed with your export or reexport and neednot review part 740 of the EAR regarding License Exceptions. You arereminded of your recordkeeping obligations related to the clearance ofthe U.S. Customs Service provided in parts 762 and 758 of the EAR. (2) Step 21: Applicability of restrictions on all LicenseExceptions. Determine whether any one or more of the restrictions inSec. 740.2 of the EAR applies to your export or reexport. If any one ormore of these restrictions apply, there are no License Exceptionsavailable to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain fromthe export or reexport. (3) Step 22: Terms and conditions of the License Exceptions. (i) Ifnone of the restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies, then revieweach of the License Exceptions to determine whether any one of themauthorizes your export or reexport. Eligibility for License Exceptionsis based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use,and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within aspecific License Exception. (ii) You may meet the conditions for more than one LicenseException. Moreover, although you may not qualify for some LicenseExceptions you may qualify for others. Review the broadest LicenseExceptions first, and use any License Exception available to you. Youare not required to use the most restrictive applicable LicenseException. If you fail to qualify for the License Exception that youfirst consider, you may consider any other License[[Page 12745]]Exception until you have determined that no License Exception isavailable. (iii) License Exception groupings TMP, RPL, BAG, AVS, GOV, and TSUauthorize exports notwithstanding the provisions of the CCL. LicenseExceptions in the list-based grouping (LST) are available only to theextent specified on the CCL. Part 740 of the EAR provides authorizationfor reexports only to the extent each License Exception expresslyauthorizes reexports. License Exception APR authorizes reexports only. (4) Step 23: Scope of License Exceptions. Some License Exceptionsare limited by country or by type of item. (i) Countries are arranged in country groups for ease of reference.For a listing of country groups, please refer to Supplement No. 1 topart 740 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated in a License Exception,License Exceptions do not apply to any exports or reexports toembargoed destinations. If your export or reexport is subject toGeneral Prohibition Six (Embargo) for embargoed destinations, LicenseExceptions are only available to the extent specifically provided inpart 746 of the EAR concerning embargoed destinations. (ii) Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. NoLicense Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR may be used foritems listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons. LicenseExceptions for short supply items are found in part 754 of the EAR. (5) Step 24: Compliance with all terms and conditions. If a LicenseException is available, you may proceed with your export or reexport.However, you must meet all the terms and conditions required by theLicense Exception that you determined authorized your export orreexport. You must also consult part 758 and 762 of the EAR todetermine your recordkeeping and documentation requirements. (6) Step 25: License requirements. If no License Exception isavailable, then you must either obtain a license before proceeding withyour export or reexport or you must refrain from the proposed export orreexport. (7) Step 26: License applications. If you are going to file alicense application with BXA, you should first review the requirementsat part 748 of the EAR. Exporters, reexporters, and exporters fromabroad should review the instructions concerning applications andrequired support documents prior to submitting an application for alicense.Sec. 732.5 Steps regarding Shipper's Export Declaration, DestinationControl Statements, record keeping, license applications, and otherrequirements. (a) Step 27--Shipper's Export Declaration. You should reviewSec. 758.3 of the EAR to determine what notations you must enter on theShipper's Export Declaration (SED). These steps should be reviewed byexporters. Reexporters and firms exporting from abroad may skip Steps27 through 29 and proceed directly to Sec. 732.6 of this part. (1) NLR. The term ``NLR'' represents exports of listed items whenno license is required. Such exports do not require that you qualifyfor a License Exception. The symbol ``NLR'' is required on the SEDunder two circumstances. First, NLR is the correct symbol whenexporting an item subject to the EAR not listed on the CCL. Such itemsare classified EAR99. Secondly, certain items are listed on the CCL butdo not require a license to all destinations under General ProhibitionsOne (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts andComponents Reexports), or Three (Foreign-Produced Direct ProductReexports) (Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of the EAR). Suchitems do not have an ``X'' in the appropriate cell on the CountryChart. If General Prohibitions Four through Ten (Sec. 736.2 (b)(4) ofthe EAR) through (b)(10) of the EAR) also do not apply, you must clearexports of such items by entering the symbol ``NLR'' in the appropriateplace on the SED. (2) License Exception group symbol. You must enter on any requiredSED the letter code (e.g., LST, TMP) of the group of License Exceptionsunder which you are exporting. In the case of License Exceptionsgrouped under LST, the ECCN of the item being exported must also beentered when an SED is required. Please refer to Sec. 758.3 of the EARfor detailed information on use of SEDs. (3) License number. If you are exporting under a license, enter thelicense number on the SED as required by Sec. 758.3 of the EAR. (b) Step 28: Destination Control Statement. You are required toenter an appropriate Destination Control Statement (DCS) on commercialdocuments in accordance with the DCS requirements of Sec. 758.6 of theEAR. Exporters should review Sec. 758.6 of the EAR and use the DCS asrequired. Reexporters and exporters from abroad should reviewSec. 752.6 for DCS requirements when using a Special ComprehensiveLicense. Otherwise, DCS requirements do not apply to reexports andexports from abroad. (c) Step 29: Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involvingexports under any license or License Exception must be maintained inaccordance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.Sec. 732.6 Steps for other requirements. Sections 732.1 through 732.4 of this part are useful in determiningthe license requirements that apply to you. Other portions of the EARimpose other obligations and requirements. Some of them are: (a) Requirements relating to the use of a license in Sec. 758.2 ofthe EAR. (b) Obligations of carriers, forwarders, exporters and others totake specific steps and prepare and deliver certain documents to assurethat items subject to the EAR are delivered to the destination to whichthey are licensed or authorized by a License Exception or some otherprovision of the regulations in Sec. 758.4 through Sec. 758.6 of theEAR. (c) Duty of carriers to return or unload shipments at the directionof U.S. Government officials (see Sec. 758.8 of the EAR). (d) Specific obligations imposed on parties to SpecialComprehensive licenses in part 752 of the EAR. (e) Recordkeeping requirements imposed in part 762 of the EAR. (f) Requirements of part 764 of the EAR to disclose facts that maycome to your attention after you file a license application or makeother statements to the government concerning a transaction or proposedtransaction that is subject to the EAR. (g) Certain obligations imposed by part 760 of the EAR on partieswho receive requests to take actions related to foreign boycotts andprohibits certain actions relating to those boycotts.Supplement No. 1--BXA's ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and RedFlags``Know Your Customer'' Guidance Various requirements of the EAR are dependent upon a person'sknowledge of the end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, or otherfacts relating to a transaction or activity. These provisionsinclude the nonproliferation-related ``catch-all'' sections and theprohibition against proceeding with a transaction with knowledgethat a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to occur. (a) BXA provides the following guidance on how individuals andfirms should act under this knowledge standard. This guidance doesnot change or interpret the EAR. (1) Decide whether there are ``red flags''. Take into accountany abnormal circumstances in a transaction that indicate that theexport may be destined for an inappropriate end-use, end-user, ordestination. Such circumstances are referred to as ``red flags''.Included among examples[[Page 12746]]of red flags are orders for items that are inconsistent with theneeds of the purchaser, a customer declining installation andtesting when included in the sales price or when normally requested,or requests for equipment configurations that are incompatible withthe stated destination (e.g., 120 volts in a country with 220volts). Commerce has developed lists of such red flags that are notall-inclusive but are intended to illustrate the types ofcircumstances that should cause reasonable suspicion that atransaction will violate the EAR. (2) If there are ``red flags'', inquire. If there are no ``redflags'' in the information that comes to your firm, you should beable to proceed with a transaction in reliance on information youhave received. That is, absent ``red flags'' (or an expressrequirement in the EAR), there is no affirmative duty upon exportersto inquire, verify, or otherwise ``go behind'' the customer'srepresentations. However, when ``red flags'' are raised ininformation that comes to your firm, you have a duty to check outthe suspicious circumstances and inquire about the end-use, end-user, or ultimate country of destination. The duty to check out``red flags'' is not confined to the use of License Exceptionsaffected by the ``know'' or ``reason to know'' language in the EAR.Applicants for licenses are required by part 748 of the EAR toobtain documentary evidence concerning the transaction, andmisrepresentation or concealment of material facts is prohibited,both in the licensing process and in all export control documents.You can rely upon representations from your customer and repeat themin the documents you file unless red flags oblige you to takeverification steps. (3) Do not self-blind. Do not cut off the flow of informationthat comes to your firm in the normal course of business. Forexample, do not instruct the sales force to tell potential customersto refrain from discussing the actual end-use, end-user, andultimate country of destination for the product your firm is seekingto sell. Do not put on blinders that prevent the learning ofrelevant information. An affirmative policy of steps to avoid``bad'' information would not insulate a company from liability, andit would usually be considered an aggravating factor in anenforcement proceeding. (4) Employees need to know how to handle ``red flags''.Knowledge possessed by an employee of a company can be imputed to afirm so as to make it liable for a violation. This makes itimportant for firms to establish clear policies and effectivecompliance procedures to ensure that such knowledge abouttransactions can be evaluated by responsible senior officials.Failure to do so could be regarded as a form of self-blinding. (5) Reevaluate all the information after the inquiry. Thepurpose of this inquiry and reevaluation is to determine whether the``red flags'' can be explained or justified. If they can, you mayproceed with the transaction. If the ``red flags'' cannot beexplained or justified and you proceed, you run the risk of havinghad ``knowledge'' that would make your action a violation of theEAR. (6) Refrain from the transaction or advise BXA and wait. If youcontinue to have reasons for concern after your inquiry, then youshould either refrain from the transaction or submit all therelevant information to BXA in the form of an application for avalidated license or in such other form as BXA may specify. (b) Industry has an important role to play in preventing exportsand reexports contrary to the national security and foreign policyinterests of the United States. BXA will continue to work inpartnership with industry to make this front line of defenseeffective, while minimizing the regulatory burden on exporters. Ifyou have any question about whether you have encountered a ``redflag'', you may contact the Office of Export Enforcement at 1-800-424-2980 or the Office of Exporter Services at (202) 482-4532.Red Flags Possible indicators that an unlawful diversion might be plannedby your customer include the following: 1. The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offerinformation about the end-use of a product. 2. The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line ofbusiness; for example, a small bakery places an order for severalsophisticated lasers. 3. The product ordered is incompatible with the technical levelof the country to which the product is being shipped. For example,semiconductor manufacturing equipment would be of little use in acountry without an electronics industry. 4. The customer has little or no business background. 5. The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive itemwhen the terms of the sale call for financing. 6. The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performancecharacteristics but still wants the product. 7. Routine installation, training or maintenance services aredeclined by the customer. 8. Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-of-the-way destinations. 9. A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's finaldestination. 10. The shipping route is abnormal for the product anddestination. 11. Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipmentor destination. 12. When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear aboutwhether the purchased product is for domestic use, export orreexport.PART 734--SCOPE OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONSSec.734.1 Introduction.734.2 Important EAR terms and principles.734.3 Items subject to the EAR.734.4 De minimis U.S. content.734.5 Activities of U.S. and foreign persons subject to the EAR.734.6 Assistance available from BXA for determining licensing andother requirements.734.7 Published information and software.734.8 Information resulting from fundamental research.734.9 Educational information.734.10 Patent applications.734.11 Government-sponsored research covered by contract controls.734.12 Effect on foreign laws and regulations.Supplement No. 1 to Part 734--Questions and Answers--Technology andSoftware Subject to the EARSupplement No. 2 to Part 734--Calculation of Values for DE MINIMISRules Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60FR 42767, August 17, 1995).Sec. 734.1 Introduction. (a) In this part, references to the Export AdministrationRegulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.This part describes the scope of the Export Administration Regulations(EAR) and explains certain key terms and principles used in the EAR.This part provides the rules you need to use to determine whether itemsand activities are subject to the EAR. This part is the first step indetermining your obligations under the EAR. If your item or activity isnot subject to the EAR, then you do not have any obligations under theEAR and you do not need to review other parts of the EAR. If youalready know that your item or activity is subject to the EAR, you donot need to review this part and you can go on to review other parts ofthe EAR to determine your obligations. This part also describes certainkey terms and principles used in the EAR. Specifically, it includes thefollowing terms: ``subject to the EAR,'' ``items subject to the EAR,''``export,'' and ``reexport.'' These and other terms are also includedin part 772 of the EAR, Definitions of Terms, and you should consultpart 772 of the EAR for the meaning of terms used in the EAR. Finally,this part makes clear that compliance with the EAR does not relieve anyobligations imposed under foreign laws. (b) This part does not address any of the provisions set forth inpart 760 of the EAR, Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts. (c) This part does not define the scope of legal authority toregulate exports, including reexports, or activities found in theExport Administration Act and other statutes. What this part does do isset forth the extent to which such legal authority has been exercisedthrough the EAR.Sec. 734.2 Important EAR terms and principles. (a) Subject to the EAR--Definition. (1) ``Subject to the EAR'' is aterm used in the EAR to describe those items and[[Page 12747]]activities over which BXA exercises regulatory jurisdiction under theEAR. Conversely, items and activities that are not subject to the EARare outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the EAR and are not affectedby these regulations. The items and activities subject to the EAR aredescribed in Sec. 734.2 through Sec. 734.5 of this part. You shouldreview the Commerce Control List (CCL) and any applicable parts of theEAR to determine whether an item or activity is subject to the EAR.However, if you need help in determining whether an item or activity issubject to the EAR, see Sec. 734.6 of this part. Publicly availabletechnology and software not subject to the EAR are described inSec. 734.7 through Sec. 734.11 and Supplement No. 1 to this part. (2) Items and activities subject to the EAR may also be controlledunder export-related programs administered by other agencies. Items andactivities subject to the EAR are not necessarily exempted from thecontrol programs of other agencies. Although BXA and other agenciesthat maintain controls for national security and foreign policy reasonstry to minimize overlapping jurisdiction, you should be aware that insome instances you may have to comply with more than one regulatoryprogram. (3) The term ``subject to the EAR'' should not be confused withlicensing or other requirements imposed in other parts of the EAR. Justbecause an item or activity is subject to the EAR does not mean that alicense or other requirement automatically applies. A license or otherrequirement applies only in those cases where other parts of the EARimpose a licensing or other requirement on such items or activities. (b) Export and reexport. (1) Definition of export. ``Export'' meansan actual shipment or transmission of items subject to the EAR out ofthe United States; or release of technology or software subject to theEAR to a foreign national in the United States, as described inparagraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See part 772 of the EAR for thedefinition that applies to exports of satellites subject to the EAR. (2) Export of technology or software. ``Export'' of technology orsoftware includes: (i) Any release of technology or software subject to the EAR in aforeign country; or (ii) Any release of technology or source code subject to the EAR toa foreign national. Such release is deemed to be an export to the homecountry or countries of the foreign national. This deemed export ruledoes not apply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence inthe United States and does not apply to persons who are protectedindividuals under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C.1324b(a)(3)). Note that the release of any item to any party withknowledge a violation is about to occur is prohibited bySec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR. (3) Definition of ``release'' of technology or software. Technologyor software is ``released'' for export through: (i) Visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-origin equipmentand facilities; (ii) Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad;or (iii) The application to situations abroad of personal knowledge ortechnical experience acquired in the United States. (4) Definition of reexport. ``Reexport'' means an actual shipmentor transmission of items subject to the EAR from one foreign country toanother foreign country; or release of technology or software subjectto the EAR to a foreign national outside the United States, asdescribed in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. See part 772 of the EARfor the definition that applies to reexports of satellites subject tothe EAR. (5) Reexport of technology or software. Any release of technologyor source code subject to the EAR to a foreign national of anothercountry is a deemed reexport to the home country or countries of theforeign national. However, this deemed reexport definition does notapply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The term``release'' is defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Note thatthe release of any item to any party with knowledge or reason to know aviolation is about to occur is prohibited by Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of theEAR. (6) For purposes of the EAR, the export or reexport of itemssubject to the EAR that will transit through a country or countries orbe transshipped in a country or countries to a new country or areintended for reexport to the new country, are deemed to be exports tothe new country. (7) If a territory, possession, or department of a foreign countryis not listed on the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 ofthe EAR, the export or reexport of items subject to the EAR to suchdestination is deemed under the EAR to be an export to the foreigncountry. For example, a shipment to the Cayman Islands, a dependentterritory of the United Kingdom, is deemed to be a shipment to theUnited Kingdom. (8) Export or reexport of items subject to the EAR does not includeshipments among any of the states of the United States, theCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the NorthernMariana Islands or any territory, dependency, or possession of theUnited States. These destinations are listed in Schedules C & E,Classification of Country and Territory Designations for U.S. ExportStatistics, issued by the Bureau of the Census.Sec. 734.3 Items subject to the EAR. (a) Except for items excluded in paragraph (b) of this section, thefollowing items are subject to the EAR: (1) All items in the United States, including in a U.S. ForeignTrade Zone or moving intransit through the United States from oneforeign country to another; (2) All U.S. origin items wherever located; (3) U.S. origin parts, components, materials or other commoditiesincorporated abroad into foreign-made products, U.S. origin softwarecommingled with foreign software, and U.S. origin technology commingledwith foreign technology, in quantities exceeding de minimis levels asdescribed in Sec. 734.4 and Supplement No. 2 of this part; (4) Certain foreign-made direct products of U.S. origin technologyor software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR. The term``direct product'' means the immediate product (including processes andservices) produced directly by the use of technology or software; and (5) Certain commodities produced by any plant or major component ofa plant located outside the United States that is a direct product ofU.S.-origin technology or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) ofthe EAR. (b) The following items are not subject to the EAR: (1) Items that are exclusively controlled for export or reexport bythe following departments and agencies of the U.S. Government whichregulate exports or reexports for national security or foreign policypurposes: (i) Department of State. The International Traffic in ArmsRegulations (22 CFR part 121) administered by the Office of DefenseTrade Controls relate to defense articles and defense services on theU.S. Munitions List. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22U.S.C. 2778). (ii) Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Regulations administered by OFAC implement broad controls and embargotransactions with certain foreign countries. These regulations includecontrols on exports and reexports to[[Page 12748]]certain countries (31 CFR chapter V). Trading with the Enemy Act (50U.S.C. app. section 1 et seq.), and International Emergency EconomicPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.) (iii) U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Regulationsadministered by NRC control the export and reexport of commoditiesrelated to nuclear reactor vessels (10 CFR part 110). Atomic Energy Actof 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. part 2011 et seq.). (iv) Department of Energy (DOE). Regulations administered by DOEcontrol the export and reexport of technology related to the productionof special nuclear materials (10 CFR part 810). Atomic Energy Act of1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 2011 et seq.). (v) Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Regulations administered byPTO provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassifiedtechnology in the form of a patent application or an amendment,modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof (37 CFR part5). BXA has delegated authority under the Export Administration Act tothe PTO to approve exports and reexports of such technology which issubject to the EAR. Exports and reexports of such technology notapproved under PTO regulations must comply with the EAR. (2) Prerecorded phonograph records reproducing in whole or in part,the content of printed books, pamphlets, and miscellaneouspublications, including newspapers and periodicals; printed books,pamphlets, and miscellaneous publications including bound newspapersand periodicals; children's picture and painting books; newspaper andperiodicals, unbound, excluding waste; music books; sheet music;calendars and calendar blocks, paper; maps, hydrographical charts,atlases, gazetteers, globe covers, and globes (terrestrial andcelestial); exposed and developed microfilm reproducing, in whole or inpart, the content of any of the above; exposed and developed motionpicture film and soundtrack; and advertising printed matter exclusivelyrelated thereto. (3) Publicly available technology and software that: (i) Are already published or will be published as described inSec. 734.7 of this part; (ii) Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, asdescribed in Sec. 734.8 of this part; (iii) Are educational, as described in Sec. 734.9 of this part; or (iv) Are included in certain patent applications, as described inSec. 734.10 of this part. (4) Foreign made items that have de minimis U.S. content based onthe principles described in Sec. 734.4 of this part. (c) ``Items subject to the EAR'' consist of the items listed on theCommerce Control List (CCL) in part 774 of the EAR and all other itemswhich meet the definition of that term. For ease of reference andclassification purposes, items subject to the EAR which are not listedon the CCL are designated as ``EAR99.''Sec. 734.4 De minimis U.S. content. (a) There is no de minimis level for the export from a foreigncountry of a foreign-made computer exceeding 7000 MTOPS containingU.S.-origin controlled semiconductors (other than memory circuits)classified under ECCN 3A001 or high speed interconnect devices (ECCN4A003.g) to Computer Tier 3 and 4 countries described in Sec. 742.12 ofthe EAR. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certaincomputers, for embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR, and forcountries named as terrorist-supporting countries in part 744 of theEAR, the following are not subject to the EAR: (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlledU.S.-origin commodities valued at 10% or less of the total value of theforeign-made commodity; (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlledU.S.-origin software valued at 10% or less of the total value of theforeign-made software; or (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn fromcontrolled U.S. origin technology valued at 10% or less of the totalvalue of the foreign technology. (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certaincomputers, for all other countries not included in paragraph (b) ofthis section, the following are not subject to the EAR: (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlledU.S.-origin commodities valued at 25% or less of the total value of theforeign-made commodity; (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlledU.S.-origin software valued at 25% or less of the total value of theforeign-made software; or (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn fromcontrolled U.S.-origin technology valued at 25% or less of the totalvalue of the foreign technology. (d) For purposes of determining de minimis levels, technology andsource code used to design or produce foreign-made commodities orsoftware are not considered to be incorporated into such foreign-madecommodities or software. Commodities subject only to short supplycontrols are not included in calculating U.S. content. (e) You are responsible for making the necessary calculations todetermine whether the de minimis provisions apply to your situation.See Supplement No. 2 to part 734 for guidance regarding calculation ofU.S. controlled content. (f) See Sec. 770.3 of the EAR for principles that apply tocommingled U.S.-origin technology and software.Sec. 734.5 Activities of U.S. and foreign persons subject to the EAR. The following kinds of activities are subject to the EAR: (a) Certain activities of U.S. persons related to the proliferationof chemical or biological weapons or of missile technology as describedin Sec. 744.6 of the EAR. (b) Activities of U.S. or foreign persons prohibited by any orderissued under the EAR, including a Denial Order issued pursuant to part766 of the EAR.Sec. 734.6 Assistance available from BXA for determining licensing andother requirements. (a) If you are not sure whether a commodity, software, technology,or activity is subject to the EAR, or is subject to licensing or otherrequirements under the EAR, you may ask BXA for an advisory opinion,classification, or a determination whether a particular item oractivity is subject to the EAR. In many instances, including thosewhere the item is specially designed, developed, configured, adapted,or modified for military application, the item may fall under thelicensing jurisdiction of the Department of State and may be subject tothe controls of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFRparts 120 through 130) (ITAR). In order to determine if the Departmentof State has licensing jurisdiction over an item, you should submit arequest for a commodity jurisdiction determination to the Department ofState, Office of Defense Trade Controls. Exporters should note that ina very limited number of cases, the categories of items may be subjectto both the ITAR and the EAR. The relevant departments are working toeliminate any unnecessary overlaps that may exist. (b) As the agency responsible for administering the EAR, BXA is theonly agency that has the responsibility for determining whether an itemor activity[[Page 12749]]is subject to the EAR and, if so, what licensing or other requirementsapply under the EAR. Such a determination only affects EARrequirements, and does not affect the applicability of any otherregulatory programs. (c) If you need help in determining BXA licensing or otherrequirements you may ask BXA for help by following the proceduresdescribed in Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.Sec. 734.7 Published information and software. (a) Information is ``published'' when it becomes generallyaccessible to the interested public in any form, including: (1) Publication in periodicals, books, print, electronic, or anyother media available for general distribution to any member of thepublic or to a community of persons interested in the subject matter,such as those in a scientific or engineering discipline, either free orat a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction anddistribution (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) throughA(6)); (2) Ready availability at libraries open to the public or atuniversity libraries (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, QuestionA(6)); (3) Patents and open (published) patent applications available atany patent office; and (4) Release at an open conference, meeting, seminar, trade show, orother open gathering. (i) A conference or gathering is ``open'' if all technicallyqualified members of the public are eligible to attend and attendeesare permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (notnecessarily a recording) of the proceedings and presentations. (ii) All technically qualified members of the public may beconsidered eligible to attend a conference or other gatheringnotwithstanding a registration fee reasonably related to cost andreflecting an intention that all interested and technically qualifiedpersons be able to attend, or a limitation on actual attendance, aslong as attendees either are the first who have applied or are selectedon the basis of relevant scientific or technical competence,experience, or responsibility (See Supplement No. 1 to this part,Questions B(1) through B(6)). (iii) ``Publication'' includes submission of papers to domestic orforeign editors or reviewers of journals, or to organizers of openconferences or other open gatherings, with the understanding that thepapers will be made publicly available if favorably received. (SeeSupplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) and A(3)). (b) Software and information is published when it is available forgeneral distribution either for free or at a price that does not exceedthe cost of reproduction and distribution. See Supplement No. 1 to thispart, Questions G(1) through G(3).Sec. 734.8 Information resulting from fundamental research. (a) Fundamental research. Paragraphs (b) through (d) of thissection and Sec. 734.11 of this part provide specific rules that willbe used to determine whether research in particular institutionalcontexts qualifies as ``fundamental research''. The intent behind theserules is to identify as ``fundamental research'' basic and appliedresearch in science and engineering, where the resulting information isordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientificcommunity. Such research can be distinguished from proprietary researchand from industrial development, design, production, and productutilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted forproprietary reasons or specific national security reasons as defined inSec. 732.10 of this part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, QuestionD(8)). (b) University based research. (1) Research conducted byscientists, engineers, or students at a university normally will beconsidered fundamental research, as described in paragraphs (b) (2)through (6) of this section. (``University'' means any accreditedinstitution of higher education located in the United States.) (2) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university researchsolely to insure that the publication would not inadvertently divulgeproprietary information that the sponsor has furnished to theresearchers does not change the status of the research as fundamentalresearch. However, release of information from a corporate sponsor touniversity researchers where the research results are subject toprepublication review, is subject to the EAR. (See Supplement No. 1 tothis part, Questions D(7), D(9), and D(10).) (3) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university researchsolely to ensure that publication would not compromise patent rightsdoes not change the status of fundamental research, so long as thereview causes no more than a temporary delay in publication of theresearch results. (4) The initial transfer of information from an industry sponsor touniversity researchers is subject to the EAR where the parties haveagreed that the sponsor may withhold from publication some or all ofthe information so provided. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part,Question D(2).) (5) University based research is not considered ``fundamentalresearch'' if the university or its researchers accept (at the request,for example, of an industrial sponsor) other restrictions onpublication of scientific and technical information resulting from theproject or activity. Scientific and technical information resultingfrom the research will nonetheless qualify as fundamental research onceall such restrictions have expired or have been removed. (SeeSupplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(7) and D(9).) (6) The provisions of Sec. 734.11 of this part will apply if auniversity or its researchers accept specific national securitycontrols (as defined in Sec. 732.11 of this part) on a research projector activity sponsored by the U.S. Government. (See Supplement No. 1 tothis part, Questions E(1) and E(2).) (c) Research based at Federal agencies or FFRDCs. Researchconducted by scientists or engineers working for a Federal agency or aFederally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) may bedesignated as ``fundamental research'' within any appropriate systemdevised by the agency or the FFRDC to control the release ofinformation by such scientists and engineers. (See Supplement No. 1 tothis part, Questions D(8) and D(11).) (d) Corporate research. (1) Research conducted by scientists orengineers working for a business entity will be considered``fundamental research'' at such time and to the extent that theresearchers are free to make scientific and technical informationresulting from the research publicly available without restriction ordelay based on proprietary concerns or specific national securitycontrols as defined in Sec. 734.11 of this part. (2) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that thepublication would compromise no proprietary information provided by thecompany to the researchers is not considered to be a proprietaryrestriction under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, paragraph(d)(1) of this section does not authorize the release of information touniversity researchers where the research results are subject toprepublication review. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, QuestionsD(8), D(9), and D(10).) (3) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure thatprepublication would compromise no patent rights will not be considereda proprietary restriction for this purpose, so long as the reviewcauses no more[[Page 12750]]than a temporary delay in publication of the research results. (4) However, the initial transfer of information from a businessentity to researchers is not authorized under the ``fundamentalresearch'' provision where the parties have agreed that the businessentity may withhold from publication some or all of the information soprovided. (e) Research based elsewhere. Research conducted by scientists orengineers who are not working for any of the institutions described inparagraphs (b) through (d) of this section will be treated as corporateresearch, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (SeeSupplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(8).)Sec. 734.9 Educational information. ``Educational information'' referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iii) ofthis part is not subject to the EAR if it is released by instruction incatalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academicinstitutions. Dissertation research is discussed in Sec. 734.8(b) ofthis part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question C(1) throughC(6).)Sec. 734.10 Patent applications. The information referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iv) of this partis: (a) Information contained in a patent application prepared whollyfrom foreign-origin technical data where the application is being sentto the foreign inventor to be executed and returned to the UnitedStates for subsequent filing in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; (b) Information contained in a patent application, or an amendment,modification, supplement or division of an application, and authorizedfor filing in a foreign country in accordance with the regulations ofthe Patent and Trademark Office, 37 CFR part 5; 1 or \1\ Regulations issued by the Patent and Trademark Office in 37CFR part 5 provide for the export to a foreign country ofunclassified technical data in the form of a patent application oran amendment, modification, or supplement thereto or divisionthereof.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (c) Information contained in a patent application when sent to aforeign country before or within six months after the filing of aUnited States patent application for the purpose of obtaining thesignature of an inventor who was in the United States when theinvention was made or who is a co-inventor with a person residing inthe United States.Sec. 734.11 Government-sponsored research covered by contractcontrols. (a) If research is funded by the U.S. Government, and specificnational security controls are agreed on to protect informationresulting from the research, Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part will notapply to any export or reexport of such information in violation ofsuch controls. However, any export or reexport of information resultingfrom the research that is consistent with the specific controls maynonetheless be made under this provision. (b) Examples of ``specific national security controls'' includerequirements for prepublication review by the Government, with right towithhold permission for publication; restrictions on prepublicationdissemination of information to non-U.S. citizens or other categoriesof persons; or restrictions on participation of non-U.S. citizens orother categories of persons in the research. A general reference to oneor more export control laws or regulations or a general reminder thatthe Government retains the right to classify is not a ``specificnational security control''. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part,Questions E(1) and E(2).)Sec. 734.12 Effect on foreign laws and regulations. Any person who complies with any of the license or otherrequirements of the EAR is not relieved of the responsibility ofcomplying with applicable foreign laws and regulations. Conversely, anyperson who complies with the license or other requirements of a foreignlaw or regulation is not relieved of the responsibility of complyingwith U.S. laws and regulations, including the EAR.Supplement No. 1 to Part 734--Questions and Answers--Technology andSoftware Subject to the EAR This Supplement No. 1 contains explanatory questions and answersrelating to technology and software that is subject to the EAR. Itis intended to give the public guidance in understanding how BXAinterprets this part, but is only illustrative, not comprehensive.In addition, facts or circumstances that differ in any material wayfrom those set forth in the questions or answers will be consideredunder the applicable provisions of the EAR. This Supplement isdivided into nine sections according to topic as follows: Section A: Publication of technology and exports and reexportsof technology that has been or will be published. Section B: Release of technology at conferences. Section C: Educational instruction. Section D: Research, correspondence, and informal scientificexchanges. Section E: Federal contract controls. Section F: Commercial consulting. Section G: Software. Section H: Availability in a public library. Section I: Miscellaneous.Section A: Publication Question A(1): I plan to publish in a foreign journal ascientific paper describing the results of my research, which is inan area listed in the EAR as requiring a license to all countriesexcept Canada. Do I need a license to send a copy to my publisherabroad? Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR.The EAR do not cover technology that is already publicly available,as well as technology that is made public by the transaction inquestion (Secs. 734.3 and 734.7 of this part). Your research resultswould be made public by the planned publication. You would not needa license. Question A(2): Would the answer differ depending on where I workor where I performed the research? Answer: No. Of course, the result would be different if youremployer or another sponsor of your research imposed restrictions onits publication (Sec. 734.8 of this part). Question (A)3: Would I need a license to send the paper to theeditors of a foreign journal for review to determine whether it willbe accepted for publication? Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EARbecause you are submitting the paper to the editors with theintention that the paper will be published if favorably received(Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(iii) of this part). Question A(4): The research on which I will be reporting in mypaper is supported by a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE).The grant requires prepublication clearance by DOE. Does that makeany difference under the Export Administration Regulations? Answer: No, the transaction is not subject to the EAR. But ifyou published in violation of any Department of Energy controls youhave accepted in the grant, you may be subject to appropriateadministrative, civil, or criminal sanctions under other laws. Question A(5): We provide consulting services on the design,layout, and construction of integrated circuit plants and productionlines. A major part of our business is the publication for sale toclients of detailed handbooks and reference manuals on key aspectson the design and manufacturing processes. A typical cost ofpublishing such a handbook and manual might be $500; the typicalsales price is about $15,000. Is the publication and sale of suchhandbooks or manuals subject to the EAR? Answer: Yes. The price is above the cost of reproduction anddistribution (Sec. 734.7(a)(1) of this part). Thus, you would needto obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception before youcould export or reexport any of these handbooks or manuals. Question A(6): My Ph.D. thesis is on technology, listed in theEAR as requiring a license to all destinations except Canada, whichhas never been published for general distribution. However, thethesis is available at the institution from which I took the degree.Do I need a license to send another copy to a colleague overseas? Answer: That may depend on where in the institution it isavailable. If it is not readily available in the university library(e.g., by filing in open stacks with a reference in the[[Page 12751]]catalog), it is not ``publicly available'' and the export orreexport would be subject to the EAR on that ground. The export orreexport would not be subject to the EAR if your Ph.D. researchqualified as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8 of this part.If not, however, you will need to obtain a license or qualify for aLicense Exception before you can send a copy out of the country. Question A(7): We sell electronically recorded information,including software and databases, at wholesale and retail. Ourproducts are available by mail order to any member of the public,though intended for specialists in various fields. They are pricedto maximize sales to persons in those fields. Do we need a licenseto sell our products to foreign customers? Answer: You would not need a license for otherwise controlledtechnology or software if the technology and software are madepublicly available at a price that does not exceed the cost ofproduction and distribution to the technical community. Even ifpriced at a higher level, the export or reexport of the technologyor software source code in a library accessible to the public is notsubject to the EAR (Sec. 734.7(a) of this part).Section B: Conferences Question B(1): I have been invited to give a paper at aprestigious international scientific conference on a subject listedas requiring a license under the EAR to all countries, exceptCanada. Scientists in the field are given an opportunity to submitapplications to attend. Invitations are given to those judged to bethe leading researchers in the field, and attendance is byinvitation only. Attendees will be free to take notes, but not makeelectronic or verbatim recordings of the presentations ordiscussions. Some of the attendees will be foreigners. Do I need alicense to give my paper? Answer: No. Release of information at an open conference andinformation that has been released at an open conference is notsubject to the EAR. The conference you describe fits the definitionof an open conference (Sec. 734.7(d) of this part). Question B(2): Would it make any difference if there were aprohibition on making any notes or other personal record of whattranspires at the conference? Answer: Yes. To qualify as an ``open'' conference, attendeesmust be permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record(although not necessarily a recording). If note taking or the makingof personal records is altogether prohibited, the conference wouldnot be considered ``open''. Question B(3): Would it make any difference if there were also aregistration fee? Answer: That would depend on whether the fee is reasonablyrelated to costs and reflects an intention that all interested andtechnically qualified persons should be able to attend(Sec. 734.7(d)(4)(ii) of this part). Question B(4): Would it make any difference if the conferencewere to take place in another country? Answer: No. Question B(5): Must I have a license to send the paper I proposeto present at such a foreign conference to the conference organizerfor review? Answer: No. A license is not required under the EAR to submitpapers to foreign organizers of open conferences or other opengatherings with the intention that the papers will be delivered atthe conference, and so made publicly available, if favorablyreceived. The submission of the papers is not subject to the EAR(Sec. 734.7(d)(4)(iii) of this part). Question B(6): Would the answers to any of the foregoingquestions be different if my work were supported by the FederalGovernment? Answer: No. You may export and reexport the papers, even if therelease of the paper violates any agreements you have made with yourgovernment sponsor. However, nothing in the EAR relieves you ofresponsibility for conforming to any controls you have agreed to inyour Federal grant or contract.Section C: Educational Instruction Question C(1): I teach a university graduate course on designand manufacture of very high-speed integrated circuitry. Many of thestudents are foreigners. Do I need a license to teach this course? Answer: No. Release of information by instruction in catalogcourses and associated teaching laboratories of academicinstitutions is not subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.9 of this part). Question C(2): Would it make any difference if some of thestudents were from countries to which export licenses are required? Answer: No. Question C(3): Would it make any difference if I talk aboutrecent and as yet unpublished results from my laboratory research? Answer: No. Question C(4): Even if that research is funded by theGovernment? Answer: Even then, but you would not be released from anyseparate obligations you have accepted in your grant or contract. Question C(5): Would it make any difference if I were teachingat a foreign university? Answer: No. Question C(6): We teach proprietary courses on design andmanufacture of high-performance machine tools. Is the instruction inour classes subject to the EAR? Answer: Yes. That instruction would not qualify as ``release ofeducational information'' under Sec. 734.9 of this part because yourproprietary business does not qualify as an ``academic institution''within the meaning of Sec. 734.9 of this part. Conceivably, however,the instruction might qualify as ``release at an open * * * seminar,* * * or other open gathering'' under Sec. 734.7(d) of this part.The conditions for qualification of such a seminar or gathering as``open'', including a fee ``reasonably related to costs (of theconference, not of producing the data) and reflecting an intentionthat all interested and technically qualified persons be able toattend,'' would have to be satisfied.Section D: Research, Correspondence, and Informal ScientificExchanges Question D(1): Do I need a license in order for a foreigngraduate student to work in my laboratory? Answer: Not if the research on which the foreign student isworking qualifies as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8 ofthis part. In that case, the research is not subject to the EAR. Question D(2): Our company has entered into a cooperativeresearch arrangement with a research group at a university. One ofthe researchers in that group is a PRC national. We would like toshare some of our proprietary information with the universityresearch group. We have no way of guaranteeing that this informationwill not get into the hands of the PRC scientist. Do we need toobtain a license to protect against that possibility? Answer: No. The EAR do not cover the disclosure of informationto any scientists, engineers, or students at a U.S. university inthe course of industry-university research collaboration underspecific arrangements between the firm and the university, providedthese arrangements do not permit the sponsor to withhold frompublication any of the information that he provides to theresearchers. However, if your company and the researchers haveagreed to a prohibition on publication, then you must obtain alicense or qualify for a License Exception before transferring theinformation to the university. It is important that you as thecorporate sponsor and the university get together to discuss whetherforeign nationals will have access to the information, so that youmay obtain any necessary authorization prior to transferring theinformation to the research team. Question D(3): My university will host a prominent scientistfrom the PRC who is an expert on research in engineered ceramics andcomposite materials. Do I require a license before telling ourvisitor about my latest, as yet unpublished, research results inthose fields? Answer: Probably not. If you performed your research at theuniversity, and you were subject to no contract controls on releaseof the research, your research would qualify as ``fundamentalresearch'' (Sec. 734.8(a) of this part). Information arising duringor resulting from such research is not subject to the EAR(Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part). You should probably assume, however, that your visitor will bedebriefed later about anything of potential military value he learnsfrom you. If you are concerned that giving such information to him,even though permitted, could jeopardize U.S. security interests, theCommerce Department can put you in touch with appropriate Governmentscientists who can advise you. Write to Department of Commerce,Bureau of Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044. Question D(4): Would it make any difference if I were proposingto talk with a PRC expert in China? Answer: No, if the information in question arose during orresulted from the same ``fundamental research.''[[Page 12752]] Question D(5): Could I properly do some work with him in hisresearch laboratory inside China? Answer: Application abroad of personal knowledge or technicalexperience acquired in the United States constitutes an export ofthat knowledge and experience, and such an export may be subject tothe EAR. If any of the knowledge or experience you export in thisway requires a license under the EAR, you must obtain such a licenseor qualify for a License Exception. Question D(6): I would like to correspond and share researchresults with an Iranian expert in my field, which deals withtechnology that requires a license to all destinations exceptCanada. Do I need a license to do so? Answer: Not as long as we are still talking about informationthat arose during or resulted from research that qualifies as``fundamental'' under the rules spelled out in Sec. 734.8(a) of thispart. Question D(7): Suppose the research in question were funded by acorporate sponsor and I had agreed to prepublication review of anypaper arising from the research? Answer: Whether your research would still qualify as``fundamental'' would depend on the nature and purpose of theprepublication review. If the review is intended solely to ensurethat your publications will neither compromise patent rights norinadvertently divulge proprietary information that the sponsor hasfurnished to you, the research could still qualify as``fundamental.'' But if the sponsor will consider as part of itsprepublication review whether it wants to hold your new researchresults as trade secrets or otherwise proprietary information (evenif your voluntary cooperation would be needed for it to do so), yourresearch would no longer qualify as ``fundamental.'' As used inthese regulations it is the actual and intended openness of researchresults that primarily determines whether the research counts as``fundamental'' and so is not subject to the EAR. Question D(8): In determining whether research is thus open andtherefore counts as ``fundamental,'' does it matter where or in whatsort of institution the research is performed? Answer: In principle, no. ``Fundamental research'' is performedin industry, Federal laboratories, or other types of institutions,as well as in universities. The regulations introduce someoperational presumptions and procedures that can be used both bythose subject to the regulations and by those who administer them todetermine with some precision whether a particular research activityis covered. Recognizing that common and predictable norms operate indifferent types of institutions, the regulations use theinstitutional locus of the research as a starting point for thesepresumptions and procedures. Nonetheless, it remains the type ofresearch, and particularly the intent and freedom to publish, thatidentifies ``fundamental research,'' not the institutional locus(Sec. 734.8(a) of this part). Question D(9): I am doing research on high-powered lasers in thecentral basic-research laboratory of an industrial corporation. I amrequired to submit the results of my research for prepublicationreview before I can publish them or otherwise make them public. Iwould like to compare research results with a scientific colleaguefrom Vietnam and discuss the results of the research with her whenshe visits the United States. Do I need a license to do so? Answer: You probably do need a license (Sec. 734.8(d) of thispart). However, if the only restriction on your publishing any ofthat information is a prepublication review solely to ensure thatpublication would compromise no patent rights or proprietaryinformation provided by the company to the researcher your researchmay be considered ``fundamental research,'' in which case you may beable to share information because it is not subject to the EAR. Notethat the information will be subject to the EAR if theprepublication review is intended to withhold the results of theresearch from publication. Question D(10): Suppose I have already cleared my company'sreview process and am free to publish all the information I intendto share with my colleague, though I have not yet published? Answer: If the clearance from your company means that you arefree to make all the information publicly available withoutrestriction or delay, the information is not subject to the EAR.(Sec. 734.8(d) of this part) Question D(11): I work as a researcher at a Government-owned,contractor-operated research center. May I share the results of myunpublished research with foreign nationals without concern forexport controls under the EAR? Answer: That is up to the sponsoring agency and the center'smanagement. If your research is designated ``fundamental research''within any appropriate system devised by them to control release ofinformation by scientists and engineers at the center, it will betreated as such by the Commerce Department, and the research willnot be subject to the EAR. Otherwise, you would need to obtain alicense or qualify for a License Exception, except to publish orotherwise make the information public (Sec. 734.8(c) of this part).Section E: Federal Contract Controls Question E(1): In a contract for performance of research enteredinto with the Department of Defense (DOD), we have agreed to certainnational security controls. DOD is to have ninety days to review anypapers we proposed before they are published and must approveassignment of any foreign nationals to the project. The work inquestion would otherwise qualify as ``fundamental research'' sectionunder Sec. 734.8 of this part. Is the information arising during orresulting from this sponsored research subject to the EAR? Answer: Under Sec. 734.11 of this part, any export or reexportof information resulting from government-sponsored research that isinconsistent with contract controls you have agreed to will notqualify as ``fundamental research'' and any such export or reexportwould be subject to the EAR. Any such export or reexport that isconsistent with the controls will continue to be eligible for exportand reexport under the ``fundamental research'' rule set forth inSec. 734.8(a) of this part. Thus, if you abide by the specificcontrols you have agreed to, you need not be concerned aboutviolating the EAR. If you violate those controls and export orreexport information as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8(a)of this part, you may subject yourself to the sanctions provided forunder the EAR, including criminal sanctions, in addition toadministrative and civil penalties for breach of contract underother law. Question E(2): Do the Export Administration Regulations restrictmy ability to publish the results of my research? Answer: The Export Administration Regulations are not the meansfor enforcing the national security controls you have agreed to. Ifsuch a publication violates the contract, you would be subject toadministrative, civil, and possible criminal penalties under otherlaw.Section F: Commercial Consulting Question F(1): I am a professor at a U.S. university, withexpertise in design and creation of submicron devices. I have beenasked to be a consultant for a ``third-world'' company that wishesto manufacture such devices. Do I need a license to do so? Answer: Quite possibly you do. Application abroad of personalknowledge or technical experience acquired in the United Statesconstitutes an export of that knowledge and experience that issubject to the Export Administration Regulations. If any part of theknowledge or experience your export or reexport deals withtechnology that requires a license under the EAR, you will need toobtain a license or qualify for a License Exception.Section G: Software 2 \2\ Exporters should note that these provisions do not apply tosoftware controlled under the International Traffic in ArmsRegulations (e.g., certain encryption software).--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Question G(1): Is the export or reexport of software in machinereadable code subject to the EAR when the source code for suchsoftware is publicly available? Answer: If the source code of a software program is publiclyavailable, then the machine readable code compiled from the sourcecode is software that is publicly available and therefore notsubject to the EAR. Question G(2): Is the export or reexport of software sold at aprice that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and distributionsubject to the EAR? Answer: Software in machine readable code is publicly availableif it is available to a community at a price that does not exceedthe cost of reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction anddistribution costs may include variable and fixed allocations ofoverhead and normal profit for the reproduction and distributionfunctions either in your company or in a third party distributionsystem. In your company, such costs may not include recovery fordevelopment, design, or acquisition. In this case, the provider ofthe software does not receive a fee for the inherent value of thesoftware.[[Page 12753]] Question G(3): Is the export or reexport of software subject tothe EAR if it is sold at a price BXA concludes in a classificationletter to be sufficiently low so as not to subject it to the EAR? Answer: In response to classification requests, BXA may chooseto classify certain software as not subject to the EAR even thoughit is sold at a price above the costs of reproduction anddistribution as long as the price is nonetheless sufficiently low toqualify for such a classification in the judgment of BXA.Section H: Available in a Public Library Question H(1): Is the export or reexport of information subjectto the EAR if it is available in a library and sold through anelectronic or print service? Answer: Electronic and print services for the distribution ofinformation may be relatively expensive in the marketplace becauseof the value vendors add in retrieving and organizing information ina useful way. If such information is also available in a library--itself accessible to the public--or has been published in any way,that information is ``publicly available'' for those reasons, andthe information itself continues not to be subject to the EAR eventhough you access the information through an electronic or printservice for which you or your employer pay a substantial fee. Question H(2): Is the export or reexport of information subjectto the EAR if the information is available in an electronic form ina library at no charge to the library patron? Answer: Information available in an electronic form at no chargeto the library patron in a library accessible to the public isinformation publicly available even though the library pays asubstantial subscription fee for the electronic retrieval service. Question H(3): Is the export or reexport of information subjectto the EAR if the information is available in a library and sold formore than the cost of reproduction and distribution? Answer: Information from books, magazines, dissertations,papers, electronic data bases, and other information available in alibrary that is accessible to the public is not subject to the EAR.This is true even if you purchase such a book at more than the costof reproduction and distribution. In other words, such informationis ``publicly available'' even though the author makes a profit onyour particular purchase for the inherent value of the information.Section I: Miscellaneous Question I(1): The manufacturing plant that I work at isplanning to begin admitting groups of the general public to tour theplant facilities. We are concerned that a license might be requiredif the tour groups include foreign nationals. Would such a tourconstitute an export? If so, is the export subject to the EAR? Answer: The EAR define exports and reexports of technology toinclude release through visual inspection by foreign nationals ofU.S.-origin equipment and facilities. Such an export or reexportqualifies under the ``publicly available'' provision and would notbe subject to the EAR so long as the tour is truly open to allmembers of the public, including your competitors, and you do notcharge a fee that is not reasonably related to the cost ofconducting the tours. Otherwise, you will have to obtain a license,or qualify for a License Exception, prior to permitting foreignnationals to tour your facilities (Sec. 734.7 of this part). Question I(2): Is the export or reexport of information subjectto the EAR if the information is not in a library or published, butsold at a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction anddistribution? Answer: Information that is not in a library accessible to thepublic and that has not been published in any way, may nonethelessbecome ``publicly available'' if you make it both available to acommunity of persons and if you sell it at no more than the cost ofreproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distributioncosts may include variable and fixed cost allocations of overheadand normal profit for the reproduction and distribution functionseither in your company or in a third party distribution system. Inyour company, such costs may not include recovery for development,design, or acquisition costs of the technology or software. Thereason for this conclusion is that the provider of the informationreceives nothing for the inherent value of the information. Question I(3): Is the export or reexport of informationcontributed to an electronic bulletin board subject to the EAR? Answer: Assume each of the following: 1. Information is uploaded to an electronic bulletin board by aperson that is the owner or originator of the information; 2. That person does not charge a fee to the bulletin boardadministrator or the subscribers of the bulletin board; and 3. The bulletin board is available for subscription to anysubscriber in a given community regardless of the cost ofsubscription. Such information is ``publicly available'' and therefore notsubject to the EAR even if it is not elsewhere published and is notin a library. The reason for this conclusion is that the bulletinboard subscription charges or line charges are for distributionexclusively, and the provider of the information receives nothingfor the inherent value of the information. Question I(4): Is the export or reexport of patented informationfully disclosed on the public record subject to the EAR? Answer: Information to the extent it is disclosed on the patentrecord open to the public is not subject to the EAR even though youmay use such information only after paying a fee in excess of thecosts of reproduction and distribution. In this case the seller doesreceive a fee for the inherent value of the technical data; however,the export or reexport of the information is nonetheless not subjectto the EAR because any person can obtain the technology from thepublic record and further disclose or publish the information. Forthat reason, it is impossible to impose export controls that denyaccess to the information.Supplement No. 2 to Part 734--Calculation of Values for De MinimisRules (a) Use the following guidelines in determining values forestablishing exemptions or for submission of a request forauthorization: (1) U.S. content value. (i) U.S. content value is the delivered cost to the foreignmanufacturer of the U.S. origin parts, components, or materials.(When affiliated firms have special arrangements that result inlower than normal pricing, the cost should reflect ``fair market''prices that would normally be charged to similar, unaffiliatedcustomers.) (ii) In calculating the U.S. content value, do not includeparts, components, or materials that, according to the CCL (part 774of the EAR) and the Country Chart (part 738 of the EAR), could beexported from the United States to the new country of destinationwithout a license (designated as ``NLR'') or under License ExceptionGBS (see part 740 of the EAR). (2) The foreign-made product value is the normal selling pricef.o.b. factory (excluding value added taxes or excise taxes). (3) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlledcontent, you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the CommerceControl List, determine those items that would require a licensefrom BXA for reexport to the ultimate destination of the foreign-made product if such parts, components, or materials were reexportedto that destination in the form received, and divide the total valueof the controlled U.S. parts, components, and materials incorporatedinto the foreign-made item by the sale price of the foreign-madeitem. (4) If no U.S. parts, components or materials are incorporatedor if the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials arebelow the de minimis level, then the foreign-made item is notsubject to the EAR by reason of Sec. 734.4 of this part, theclassification of a foreign-made item is irrelevant in determiningthe scope of the EAR, and you should skip Step 4 in Sec. 732.2(d)and go on to consider Step 6 in Sec. 732.2(f) of the EAR regardingthe foreign-produced direct product rule. (b) One-time report prior to reliance upon the de minimisexclusion. (1) Report requirement. Before you may rely upon the de minimisexclusion for foreign software and technology commingled with U.S.software or technology, you must file a one-time report for theforeign software or technology. The report must include thepercentage of U.S.-content by value and a description of yourcalculations including relevant values, assumptions, and the basisor methodologies for making the percentage calculation. The threecriteria important to BXA in its review of your report will be theexport price of the U.S.-content, the assumption regarding futuresales of software, and the choice of the scope of foreigntechnology. Your methodologies must be based upon the accountingstandards used in the operation of your business, and you mustspecify that standard in your report. Regardless of the accountingsystems,[[Page 12754]]standard, or conventions you use in the operation of your business,you may not depreciate the fair market values reported or otherwisereduce the fair market values by other accounting conventions suchas depreciation. You may rely upon the de minimis exclusion from thecommingled rule only to the extent you have reported the relevantcalculations, values, assumptions, and the basis or methodologiesfor the calculations. These values may be historic or projected. Youmay rely on projected values only to the extent that and for so longas they remain consistent with your report or future values reducethe U.S.-content under your reported assumptions, basis, andmethodologies. You are not required to file the above report if youdo not choose to take advantage of the de minimis exclusion from thecommingled rule. (2) Export price. The report must include a description of theU.S.-content including its classification on the Commerce ControlList, its performance characteristics and features, and the methodof calculating its fair market value. The fair market value shall bethe arms-length transaction price, if it is available. If an arms-length transaction price is unavailable, then the report willdescribe the valuation method chosen to calculate or derive the fairmarket value. Such methods may include comparable market prices orcosts of production and distribution. This rule does not requirecalculations based upon any one accounting system or U.S. accountingstandards. However, you must specify the accepted accountingstandards you have chosen, and cost-based methods of valuation mustbe based upon records you maintain in the normal course of business.You should also indicate whether reported values are actual arms-length market prices or derived from comparable transactions orcosts of production, overhead, and profit. For example, if you choseto make calculations under the transfer pricing rules of the UnitedStates Internal Revenue Code at section 482, your report shouldindicate that this is the source for your methodology, and youshould also indicate which of the several methodologies in thesetransfer pricing rules you have chosen. (3) Future software sales. For calculations of U.S.-content inforeign software, you shall include your estimate of future softwaresales in units and value along with the rationale and basis forthose estimates in the report. (4) Foreign technology and software. For calculations of U.S.-content in foreign technology and software, you shall include in thereport a description of the foreign technology or software and adescription of its fair market value along with the rationale andbasis for the selection and valuation of such foreign software ortechnology. The report does not require information regardingdestinations and end users for reexport. The purpose of the reportis solely to permit the U.S. Government to evaluate thereasonableness of U.S.-content calculations. (5) Report and wait. If you have not been contacted by BXAconcerning your report within thirty days after filing the reportwith BXA, you may rely upon the calculations in your report and thede minimis exclusions for software and technology for so long as youare not contacted by BXA.

In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFRchapter VII, subchapter C. A person may undertake transactions subjectto the EAR without a license or other authorization, unless theregulations affirmatively state such a requirement. As such, if anexport, reexport, or activity is subject to the EAR, the generalprohibitions contained in this part and the License Exceptionsspecified in part 740 of the EAR must be reviewed to determine if alicense is necessary. In the case of all exports from the UnitedStates, you must document your export as described in part 762 of theEAR regarding recordkeeping and clear your export through the U.S.Customs Service as described in part 758 of the EAR regarding exportclearance requirements. Also note that for short supply controls allprohibitions and License Exceptions are in part 754 of the EAR. (a) In this part we tell you: (1) The facts that make your proposed export, reexport, or conductsubject to these general prohibitions, and (2) The ten general prohibitions. (b) Your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and underthe EAR depend in large part upon the five types of informationdescribed in Sec. 736.2(a) of this part and upon the generalprohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of this part. The ten generalprohibitions contain cross-references to other parts of the EAR thatfurther define the breadth of the general prohibitions. For thatreason, this part is not freestanding. In part 732, we provide certainsteps you may follow in proper order to help you understand the generalprohibitions and their relationship to other parts of the EAR. (c) If you violate any of these ten general prohibitions, or engagein other conduct contrary to the Export Administration Act, the EAR, orany order, license, License Exception, or authorization issuedthereunder, as described in part 764 of the EAR regarding enforcement,you will be subject to the sanctions described in that part.Sec. 736.2 General prohibitions and determination of applicability. (a) Information or facts that determine the applicability of thegeneral prohibitions. The following five types of facts determine yourobligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally: (1) Classification of the item. The classification of the item onthe Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR); (2) Destination. The country of ultimate destination for an exportor reexport (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the CountryChart and the Commerce Control List); (3) End-user. The ultimate end-user (see General Prohibition Four(paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR fora reference to the list of persons you may not deal with); (4) End-use. The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five(paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for generalend-use restrictions); and (5) Conduct. Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freightforwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in part744 of the EAR. (b) General prohibitions. The following ten general prohibitionsdescribe certain exports, reexports, and other conduct, subject to thescope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have alicense from the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) or qualify underpart 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicablegeneral prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part740 of the EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports andReexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports),and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports); however,selected License Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorizedin part 746 of the EAR concerning embargo destinations and inSec. 744.2(c) of the EAR regarding nuclear end-uses.[[Page 12755]] (1) General Prohibition One--Export and reexport of controlleditems to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, withouta license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR toanother country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of thefollowing is true: (i) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicableExport Control Classification Number (ECCN), and (ii) Export to the country of destination requires a license forthe control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of theEAR. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correctclassification of your item and the ultimate destination as thatcombination is reflected on the Country Chart.) 1 Note that eachLicense Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes GeneralProhibition One if all terms and conditions of a given LicenseException are met by the exporter or reexporter. \1\ See part 738 of the EAR for selected controls that are notspecified on the Country Chart.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (2) General Prohibition Two--Reexport and export from abroad offoreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount ofcontrolled U.S. content (Parts and Components Reexports).

(a) Commerce Control List scope. (1) In this part, references tothe EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureauof Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List(CCL) within the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), whichincludes items (i.e., commodities, software, and technology) subject tothe export licensing authority of BXA. The CCL does not include thoseitems exclusively controlled for export or reexport by anotherdepartment or agency of the U.S. Government. In instances whereagencies other than the Department of Commerce administer[[Page 12757]]controls over related items, entries in the CCL contain a reference tothese controls. (2) The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of theEAR. Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR contains the GeneralTechnology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL. (b) Commerce Country Chart scope. BXA also maintains the CommerceCountry Chart. The Commerce Country Chart, located in Supplement No. 1to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination andReason for Control. In combination with the CCL, the Commerce CountryChart allows you to determine whether a license is required for itemson the CCL to any country in the world.Sec. 738.2 Commerce Control List (CCL) structure. (a) Categories. The CCL is divided into 10 categories, numbered asfollows:0--Nuclear Materials, Facilities and Equipment and Miscellaneous1--Materials, Chemicals, ``Microorganisms,'' and Toxins2--Materials Processing3--Electronics4--Computers5--Telecommunications and Information Security6--Lasers and Sensors7--Navigation and Avionics8--Marine9--Propulsion Systems, Space Vehicles and Related Equipment (b) Groups. Within each category, items are arranged by group. Eachcategory contains the same five groups. Each Group is identified by theletters A through E, as follows:A--Equipment, Assemblies and ComponentsB--Test, Inspection and Production EquipmentC--MaterialsD--SoftwareE--Technology (c) Order of review. In order to classify your item against theCCL, you should begin with a review of the general characteristics ofyour item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category onthe CCL. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should matchthe particular characteristics and functions of your item to a specificECCN. If the ECCN contains a list under the ``Items'' heading, youshould review the list to determine within which subparagraph(s) youritems are identified. (d) Entries. (1) Composition of an entry. Within each group,individual items are identified by an Export Control ClassificationNumber (ECCN). Each number consists of a set of digits and a letter.The first digit identifies the general category within which the entryfalls (e.g., 3A001). The letter immediately following this first digitidentifies under which of the five groups the item is listed (e.g.,3A001). The second digit differentiates individual entries byidentifying the type of controls associated with the items contained inthe entry (e.g., 3A001). Listed below are the Reasons for Controlassociated with this second digit.0: National Security reasons (including Dual Use and InternationalMunitions List) and Items on the NSG Dual Use Annex and Trigger List1: Missile Technology reasons2: Nuclear Nonproliferation reasons3: Chemical & Biological Weapons reasons9: Anti-terrorism, Crime Control, Regional Stability, Short Supply, UNSanctions, etc. (i) Since Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive, numbersare assigned in order of precedence. As an example, if an item iscontrolled for both National Security and Missile Technology reasons,the entry's third digit will be a ``0''. If the item is controlled onlyfor Missile Technology the third digit will be ``1''. (ii) The numbers in either the second or third digit (e.g., 3A001)serve to differentiate between multilateral and unilateral entries. Anentry with the number ``9'' as the second digit, identifies the entireentry as controlled for a unilateral concern (e.g., 2B991 for anti-terrorism reasons). If the number ``9'' appears as the third digit, theitem is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a proliferationconcern (e.g., 2A292 is controlled for unilateral purposes based onnuclear nonproliferation concerns). (2) Reading an ECCN. A brief description is provided next to eachECCN. Following this description is the actual entry containing``License Requirements,'' ``License Exceptions,'' and ``List of ItemsControlled'' sections. A brief description of each section and its usefollows: (i) License Requirements. This section contains a separate lineidentifying all possible Reasons for Control in order of precedence,and two columns entitled ``Control(s)'' and ``Country Chart''. (A) The ``Controls'' header identifies all applicable Reasons forControl, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies(e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs). Thoserequiring licenses for a larger number of countries and/or items arelisted first. As you read down the list the number of countries and/oritems requiring a license declines. Since Reasons for Control are notmutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular ECCN may becontrolled for more than one reason. The following is a list of allpossible Reasons for Control:AT Anti-TerrorismCB Chemical & Biological WeaponsCC Crime ControlMT Missile TechnologyNS National SecurityNP Nuclear NonproliferationRS Regional StabilitySS Short SupplyXP Computers (B) The ``Country Chart'' header identifies, for each applicableReason for Control, a column name and number (e.g., CB Column 1). Thesecolumn identifiers are used to direct you from the CCL to theappropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license.Consult part 742 of the EAR for an indepth discussion of the licensingrequirements and policies applicable to each Country Chart column. (ii) License Exceptions. This section provides a brief eligibilitystatement for each ECCN-driven License Exception that may be applicableto your transaction, and should be consulted only AFTER you havedetermined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry andthe Country Chart. The brief eligibility statement in this section isprovided to assist you in deciding which ECCN-driven License Exceptionrelated to your particular item and destination you should exploreprior to submitting an application. The word ``Yes'' (followed in someinstances by the scope of Yes) appears next to each available ECCN-driven License Exception. ``N/A'' will be noted for License Exceptionsthat are not available within a particular entry. If one or moreLicense Exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you mustconsult part 740 of the EAR to review the conditions and restrictionsapplicable to each available License Exception. (iii) List of Items Controlled. (A) Units. The unit of measureapplicable to each entry is identified in the ``Units'' header. Mostmeasurements used in the CCL are expressed in metric units with aninch-pound conversion where appropriate. Note that in some ECCNs theinch-pound unit will be listed first. In instances where other unitsare in general usage or specified by law, these will be used instead ofmetric. Generally, when there is a difference[[Page 12758]]between the metric and inch-pound figures, the metric standard will beused for classification and licensing purposes. (B) Related definitions. This header identifies, where appropriate,definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by theentry. The information provided in this section is unique to the entry,and hence not listed in the definitions contained in part 772 of theEAR. (C) Related controls. If another U.S. government agency ordepartment has export licensing authority over items related to thosecontrolled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agencyor department along with the applicable regulatory cite. An additionalcross-reference may be included in instances where the scope ofcontrols differs between a CCL entry and its corresponding entry onlist maintained by the European Union. This information is provided toassist readers who use both lists. (D) Items. This header contains a positive list of all itemscontrolled by a particular entry and must be reviewed to determinewhether your item is controlled by that entry. In some entries, thelist is contained within the entry heading. In these entries a note isincluded to direct you to the entry heading.Sec. 738.3 Commerce Country Chart structure. (a) Scope. The Commerce Country Chart (Country Chart) allows you todetermine, based on the Reason(s) for Control associated with youritem, if you need a license to export or reexport your item to aparticular destination. There are only two instances where the chartcannot be used for this purpose: (1) Items controlled for short supply reasons. Due to the uniquenature of these controls, entries controlled for Short Supply reasonswill send you directly to part 754 of the EAR. Part 754 of the EAR isself-contained and includes information on licensing requirements,licensing policies, and all available License Exceptions, for itemscontrolled for Short Supply reasons. (2) Unique entries. The following are unique entries where you donot need to consult the Country Chart to determine whether a license isrequired. (A) ECCNs 0A983 and 5A980. A license is required for alldestinations of items controlled under these entries. No LicenseExceptions apply. If your item is controlled by 0A983 or 5A980 youshould proceed directly to part 748 of the EAR for license applicationinstructions and Sec. 742.11 or Sec. 742.13 of the EAR for informationon the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications. (B) ECCNs 0A986, 0A988, 1A988, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994 and 2B985. Alicense is required for items controlled under these entries only tothe specific countries identified within each entry. (b) Countries. The first column of the Country Chart lists allcountries in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinationsthat are not listed in the Country Chart contained in Supplement No. 1to part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart andsuch destination is a territory, possession, or department of a countryincluded on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination thesame licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory,possession, or department. For example, if your destination is theCayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, consultthe United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements. (c) Columns. Stretching out to the right are horizontal headersidentifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason forControl header are diagonal column identifiers capping individualcolumns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason forControl and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The columnidentifiers correspond to those listed in the ``Country Chart'' headerwithin the ``License Requirements'' section of each ECCN. (d) Cells. The symbol ``X'' is used to denote licensingrequirements on the Country Chart. If an ``X'' appears in a particularcell, transactions subject to that particular Reason for Control/Destination combination require a license. There is a directcorrelation between the number of ``X''s applicable to your transactionand the number of licensing reviews your application will undergo.Sec. 738.4 Determining whether a license is required. (a) Using the CCL and the Country Chart. (1) Overview. Once youhave determined that your item is controlled by a specific ECCN, youmust use information contained in the ``License Requirements'' sectionof that ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether alicense is required. (2) License decision making process. The following decision makingprocess must be followed in order to determine whether a license isrequired to export or reexport a particular item to a specificdestination: (i) Examine the appropriate ECCN in the CCL. Is the item you intendto export or reexport controlled for a single Reason for Control? (A) If yes, identify the single Reason for Control and the relevantCountry Chart column identifier (e.g., CB Column 1). (B) If no, identify the Country Chart column identifier for eachapplicable Reason for Control (e.g., NS Column 1, NP Column 1, etc.). (ii) Review the Country Chart. With each of the applicable CountryChart Column identifiers noted, turn to the Country Chart (SupplementNo. 1 to part 738). Locate the correct Country Chart column identifieron the diagonal headings, and determine whether an ``X'' is marked inthe cell next to the country in question for each Country Chart columnidentified in the applicable ECCN. If your item is subject to more thanone reason for control, repeat this step using each unique CountryChart column identifier. (A) If yes, a license application must be submitted based on theparticular reason for control and destination, unless a LicenseException applies. If ``Yes'' is noted next to any of the listedLicense Exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the EAR to determinewhether you can use any of the available ECCN-drvien License Exceptionsto effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. Eachaffirmative license requirement must be overcome by a LicenseException. If you are unable to qualify for a License Exception basedon each license requirement noted on the Country Chart, you must applyfor a license. Note that other License Exceptions, not related to theCCL, may also apply to your transaction (See part 740 of the EAR). (B) If no, a license is not required based on the particular reasonfor control and destination. Provided General Prohibitions Four throughTen do not apply to your proposed transaction, you may effect yourshipment using the symbol ``NLR''. Proceed to parts 758 and 762 of theEAR for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeepingrequirements. Note that although you may stop after determining alicense is required based on the first Reason for Control, it is bestto work through each applicable Reason for Control. A full analysis ofevery possible licensing requirement based on each applicable Reasonfor Control is required to determine the most advantageous LicenseException available for your particular transaction and, if a licenseis required, ascertain the scope of review conducted by BXA on yourlicense application.[[Page 12759]] (b) Sample analysis using the CCL and Country Chart. (1) Scope. Thefollowing sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustratethe type of thought process you must complete in order to determinewhether a license is required to export or reexport a particular itemto a specific destination using the CCL in combination with the CountryChart.

I read that theentire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorismreasons. Since my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, Iunderstand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to aportion the entry, they do not apply to my item. I note that theappropriate Country Chart column identifiers are NS Column 2 and ATColumn 1. Turning to the Country Chart, I locate my specificdestination, India, and see that an ``X'' appears in the NS Column 2cell for India, but not in the AT Column 1 cell. I understand that alicense is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a LicenseException or Special Comprehensive License. From the License ExceptionLVS value listed in the entry, I know immediately that my proposedtransaction exceeds the value limitation associated with LVS. Notingthat License Exception GBS is ``Yes'' for this entry, I turn to part740 of the EAR to review the provisions related to use of GBS.BILLING CODE 3510-DT-P[[Page 12760]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.000[[Page 12761]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.001[[Page 12762]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.002[[Page 12763]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.003[[Continued on page 12764]][Federal Register: March 25, 1996 (Rules and Regulations)][Page 12764-12814]From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov][[pp. 12764-12814]] Export Administration Regulation; Simplification of ExportAdministration Regulations[[Continued from page 12763]][[Page 12764]][[Page 12765]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.005[[Page 12766]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.006[[Page 12767]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.007BILLING CODE 3510-DT-C[[Page 12768]]PART 740--LICENSE EXCEPTIONSSec.740.1 Introduction.740.2 Restrictions on all License Exceptions.740.3 License Exceptions based on the Commerce Control List (LST).740.4 Temporary imports, exports, and reexports (TMP).740.5 Servicing and replacement of parts and equipment (RPL).740.6 Governments and international organizations (GOV).740.7 Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT).740.8 Technology and software--unrestricted (TSU).740.9 Baggage (BAG).740.10 Aircraft and vessels (AVS).740.11 Additional Permissive Reexports (APR).Supplement No. 1 to Part 740--Country GroupsSupplement No. 2 to Part 740--Items That May Be Donated to Meet BasicHuman Needs Under the Humanitarian License Exception Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60FR 42767, August 17, 1995).Sec. 740.1 Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFRchapter VII, subchapter C. (a) Scope. A ``License Exception'' is an authorization contained inthis part that allows you to export or reexport, under statedconditions, items subject to the Export Administration Regulations(EAR) that would otherwise require a license under General ProhibitionsOne, Two, or Three, as indicated under one or more of the ExportControl Classification Numbers (ECCN) in the Commerce Control List(CCL) in part 774 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject toGeneral Prohibition Six for embargoed destinations, refer to part 746of the EAR concerning embargoed destinations to determine theavailability of any License Exception. Special commodity controls applyto short supply items. Exceptions for items listed on the CCL ascontrolled for Short Supply reasons are found in part 754 of the EAR.If your export or reexport is subject General Prohibition Seven,consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject toGeneral Prohibitions Four, Five, Eight, Nine, or Ten, then no LicenseExceptions apply. (b) Certification. By using any of the License Exceptions you arecertifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use ofthe License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please referto part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting theuse of License Exceptions. (c) License Exception groupings and symbols. License Exceptions aregrouped together; each grouping bears a three letter symbol that willbe used for export clearance purposes (see paragraph (d) of thissection). Additionally, each License Exception bears a separatedesignator, of three or four letters, for convenience in distinguishingbetween License Exceptions and for recordkeeping purposes. (d) Shipper's Export Declaration. (1) Clearing exports underLicense Exceptions. You must enter on any required Shipper's ExportDeclaration (SED) the letter code (e.g., LST, TMP) of the grouping ofLicense Exceptions under which you are exporting. In the case ofLicense Exceptions available under LST, except License Exception TSR(Technology and Software under Restriction), the ECCN of the item beingexported must also be entered. Please refer to Sec. 758.3 of the EARfor the use of SEDs. (2) Clearing exports when no license is required (NLR). Certainitems are listed on the CCL but do not require a license to certaindestinations under General Prohibitions One, (Exports and Reexports inthe Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or Three(Foreign Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 732.6 (b)(1), (b)(2),or (b)(3) of the EAR). (You will have determined this by consulting theCountry Chart and finding no ``X'' in the box(es) at theintersection(s) of your country of destination and the column headingsassigned to your item by the CCL.) If General Prohibitions Four throughTen (Sec. 732.6 (b)(4) through (b)(10) of the EAR) also do not apply,you must clear exports of such items by entering the symbol ``NLR'' inthe appropriate place on the Shippers Export Declaration. The term``NLR'' represents exports of listed items when no license is required.Such exports do not require that you qualify for a License Exception. (e) Destination Control Statement. You may be required to enter anappropriate Destination Control Statement on commercial documents inaccordance with the Destination Control Statement requirements ofSec. 758.5 of the EAR. (f) Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involving exports underany of the License Exceptions must be maintained in accordance with therecordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.Sec. 740.2 Restrictions on all License Exceptions. (a) You may not use any License Exception if any one or more of thefollowing apply: (1) Your authorization to use a License Exception has beensuspended or revoked, or your intended export does not qualify for aLicense Exception. (2) The export is contrary to a Denial Order. See part 764 of theEAR for a description of Denial Orders. (3) You know that the item will be reexported and such reexport issubject to one of the ten General Prohibitions, is not eligible for aLicense Exception, and has not been authorized by BXA. (4) You know that the export will be used for certain end-uses oris for certain end-users as provided and prohibited in part 744 of theEAR. (5) The item is for surreptitious interception of wire or oralcommunications controlled under ECCN 5A980, unless you are a U.S.Government agency (see Sec. 740.6(b)(2)(ii) of this part, Governments(GOVT)). (6) The commodity you are shipping is a specially designed crimecontrol and detection instrument or equipment as described inSec. 742.7 of the EAR and you are not shipping to Iceland, New Zealand,or countries listed in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part740), unless the shipment is authorized under License Exception BAG,Sec. 740.9(e) of this part (shotguns and shotgun shells). (b) All License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, orrevocation, in whole or in part, without notice. It may be necessaryfor BXA to stop a shipment or an export transaction at any stage of itsprogress, e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport.If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary to orderthe return or unloading of the shipment at any port of call.Sec. 740.3 License Exceptions based on the Commerce Control List(LST). These License Exceptions are listed on the CCL. Each is designatedby a three-letter symbol that appears both in the paragraph of thissection describing its terms and on the CCL. All list-based LicenseExceptions use the symbol ``LST'' on shipping documentation for exportclearance purposes. (a) Shipments of Limited Value (LVS). (1) Scope. License ExceptionLVS authorizes the export and reexport in a single shipment of eligiblecommodities as identified by ``LVS--$(value limit)'' on the CCL. (2) Eligible Destinations. This License Exception is available forall destinations in Country Group B (see[[Page 12769]]Supplement No. 1 to part 740), provided that the net value of thecommodities included in the same order and controlled under the sameECCN entry on the CCL does not exceed the amount specified in the LVSparagraph for that entry. (3) Definitions. (i) Order. The term ``order'' as used in thisSec. 740.3 means a communication from a person in a foreign country, orthat person's representative, expressing an intent to importcommodities from the exporter. Although all of the details of the orderneed not be finally determined at the time of export, terms relating tothe kinds and quantities of the commodities to be exported, as well asthe selling prices of these commodities, must be finalized before thegoods can be exported under License Exception LVS. (ii) Net value: for LVS shipments. The actual selling price of thecommodities that are included in the same order and are controlledunder the same entry on the CCL, less shipping charges, or the currentmarket price of the commodities to the same type of purchaser in theUnited States, whichever is the larger. In determining the actualselling price or the current market price of the commodity, the valueof containers in which the commodity is being exported may be excluded.The value for LVS purposes is that of the controlled commodity that isbeing exported, and may not be reduced by subtracting the value of anycontent that would not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing.Where the total value of the containers and their contents must beshown on Shipper's Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, theexporter, in effecting a shipment under this License Exception, mustindicate the ``net value'' of the contained commodity immediately belowthe description of the commodity. (iii) Single shipment. All commodities moving at the same time fromone exporter to one consignee or intermediate consignee on the sameexporting carrier even though these commodities will be forwarded toone or more ultimate consignees. Commodities being transported in thismanner will be treated as a single shipment even if the commoditiesrepresent more than one order or are in separate containers. (4) Additional eligibility requirements and restrictions. (i)Eligible orders. To be eligible for this License Exception, orders mustmeet the following criteria: (A) Orders must not exceed the applicable ``LVS'' dollar valuelimits. An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the ``netvalue'' of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCLdoes not exceed the amount specified in the ``LVS'' paragraph for thatentry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order becauseLVS eligibility is based on the ``net value'' of the commodities ineach order, instead of the ``net value'' of the commodities in theshipment. (B) Orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollarlimits. An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit maynot be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or moreshipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollarvalue limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibilityrequirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may besplit among two or more shipments. (C) Orders must be legitimate. Exporters and consignees may not,either collectively or individually, structure or adjust orders to meetthe applicable LVS dollar value limits. (ii) Restriction on annual value of LVS orders. The total value ofexports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediateconsignee of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed12 times the LVS value limit for that ECCN. This annual value limitapplies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even though theshipments are made through more than one intermediate consignee. Thereis no restriction on the number of orders that may be included in ashipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must not beexceeded. (iii) Orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply. Anorder may include commodities that are controlled under more than oneentry on the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order mayexceed the LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However,the net value of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shallnot exceed the LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry. Example to paragraph (iii): An order includes commodities valued at$8,000. The order consists of commodities controlled under two ECCNentries, each having an LVS value limit of $5000. Commodities in theorder controlled under one ECCN are valued at $3,500 while thosecontrolled under the other ECCN are valued at $4,500. Since the netvalue of the commodities controlled under each entry falls within theLVS dollar value limits applicable to that entry, the order may beshipped under this License Exception. (iv) Prohibition against evasion of license requirements. Anyactivity involving the use of this License Exception to evade licenserequirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limitedto, the splitting or structuring of orders to meet applicable LVSdollar value limits, as prohibited by paragraphs (a)(4)(i) (B) and (C)of this section. (5) Reexports. Commodities may be reexported under this LicenseException, provided that they could be exported from the United Statesto the new country of destination under LVS. (b) Shipments to Country Group B countries (GBS). License ExceptionGBS authorizes exports and reexports to Country Group B (see SupplementNo. 1 to part 740) of those commodities controlled for nationalsecurity reasons and identified by ``GBS--Yes'' on the CCL. (c) Civil end-users (CIV). (1) Scope. License Exception CIVauthorizes exports and reexports of national security controlled itemsidentified by ``CIV--Yes'' on the CCL only to civil end-users for civilend-uses in Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) CIVmay not be used for exports and reexports to military end-users or toknown military uses. Such exports and reexports will continue torequire a license. In addition to conventional military activities,military uses include any proliferation activities described andprohibited by part 744 of the EAR. A license is also required fortransfer to military end-users or end-uses in eligible countries ofitems exported under CIV. (d) Technology and software under restriction (TSR). (1) Scope.License Exception TSR permits exports and reexports of technology andsoftware subject to national security controls and identified by``TSR--Yes'' in entries on the CCL only to the destinations in CountryGroup B. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) A written assurance isrequired from the consignee before exporting under this LicenseException. (i) Required assurance for export of technology. You may not exportor reexport technology under this License Exception until you havereceived from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXAlicense or License Exception, the importer will not: (A) Reexport or release the technology to a national of a countryin Country Groups D:1 or E:2; or (B) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of thetechnology, if such foreign produced direct product is subject tonational security controls as identified on the CCL (See GeneralProhibition Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR); or[[Page 12770]] (C) If the direct product of the technology is a complete plant orany major component of a plant, export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 thedirect product of the technology, if such foreign produced directproduct is subject to national security controls as identified on theCCL or is subject to State Department controls under the U.S. MunitionsList (22 CFR part 121). (ii) Required assurance for export of software. You may not exportor reexport software under this License Exception until you havereceived from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXAlicense or License Exception, the importer will neither: (A) Reexport or release the software or the source code for thesoftware to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1 or E:2; nor (B) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of thesoftware, if such foreign produced direct product is subject tonational security controls as identified on the CCL. (See GeneralProhibition Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). (iii) Form of written assurance. The required assurance may be madein the form of a letter or any other written communication from theimporter, or the assurance may be incorporated into a licensingagreement that specifically includes the assurances. An assuranceincluded in a licensing agreement is acceptable only if the agreementspecifies that the assurance will be honored even after the expirationdate of the licensing agreement. If such a written assurance is notreceived, License Exception TSR is not applicable and a license isrequired. The license application must include a statement explainingwhy assurances could not be obtained. (iv) Other License Exceptions. The requirements in this LicenseException do not apply to the export of technology or software underother License Exceptions, or to the export of technology or softwareincluded in an application for the foreign filing of a patent, providedthe filing is in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. PatentOffice. (2) Reserved. (e) Computers (CTP). (1) Scope. License Exception CTP authorizesexports and reexports of computers and specially designed componentstherefor, exported or reexported separately or as part of a system, andrelated equipment therefor when exported or reexported with thesecomputers as part of a system, for consumption in Computer Tiercountries as provided by this section. You may not use this LicenseException to export or reexport items that you know will be used toenhance the CTP beyond the eligibility limit allowed to your country ofdestination. When evaluating your computer to determine LicenseException CTP eligibility, use the CTP parameter to the exclusion ofother technical parameters for computers classified under ECCN 4A003,except of parameters specified as Missile Technology (MT) concerns,4A003.e (equipment performing analog-to-digital conversions exceedingthe limits in ECCN 3A001.a.5), and graphic accelerators or graphiccoprocessors exceeding a ``3-D vector rate'' of 10,000,000.

In this part, references to the ExportAdministration Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII,subchapter C. (a) Scope. This part describes all the reasons for controlreflected in the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of theEAR. In addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensingpolicies for the following items that are not reflected on the CountryChart: specially designed implements of torture, high performancecomputers, and communications intercepting devices. This part isorganized so that it lists each reason for control in the order(reading left to right) in which the control appears on the CountryChart. In addition to describing the reasons for control and licensingrequirements and policies, this part describes any applicable contractsanctity provisions that may apply to specific controls and includes adescription of any multilateral regime under which specific controlsare maintained. (b) Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part.This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policiesfor all the ``Reasons for Control'' that are listed on the CommerceControl List (CCL) except ``Short Supply'' and ``U.N. Sanctions,''which do not appear on the Country Chart. (1) Short Supply. ECCNs containing items subject to short supplycontrols (``SS'') refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. TheseECCNs are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganicchemicals); 1C981 (Crude petroleum, including reconstituted crudepetroleum, tar sands, and crude shale oil); 1C982 (certain otherpetroleum products); 1C983 (Natural gas liquids and other natural gasderivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas(except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to exportauthorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Western redcedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and workedlumber containing wane). (2) U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short ofcomplete embargoes, against certain countries which may result incontrols that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR forthat particular country. This part does not address licenserequirements and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N.sanctions. CCL entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions willrefer the exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other SpecialControls, for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports andreexports involving these countries. (c) Exports and reexports involving Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iraq,Iran, and the Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thispart does not cover license requirements and licensing policies thatapply to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba, Libya,North Korea, Iraq, Iran and the Bosnian-Serb controlled areas ofBosnia-Herzegovina). These comprehensive embargoes cover a broaderrange of items than those reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting orreexporting to any of these destinations, you should first review part746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls. (d) Anti-terrorism Controls on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, NorthKorea, Sudan and Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls onIran, Syria and Sudan under section 6(a) of the Export AdministrationAct. Items controlled under section 6(a) to these three countries aredescribed in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also maintainscontrols under EAA section 6(j) of the EAA to Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran,North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Items controlled to these seven countriesunder EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742.The Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notifyappropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a licensefor an item controlled under section 6(j) to Cuba, Libya, North Korea,Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. As noted in paragraph (c) of this section,if you are exporting or reexporting to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq andNorth Korea, you should review Part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and OtherSpecial Controls. (e) End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not coverprohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items notincluded on the[[Page 12787]]CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: certain nuclearend-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and biologicalweapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; certainactivities of U.S. persons; certain exports to and for the use ofcertain foreign vessels or aircraft; and certain exports to allcountries for Libyan aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies forthese exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR. (f) Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subjectto more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missiletechnology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability(RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other thanthose controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missiletechnology (see Sec. 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclearnonproliferation (see Sec. 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical andbiological weapons (see Sec. 742.3(b)(3) of this part), if the end-useor end-user may be involved in certain proliferation activities.Finally, many multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-terrorism reasons if they are destined for a terrorism-supportingcountry (see paragraph (d) of this section). Your application for alicense will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies. Alicense will be issued only if an application can be approved under allapplicable licensing policies.Sec. 742.2 Proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. (a) License requirements. The following controls are maintained insupport of the U.S. foreign policy of opposing the proliferation andillegal use of chemical and biological weapons: (1) If CB Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license isrequired to all destinations except Canada for the following: (i) Human pathogens, zoonoses, toxins, animal pathogens,genetically modified microorganisms and plant pathogens identified inECCNs 1C351, 1C352, 1C353 and 1C354; and (ii) Technology (ECCN 1E391) for the production and/or disposal ofmicrobiological commodities described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of thissection. (2) If CB Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license isrequired to all destinations except countries in Country Group A:3 (seeSupplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group members) forthe following: (i) Chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350 (precursor and intermediatechemicals used in the production of chemical warfare agents). (A) This licensing requirement includes chemical mixturescontaining any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, except as specifiedin Note 2 to that ECCN. (B) This licensing requirement does not include chemical compoundscreated with any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, unless thosecompounds are also identified in ECCN 1C350. (ii) Software (ECCN 1D390) for process control that is specificallyconfigured to control or initiate production of the chemical precursorscontrolled by ECCN 1C350. (iii) Technology (ECCN 1E390) for the production and/or disposal ofchemical precursors described in ECCN 1C350, and technology involvingthe following for facilities designed or intended to produce chemicalsdescribed in ECCN 1C350: (A) Overall plant design; (B) Design, specification, or procurement of equipment; (C) Supervision of construction, installation, or operation ofcomplete plant or components thereof; (D) Training of personnel; or (E) Consultation on specific problems involving such facilities. (3) If CB Column 3 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license isrequired to Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of theEAR) for the following: (i) Equipment and materials identified in ECCNs 2B350 and 2B351 onthe CCL, which can be used in the production of chemical weaponsprecursors or chemical warfare agents, and equipment and materialsidentified in ECCN 2B352, which can be used in the production ofbiological agents; and (ii) Technology (ECCN 2E301) for production of the commoditiescovered in ECCNs 2B350, 2B351, 2B352, 2B353 and 2B354. (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications for the itemsdescribed in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered on acase-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport wouldmake a material contribution to the design, development, production,stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an exportor reexport is deemed to make such a contribution, the license will bedenied. (2) The following factors are among those that will be consideredto determine what action should be taken on individual licenseapplications: (i) The specific nature of the end-use; (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of itscontribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, oruse of chemical or biological weapons; (iii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country; (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees against design,development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biologicalweapons that are given in a particular case; and (v) The existence of a pre-existing contract. (3) BXA will review license applications in accordance with thelicensing policy described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section foritems not described in paragraph (a) of this section that: (i) Require a license for reasons other than short supply; (ii) Are destined to any country except countries in Country GroupA:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Groupmembers); and (iii) Could be destined for the design, development, production,stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or for afacility engaged in such activities. (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates are set forth inSupplement No. 1 to part 742. Applicants who wish that a preexistingcontract be considered in reviewing their license applications mustsubmit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of such acontract.

Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 requires BXA to identify items subject to theEAR that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes ifused for activities other than those authorized at the time of exportor reexport. ECCNs on the CCL that include the symbol ``NP 1'' or ``NP2'' in the ``Country Chart'' column of the ``License Requirements''section identify items that could be of significance for nuclearexplosive purposes and are therefore subject to licensing[[Page 12788]]requirements under this part and under section 309(c) of the NuclearNon-Proliferation Act of 1978. These items are referred to as ``TheNuclear Referral List'' and are subject to the following licensingrequirements: (1) If NP Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license isrequired to all destinations except Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)member countries (Country Group A:4) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740of the EAR). (2) If NP Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part738 of the EAR) is indicated in the applicable ECCN, a license isrequired to Country Group D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of theEAR). (3) Other nuclear-related license requirements are described inSecs. 744.2 and 744.5 of the EAR. (b) Licensing policy. (1) To implement the controls in paragraph(a) of this section, the following factors are among those used todetermine what action should be taken on individual applications: (i) Whether the items to be transferred are appropriate for thestated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for theend-user; (ii) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular item; (iii) Whether the items to be exported or reexported are to be usedin research on, or for the development, design, manufacture,construction, operation, or maintenance of, any reprocessing orenrichment facility; (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use fornuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case; (v) Whether any party to the transaction has been engaged inclandestine or illegal procurement activities; (vi) Whether an application for a license to export or reexport tothe end-user has previously been denied, or whether the end-user haspreviously diverted items received under a general license, a LicenseException, or a validated license to unauthorized activities; (vii) Whether the export or reexport would present an unacceptablerisk of diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguardednuclear fuel-cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR; and (viii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country,based on consideration of the following factors: (A) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition ofNuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) or to a similarinternational legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement; (B) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclearactivities, facilities, or installations that are operational, beingdesigned, or under construction under International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards; (C) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil usesof atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country; (D) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the governmentof the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation andwhether that government is in compliance with its internationalobligations in the field of non-proliferation; (E) The degree to which the government of the importing countrycooperates in non-proliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness toconsult on international nonproliferation issues); and (F) Information on the importing country's nuclear intentions andactivities. (2) In addition, BXA will review license applications in accordancewith the licensing policy described in paragraph (b) of this sectionfor items not on the Nuclear Referral List that: (i) Require a license on the CCL for reasons other than ``shortsupply;'' and (ii) Are intended for a nuclear related end-use or end-user. (3) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensingpolicy for applications for those items that would make a direct andsignificant contribution to nuclear weapons and their delivery systemsis extended review or denial. (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are notavailable for license applications reviewed under this section. (d) Nuclear Suppliers Group. Most items on the Nuclear ReferralList that require a license under NP Column No. 1 on the Country Chart(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are contained in theAnnex to the ``Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-UseEquipment, Material, and Related Technology'' (the Annex), as publishedby the International Atomic Energy Agency in INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2.

Accordingly, a license is required forexports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada, for all itemsin ECCNs on the CCL that include NS Column 1 in the Country Chartcolumn of the ``License Requirements'' section. A license is requiredto all destinations except Country Group A:1 and cooperating countries(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) for all items in ECCNs on the CCLthat include NS Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the ``LicenseRequirements'' section. The purpose of the controls is to ensure thatthese items do not make a contribution to the military potential ofcountries in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of theEAR) that would prove detrimental to the national security of theUnited States. License Exception GBS is available for the export andreexport of certain national security controlled items to Country GroupB (see Sec. 740.3(b) and Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). (b) Licensing policy. (1) The policy for national securitycontrolled items exported or reexported to any country except a countryin Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) isto approve applications unless there is a significant risk that theitems will be diverted to a country in Country Group D:1. (2) Except for those countries described in paragraphs (b)(5)through (b)(7) of this section, the general policy for exports andreexports of items to Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part740 of the EAR) is to approve applications when BXA determines, on acase-by-case basis, that the items are for civilian use or wouldotherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potentialof the country of destination that would prove detrimental to thenational security of the United States. (3) To permit such policy judgments to be made, each application isreviewed in the light of prevailing policies with full consideration ofall[[Page 12789]]aspects of the proposed transaction. The review generally includes: (i) An analysis of the kinds and quantities of items to be shipped; (ii) Their military or civilian uses; (iii) The unrestricted availability abroad of the same orcomparable items; (iv) The country of destination; (v) The ultimate end-users in the country of destination; and (vi) The intended end-use. (4) Although each proposed transaction is considered individually,items described in Advisory Notes on the Commerce Control List are morelikely to be approved than others. (5) In recognition of efforts made to adopt safeguard measures forexports and reexports, Bulgaria, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania,Mongolia, and Russia are accorded enhanced favorable considerationlicensing treatment. (6) The general policy for Cambodia and Laos is to approve licenseapplications when BXA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that theitems are for an authorized use in Cambodia or Laos and are not likelyto be diverted to another country or use contrary to the nationalsecurity or foreign policy controls of the United States. (7) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensingpolicy is to approve applications, except that those items that wouldmake a direct and significant contribution to electronic and anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, power projection, and airsuperiority receive extended review or denial. Each application will beconsidered individually. Items may be approved even though they maycontribute to Chinese military development or the end-user or end-useis military. Note that the Advisory Notes in the CCL headed ``Note forthe People's Republic of China'' provide guidance on equipment likelyto be approved more rapidly for China. (c) Contract sanctity.

Licenses for these items are required to alldestinations, except Canada, as indicated by MT Column 1 of the CountryChart (see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). (2) The term ``missiles'' is defined as rocket systems (includingballistic missile systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets)and unmanned air vehicle systems (including cruise missile systems,target drones, and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering atleast 500 kilograms (kg) payload to a range of at least 300 kilometers(km). (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport itemsidentified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chartcolumn of the ``License Requirements'' section will be considered on acase-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport wouldmake a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles.Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained inCategory 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be consideredmore favorably if such exports or reexports are determined to bedestined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marinevessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for suchapplications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a materialcontribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will bedenied. (2) The following factors are among those that will be consideredin reviewing individual applications. (i) The specific nature of the end-use; (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of itscontribution to the design, development, production, or use ofmissiles; (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and spaceprograms of the recipient country; (iv) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country; (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design,development, production, or use of missiles that are given in aparticular case; and (vi) The existence of a preexisting contract.

The licensing policies for the export, reexport, orin-country transfer of high performance computers are set forth inSec. 742.12 of this part. (a) Safeguard conditions. Following interagency review of theapplication, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) will instructthe exporter to submit a safeguard plan signed by the ultimateconsignee and certified by the export control authorities of theimporting country (see Certification by export control authoritiesof importing country in this Supplement). The safeguard plan mustindicate that the ultimate consignee agrees to implement thosesafeguards required by the BXA as a condition of issuing thelicense. BXA will inform exporters concerning which of the followingsafeguards will be imposed as license conditions: (1) The applicant will assume responsibility for providingadequate security against physical diversion of the computer duringshipment (e.g., delivery by either attended or monitored shipment,using the most secure route possible--this precludes using theservices or facilities of any country in Computer Tier 4). (2) There will be no reexport or intra-country transfer of thecomputer without prior written authorization from BXA. (3) The computer systems will be used only for those activitiesapproved on the license or reexport authorization. (4) There will be no changes either in the end-users or the end-uses indicated on the license without prior written authorization byBXA. (5) Only software that supports the approved end-uses will beshipped with the computer system. (6) The end-user will station security personnel at the computerusing facility to ensure that the appropriate security measures areimplemented. (7) The exporter will station representatives at the computerusing facility, or make such individuals readily available, to guidethe security personnel in the implementation and operation of thesecurity measures. (8) The security personnel will undertake the following measuresunder the guidance of the exporter's representatives: (i) The physical security of the computer using facility; (ii) The establishment of a system to ensure the round-the-clocksupervision of computer security; (iii) The inspection, if necessary, of any program or softwareto be run on the computer system in order to ensure that all usageconforms to the conditions of the license; (iv) The suspension, if necessary, of any run in progress andthe inspection of any output generated by the computer to determinewhether the program runs or output conform with the conditions ofthe license; (v) The inspection of usage logs daily to ensure conformity withthe conditions of the license and the retention of records of theselogs for at least a year; (vi) The determination of the acceptability of computer users toensure conformity with the conditions of the license; (vii) The immediate reporting of any security breaches orsuspected security breaches to the government of the importingcountry and to the exporter's representatives; (viii) The execution of the following key tasks:(A) Establishment of new accounts;(B) Assignment of passwords;(C) Random sampling of data;(D) Generation of daily logs; (ix) The maintenance of the integrity and security of tapes anddata files containing archived user files, log data, or systembackups. (9) The exporter's representatives will be present when certainkey functions are being carried out (e.g., the establishment of newaccounts, the assignment of passwords, the random sampling of data,the generating of daily logs, the setting of limits to computerresources available to users in the development mode, thecertification of[[Page 12801]]programs for conformity to the approved end-uses before they areallowed to run in the production mode, and the modification topreviously certified production programs). (10) The security personnel and the exporter's representativeswill provide monthly reports on the usage of the computer system andon the implementation of the safeguards. (11) The computer system will be housed in one secure buildingand protected against theft and unauthorized entry at all times. (12) Restricted nationals, i.e., nationals of Computer Tier 4countries, will not be allowed access to computers: (i) No physical or computational access to computers may begranted to restricted nationals without prior written authorizationfrom BXA, except that commercial consignees as described in thisSupplement are prohibited only from giving such nationals user-accessible programmability without prior written authorization; (ii) No passwords or IDs may be issued to restricted nationals; (iii) No work may be performed on the computer on behalf ofrestricted nationals; and (iv) No conscious or direct ties may be established to networks(including their subscribers) operated by restricted nationals. (13) Physical access to the computer, the operator consoles, andsensitive storage areas of the computer using facility will becontrolled by the security personnel, under the guidance andmonitoring of the exporter's representatives, and will be limited tothe fewest number of people needed to maintain and run the computersystem. (14) The computer will be equipped with the necessary softwareto: Permit access to authorized persons only, detect attempts togain unauthorized access, set and maintain limits on usage,establish accountability for usage, and generate logs and otherrecords of usage. This software will also maintain the integrity ofdata and program files, the accounting and audit system, thepassword or computational access control system, and the operatingsystem itself. (i) The operating system will be configured so that all jobs canbe designated and tracked as either program development jobs or asproduction jobs. (ii) In the program development mode, users will be free,following verification that their application conforms to the agreedend-use, to create, edit, or modify programs, to use utilities suchas editors, debuggers, or compilers and to verify program operation.Programs in the development mode will be subject to inspection asprovided by paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this Supplement. (iii) In the production mode, users will have access to the fullrange of computer resources, but will be prohibited from modifyingany program or using utilities that could modify any program. Beforebeing allowed to run in the production mode, a program will have tobe certified for conformity to approved end-uses by the securitypersonnel and the exporter's representatives. (iv) Programs certified for execution in the production modewill be protected from unauthorized modification by appropriatesoftware and physical security measures. Any modifications topreviously certified production programs will be approved by thesecurity personnel under the guidance and monitoring of theexporter's representatives. (v) The computer will be provided with accounting and auditsoftware to ensure that detailed logs are maintained to record allcomputer usage. A separate log of security-related events will alsobe kept. (vi) For each job executed in the production mode, the operatingsystem will record execution characteristics in order to permitgeneration of a statistical profile of the program executed. (15) The source code of the operating system will be accessibleonly to the exporter's representatives. Only those individuals willmake changes in this source code. (16) The security personnel, under the guidance of theexporter's representatives, will change passwords for individualsfrequently and at unpredictable intervals. (17) The security personnel, under the guidance of theexporter's representatives, will have the right to deny passwords toanyone. Passwords will be denied to anyone whose activity does notconform to the conditions of the license. (18) Misuse of passwords by users will result in denial offurther access to the computer. (19) The exporter's representatives will install a strictpassword system and provide guidance on its implementation. (20) Only the exporter's representatives will be trained inmaking changes in the password system and only they will make suchchanges. (21) No computer will be networked to other computers outsidethe computer center without prior authorization from BXA. (22) Generally, remote terminals will not be allowed outside thecomputer using facility without prior authorization by BXA. Ifremote terminals are specifically authorized by the license: (i) The terminals will have physical security equivalent to thesafeguards at the computer using facility; (ii) The terminals will be constrained to minimal amounts ofcomputer resources (CPU time, memory access, number of input-outputoperations, and other resources); (iii) The terminals will not be allowed direct computationalaccess to the computer (i.e., the security personnel, under theguidance of the exporter's representatives, will validate thepassword and identity of the user of any remote terminals before anysuch user is permitted to access the computer); all terminals willbe connected to the computer system by a dedicated access line and anetwork access controller. (23) There will be no direct input to the computer from remoteterminals. Any data originating from outside the computer usingfacility, except for direct input from terminals within the samecompound as the computer using facility, will first be processed bya separate processor or network access controller in order to permitexamination of the data prior to its entry into the computer. (24) The exporter will perform all maintenance of the computersystem. (25) Spare parts kept on site will be limited to the minimumamount. Spares will be kept in an area accessible only to theexporter's representatives. These representatives will maintain astrict audit system to account for all spare parts. (26) No development or production technology on the computersystem will be sent with the computer to the ultimate consignee. (27) The end-user must immediately report any suspicions orfacts concerning possible violations of the safeguards to theexporter and to the export control authorities of the importingcountry. (28) The exporter must immediately report any informationconcerning possible violations of the safeguards to BXA. A violationof the safeguards might constitute grounds for suspension ortermination of the license, preventing the shipment of unshippedspare parts, or the denial of additional licenses for spare parts,etc. (29) The end-user will be audited quarterly by an independentconsultant who has been approved by the export control authoritiesof the importing and exporting countries, but is employed at theexpense of the end-user. The consultant will audit the computerusage and the implementation of the safeguards. (30) The installation and operation of the computer will becoordinated and controlled by the following management structure: (i) Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will comprisenationals of the importing country who will oversee the managementand operation of the computer. (ii) Security Staff. The Security Staff will be selected by theend-user or the government of the importing country to ensure thatthe required safeguards are implemented. This staff will beresponsible for conducting an annual audit to evaluate physicalsecurity, administrative procedures, and technical controls. (iii) Technical Consultative Committee. This committee willcomprise technical experts from the importing country and theexporting company who will provide guidance in operating andmaintaining the computer. At least one member of the committee willbe an employee of the exporter. The committee will approve allaccounts and maintain an accurate list of all users. In addition,the committee will advise the Steering Committee and the SecurityStaff concerning the security measures needed to ensure compliancewith the safeguards required by the license. (31) An ultimate consignee who is a multiple-purpose end-user,such as a university, will establish a peer review group comprisingexperts who represent each department or application area authorizedfor use on the computer under the conditions of the license. Thisgroup shall have the following responsibilities: (i) Review all requests for computer usage and makerecommendations concerning the acceptability of all projects andusers; (ii) Submit these recommendations to the Security Staff andTechnical Consultative Committee for review and approval (seeparagraph (a)(28) of this Supplement); (iii) Establish acceptable computer resource parameters for eachproject and[[Page 12802]]review the results to verify their conformity with the authorizedend-uses, restrictions, and parameters; and (iv) Prepare monthly reports that would include a description ofany runs exceeding the established parameters and submit them to thesecurity staff. (32) The end-user will also cooperate with any post-shipmentinquiries or inspections by the U.S. Government or exporting companyofficials to verify the disposition and/or use of the computer,including access to the following: (i) Usage logs, which should include, at a minimum, computerusers, dates, times of use, and amount of system time used; (ii) Computer access authorization logs, which should include,at a minimum, computer users, project names, and purpose ofprojects. (33) The end-user will also cooperate with the U.S. Governmentor exporting company officials concerning the physical inspection ofthe computer using facility, on short notice, at least once a yearand will provide access to all data relevant to computer usage. Thisinspection will include: (i) Analyzing any programs or software run on the computer toensure that all usage complies with the authorized end-uses on thelicense. This will be done by examining user files (e.g., sourcecodes, machine codes, input/output data) that are either on-line atthe time of the inspection or that have been previously sampled andsecurely stored. (ii) Checking current and archived usage logs for conformitywith the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed by thelicense. (iii) Verifying the acceptability of all computer users inconformity with the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposedby the license. (34) Usage requests that exceed the quantity of monthly CPU timespecified on the license shall not be approved without prior writtenauthorization from the BXA. Requests for computational accessapproval shall include a description of the intended purpose forwhich access is sought. (35) In addition to, or in lieu of, the normal access by on-siteexporting company staff or its representatives, the company, whenrequired by the exporting government, will provide a separate remoteelectronic access capability to the computer for the purposes ofmaintenance, troubleshooting, inspection of work in progress, andauditing of all work performed on the computer. On-site and centralexporting company hardware and software maintenance facilities, atthe direction of the exporting company staff or its representatives,to gather information such as: (i) Statistical profiles of production jobs; (ii) Logs of jobs run in both production and development mode; (iii) Logs and reports of security related events. If such method is used, the remote maintenance facilities willbe considered part of the operating system and protectedaccordingly, and will be available only to exporting companyoperational staff or its representatives. The maintenance hardwareand software and associated communication links will be protected toensure the integrity and authenticity of data and programs and toprevent tampering with hardware. (36) The export company staff or its representatives will berequired to provide personnel for a specified period of time at thecomputer facility for management, operation, and safeguarding of thecomputer. (b) Certification by export control authorities of importingcountry. (1) The following importing government certification may berequired under Sec. 742.12 of this part: This is to certify that (name of ultimate consignee) hasdeclared to (name of appropriate foreign government agency) that thecomputer (model name) will be used only for the purposes specifiedin the end-use statement and that the ultimate consignee willestablish and adhere to all the safeguard conditions and perform allother undertakings described in the end-use statement. The (name of appropriate foreign government agency) will advisethe United States Government of any evidence that might reasonablyindicate the existence of circumstances (e.g., transfer ofownership) that could affect the objectives of the securitysafeguard conditions. (2) Other importing government assurances regarding prohibitedactivities may also be required on a case-by-case basis. (c) Commercial consignees. Exports or reexports of computers that are solely dedicated tothe following non-scientific and non-technical commercial businessuses will usually be eligible for a reduced set of securitysafeguard conditions: (1) Financial services (e.g., banking, securities and commodityexchanges); (2) Insurance; (3) Reservation systems; (4) Point-of-sales systems; (5) Mailing list maintenance for marketing purposes; (6) Inventory control for retail/wholesale distribution.PART 744--CONTROL POLICY: END-USER AND END-USE BASEDSec.744.1 General provisions.744.2 Restrictions on certain nuclear end-uses.744.3 Restrictions on certain missile end-uses.744.4 Restrictions on certain chemical and biological weapons end-uses.744.5 Restrictions on certain maritime nuclear propulsion end-uses.744.6 Restrictions on certain activities of U.S. persons.744.7 Restrictions on certain exports to and for the use of certainforeign vessels or aircraft.744.8 Restrictions on certain exports to all countries for Libyanaircraft.Supplement No. 1 to Part 744--Missile Technology ProjectsSupplement No. 2 to Part 744--[Reserved]Supplement No. 3 to Part 744--Countries Not Subject to Certain NuclearEnd-Use Restrictions in Sec. 744.2(a) Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;22 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2139a; E.O. 12058, 3 CFR, 1978Comp., p. 179; E.O. 12851, 3 CFR 1993 Comp., p. 608; E.O. 12924, 3CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; E.O. 12938, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 950;Notice of August 15, 1995 (60 FR 42767, August 17, 1995).Sec. 744.1 General provisions. (a) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR arereferences to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part containsprohibitions against exports, reexports, and selected transfers tocertain end-users and end-uses as introduced under General ProhibitionFour (Denial Orders) and prohibitions against exports or reexports tocertain end-uses as introduced, under General Prohibition Five (End-use/End-users). Sections 744.2, 744.3, 744.4, and 744.5 prohibitexports and reexports of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear,missile, chemical and biological weapons, and nuclear maritime end-uses. Section 744.6 prohibits certain activities by U.S. persons insupport of certain nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological end-usesregardless of whether that support involves the export or reexport ofitems subject to the EAR. Sections 744.7 and 744.8 prohibit exports andreexports of certain items for certain aircraft and vessels. Inaddition, these sections include license review standards for exportlicense applications submitted as required by these sections. It shouldalso be noted that part 764 of the EAR prohibits exports, reexports andcertain in-country transfers of items subject to the EAR to deniedparties. (b) Steps. The following are steps you should follow in using theprovisions of this part: (1) Review end-use and end-user prohibitions. First, review eachend-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn thescope of these prohibitions. (2) Determine applicability. Second, determine whether any of theend-use and end-user prohibitions described in this part are applicableto your planned export, reexport, or other activity. See Supplement No.1 to part 732 for guidance.Sec. 744.2 Restrictions on certain nuclear end-uses. (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirementsfor items[[Page 12803]]specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport to anydestination, other than countries in the Supplement No. 3 to this part,any item subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of theexport or reexport you know 1 the item will be used directly orindirectly in any one or more of the following activities described inparagraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section: \1\ Part 772 of the EAR defines ``knowledge'' for all of theEAR except part 760, Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts. Thedefinition, which includes variants such as ``know'' and ``reason toknow'', encompasses more than positive knowledge. Thus, the use of``know'' in this section in place of the former wording ``know orhave reason to know'' does not lessen or otherwise change theresponsibilities of persons subject to the EAR.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Nuclear explosive activities. Nuclear explosive activities,including research on or development, design, manufacture,construction, testing or maintenance of any nuclear explosive device,or components or subsystems of such a device.\2\ \3\ \2\ Nuclear explosive devices and any article, material,equipment, or device specifically designed or specially modified foruse in the design, development, or fabrication of nuclear weapons ornuclear explosive devices are subject to export licensing or otherrequirements of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S.Department of State, or the licensing or other restrictionsspecified in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Similarly,items specifically designed or specifically modified for use indevising, carrying out, or evaluating nuclear weapons tests ornuclear explosions (except such items as are in normal commercialuse for other purposes) are subject to the same requirements. \3\ Also see Secs. 744.5 and 748.4 of the EAR for specialprovisions relating to technical data for maritime nuclearpropulsion plants and other commodities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (2) Unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Activities including researchon, or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, ormaintenance of any nuclear reactor, critical facility, facility for thefabrication of nuclear fuel, facility for the conversion of nuclearmaterial from one chemical form to another, or separate storageinstallation, where there is no obligation to accept InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the relevant facility orinstallation when it contains any source or special fissionablematerial (regardless of whether or not it contains such material at thetime of export), or where any such obligation is not met. (3) Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Safeguardedand unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities, including research onor development, design, manufacture, construction, operation ormaintenance of any of the following facilities, or components for suchfacilities: 4 \4\ Such activities may also require a specific authorizationfrom the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Sec. 57.b.(2) of the AtomicEnergy Act of 1954, as amended, as implemented by the Department ofEnergy's regulations published in 10 CFR 810.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) Facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated specialnuclear or source material; (ii) Facilities for the production of heavy water; (iii) Facilities for the separation of isotopes of source andspecial nuclear material; or (iv) Facilities for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuelcontaining plutonium. (b) Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed byBXA. BXA may inform an exporter or reexporter, either individually byspecific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license isrequired for export or reexport of specified items to specified end-users, because BXA has determined that there is an unacceptable risk ofuse in, or diversion to, any of the activities described in paragraph(a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at thedirection of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration.When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a writtennotice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretaryfor Export Administration. The absence of any such notification doesnot excuse the exporter or reexporter from compliance with the licenserequirements of paragraph (a) of this section. (c) Exceptions. Despite the prohibitions described in paragraph (a)and (b) of this section, you may export technology subject to the EARunder the License Exception provided in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR foroperating technology and software (OTS) and under the License Exceptionprovided in Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR for sales technology (STS) butonly to and for use in countries listed in Country Group A:1 (seeSupplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) and New Zealand. All the termsand conditions of License Exception 13 apply except that this exceptionmay only be used for exports to the countries listed in Country GroupA:1 and New Zealand notwithstanding the provisions of part 740 of theEAR. (d) License review standards. The following factors are among thoseused by the United States to determine whether to grant or deny licenseapplications required under this section: (1) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to betransferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether thatstated end-use is appropriate for the end-user; (2) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particularcommodity, software, or technology; (3) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be exportedare to be used in research on or for the development, design,manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of anyreprocessing or enrichment facility; (4) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use fornuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case; (5) Whether the end-user has been engaged in clandestine or illegalprocurement activities; (6) Whether an application for a license to export to the end-userhas previously been denied, or whether the end-use has previouslydiverted items received under a license, License Exception, or NLR tounauthorized activities; (7) Whether the export would present an unacceptable risk ofdiversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclearfuel-cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2 of this part; and (8) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country,based on consideration of the following factors: (i) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition ofNuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) (see SupplementNo. 2 to part 742 of the EAR), or to a similar international legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement; (ii) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclearactivities, facilities or installations that are operational, beingdesigned, or under construction, under International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards; (iii) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civiluses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country; (iv) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of thegovernment of the importing country are in support of nuclearnonproliferation and whether that government is in compliance with itsinternational obligations in the field of nonproliferation; (v) The degree to which the government of the importing countrycooperates in nonproliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness toconsult on international nonproliferation issues); (vi) Intelligence data on the importing country's nuclearintentions and activities.[[Page 12804]]Sec. 744.3 Restrictions on certain missile end-uses. (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirementsfor items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport an itemsubject to the EAR to any destination, including Canada, without alicense if at the time of the export or reexport you know the item: (1) Is destined to or for a project listed in the footnote toCountry Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or (2) Will be used in the design, development, production or use ofmissiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4, whether or notthat use involves a listed project. (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA mayinform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specificnotice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required fora specific export or reexport, or for exports or reexports of specifieditems to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk ofuse in or diversion to activities described in paragraph (a) of thissection, anywhere in the world. Specific notice is to be given only by,or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for ExportAdministration. When such notice is provided orally, it will befollowed by a written notice within two working days signed by theDeputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, theabsence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter fromcompliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of thissection. An illustrative list of projects is included in a footnote toCountry Group D:4. Exporters and reexporters are deemed to have beeninformed that an individual license is required to export or reexportto these projects.

In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFRchapter VII, subchapter C. This part implements broad based controlsfor items and activities subject to the EAR imposed to implement orU.S. government policies. Two categories of controls are included inthis part. (a) Comprehensive controls. This part contains or refers to all theBXA licensing requirements, licensing policies, and License Exceptionsfor countries subject to general embargoes, currently Cuba, Libya,North Korea, Iran and Iraq. This part is the focal point for all theEAR requirements for transactions involving these countries. (1) Cuba, Libya, North Korea. All the items on the Commerce ControlList (CCL) require a license to Cuba, Libya, or North Korea. Inaddition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on theCCL, designated by the Number ``EAR99'', require a license to Cuba,Libya, and North Korea. Most items requiring a license to thesedestinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because thesecontrols extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in theCountry Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in theCommerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR. (2) Iran and Iraq. While BXA maintains controls on exports andreexports to Iran and Iraq, comprehensive embargoes on transactionsinvolving these countries are administered by the Department of theTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). (b) Rwanda. The second category of EAR controls apply to Rwandaincluded in this part are those that are supplemental to controls setforth in the Country Chart in part 738. Such controls[[Page 12807]]are listed under each affected ECCN on the CCL in part 774 of the EAR. (c) This part also contains descriptions of controls maintained bythe Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department and byOffice of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State.Comprehensive embargoes and supplemental controls implemented by BXAunder the EAR usually also involve controls on items and activitiesmaintained by these agencies. This part sets forth the allocation oflicensing responsibilities between BXA and these other agencies.References to the requirements of other agencies are informational; forcurrent, complete, and authoritative requirements, you should consultthe appropriate agency's regulations. (d) Supplement No. 1 to this part provides you with generalinformation on United Nations sanctions administered by the Departmentof the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (31 CFR part590) on UNITA in Angola. (e) Supplement No. 2 to this part provides you with generalinformation on United Nations arms embargoes administered by theDepartment of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) on all the countriesof the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Slovenia),Liberia and Somalia.

(a) Disclosure and substantiation of facts on license applications.You, as the applicant, are required to make the complete disclosure ofall parties in interest to the transaction so that BXA may decide onthe license application with the fullest knowledge of all relevantfacts.

(b) Applications for the export of items from the United States. Alicense application to export items from the United States may be madeonly by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States whois in fact the exporter, or by the applicant's duly authorized agent.This limitation does not apply to applications for the reexport ofitems previously exported. An application may be made on behalf of aperson not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States by anauthorized agent in the United States, who then becomes the applicant. (c) Prohibited from applying for a license. No person convicted ofa violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the ExportAdministration Act, as amended, at the discretion of the Secretary ofCommerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years fromthe date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR. (d) Prior action on a shipment.

(2) Licenses for items previously exported. You may not submit alicense application to BXA covering a shipment that is already ladenaboard the exporting carrier, exported or reexported. If such export orreexport should not have been made without first securing a licenseauthorizing the shipment, you must send a letter of explanation to theOffice of Export Enforcement, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th andPennsylvania Avenue, N.W., H4520, Washington, D.C., 20230. The lettermust state why a license was not obtained and disclose all factsconcerning the shipment that would normally have been disclosed on thelicense application. You will be informed of any action and furnishedany instructions by the Office of Export Enforcement. (e) Multiple shipments. Your license application need not belimited to a single shipment, but may represent a reasonable estimateof items to be shipped throughout the validity of the license.

Citethe Application Control Number on your original application in Block 24on the new license application. (h) Emergency processing.

This office may be reached bytelephone on (202) 482-4811 or by facsimile on (202) 482-3617. Theseprocedures do not apply to emergency handling of Special ComprehensiveLicense applications. (1) How to request emergency handling. If your license applicationis already pending with BXA, contact the Exporter Counseling Divisiondirectly on either number listed in paragraph (h) of this section. Ifyou have not yet submitted your license application, include a writtenletter with the title ``Emergency Handling Request'' with your licenseapplication. The letter must include: (i) A justification for the request, supported, where appropriate,with copies of orders, communications, or other documentation tosubstantiate that your request constitutes a valid emergency. You maybe specifically requested to supply other documents not included withyour submission.[[Continued on page 12814]][Federal Register: March 25, 1996 (Rules and Regulations)][Page 12814-12864]From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov][[pp. 12814-12864]] Export Administration Regulation; Simplification of ExportAdministration Regulations[[Continued from page 12813]][[Page 12814]] (ii) An acknowledgement by you that any license issued under theseemergency procedures will have a limited validity period as describedin Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR, and that it generally will not beextended. (2) Prompt delivery of emergency handling requests. You areresponsible for prompt delivery of your request and license applicationto BXA. You may hand-carry your request and license application or usethe services of an overnight courier to ensure prompt delivery. If youdesire to hand-carry your request and license application, you may handdeliver it to the Exporter Counseling Division at the address stated inSec. 748.2(a) of this part. If you decide to use an overnight courier,use the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part. The envelopecontaining your license application should be labeled ``Attn: ExporterCounseling Division, Emergency Handling Request Enclosed''. (3) Review of emergency handling requests. BXA views an emergencyas an unforeseeable situation over which you have no control. On theday of receipt, BXA will evaluate your license application and decidewhether emergency handling is warranted. Frequent emergency requestwill be given particularly close scrutiny. This procedure is notdesigned to become a substitute for timely filing of licenseapplications. (4) Action on license applications processed under emergencyprocedures. If you have submitted an emergency request, you will becontacted by the Exporter Counseling Division informing you of whetheror not your request for emergency processing has been granted. If yourlicense is approved under emergency handling procedures, you will benotified by BXA of the approval by telephone or in person. You will begiven the license number and verbal authorization to effect shipmentimmediately, without waiting for the actual license. Any licenseapproved under these emergency handling procedures will have a limitedvalidity period as described in Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR.Sec. 748.5 Parties to the transaction on a license application. (a) Applicant. (1) The ``applicant'' is defined as the person who,as the principal party in interest in the transaction, has the powerand responsibility for determining and controlling the exporting orreexporting of the items. BXA is primarily concerned with the identityof the applicant and the applicant's role in the transaction, and notthe terms of sale. (2) Ordinarily, a seller who delivers items in the United States toa foreign buyer, or to the latter's forwarder or other agent, would notbe in a position to assume responsibility for the export and would notbe a proper applicant. This would normally be the situation where saleis made f.o.b. factory, although such terms of sale may relate only toprice and are not necessarily inconsistent with the assumption by theseller of full responsibility for effecting the export or reexport. Theseller can still be liable if the seller knows that the importer or itsagent will not obtain the required license. (3) If the seller intends to leave the responsibility for effectingan export or reexport in the hands of the foreign importer or thelatter's forwarding or purchasing agent in the United States, theforeign importer should apply for the license in the foreign importer'sown name if the foreign importer is subject to the jurisdiction of theUnited States at the time of export. Otherwise, the importer'sforwarding or purchasing agent or other person subject to thejurisdiction of the U.S. must appear as applicant and exporter. In thissituation you, as the applicant, must disclose your role as agent andthe name of your principal. (b) Order party. The order party is that person in the UnitedStates who conducted the direct negotiations or correspondence with theforeign purchaser or ultimate consignee and who, as a result of thesenegotiations, received the order from the foreign purchaser or ultimateconsignee. (c) Purchaser. The purchaser is that person abroad who has enteredinto the transaction with the applicant to purchase an item fordelivery to the ultimate consignee. A bank, freight forwarder,forwarding agent, or other intermediary is not the purchaser. Thepurchaser and ultimate consignee may be the same entity. (d) Intermediate consignee. The intermediate consignee is the bank,forwarding agent, or other intermediary (if any) who acts in a foreigncountry as an agent for the exporter or reexporter, the purchaser, orthe ultimate consignee, for the purpose of effecting delivery of theexport or reexport to the ultimate consignee. (e) Ultimate consignee. The ultimate consignee is the personlocated abroad who is the true party in interest in actually receivingthe export for the designated end-use. A bank, freight forwarder,forwarding agent, or other party, when acting as an intermediary, isnot acceptable as the ultimate consignee.Sec. 748.6 General instructions for license applications. (a) Form and instructions. An application for license, whether toexport or reexport, must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, MultipurposeApplication (revised June 15, 1996 or later), and Form BXA-748P-A, ItemAppendix, and Form BXA-748P-B, End-User Appendix. Facsimiles or copiesof these forms are not acceptable. Instructions for preparing Form BXA-748P are contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part 748. SeeSec. 748.7(a) of this part for instructions on submitting licenseapplications electronically. (b) Application Control Number. Each application form includes apreprinted Application Control Number. The Application Control Number,consisting of a letter followed by six digits, is for use by BXA whenprocessing applications, and by applicants when communicating with BXAconcerning pending applications. This number is used for trackingpurposes within the U.S. Government. The Application Control Number isnot a license number. (c) Approval or denial in entirety. License applications may beapproved in whole or in part, denied in whole or in part, or returnedwithout action. However, you may specifically request that your licenseapplication be considered as a whole and either approved or denied inits entirety. (d) Combining items on license applications. Any items may becombined on a single application, however, if the items differdramatically (e.g., computers and shotguns) the number of BXA officesto which a license application may be referred for review may increasesignificantly. Accordingly, it is recommended that you limit items oneach license application to those that are similar and/or related. (e) Assembly and additional information. All documents orcorrespondence accompanying your license application should bear theApplication Control Number, and be stapled together. Where necessary,BXA may require you to submit additional information beyond that statedin the EAR confirming or amplifying information contained in yourlicense application. (f) Changes in facts. Answers to all items on the licenseapplication will be deemed to be continuing representations of theexisting facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change inthe terms of the order, or in the facts relating to the transaction,must be promptly reported to BXA, whether a license has been granted orthe license application is still[[Page 12815]]under consideration. If a license has been granted and such changes arenot excepted in Sec. 750.7(c) of the EAR, they must be reportedimmediately to BXA, even though shipments against the license may bepartially or wholly completed, during the validity period of thelicense. (g) Request for extended license validity period. An extendedvalidity period will generally be granted if your transaction isrelated to a multi-year project, when production lead time will notpermit export or reexport during the normal validity period or forother similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spareor replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validityperiod. To request an extended validity period, include justificationfor your request in Block 24 on the application.Sec. 748.7 Applying electronically for a license or Classificationrequest. (a) Authorization. You may apply electronically once you have beenauthorized to do so by BXA. An authorization to submit applicationselectronically may be limited or withdrawn by BXA at any time.

(ii) Your company may reveal the assigned company identificationnumber only to the PIN holders, their supervisors, employees, or agentsof the company with a commercial justification for knowing the companyidentification number. (iii) An individual PIN holder may not: (A) Disclose the PIN to anyone; (B) Record the PIN either in writing or electronically; (C) Authorize another person to use the PIN; or (D) Use the PIN following termination by BXA or your company ofyour authorization or approval for PIN use. (iv) To prevent misuse of the PIN: (A) If a PIN is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the companyand the PIN holder must report the loss, theft or compromise of the PINimmediately by telephoning BXA at (202) 482-0436.

These instructions may be modified by BXAfrom time to time. (2) License Applications. The electronic submission of anapplication for license will constitute an export control document.Such submissions must provide the same information as writtenapplications and are subject to the recordkeeping provisions of part762 of the EAR. The applicant company and PIN holder submitting theapplication will be deemed to make all representations andcertifications as if the submission were made in writing by the companyand signed by the submitting PIN holder. Electronic submission of alicense application will be considered complete upon the transmittal ofthe application to BXA or to an entity under contract to receive suchapplications for BXA. (c) Maintenance of a log.

BXA will not seek or undertake to giveconsideration to recommendations from the foreign government as to theaction to be taken on a license application. A supporting documentissued by a foreign government will be only one of the factors uponwhich BXA will base its licensing action, since end-uses and otherconsiderations are important factors in the decision making process. (i) Request for return of support documents submitted to BXA. If anapplicant is requested by a foreign importer to return an unused orpartially used Import or End-User Certificate submitted to BXA insupport of a license application, the procedure provided in thisparagraph (i) should be followed: (1) The applicant must send a letter request for return of anImport or End-User Certificate to the address stated in Sec. 748.2(c)of this part, ``Attn: Import/End-User Certificate Request''.

You must make a copy of the certificate before you return theoriginal to the importer. This copy must show all the informationcontained on the original certificate including any notation made onthe certificate by BXA.

(d) Where to obtain Import and End-User Certificates. SeeSupplement No. 4 to this part for a list of the authoritiesadministering the Import Certificate/Delivery Verification and End-UserCertificate Systems in other countries. (e) Triangular symbol on International Import Certificates.

(a) Grace periods. Whenever the requirement for an Import or End-User Certificate or Statement by Ultimate Consignee or Purchaser isimposed or extended by a change in the regulations, the licenseapplication need not conform to the new support documentationrequirements for a period of 45 days after the effective date of theregulatory change published in the Federal Register. (1) Requirements are usually imposed or extended by virtue of oneof the following: (i) Addition or removal of national security controls over aparticular item; or (ii) Development of an Import Certificate/Delivery Verification orEnd-User Certificate program by a foreign country; or (iii) Removal of an item from eligibility under the SpecialComprehensive License described in part 752 of the EAR, when you holdsuch a special license and have been exporting the item under thatlicense. (2) License applications filed during the 45 day grace period mustbe accompanied by any evidence available to you that will supportrepresentations concerning the ultimate consignee, ultimatedestination, and end use, such as copies of the order, letters ofcredit, correspondence between you and ultimate consignee, or otherdocuments received from the ultimate consignee. You must also identifythe regulatory change (including its effective date) that justifiesexercise of the 45 day grace period. Note that an Import or End-UserCertificate will not be accepted, after the stated grace period, forlicense applications involving items that are no longer controlled fornational security reasons. If an item is removed from national securitycontrols, you must obtain a Statement by Ultimate Consignee andPurchaser as described in Sec. 748.11 of this part. Likewise, any itemnewly controlled for national security purposes requires support of anImport or End-User Certificate as described in Sec. 748.10 of this partafter expiration of the stated grace period. (b) Reexports. If a support document would be required for anexport, the same document would be required for reexport to CountryGroup D:1 and E:2 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). (c) Granting of exceptions to the support documentationrequirement. An exception to obtaining the required supportdocumentation will be considered by BXA, however, an exception will notbe granted contrary to the objectives of the U.S. export controlprogram. A request for exception may involve either a singletransaction, or where the reason necessitating the request iscontinuing in nature, multiple transactions. If satisfied by theevidence presented, BXA may waive the support document requirement andaccept the license application for processing. Favorable considerationof a request for exception generally will be given in instances wherethe support document requirement: (1) Imposes an undue hardship on you and/or ultimate consignee(e.g., refusal by the foreign government to issue an Import or End-UserCertificate and such refusal constitutes discrimination against you);or (2) Cannot be complied with (e.g., the items will be held in aforeign trade zone or bonded warehouse for subsequent distribution inone or more countries); or (3) Is not applicable to the transaction (e.g., the items will notbe imported for consumption into the named country of destination). (d) Procedures for requesting an exception. (1) Requests forexception must be submitted with the license application to which therequest relates. Where the request relates to more than one licenseapplication it should be submitted with the first license applicationand referred to in Block 24 on any subsequent license application. Therequest for exception must be submitted in writing on the applicant'sletterhead. (2) In instances where you are requesting exception from obtainingan Import or End-User Certificate, the request must be accompanied by amanually-signed original Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaseras described in Sec. 748.11 of this part. (3) At a minimum, the letter request must include: (i) Name and address of ultimate consignee; (ii) Name and address of purchaser, if different from ultimateconsignee; (iii) Location of foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse if theitems will be exported to a foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse; (iv) Type of request, i.e., whether for a single transaction ormultiple transactions; (v) Full explanation of the reason(s) for requesting the exception; (vi) Nature and duration of the business relationship between youand ultimate consignee and purchaser shown on the license application; (vii) Whether you have previously obtained and/or submitted to BXAan Import or End-User Certificate issued in the name of the ultimateconsignee and/or purchaser, and a list of the Application ControlNumber(s) to which the certificate(s) applied; and (viii) Any other facts to justify granting an exception. (4) Action by BXA. (i) Single transaction request. Where a singletransaction is involved, BXA will act on the request for exception atthe same time as the license application with which the request issubmitted. In those instances where the related license application isapproved, the issuance of the license will serve as an automatic noticeto the applicant that the exception was approved. If any restrictionsare placed on granting of the exception, these will appear on theapproval. If the request for exception is not approved, BXA will adviseyou by letter.[[Page 12821]] (ii) Multiple transactions request. Where multiple transactions areinvolved, BXA will advise you by letter of the action taken on theexception request. The letter will contain any conditions orrestrictions that BXA finds necessary to impose (including an exceptiontermination date if appropriate). In addition, a written acceptance ofthese conditions or restrictions may be required from the parties tothe transaction. (e) Availability of original. The original certificate or statementmust be kept on file, and made available for inspection in accordancewith the provisions of part 762 of the EAR. To ensure compliance withthis recordkeeping requirement, BXA will require applicants, on arandom basis, to submit specific original certificates and statementsthat have been retained on file. Applicants will be notified in writingof any such request. Sec. 748.13 Delivery Verification (DV). (a) Scope. (1) BXA may request applicants to obtain verificationsof delivery on a selective basis. A Delivery Verification Certificate(DV) is a document issued by the government of the country of ultimatedestination after the export has taken place and the items have eitherentered the export jurisdiction of the recipient country or areotherwise accounted for by the importer to the issuing government.Governments that issue DVs are listed in Supplement No. 4 to this part. (2) If BXA decides to request verification of delivery, the requestwill appear as a condition on the face of the license. If the licenseis sent directly to a party other than the applicant authorized toreceive the license (e.g., agent, forwarder, broker, etc.), such partyis responsible for notifying the licensee immediately in writing that aDV is required. (b) Exception to obtaining Delivery Verification. The DVrequirement for a particular transaction is automatically canceled if,subsequent to the issuance of a license, the item is no longercontrolled for national security reasons. In this instance, thelicensee must send a letter to BXA at the address listed inSec. 748.2(c) of this part, stating that the items on the license areno longer controlled for national security reasons, and accordingly,the request for DV will not be fulfilled by the licensee. (c) Procedure for obtaining Delivery Verification. When notifiedthat a DV is required by BXA, the licensee must transmit to theimporter a written request for a DV at the time of making each shipmentunder the license (whenever possible, this request should be submittedtogether with the related bill of lading or air waybill). The requestmust include the number of the Import or End-User Certificate for thetransaction referred to on the license, and notify the importer thatthis same Import or End-User Certificate number should be shown on theDV. (1) The importer must obtain the DV from the appropriate governmentministry identified in Supplement No. 4 to this part, and forward thecompleted DV to the licensee. The DV must cover the items described onthe license that have been shipped. Note that BXA must be able torelate the description provided in the DV to the approved license. Inorder to ensure the same terminology is used, the licensee shouldprovide the importer with the description as it appears on the license. (2) The original copy of the DV must be sent to BXA within 90 daysafter the last shipment has been made against the license. Ifverification of delivery is required for items covered by a licenseagainst which partial shipments have been made, the licensee shallobtain the required DV for each partial shipment, and retain these onfile until all shipments have been made against the license. Once allshipments against the license have been made (or the licensee hasdetermined that none will be), the licensee must forward, in onepackage, all applicable DVs to BXA at the address listed inSec. 748.2(c) of this part. (3) The documents must be forwarded with a dated letter giving thelicense number, the name, title and signature of the authorizedrepresentative, and one of the following statements: (i) The total quantity authorized by license number ______ has beenexported, and all delivery verification documents are attached. (ii) A part of the quantity authorized by license number ______will not be exported. Delivery verification documents covering allitems exported are attached. (iii) No shipment has been made against this license, and none iscontemplated. (d) Inability to obtain Delivery Verification Certificates. If alicensee is unable to obtain the required DV (within the time framestated above, or at all) from the importer, the licensee must promptlynotify BXA and, upon request, make available all information andrecords, including correspondence, regarding the attempt to obtain theDV.Supplement No. 1 to Part 748 BXA-748P, BXA-748P-A; Item Appendix, andBXA-748P-B; End-User Appendix; Multipurpose Application Instructions All information must be legibly typed within the lines for eachBlock or Box except where a signature is required.

Under this procedure, U.S. importers aresometimes required to provide their foreign suppliers with an U.S.International Import Certificate that is validated by the U.S.Government. This certificate tells the government of the exporter'scountry that the items covered by the certificate will be importedinto the U.S. Economy and will not be reexported except asauthorized by U.S. export control regulations. In addition, in somecases, the exporter's government may require a deliveryverification. Under this procedure, the U.S. Customs Servicevalidates a certificate confirming that the items have entered theU.S. economy. The U.S. importer must return this certificate to theforeign exporter. This supplement establishes the procedures and requirements ofBXA with respect to both of these programs. Paragraph (a) of thisSupplement contains the requirements and procedures of the U.S.International Import Certificate procedure. Paragraph (b) of thisSupplement contains the requirements and procedures of the DeliveryVerification procedure. (a) U.S. International Import Certificates. If you are a U.S.importer, a foreign supplier may request you to obtain a U.S. importcertificate. The reason for this request is that the exporter'sgovernment requires a U.S. import certificate as a condition toissuing an export license. To obtain such a certificate you willhave to fill in and execute the U.S. International ImportCertificate form (Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53) and submit it tothe U.S. government agency that has jurisdiction over the items youare importing. In doing so, you will be making a representation tothe United States Government that you will import the itemsdescribed in the certificate into the United States or if not soimported, you will not divert, transship or reexport them to anotherdestination with the explicit approval of the U.S. government agencythat has jurisdiction over those items. (Representations that itemswill be entered into the U.S. do not preclude the temporaryunloading of items in a foreign trade zone for subsequent entry intothe economy of the U.S.) If the items described in the certificateare subject to U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction, theDepartment will validate the certificate and return it to you. Youmay then send the certificate to your foreign supplier. In this waythe government of the exporting country is assured that the itemswill become subject to the export control laws of the United States. (1) Items for which the U.S. Department of Commerce issues U.S.International Import Certificates and forms to use. The Departmentof Commerce issues U.S. International Import Certificates for thefollowing types of items. (i) Items controlled for National Security reasons.

The notification will include: (1) The intent to deny decision; (2) The statutory and regulatory basis for the denial; (3) To the extent consistent with the national security and foreignpolicy of the United States, the specific considerations that led tothe decision to deny the license application; (4) What, if any, modifications or restrictions to the licenseapplication would allow BXA to reconsider the license application; (5) The name of the BXA representative in a position to discuss theissues with the applicant; and (6) The availability of appeal procedures. (b) Response to intent to deny notification. You will be allowed 20days from the date of the notification to respond to the decisionbefore the license application is denied. If you respond to thenotification, BXA will advise you if, as a result of your response, thedecision to deny has been changed. Unless you are so advised by the45th day after the date of the notification, the denial will becomefinal, without further notice. You will then have 45 days from the dateof final denial to exercise the right to appeal under part 756 of theEAR.Sec. 750.7 Issuance of licenses. (a) Scope. A license authorizes only a specific transaction, orseries of transactions, as described in the license application and anysupporting documents. A license application may be approved in whole orin part or further limited by conditions or other restrictionsappearing on the license itself or in the EAR. When a licenseapplication is approved by the BXA, a license is issued as described inparagraph (b) of this section. (b) Issuance of a license. After a license application is approved,a computer generated license is issued by the Department of Commercebearing the license number and a validation date. Where appropriate,the license will also show an expiration date. Where necessary,attachments to a license will also be validated with the Department ofCommerce seal and the date of validation. Exporters must use thecomplete license number when preparing a Shipper's Export Declaration(SED) and other export control documents, and in communicating with theDepartment of Commerce concerning the license. (c) Changes to the license. The following non-material changes donot require submission of a ``Replacement'' license or any othernotification to BXA. (If you wish to make any change not identified inthis paragraph, you will need to submit a ``Replacement'' license inaccordance with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part748 of the EAR, Block 11): (1) Decrease in unit price or total value; (2) Increase in price or quantity if permitted under the shippingtolerances in Sec. 750.11 of this part; (3) Increase in price that can be justified on the basis of changesin point of delivery, port of export, or as a result of transportationcost, drayage, port charges, warehousing, currency fluctuations, etc.; (4) Establishment of unit or total price in conformance with a``price statement'' on a license that permits price to be based on themarket price at a specified date plus an exporter's mark-up, or likebasis; (5) Change in intermediate consignee if the new intermediateconsignee is located in the country of ultimate destination as shown onthe license, except a change in, or addition of, an intermediateconsignee involving a consolidated shipment; (6) Change in continuity of shipment by unloading from carrier at acountry listed in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 ofthe EAR) port not in the country of ultimate destination, without thedesignation of an intermediate consignee on the shipping documents andlicense, provided: (i) The purpose is to transfer the shipment to another vessel,barge, or vehicle, solely for onforwarding to the country ofdestination shown on the shipping documents and the license; (ii) The shipment is moving on a through bill of lading; (iii) The carrier is not registered in, owned or controlled by, orunder charter or lease to a country in Country Group D:1 or E:2 (seeSupplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or a national of any of thesecountries; (iv) The carrier retains custody of the shipment until it isdelivered to the ultimate consignee; and (v) The original bill of lading or air waybill first issued at theport of export is delivered with the shipment to the ultimateconsignee; (7) Change in address of purchaser or ultimate consignee if the newaddress is located within the same country shown on the license; or (8) Change in ECCN, unit of quantity, unit price, or wording of theitem[[Page 12833]]description (where necessary only for the purpose of conforming to anofficial revision in the CCL). This does not cover an actual change inthe item to be shipped, or an increase in the price or quantity. (d) Responsibility of the licensee. If a license is issued to you,you become the licensee. The licensee will be held accountable for useof the license, whether as a principal (exporting for your own account)or as an agent (including an agent acting for the account of a foreignprincipal who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States).You, as the licensee, assume responsibility for effecting the export orreexport, for proper use of the license, and for due performance of allof the license's terms and conditions. The obligations arising underthe provisions of the EAA and the EAR are the same whether the licenseapplication is submitted and issued in writing or electronically. (e) Prohibited use of a license. No person convicted of a violationof any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretionof the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period upto 10 years from the date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of theEAR. (f) Quantity of commodities authorized. Unlike software andtechnology, commodities will be approved with a quantity or dollarvalue limit. The ``Unit'' paragraph within each CCL commodity entrywill list a specific ``Unit'' for those commodities controlled by thatentry. Any license resulting from a license application to export orreexport commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified``Unit''. If a commodity is licensed in terms of ``$ value'', the unitof quantity commonly used in trade may also be shown on the license.Though this unit may be shown on the approved license, the quantity ofcommodities authorized is limited entirely by the total dollar valueshown on the approved license. (g) License validity period. Licenses involving the export orreexport of items will generally have a 24-month validity period,unless a different validity period has been requested and specificallyapproved by BXA. Exceptions from the 24-month validity period include,license applications reviewed and approved as an ``emergency'' (SeeSec. 748.5 (g) of the EAR), license applications for items controlledfor short supply reasons, and Special Comprehensive Licenses. Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of thecalendar month following the month in which the emergency license isissued. Licenses for items controlled for short supply reasons will belimited to a 12-month validity period. The expiration date will beclearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date fallson a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period isautomatically extended to midnight of the first day of businessfollowing the expiration date. (See part 752 of the EAR for validityperiods for Special Comprehensive Licenses.) (1) Extended validity period. Validity periods in excess of 24months generally will not be granted. BXA will consider granting avalidity period exceeding 24 months when extenuating circumstanceswarrant such an extension, however, no changes will be approved relatedto any other particular on the license (e.g., parties to thetransaction, countries of ultimate destination, etc.). For example, anextended validity period will generally be granted where thetransaction is related to a multi-year project, when production leadtime will not permit an export or reexport during the original validityperiod of the license, when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipmentwithin the 24-month validity of the license, or for other similarcircumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or replacementparts will not normally justify an extended validity period. Licensesissued in accordance with the emergency clearance provisions containedin Sec. 748.5(g) of the EAR will not be extended. See Sec. 752.9 of theEAR for information relating to the extension of a SpecialComprehensive License. (2) Request for extension. (i) The applicant must submit a letterin writing to request an extension in the validity period of apreviously approved license. The subject of the letter must be titled:``Request for Validity Period Extension'' and contain the followinginformation: (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor; (B) A copy of the original license, with the license number,validation date, and current expiration date legible; and (C) Justification for the extension; (ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that allapplicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession ofthe applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BXA willprovide the applicant with a written response. (h) Specific types of licenses--(1) Licenses for temporary exportsor reexports. If you have been granted a license for the temporaryexport or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items tothe United States, you must submit a license application requestingauthorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to beused on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to theUnited States after such use), you must ensure that your licenseapplication is accompanied by all documents that would be required ifyou had requested a license to export or reexport the same itemdirectly to the new destination. (2) Intransit within the United States. If you have been issued alicense authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify forLicense Exception TUS) through the United States, your license will bevalid only for the export of the intransit shipment wholly of foreignorigin and for which a Transportation and Exportation customs entry oran Immediate Exportation customs entry is outstanding. (3) Intransit outside the United States. If you have been issued alicense authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in theGeneral Prohibition Eight contained in Sec. 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, andyou did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the timeof the original license application, you must notify BXA in writingonce you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee.Your notification must contain the original license number, and thecomplete name, address, and telephone number of the intermediateconsignee. The written request must be submitted to BXA at the addresslisted in Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR. (4) Replacement license. If you have been issued a ``replacement''license (for changes to your original license that were not covered inparagraph (c) of this section), you must attach the ``replacement''license to the original, and retain both. (i) Records. If you have been issued a license you must retain thelicense, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 ofthe EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid orexpired) and all supporting documents and shipping records.Sec. 750.8 Revocation or suspension of licenses. (a) Revocation. All licenses for exports or reexports are subjectto revision, suspension, or revocation, in whole or in part, withoutnotice whenever it is known that the EAR have been violated or that aviolation is about to occur. BXA's Office of Exporter Services mayrevoke any license in which a person who has been convicted of one ofthe statutes specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the[[Page 12834]]discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the licenseat the time of the conviction. It may be necessary for BXA to stop ashipment or an export or reexport transaction at any stage in theprocess (e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport).If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary for BXAto order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of callin accordance with the provisions of the EAA. (b) Return of revoked or suspended licenses. If BXA revokes orsuspends a license, the licensee shall return the license immediatelyupon notification that the license has been suspended or revoked. Thelicense must be returned to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c)of the EAR, Attn:'' Return of Revoked/Suspended License''. Allapplicable supporting documents and records of shipments must beretained by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeepingprovisions of part 762 of the EAR. If the licensee fails to return alicense immediately upon notification that it has been suspended orrevoked, BXA may impose sanctions provided for in part 764 of the EAR.Sec. 750.9 Duplicate licenses. (a) Lost, stolen or destroyed. If a license is lost, stolen ordestroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the licenseby submitting a letter to the BXA at the address listed inSec. 748.2(c) of the EAR, Attention: Duplicate License Request''. Youmust certify in your letter: (1) That the original license ([number] issued to [name and addressof licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed; (2) The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed;and (3) If the original license is found, the licensee will returneither the original or duplicate license to the BXA. Note that ifshipment was made against the original license, those shipments must becounted against the duplicate license. If you are issued a duplicatelicense you must retain the duplicate license in accordance with therecordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR. (b) Hong Kong Trade Department. BXA will automatically issue aduplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong asthe intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as thecountry from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate licensewill be labeled ``Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department''. Thisduplicate must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consigneefor submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department. The original licensemust be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with therecordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.Sec. 750.10 Transfers of licenses for exports. (a) Authorization. As the licensee, you may not transfer a licenseissued for the export of items from the United States to any otherparty, except with the prior written approval of BXA. BXA may authorizea transfer of a license for export to a transferee who is subject tothe jurisdiction of the United States, is a principal party ininterest, and will assume all powers and responsibilities under thelicense for the control of the shipment of the items out of the UnitedStates. BXA will approve only one transfer of the same license and onlytransfers of licenses to export items. (b) How to request the transfer of licenses--(1) Letter fromlicensee. You, as the licensee, must submit a letter in writing torequest a transfer of a license or licenses. The letter must containthe following information: (i) The reasons for the requested transfer; (ii) Either a list of the outstanding license numbers or astatement that all outstanding licenses in the name of the licensee areto be transferred, and the total number of such outstanding licenses; (iii) A list of all license applications for export to betransferred that are pending with BXA, identifying the ApplicationControl Number for each, or other information that will assist inidentifying the pending license applications; (iv) Name and address of the person you intend to transfer thelicenses and license applications to; (v) The facts necessitating transfer; (vi) A statement as to whether or not any consideration has been,or will be, paid for the transfer; and (vii) Identification by name of the legal document (certificate,agreement, etc.) or other authority by which the new firm name islegally established, the new corporation or firm created, or the assetstransferred and showing the effective date of such document and thestate where filed or recorded.

(a) Applicability and use of shipping tolerances. Under somecircumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of itemsfrom the United States to export more than the quantity or value shownon that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance.This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage ofa shipping tolerance and the amount[[Page 12835]]of shipping tolerance you are permitted to use. (1) If you have already shipped the full amount approved on yourlicense, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No furthershipment may be made under the license. (2) The amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted is based onthe ``Unit'' specified for the item you want to export in theapplicable ECCN on the CCL (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of theEAR). You must calculate shipping tolerance based on the applicable``Unit'' whether that be Number, Dollar Value, or Area, Weight, orother Measure. You may not use any other unit that may appear on yourlicense. (b) Calculating shipping tolerances. There are three basic rules,one for items licensed by ``Dollar Value'', one for items licensed by``Number'', and another for items licensed by ``Area, Weight or otherMeasure''. (1) Items licensed by ``Dollar Value''. If the ``Unit'' paragraphin the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Sec. value'' or ``inSec. value'', there is no shipping tolerance. You may not ship morethan the total dollar value stated on your license. (2) Items licensed by ``Number''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph in theECCN applicable to your item reads ``Number'' or ``in Number'', thereis no shipping tolerance with respect to the number of units. However,the value of all of your shipments under one license may exceed thetotal dollar value stated on that license by up to 25%. (3) Items licensed by ``Area, Weight or Measure''. If the ``Unit''paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``kilograms'' or``square meters'' or some other unit of area, weight or measure, yourshipment may exceed the unshipped balance of the area, weight or othermeasure listed on your license by up to 10% and the total dollar valueshown on your license by up to 25%, unless; (i) Your license stipulates a specific shipping tolerance; or (ii) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a smallertolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR). (c) Examples of shipping tolerances.--(1) A license authorizes theexport of 100,000 kilograms of an item controlled by an ECCN where the``Unit'' is stated as ``kilograms'', the total cost of which is$1,000,000: (i) One shipment. If one shipment is made, the quantity that may beexported may not exceed 110,000 kg (10% tolerance on the unshippedArea, Weight, or Measure balance), and the total cost of that oneshipment may not exceed $1,250,000:$1,000,000.. (the total value shown on the license)+250,000.... (25% of the total value shown on the license)-------------$1,250,000.. (ii) Two shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg (valuedat $400,000), the second shipment may not exceed 66,000 kg (10% of theunshipped balance of 60,000 kg (6,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance),and the total cost of the second shipment shall not exceed $850,000:$600,000.... (the value of the unshipped balance of 60,000 kg)+250,000.... (25% of the original total value shown on the license)-------------$850,000.... (iii) Three shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg(valued at $400,000) the second shipment is for 20,000 kg (valued at$200,000), the third shipment may not exceed 44,000 kg (10% of theunshipped balance of 40,000 kg (4,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance),and the total cost of the third shipment can not exceed $650,000:$400,000.... (the value of the unshipped balance of 40,000 kg)+250,000.... (25% of the original total value on the license)-------------$650,000.... (2) A license authorizes the export of an item controlled by anECCN where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``$ value'', the total cost ofwhich is $5,000,000. There is no shipping tolerance on this licensebecause the items are controlled by an ECCN where ``$ value'' is thestated ``Unit''. (3) A license authorizes the export of 10 pieces of equipmentcontrolled by an ECCN where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``Number'', witha total value of $10,000,000 and the export of parts and accessoriescovered by that same entry valued at $1,000,000: (i)(A) If one shipment is made, the quantity of equipment that maybe exported may not exceed 10 pieces of equipment because there is noshipping tolerance on the ``number'' of units. That one shipment ofequipment may not exceed $12,500,000:$10,000,000. (the total value shown on the license)+2,500,000.. (25% of the total value shown on the license)-------------$12,500,000. (B) If the one shipment includes parts and accessories, those partsand accessories may not exceed $1,000,000 because there is no shippingtolerance on any commodity licensed in terms of dollar value. (ii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valuedat $4,000,000, the second shipment may not exceed 6 pieces of equipment(no tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than $8,500,000:$6,000,000.. (the value of the unshipped 6 pieces).+2,500,000.. (25% of the original total value shown on the license).-------------$8,500,000.. (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts andaccessories, the second shipment may not exceed $700,000 of parts andaccessories because there is no shipping tolerance on any commoditylicensed in terms of dollar value. (iii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valuedat $4,000,000 and the second shipment is for 3 pieces of equipmentvalued at $3,000,000, the third shipment may not exceed 3 pieces ofequipment (no tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than$5,500,000:$3,000,000.. (the value of the unshipped 3 pieces).+2,500,000.. (25% of the original value shown on the license),-------------$5,500,000.. (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts andaccessories and the second shipment includes another $300,000, thethird shipment may not exceed $400,000 because there is no shippingtolerance on commodities licensed in terms of dollar value.PART 752--SPECIAL COMPREHENSIVE LICENSESec.752.1 Scope.752.2 Eligible activities.752.3 Eligible items.752.4 Eligible countries.752.5 Steps you must follow to apply for an SCL.752.6 Reexports.752.7 Direct shipment to customers.752.8 SCL application review process.752.9 Action on SCL applications.752.10 Changes to the SCL.752.11 Internal Control Programs.752.12 Recordkeeping requirements.752.13 Inspection of records.752.14 System reviews.752.15 Export clearance.752.16 Administrative actions.752.17 BXA mailing addresses.[[Page 12836]]Supplement No. 1 to Part 752: Instructions for Completing Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose Application, for Requests for Special ComprehensiveLicensesSupplement No. 2 to Part 752: Instructions for Completing Form BXA-748P-A, Item AnnexSupplement No. 3 to Part 752: Instructions for Completing Form BXA-752,Statement by Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive LicenseSupplement No. 4 to Part 752: Instructions for Completing Form BXA-752-A, Reexport TerritoriesSupplement No. 5 to Part 752: Instructions for Completing Form BXA-748P-B End-User Appendix Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60FR 42767, August 17, 1995).Sec. 752.1 Scope. (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR arereferences to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes theprovisions of the Special Comprehensive License (SCL). You may applyfor an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license described in part748 of the EAR, or a License Exception described in part 740 of theEAR, for multiple exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR.The SCL provides authorization to make specified exports and reexportsthat are otherwise prohibited by General Prohibitions One, Two, andThree described in part 734 of the EAR. The existence of an SCL doesnot supersede an exporter's obligation to request a separate license asmay be required by part 744 of the EAR. Because the Bureau of ExportAdministration (BXA) does not review each individual transactionauthorized by an SCL, parties to the SCL must have the mechanisms inplace to ensure that each export and reexport made under an SCL meetsall the terms and conditions of the license and are in accordance withall applicable provisions of the EAR. It is through the design andeffective implementation of an Internal Control Program (ICP) that theSCL holder and the SCL consignee (referred to as ``consignee'' forpurposes of this part) assure that exports and reexports are not madecontrary to the EAR. (2) Definitions. (i) SCL holder. As used in this part, ``SCLholder'' is that party approved on an SCL to perform activitiesapproved under the SCL. (ii) SCL consignee. As used in this part, ``SCL consignee'' or``consignee'' means any party authorized to receive items under the SCLand named as a consignee on an approved Form BXA-752, Statement byConsignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License. (b) ICP requirement. To qualify for an SCL, you must develop anICP. Section 752.11 of this part includes a general description of theelements of the ICP, and guidance on which elements your company mustimplement before making shipments under the SCL. The elements of theICP your company will develop reflect the complexity of the activitiesauthorized under the SCL, the countries and items involved, and therelationship between the SCL holder and the approved consignees. BXAmay require you to include in your ICP any combination of elements,depending upon the nature of your SCL application. During your pre-application consultation required by Sec. 752.5(a)(1), BXA will provideyou guidance on which elements you must implement.Sec. 752.2 Eligible activities. (a) Possible authorizations. Under the SCL, BXA may authorize youto perform any number of activities, which can be grouped under thegeneral categories of ``service'', ``end-user'', ``distribution'' and``other'' activities. Examples of the general categories include: (1) Service activities. Exporting items subject to the EAR as spareand replacement parts for servicing or stocking. (2) End-user activities. Exporting and reexporting items subject tothe EAR for use as capital equipment. (3) Distribution activities. Exporting and reexporting itemssubject to the EAR for the purpose of resale and reexport byconsignees. (4) Other activities. Other activities not included in paragraphs(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section may be authorized by BXA underthe SCL on a case-by-case basis. (b) Prohibited activities. The general prohibitions described inSec. 736.2(b)(4) through (10) of the EAR apply to all exports andreexports by, and conduct of, all parties approved on your SCL, unlessyou are specifically authorized under the SCL to perform suchactivities, or the particular activity otherwise qualifies for aLicense Exception described in part 740 of the EAR.Sec. 752.3 Eligible items. (a) All items subject to the EAR, including items eligible forLicense Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR, are eligible forexport and reexport under the SCL, except: (1) Items controlled for missile technology reasons that areidentified by the letters MT in the applicable ``Reason for Control''paragraph on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 topart 774 of the EAR); (2) Items controlled by ECCNs 1C351, 1C352, 1C353, 1C354, 1E001,1E351, 1E391, 2B352, and 2E301 on the CCL that can be used in theproduction of biological weapons; (3) Items controlled by ECCNs 1C350, 1D390, 1E001, 1E350, 1E391,2B350, and 2B351 on the CCL that can be used in the production ofchemical weapons precursors and chemical warfare agents, todestinations listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part740 of the EAR); (4) Items controlled for short supply reasons that are identifiedby the letters ``SS'' in the applicable ``Reason for Control''paragraph on the CCL; (5) Maritime (civil) nuclear propulsion systems or associateddesign or production software and technology identified in Sec. 744.5of the EAR; (6) Communications intercepting devices controlled by ECCN 5A980 onthe CCL; (7) Items specifically identified as ineligible by BXA on yourapproved SCL; and (8) Additional items consistent with international commitments. (b) Items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons that areidentified by the letters NP in the applicable ``Reason for Control''paragraph on the CCL may be authorized on a case-by-case basis providedcontrols are in place to screen for proscribed end-users or end-uses.Sec. 752.4 Eligible countries. (a) General provisions. All countries are eligible under the SCLexcept: (1) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. (2) Other countries that BXA may designate on a case-by-case basisas ineligible to receive items under the SCL. (b) Servicing prohibitions. Under the SCL, you may not service anyitem when you know that the item is owned or controlled by, or underthe lease or charter of, entities in countries identified in paragraphs(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section or any national of such countries.Sec. 752.5 Steps you must follow to apply for an SCL. (a) Step One: Establish applicant reliability--(1) Pre-applicationconsultation. To apply for an SCL, BXA must determine your reliabilityas a potential SCL holder. BXA usually does this through consultationwith company officials and a review of the criteria identified inparagraph (a)(2) of this[[Page 12837]]section. To determine whether your company requires a consultationbefore you apply for an SCL, contact BXA at the address, phone, ortelefacsimile numbers included in Sec. 752.17 of this part.

(d) Additional requirements for embargoed destinations. For exportsinvolving embargoed destinations, you must satisfy the requirements ofthis part and also of part 746 of the EAR (Embargoes and Other SpecialControls).Sec. 754.2 Crude oil. (a) License requirement. As indicated by the SS notation in the``License Requirements'' section of ECCN 1C981 on the CCL (SupplementNo. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), a license is required for the export ofcrude oil to all destinations, including Canada. See paragraph (h) ofthis section for a License Exception permitting the export of certainoil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and paragraph (i) of thissection for a License Exception for certain shipments of samples.``Crude oil'' is defined as a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed inliquid phase in underground reservoirs and remains liquid atatmospheric pressure after passing through surface separatingfacilities and which has not been processed through a crude oildistillation tower. Included are reconstituted crude petroleum, andlease condensate and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands,gilsonite, and oil shale. Drip gases are also included, but toppedcrude oil, residual oil, and other finished and unfinished oils areexcluded. (b) License policy. (1) BXA will approve applications to exportcrude oil for the following kinds of transactions if BXA determinesthat the export is consistent with the specific requirements pertinentto that export: (i) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet (see paragraph (d) of thissection); (ii) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein (seeparagraph (e) of this section); (iii) Exports in connection with refining or exchange of strategicpetroleum reserve oil (see paragraph (f) of this section); (iv) Exports of heavy California crude oil up to an average volumenot to exceed 25 MB/D (see paragraph (g) of this section); (v) Exports that are consistent with international agreements asdescribed in the statutes listed in paragraph (c) of this section; (vi) Exports that are consistent with findings made by thePresident under an applicable statute, including the statutes describedin paragraph (c) of this section; and (vii) Exports of foreign origin crude oil where, based on writtendocumentation satisfactory to BXA, the exporter can demonstrate thatthe oil is not of U.S. origin and has not been commingled with oil ofU.S. origin. See paragraph (h) of this section for the provisions ofLicense Exception SPR permitting exports of certain crude oil from theStrategic Petroleum Reserve. (2) BXA will review other applications to export crude oil on acase-by-case basis and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of thissection, generally will approve such applications if BXA determinesthat the proposed export is consistent with the national interest andthe purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). AlthoughBXA will consider all applications for approval, generally, thefollowing kinds of transactions will be among those that BXA willdetermine to be in the national interest and consistent with thepurposes of EPCA. (i) The export is part of an overall transaction: (A) That will result directly in the importation into the UnitedStates of an equal or greater quantity and an equal or better qualityof crude oil or of a quantity and quality of petroleum products listedin Supplement No. 1 to this part that is not less than the quantity andquality of commodities that would be derived from the refining of thecrude oil for which an export license is sought; (B) That will take place only under contracts that may beterminated if the petroleum supplies of the United States areinterrupted or seriously threatened; and (C) In which the applicant can demonstrate that, for compellingeconomic or technological reasons that are beyond the control of theapplicant, the crude oil cannot reasonably be marketed in the UnitedStates. (ii) Exports involving temporary exports or exchanges that areconsistent with the exceptions from the restrictions of the statuteslisted in paragraph (c) of this section. (c) Additional statutory controls. (1) The following statutesprovide controls on the export of domestically produced crude oil basedon its place of origin or mode of transport. If such other statutorycontrols apply, an export may only be approved if the President makesthe findings required by the applicable law. (i) Section 201 of Public Law 104-58, entitled ``Exports of AlaskanNorth Slope Oil,'' provides for exports of domestically produced crudeoil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted pursuant tosection 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C.1652) (``TAPS crude oil''). (ii) The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 restricts exports ofdomestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted pursuant to section 28(u) of that Act (30 U.S.C. 185(u))(``MLA''). (iii) The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act restricts exports ofcrude oil produced from the outer Continental Shelf (29 U.S.C. 1354)(``OCSLA''). (iv) The Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act restricts theexport of crude oil produced from the naval petroleum reserves (10U.S.C. 7430) (``NPRPA''). (2) Supplement No. 3 to this part describes the relevant statutoryprovisions. In cases where a particular statute applies, a Presidentialfinding is necessary before the export can be authorized. You shouldnote that in certain cases it is possible that more than one statutecould apply to a particular export of crude oil. (d) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet. The licensing policy is toapprove applications for exports of crude oil that was derived from thestate-owned submerged lands of Alaska's Cook Inlet and has not been, orwill not be, transported by a pipeline over a federal right-of-waysubject to the MLA or the Trans-Alaska Pipeline AuthorizationAct.1 \1\ On November 6, 1985, the Secretary of Commerce determinedthat the export of crude oil derived from State waters in Alaska'sCook Inlet is consistent with the national interest and the purposesof the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (e) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein. (1) Exceptfor TAPS crude oil, the licensing policy is to approve applications forexports of crude oil to Canada for consumption or use therein. (2) The licensing policy for TAPS crude oil is to approveapplications for an average of no more than 50,000 barrels of oil perday for consumption or use in Canada, subject to the followingprocedures and conditions: (i) Any ocean transportation of the commodity will be made byvessels documented for United States coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C.12106. Only barge voyages between the State of Washington andVancouver, British Columbia, and comparable barge movements acrosswaters between the U.S. and Canada may be excluded from thisrequirement. The Bureau of Export Administration will determine, inconsultation with the Maritime[[Page 12846]]Administration, whether such transportation is ``ocean''transportation; and (ii) Authorization to export TAPS crude oil will be granted on aquarterly basis. Applications will be accepted by BXA no earlier thantwo months prior to the beginning of the calendar quarter in question,but must be received no later than the 25th day of the second monthpreceding the calendar quarter. For example, for the calendar quarterbeginning April 1 and ending June 30, applications will be acceptedbeginning February 1, but must be received no later than February 25. (iii) The quantity stated on each application must be the totalnumber of barrels for the quarter, not a per-day rate. This quantitymust not exceed 50,000 barrels times the number of calendar days in thequarter. (iv) Each application must include support documents providingevidence that the applicant has either: (A) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application; or (B) A contract to purchase the quantity of barrels stated in theapplication.

Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60FR 42767, August 17, 1995).Sec. 758.1 Export clearance requirements. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFRchapter VII, subchapter C. (a) Responsibility of licensee, exporter and agent. (1) If you areissued a BXA license, or you rely on a License Exception described inpart 740 of the EAR, you are responsible for the proper use of thatlicense or License Exception and for the performance of all of itsterms and conditions. (2) If you export without either a license issued by BXA or aLicense Exception, you are responsible for determining that thetransaction is outside the scope of the EAR or the export is designatedas ``No License Required'' as described in paragraph (a)(3) of thissection. (3)(i) ``No License Required''. Items that are listed on theCommerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR)but that do not require a license by reason of the Country Chartcontained in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR, and items designatedEAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope of the EAR'') mustbe designated as ``NLR'', or ``no license required'', on your shippingdocuments in accordance with the provisions of this part. (ii) NLR notation. Entering the symbol NLR is a representation tothe U.S. Government that the items being exported are listed on the CCLbut do not require a license by reason of the Country Chart or thatthey are within the scope of EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EARentitled ``Scope of the EAR''); that they do not require a licenseunder General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts andComponents Reexports), or Three (Foreign-produced Direct ProductReexports); that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply tothe given export, reexport, or other activity; and that the items aresubject to the EAR. (4) License Exception symbol. Entering a License Exception symbolon an export control document is a representation to the U.S.Government that the transaction meets all of the terms and conditionsof the License Exception cited. (See part 740 of the EAR for detailsregarding License Exceptions.) (5) Software and technology not subject to the EAR. If you areexporting software or technology that is outside the scope of the EARas described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR, you may use thesymbol TSPA. Use of this symbol is optional; however, if you enter iton an export control document, you are making a representation to theU.S. Government that the technology or software is outside the scope ofthe EAR. (b) Forwarding agent.--(1) Authorizing a forwarding agent. Aforwarding agent is a person the exporter authorizes to performservices that facilitate the export described on the Shipper's ExportDeclaration (SED). The agent must be authorized to act on behalf of theexporter either for the specific transaction for which the agent issubmitting the SED or under a general power of attorney. The ForeignTrade Statistics Regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part30) provide the specific requirements for obtaining authorization as aforwarding agent. (2) Forwarding agent as licensee. If the forwarding agent isappointed at the suggestion of a foreign buyer, the seller may insistthat the agent apply for the export license. See Sec. 748.4(a)(1) ofthe EAR which defines parties to a transaction. (3) Record and proof of agent's authority. The power-of-attorney orother authorization from the exporter must be retained on file in theforwarding agent's office while the authorization is in force and for aperiod of five years after the last action taken by the forwardingagent under the authority. During this retention period, the forwardingagent must make its delegation of authority from the exporter availablefor inspection on demand, in accordance with the provisions ofSec. 762.6 of the EAR. This recordkeeping and inspection requirementalso applies to any redelegation of the forwarding agent's authorityand to any person to whom the forwarding agent redelegates itsauthority. (For further recordkeeping requirements see part 762 of theEAR). (c) Responsibility for compliance. Acting through a forwardingagent, or other agent or delegation or redelegation of authority, doesnot relieve anyone of responsibility for compliance with the EAR.Forwarding agents, carriers and others who participate in transactionsthat are subject to the EAR are also responsible for complying with theEAR. (d) Exports by U.S. Mail.--(1) Exports made under a license issuedby BXA. Before making an export by U.S. Mail that is authorized by alicense issued by BXA, you must enter the license number on the addressside of the parcel and submit a properly executed SED to the postoffice at the place of mailing, when required by the regulations inthis part and/or the Foreign Trade Statistics[[Page 12853]]Regulations of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. 1 \1\ The Shipper's Export Declaration (U.S. Department ofCommerce form 7525-V) may be purchased from the Superintendent ofDocuments, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, orit may be privately printed.

The requirements of this paragraphapply whenever you export items that do not require a license under theEAR. These requirements apply regardless of whether your transactiondoes not require a license because the item you are going to ship isencompassed with EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scopeof the EAR''), because the item, although on the list, does not requirea license to be exported to the destination to which you intend to shipor because the transaction qualifies for a License Exception asdescribed in part 740 of the EAR. (i) Shipments to Canada for consumption therein. An SED is notrequired for exports of items to Canada if the items are forconsumption in Canada and the export transaction does not require alicense from BXA.

(ii) Shipments to Puerto Rico or U.S. territories or possessions.Exports of items to Puerto Rico or the U.S. territories or possessionsdo not require a license issued by BXA. However, the regulations of theCensus Bureau (15 CFR part 30) may still require you to file a SED. (iii) Shipments valued over $500. When mailing an item from onebusiness concern to another where the total value of the items beingshipped exceeds $500, you must present an executed SED to the postoffice at the place of mailing unless the EAR or the Bureau of theCensus Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations specifically provide anexception to this requirement. If either the exporter or recipient isnot a business concern, no SED is required. (iv) Designation on SED and/or parcel. If you are exporting an itemthat is encompassed within EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled``Scope of the EAR''), or one that is listed on the CCL but no licenseis required to the destination to which you are shipping, or you areexporting pursuant to a License Exception, as described in part 740 ofthe EAR, you must enter the appropriate symbol indicating the absenceof a license requirement either NLR, meaning ``No License Required'' orthe applicable License Exception symbol, on the SED and on the addressside of the parcel along with the phrase ``Export License NotRequired.'' If your transaction is one for which you are not requiredto file a SED, you must enter the appropriate symbol NLR, meaning nolicense required or of the applicable License Exception on the addressside of the parcel along with the phrase ``Export License NotRequired.'' If you are exporting technology or software that is outsidethe scope of the EAR as described in Sec. 734.7 through 734.11 you mayenter the symbol TSPA. (A) By entering the symbol NLR you are representing to the U.S.Government that the items you are exporting are listed on the CCL (SeeSupplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) but do not require a licenseby reason of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of theEAR) or because they are encompassed within the EAR99 (SeeSec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope of the EAR''); that they donot require a license under General Prohibitions One (Exports andreexports of controlled items to listed countries), Two (Parts andComponents Reexports), or Three (Foreign Produced Direct ProductReexports); that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply tothe given export, reexport, or other activity; and that the item issubject to the EAR. (B) By entering a License Exception symbol, you are representing tothe U.S. Government that your transaction meets all of the terms andconditions of the License Exception you are using. (See part 740 of theEAR for details regarding License Exceptions).

If you are sending a gift parcel pursuant to therequirements of Sec. 746.16 of the EAR, you must enter the phrase``Gift--export license not required'' on any customs declarationdocuments and on the address side of the parcel. (vi) Software and technology. If you are exporting software ortechnology, the export of which is authorized under the LicenseExceptions in Sec. 740.17 through Sec. 740.21 of the EAR, you do notneed to make any notation on the package. If you are exporting softwareor technology that is outside the scope of the EAR, check to see if anyother agency's regulations require specific markings on the package. (3) When you enter any of the symbols or phrases referred to inparagraph (d) of this section on the documents or packages, you arecertifying to the post office and to BXA that you are exporting thepackage in compliance with all of the terms and provisions of anapplicable License Exception or other authority to export. (e) Exports by means other than U.S. Mail. (1) When SEDs arerequired to be submitted, the exporter or the exporter's agent mustpresent a duly executed SED to the exporting carrier before the vessel,aircraft, or overland transport depart. (i) Exemptions to SED. A SED is not required for: (A) Any shipment, other than a shipment made under a license issuedby BXA, to any country in Country Group B (See Supplement No. 1 to part740 of the EAR) or to the People's Republic of China if the shipment isvalued at $2,500 or less per Schedule B Number. The schedule B numberof an item is that shown in the current edition of Schedule B,Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exportedfrom the United States. In this Sec. 758.1(e), ``shipment'' means allitems classified under a single Schedule B Number, shipped on the samecarrier, from one exporter to one importer. The Foreign TradeStatistics Regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part 30)shall govern the valuation of items when determining whether a shipmentmeets the $2,500 threshold of this Sec. 758.1(e)(1)(i)(A). (B) Any shipment reported under the provisions of the MonthlyReporting Procedure (Sec. 758.3(o) of this part); or (C) Any shipment made under any other exception to the SEDrequirements found in Subpart D of the Bureau of the Census' ForeignTrade Statistics Regulations. See Supplement No. 1 to this part 758.) (ii) Exceptions from SED requirements. (A) Statement on shippingdocuments. If you are exempt by paragraph (e)(1) of this section fromthe requirement of filing a SED, the Bureau of the Census Foreign TradeStatistics Regulations (FTSR) (15 CFR 30.50), require you to make astatement on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other loading documentdescribing the basis for the exemption and referencing the specificsection of the FTSR where the exemption is provided, unless theexemption is based on value and destination. If the exemption is basedon the value and destination of your shipment, you must state the basisfor the exemption, but you do not have to cite a reference to thespecific section of the FTSR containing the exemption.[[Page 12854]] (B) Monthly reporting procedures. (1) All forwarders or brokers whouse the monthly reporting procedures described in FTSR Sec. 30.39 (15CFR 30.39) on behalf of exporters who are not themselves exempt fromthe individual filing requirement must also include on the bill oflading, air waybill (including house air waybill), or other loadingdocument either the number of and expiration date of an export licenseissued by BXA, or the appropriate symbol indicating the inapplicabilityof an export license requirement (either NLR, meaning ``No LicenseRequired'' or of the applicable License Exception, from part 740 of theEAR). (2) The notation required by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of thissection applies to any bill of lading or other loading document,including one issued by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an exportincluded in a consolidated shipment. However, this requirement does notapply to a ``master'' bill of lading or other loading document issuedby a carrier to cover a consolidated shipment. The bill of lading orother loading document must be available for inspection along with thegoods or data prior to lading on the carrier. (2) Export carrier SED information. The exporting carrier, or ifnone is utilized, the exporter or agent is responsible for the accuracyof the following items of information (where required) on the SED: (i) Name of carrier (including flag of vessel), (ii) U.S. Customs port of export, (iii) Method of transportation, (iv) Foreign port of unloading, (v) Bill of lading or air waybill number, and (vi) Whether or not containerized. (3) Exports not requiring a license. Even if your shipment does notrequire a license from BXA, it may still require a SED. Beforeshipping, check the Bureau of the Census Foreign Trade StatisticsRegulations for the complete SED requirements. (f) Shipments transiting Canada en route to other countries--(1)Shipments moving under individual SED. When an export to a foreigncountry is made in transit through Canada, and the shipment is one forwhich an individual SED is required by this part 758, the U.S. exportermust submit to the Canadian Customs authorities at the Canadian port ofentry a copy of the U.S. SED, Form 7525-V, certified by the exporter as``A True Copy'' of the original SED. (2) Shipments for which individual SED are not required. When anexport to a foreign country is made in transit through Canada, and theshipment is one for which an individual SED is not required because: (i) The forwarder or broker is authorized to report exportinformation to Census by means other than an individual SED; or (ii) The shipment qualifies for a specific exemption (listed inSubpart D of the Census Bureau Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations),the forwarder or broker must include the number of and expiration dateof the license issued by BXA, or the appropriate symbol indicating theinapplicability of an export license requirement (either NLR, meaning``No License Required'' of the applicable License Exception from part740 of the EAR on the bill of lading or other loading document asdirected in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). The bill of lading orother loading document properly annotated with respect to the FTSR SEDexemption or exception, along with the license authorization, whenrequired, must be displayed to the Canadian Customs authorities at theCanadian port of entry and a copy provided, if requested by theCanadian authorities.Sec. 758.2 Use of export license. (a) License valid for shipment from any port. A license issued byBXA authorizes exports from the United States from any U.S. port ofexport unless the license notes otherwise. Items that leave the UnitedStates at one port, cross adjacent foreign territory, and reenter theUnited States at another port before final export to a foreign countrywill be treated as an export from the last U.S. port of export. (b) Shipments against expiring license. (1) Any item that has notdeparted from the last U.S. port of export by midnight of theexpiration date of the license may not be exported under that licenseunless the shipment meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or(ii) of this section.

(c) Reshipment of undelivered items. If the consignee does notreceive an export made under a license because the carrier failed todeliver it, the exporter may reship the same or an identical itemsubject to the same limitations as to quantity or value as described onthe license to the same consignee and destination under the samelicense. Before reshipping, the exporter must submit to the OEXSsatisfactory evidence of the original export and of the deliveryfailure, together with a satisfactory explanation of the deliveryfailure. If an item is to be reshipped to any person other than theoriginal consignee, the shipment is deemed to be a new export and issubject to all current EAR regarding the specific item and destination.Sec. 758.3 Shipper's Export Declaration (SED). (a) SED presentation requirement. Both the Foreign Trade StatisticsRegulations of the Census Bureau (15 CFR part 30) and these ExportAdministration Regulations require that SED's be submitted to the U.S.Government. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but if you arerequired to submit a SED you must prepare it in accordance with therules of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) and presentthe number of copies specified in the FTSR at the port of export. (b) SED is a statement to the U.S. Government. Your SED is astatement to the U.S. Government in which you assert that all of theinformation shown on the SED is true.

If the item(s) will be exported underthe provisions of LST (License Exceptions GBS, CIV, LVS) or under the``NLR'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of thispart) and the item(s) are covered by entries on the Commerce ControlList that have the column identifier ``NS Column 2'' controlled for``NS'' reasons, the ECCN must also be shown in the designated space onthe SED or SED continuation sheet. The following apply for notationsmade on SED: (i) Entering the license number and expiration date is arepresentation to the U.S. Government that the transaction isauthorized by the license cited. (ii) Entering a License Exception symbol, or ``NLR'' is arepresentation to the U.S. Government that the shipment meets one ofthe applicable provisions of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(4) ofSec. 758.1 of this part. (3) If you are exporting technology or software that is outside thescope of the EAR as described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR,you may enter the symbol TSPA on the SED. Use of this[[Page 12856]]symbol is optional, however, if you enter it, you are representing tothe U.S. Government that the software or technology you are exportingis outside the scope of the EAR. (i) Optional ports of unlading. (1) Applicability. If, prior to thedeparture of the exporting carrier, the exporter does not know at whatport the shipment will be unloaded, the exporter may designate optionalports of unlading on the SED and bill of lading or air waybill inaccordance with the provisions of this paragraph. There arerestrictions on the countries in which these optional ports may belocated. The restrictions depend on whether the export is authorizedunder the ``No license Required'' provisions of the EAR (as describedin Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), the License Exceptions described inpart 740 of the EAR, or a license (See paragraph (j)(3) of thissection). (2) Exemptions. You may never designate an optional port ofunlading for a shipment destined directly or indirectly to CountryGroup D:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR (except for thePeople's Republic of China), Libya, Cuba, or North Korea. (3) Shipments for which no license is required or which areauthorized by a License Exception. (i) For exports under the authorityof the ``No License Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described inSec. 758.1(a) of this part), if the exporter does not know which ofseveral countries in Country Group B or the People's Republic of Chinais the country of ultimate destination, the exporter may name optionalports of unlading in one or more of these countries. (ii) When an export under any License Exception is shipped intransit through a country other than the country of ultimatedestination, the exporter may designate optional ports of unlading inone or more countries, together with the name and address of theintermediate consignee in each country designated. (4) Restrictions on optional ports of unlading. The optional portsof unlading, which the exporter designates on the SED pursuant toparagraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, must be in a country to which theitem being unloaded may be exported directly from the United Statesunder the same or another applicable ``No License Required'' provisionof the EAR (described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), or LicenseException contained in the EAR. (5) Shipments under a license issued by BXA. For exports under alicense, optional ports of unlading are restricted to the country ofultimate destination, unless either the transaction complies with theprovisions of Sec. 750.7 of the EAR dealing with continuity ofshipments, or the license designates intermediate consignees in othercountries. In the latter case, the optional ports of unlading must bedesignated as optional intransit points on the SED, or if there is noSED, on the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, or, if there is neither,the optional port of unlading must appear on another documentcontaining instructions that the exporter conveys (either directly orthrough an agent) to the carrier, and on the bill of lading or airwaybill. (6) Correcting the SED. As soon as the exporter, or the exporter'sforwarding agent or carrier determines at which port the shipment is tobe unloaded (whether in the country of ultimate destination or in acountry of transit), that person must correct the SED to show thespecific port of unloading and the name and address of the intermediateconsignee to whom delivery is to be made. An intermediate consigneemust be shown if the port of unloading is located in a country otherthan the country of destination. If the export is unloaded at more thanone port, the quantity and value unloaded at each port and the name andaddress of each intermediate consignee must be given. The proceduresfor correcting and filing SEDs may be found in paragraph (n) of thissection. (j) Signature on SED. The exporter or the exporter's authorizedforwarding agent, or an authorized employee of either, may sign theSED. In general, the requisite authority rests with employees who, bytheir official titles, are apparently vested with power to deal withexports, such as export managers or such corporate officers as thepresident, vice president, treasurer, and secretary of a corporation,any partner of a partnership, and any responsible head of any otherform of private or quasi-governmental organization, and assistantofficers. The signature of such person, whether that of the exporter orauthorized agent or employee, constitutes a representation by theexporter that all statements and information in the SED are true andcorrect. In addition, if the signature is that of the forwarding agent,or the forwarding agent's duly authorized officer or employee, suchsignature constitutes a like representation by the forwarding agent. (k) Attachment to SED. (1) If you need additional space for anyinformation on the SED, you may use additional copies of the SED orcopies of the continuation sheet. In such cases, only one SED need besigned. You must number the additional sheets in sequence and securelyattach them to the executed SED. You must insert the followingstatement on the last line of the description line of the SED formitself: This SED consists of this sheet and ________ continuationsheets. (2) No portion of any form attached as a continuation sheet may betorn off or removed. (l) Special requirements for additional information and documents.(1) A license may bear on its face a requirement to submit a SED orother documents (or information) to the Office of Export Enforcement inaddition to that furnished when the application was filed. The exporterand the person submitting the documents represent that the documentsare complete, truthful and accurate. The Export AdministrationRegulations prohibit the making of false representations to the U.S.Government in any export control matter (see Sec. 764.2(g) of the EAR).The licensee must furnish the documents to: Office of ExportEnforcement, Room H-4520, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street andConstitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230.

The rules of conformity in this section apply toshipping documents used in connection with any shipment under theauthority[[Page 12858]]of a license issued by BXA except ``master'' air waybills issued byconsolidators. These rules apply to any individual air waybill issuedby a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export included in aconsolidated shipment and to any air waybill issued by anyone inconnection with an export not included in a consolidated shipment. (b) Compliance. You may not issue, prepare, or procure a bill oflading that is contrary to the provisions of this section. Officials ofBXA and the U.S. Customs Service are authorized to require any documentor to use any other appropriate methods to ensure compliance with therules of conformity in this section. (c) Rules of conformity. (1) General. The following documents mustbe consistent with each other: (i) The license issued by BXA; (ii) One of the following applicable documents: (A) The SED; (B) If there is no SED, the Shipper's Letter of Instructions; or (C) If there is neither, another document containing instructionsthat the exporter conveys (either directly or through an agent) to thecarrier; and (iii) The outbound bill of lading (including a railroad throughbill of lading) covering a particular export shipment must beconsistent with one another. (2) Signs of inconsistent documents. The bill of lading, whether innegotiable or nonnegotiable form, is not consistent with those otherdocuments if: (i) It does not provide for delivery of the shipment (cargo) at aport located in the country of either the ultimate or intermediateconsignee named in the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) ofthis section; (ii) It contains any indication that the shipment is intransit to acountry of ultimate destination different from that named in theappropriate one of the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) ofthis section, or that the shipment is not for consumption in suchcountry of ultimate destination. For example, it would be inconsistentto consign a shipment to the ultimate destination with a qualifyingphrase indicating the shipment is ``in transit'' at that destination,or to consign the shipment to a free zone or free port; (iii) It names as shipper any person other than the licensee (theperson to whom a license is issued) or the licensee's duly authorizedforwarding agent. Where shipments from more than one licensee areconsolidated on a single bill of lading, the shipper named on the billof lading must also appear as the authorized forwarding agent for eachexporter on each document described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of thissection. (iv) The name and address of the ultimate consignee are not showneither in the space provided for ``consignee'' or in the body of thebill of lading under the caption ``ultimate consignee and notifyparty'' or, in the case of the air waybill, under the caption ``alsonotify.'' However, where shipments to more than one ultimate consigneeare consolidated on one bill of lading and not all are shown in thebody of the bill of lading, the name of the intermediate consignee(customs broker or consolidator's agent in the foreign country) whowill receive and distribute the items to the ultimate consignees mustappear on the bill of lading, the export license(s), and documentslisted in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. (3) Additional rules for negotiable bills of lading. A negotiablebill of lading (an ``order'' bill of lading) is deemed consistent withthe appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)of this section only if the consignee or order party named on the billof lading is also named in the SED, the Shipper's Letter ofInstructions or the other document. (i) Sometimes ``order'' bills of lading consign the items theycover to the order of the shipper, to the order of an intermediateconsignee such as a bank, foreign freight forwarder, or otherintermediary, or to the order of a purchaser who is not the same personas the ultimate consignee. An ``order'' bill of lading issued in any ofthese forms constitutes a representation by the shipper that: (A) The items covered by the appropriate one of the documentsdescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and bill of ladingare ultimately destined to the ultimate consignee stated on thelicense; (B) The ``order'' bill of lading has not been used for the purposeof evading the terms and conditions of the license; and (C) Pursuant to the contract of carriage, the items will bedelivered at a port located in the country of the ultimate consignee orof the intermediate consignee named on the appropriate one of thedocuments described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. (ii) [Reserved] (4) Item description. On the bill of lading the items may bedescribed in terms of the freight tariff classification or other typeof classification, but may not be inconsistent with the descriptionshown on the appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph(c)(1)(ii).

The purpose of these prohibitions is to prevent items licensedfor export from being diverted while in transit or thereafter. It alsosets forth the duties of the parties when the goods are unloaded in acountry other than that of the ultimate consignee or intermediateconsignee as stated on the export license. (b) Destination on bill of lading or air waybill--(1) Requirementsto prevent diversions. (i) Statements on bill of lading or air waybill.(A) A carrier (or any other person on behalf of any carrier) may notissue a bill of lading or air waybill providing for delivery of cargoat any foreign port located outside the country of the ultimateconsignee, or the intermediate consignee, named on the appropriate oneof the documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part. (B) Optional ports on bill of lading or air waybill.

(i) If the item isunloaded in a country to which that item may be exported without alicense issued by BXA, no one is required to notify BXA of theunloading. The exporter may dispose of the items in that countrywithout approval of BXA. When making such a disposition you must stillcomply with any conditions or requirements of the License Exception orother provisions of the EAR that would authorize the export of the itembeing unloaded to the country in which you are disposing of it, and anyregulations of other government agencies that apply to the transaction.This paragraph does not authorize anyone to take any action withknowledge that a violation of the Export Administration Act, the EAR,or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, has occurred,is about to occur or is intended to occur, or to deliver to a deniedparty or to take any other action prohibited by the EAR.

(b) Definition of ``United States Person''. (1) This part appliesto United States persons. For purposes of this part, the term UnitedStates person means any person who is a United States resident ornational, including individuals, domestic concerns, and ``controlled infact'' foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, or other permanent foreignestablishments of domestic concerns. This definition of United Statesperson includes both the singular and plural and, in addition,includes: (i) The government of the United States or any department, agency,or commission thereof; (ii) The government of any State of the United States, the Districtof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory orpossession of the United States, or any subdivision, department,agency, or commission of any such government; (iii) Any partnership, corporation, company, association, or otherentity organized under the laws of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of thissection; (iv) Any foreign concern's subsidiary, partnership, affiliate,branch, office, or other permanent establishment in any state of theUnited States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of PuertoRico, or any territory or possession of the United States; and (v) Any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership,affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishmentwhich is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. (See paragraph(c) of this section on ``Definition of 'Controlled in Fact'.'') (2) The term domestic concern means any partnership, corporation,company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the lawsof, any jurisdiction named in paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of thissection, or any permanent domestic establishment of a foreign concern. (3) The term foreign concern means any partnership, corporation,company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the lawsof, any jurisdiction other than those named in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or(ii) of this section. (4) The term United States person does not include an individualUnited States national who is resident outside the United States andwho is either employed permanently or temporarily by a non-UnitedStates person or assigned to work as an employee for, and under thedirection and control of, a non-United States person.Examples of ``United States Person'' The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining whether a person is a ``United States person.'' They areillustrative, not comprehensive. (i) U.S. bank A has a branch office in foreign country P. Suchbranch office is a United States person, because it is a permanentforeign establishment of a domestic concern. (ii) Ten foreign nationals establish a manufacturing plant, A,in the United States, incorporating the plant under New York law. A is a United States person, because it is a corporationorganized under the laws of one of the states of the United States. (iii) A, a foreign corporation, opens an office in the UnitedStates for purposes of soliciting U.S. orders. The office is notseparately incorporated. A's U.S. office is a United States person, because it is apermanent establishment, in the United States, of a foreign concern. (iv) A, a U.S. individual, owns stock in foreign corporation B. A is a United States person. However, A is not a ``domesticconcern,'' because the term ``domestic concern'' does not includeindividuals. (v) A, a foreign national resident in the United States, isemployed by B, a foreign corporation. A is a United States person, because he is resident in theUnited States. (vi) A, a foreign national, who is resident in a foreign countryand is employed by a foreign corporation, makes occasional visits tothe United States, for purposes of exploring business opportunities. A is not a United States person, because he is not a UnitedStates resident or national. (vii) A is an association of U.S. firms organized under the lawsof Pennsylvania for the purpose of expanding trade. A is a United States person, because it is an associationorganized under the laws of one of the states of the United States. (viii) At the request of country Y, A, an individual employed byU.S. company B, is transferred to company C as an employee. C is aforeign company owned and controlled by country Y. A, a U.S.national who will reside in Y, has agreed to the transfer providedhe is able to retain his insurance, pension, and other benefits.Accordingly, company B has agreed to keep A as an employee in orderto protect his employee benefits, and company C has agreed to payfor A's salary. At all times while he works for C, A will be underC's direction and control. A is not a United States person while under C's direction andcontrol, because he will be resident outside the United States andassigned as an employee to a non-United States person. Thearrangement designed to protect A's insurance, pension, and otherbenefits does not destroy his status as an[[Page 12863]]employee of C so long as he is under the direction and control of C. (ix) A, a U.S. citizen, has resided in Europe for three years,where he is a self-employed consultant for United States and foreigncompanies in the communications industry. A is a United States person, because he is a U.S. national andbecause he is not a resident outside the United States who isemployed by other than a United States person. (c) Definition of ``Controlled in Fact''. (1) This part applies toany domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate,branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which iscontrolled in fact by such domestic concern. Control in fact consistsof the authority or ability of a domestic concern to establish thegeneral policies or to control day-to-day operations of its foreignsubsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanentforeign establishment. (2) A foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a domestic concern will bepresumed to be controlled in fact by that domestic concern, subject torebuttal by competent evidence, when: (i) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whetherdirectly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the outstanding votingsecurities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whetherdirectly or indirectly) 25 percent or more of the voting securities ofthe foreign subsidiary or affiliate, if no other person owns orcontrols (whether directly or indirectly) an equal or largerpercentage; (iii) The foreign subsidiary or affiliate is operated by thedomestic concern pursuant to the provisions of an exclusive managementcontract; (iv) A majority of the members of the board of directors of theforeign subsidiary or affiliate are also members of the comparablegoverning body of the domestic concern; (v) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the majority ofthe members of the board of directors of the foreign subsidiary oraffiliate; or (vi) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the chiefoperating officer of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate. (3) A brokerage firm or other person which holds simple recordownership of securities for the convenience of clients will not bedeemed to control the securities. (4) A domestic concern which owns, directly or indirectly,securities that are immediately convertible at the option of the holderor owner into voting securities is presumed to own or control thosevoting securities. (5) A domestic concern's foreign branch office or otherunincorporated permanent foreign establishment is deemed to becontrolled in fact by such domestic concern under all circumstances.Examples of ``Controlled in Fact'' The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which a foreign subsidiary,affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment of a domesticconcern is ``controlled in fact.'' They are illustrative, notcomprehensive. (i) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-onepercent of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumptionmay be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,in fact, lie with B. (ii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten percentof the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has anexclusive management contract with B pursuant to which A is operatedby B. As long as such contract is in effect, A is presumed to becontrolled in fact by B. This presumption may be rebutted bycompetent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, lie withB. (iii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Tenpercent of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has10 persons on its board of directors. Six of those persons are alsomembers of the board of directors of U.S. company B. A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumptionmay be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,in fact, lie with B. (iv) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Thirtypercent of the voting securities of A is owned by U.S. company B andno other person owns or controls an equal or larger share. A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumptionmay be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,in fact, lie with B. (v) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. In A'sarticles of incorporation, U.S. company B has been given authorityto appoint A's board of directors. A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumptionmay be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,in fact, lie with B. (vi) Company A is a joint venture established in a foreigncountry, with equal participation by U.S. company B and foreigncompany C. U.S. Company B has authority to appoint A's chiefoperating officer. A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumptionmay be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,in fact, lie with B. (vii) Same as (vi), except that B has no authority to appointA's chief operating officer. B is not presumed to control A, absent other facts giving riseto a presumption of control. (viii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. U.S.companies B, C, and D each own 20 percent of A's voting securitiesand regularly cast their votes in concert. A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B, C, and D, becausethese companies are acting in concert to control A. (ix) U.S. bank B located in the United States has a branchoffice, A, in a foreign country. A is not separately incorporated. A is deemed to be controlled in fact by B, because A is a branchoffice of a domestic concern. (x) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-onepercent of the voting stock of A is owned by company B, which isincorporated in another foreign country. Fifty-one percent of thevoting stock of B is owned by C, a U.S. company. Both A and B are presumed to be controlled in fact by C. Thepresumption of C's control over B may be rebutted by competentevidence showing that control over B does not, in fact, lie with C.The presumption of B's control over A (and thus C's control over A)may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control over Adoes not, in fact, lie with B. (xi) B, a U.S. individual, owns 51 percent of the votingsecurities of A, a manufacturing company incorporated and located ina foreign country. A is not ``controlled in fact'' under this part, because it isnot controlled by a ``domestic concern.'' (d) Definition of ``Activities in the Interstate or ForeignCommerce of the United States''.Activities Involving United States Persons Located in the UnitedStates (1) For purposes of this part, the activities of a United Statesperson located in the United States are in the interstate or foreigncommerce of the United States if they involve the sale, purchase, ortransfer of goods or services (including information) between: (i) Two or more of the several States (including the District ofColumbia); (ii) Any State (including the District of Columbia) and anyterritory or possession of the United States; (iii) Two or more of the territories or possessions of the UnitedStates; or (iv) A State (including the District of Columbia), territory orpossession of the United States and any foreign country. (2) For purposes of this part, the export of goods or services fromthe United States and the import of goods or services into the UnitedStates are activities in United States commerce. In addition, theaction of a domestic concern in specifically directing the activitiesof its controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or otherpermanent foreign establishment is an activity in United Statescommerce. (3) Activities of a United States person located in the UnitedStates may be in United States commerce even if they are part of orancillary to activities[[Continued on page 12864]][Federal Register: March 25, 1996 (Rules and Regulations)][Page 12864-12914]From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov][[pp. 12864-12914]] Export Administration Regulation; Simplification of ExportAdministration Regulations[[Continued from page 12863]][[Page 12864]]activity is in United States commerce does not, in and of itself, meanthat the underlying or related activity is in United States commerce. (4) Hence, the action of a United States bank located in the UnitedStates in providing financing from the United States for a foreigntransaction that is not in United States commerce is nonetheless itselfin United States commerce. However, the fact that the financing is inUnited States commerce does not, in and of itself, make the underlyingforeign transaction an activity in United States commerce, even if theunderlying transaction involves a foreign company that is a UnitedStates person within the meaning of this part. (5) Similarly, the action of a United States person located in theUnited States in providing financial, accounting, legal, transportation, or other ancillary services to its controlled in factforeign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishmentin connection with a foreign transaction is in United States commerce.But the provision of such ancillary services will not, in and ofitself, bring the foreign transaction of such subsidiary, affiliate, orpermanent foreign establishment into United States commerce.Activities of Controlled in Fact Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, andOther Permanent Foreign Establishments (6) Any transaction between a controlled in fact foreignsubsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment of adomestic concern and a person located in the United States is anactivity in United States commerce. (7) Whether a transaction between such a foreign subsidiary,affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a personlocated outside the United States is an activity in United Statescommerce is governed by the following rules.Activities in United States Commerce (8) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled in factforeign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishmentand a person outside the United States, involving goods or services(including information but not including ancillary services) acquiredfrom a person in the United States is in United States commerce underany of the following circumstances-- (i) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose offilling an order from a person outside the United States; (ii) If the goods or services were acquired for incorporation into,refining into, reprocessing into, or manufacture of another product forthe purpose of filling an order from a person outside the UnitedStates; (iii) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose offulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with a person outsidethe United States; or (iv) If the goods were acquired and are ultimately used, withoutsubstantial alteration or modification, in filling an order from, orfulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with, a person outsidethe United States (whether or not the goods were originally acquiredfor that purpose). If the goods are indistinguishable as to origin fromsimilar foreign-trade goods with which they have been mingled in astockpile or inventory, the subsequent transaction involving the goodsis presumed to be in United States commerce unless, at the time offilling the order, the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficientto fill the order. (9) For purposes of this section, goods or services are consideredto be acquired for the purpose of filling an order from or engaging inany other transaction with a person outside the United States where: (i) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, orother permanent foreign establishment upon the receipt of an order fromor on behalf of a customer with the intention that the goods orservices are to go to the customer; (ii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, orother permanent foreign establishment to meet the needs of specifiedcustomers pursuant to understandings with those customers, although notfor immediate delivery; or (iii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, orother permanent foreign establishment based on the anticipated needs ofspecified customers. (10) If any non-ancillary part of a transaction between a domesticconcern's controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanentforeign establishment and a person outside the United States is inUnited States commerce, the entire transaction is in United Statescommerce. For example, if such a foreign subsidiary is engaged infilling an order from a non-United States customer both with goodsacquired from the United States and with goods acquired elsewhere, theentire transaction with that customer is in United States commerce.Activities Outside United States Commerce (11) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled foreignsubsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and aperson outside the United States, not involving the purchase, sale, ortransfer of goods or services (including information) to or from aperson in the United States, is not an activity in United Statescommerce. (12) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreignsubsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment withrespect to goods acquired from a person in the United States are not inUnited States commerce where: (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order fromor transaction with a person outside the United States; and (ii) They were further manufactured, incorporated into, refinedinto, or reprocessed into another product. (13) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreignsubsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment withrespect to services acquired from a person in the United States are notin United States commerce where: (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order fromor transaction with a person outside the United States; or (ii) They are ancillary to the transaction with the person outsidethe United States. (14) For purposes of this section, services are ancillary servicesif they are provided to a controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, orother permanent foreign establishment primarily for its own use ratherthan for the use of a third person. These typically include financial,accounting, legal,transportation, and other services, whether providedby a domestic concern or an unrelated entity. (15) Thus, the provision of the project financing by a UnitedStates bank located in the United States to a controlled foreignsubsidiary unrelated to the bank is an ancillary service which will notcause the underlying transaction to be in United States commerce. Bycontrast, where a domestic concern, on behalf of its controlled foreignsubsidiary, gives a guaranty of performance to a foreign countrycustomer, that is a service provided to the customer and, as such,brings that subsidiary's transaction with the customer into UnitedStates commerce. Similarly, architectural or engineering servicesprovided by a[[Page 12865]]domestic concern in connection with its controlled foreign subsidiary'sconstruction project in a third country are services passed through tothe subsidiary's customer and, as such, bring that subsidiary's foreigntransaction into United States commerce.General (16) Regardless of whether the subsequent disposition of goods orservices from the United States is in United States commerce, theoriginal acquisition of goods or services from a person in the UnitedStates is an activity in United States commerce subject to this part.Thus, if a domestic concern's controlled foreign subsidiary engages ina prohibited refusal to do business in stocking its inventory withgoods from the United States, that action is subject to this partwhether or not subsequent sales from that inventory are. (17) In all the above, goods and services will be considered tohave been acquired from a person in the United States whether they wereacquired directly or indirectly through a third party, where the personacquiring the goods or services knows or expects, at the time he placesthe order, that they will be delivered from the United States.Letters of Credit (18) Implementation of a letter of credit in the United States by aUnited States person located in the United States, including apermanent United States establishment of a foreign concern, is anactivity in United States commerce. (19) Implementation of a letter of credit outside the United Statesby a United States person located outside the United States is inUnited States commerce where the letter of credit (a) specifies aUnited States address for the beneficiary, (b) calls for documentsindicating shipment from the United States, or (c) calls for documentsindicating that the goods are of United States origin. (20) See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part on ``Letters of Credit'' todetermine the circumstances in which paying, honoring, confirming, orotherwise implementing a letter of credit is covered by this part.Examples of Activities in the Interstate or Foreign Commerce of theUnited States The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which an activity is in theinterstate or foreign commerce of the United States. They areillustrative, not comprehensive.United States Person Located in the United States (i) U.S. company A exports goods from the United States to aforeign country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A isexporting goods from the United States. (ii) U.S. company A imports goods into the United States from aforeign country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A isimporting goods into the United States. (iii) U.S. engineering company A supplies consulting services toits controlled foreign subsidiary, B. A's activity is in U.S.commerce, because A is exporting services from the United States. (iv) U.S. company A supplies consulting services to foreigncompany B. B is unrelated to A or any other U.S. person. A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B, a foreign-ownedcompany located outside the United States, is not subject to thispart, because A is exporting services from the United States. (v) Same as (iv), except A is a bank located in the UnitedStates and provides a construction loan to B. A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B is not subject tothis part, because A is exporting financial services from the UnitedStates. (vi) U.S. company A issues policy directives from time to timeto its controlled foreign subsidiary, B, governing the conduct ofB's activities with boycotting countries. A's activity in directing the activities of its foreignsubsidiary, B, is an activity in U.S. commerce.Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and Other Permanent ForeignEstablishments of Domestic Concerns (i) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,purchases goods from the United States. A's purchase of goods from the United States is in U.S.commerce, because A is importing goods from the United States.Whether A's subsequent disposition of these goods is in U.S.commerce is irrelevant. Similarly, the fact that A purchased goodsfrom the United States does not, in and of itself, make anysubsequent disposition of those goods an activity in U.S. commerce. (ii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,receives an order from boycotting country Y for constructionmaterials. A places an order with U.S. company B for the materials. A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, becausethe materials are purchased from the United States for the purposeof filling the order from Y. (iii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,receives an order from boycotting country Y for constructionmaterials. A places an order with U.S. company B for some of thematerials, and with U.S. company C, an unrelated company, for therest of the materials. A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, becausethe materials are purchased from the United States for the purposeof filling the order from Y. It makes no difference whether thematerials are ordered from B or C. (iv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is inthe wholesale and retail appliance sales business. A purchasesfinished air conditioning units from the United States from time totime in order to stock its inventory. A's inventory is also stockedwith air conditioning units purchased outside the United States. Areceives an order for air conditioning units from Y, a boycottingcountry. The order is filled with U.S.-origin units in A'sinventory. A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because its U.S.-origin goods are resold without substantial alteration. (v) Same as (iv), except that A is in the chemicals distributionbusiness. Its U.S.-origin goods are mingled in inventory withforeign-origin goods. A's sale to Y of unaltered goods from its general inventory ispresumed to be in U.S. commerce unless A can show that at the timeof the sale the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient tocover the shipment to Y. (vi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives anorder from boycotting country Y for computers. A places an orderwith U.S. company B for some of the components; with U.S. company C,an unrelated company, for other components; and with foreign companyD for the rest of the components. A then assembles the computers andships them to Y. A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, becausesome of the components are acquired from the United States forpurposes of filling an order from Y. (vii) Same as (vi), except A purchases all the components fromnon-U.S.sources. A's transaction with Y is not an activity in U.S. commerce,because it involves no export of goods from the United States. Itmakes no difference whether the technology A uses to manufacturecomputers was originally acquired from its U.S. parent. (viii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,manufactures computers. A stocks its general components and partsinventory with purchases made at times from the United States and attimes from foreign sources. A receives an order from Y, a boycottingcountry, for computers. A fills that order by manufacturing thecomputers using materials from its general inventory. A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because theU.S.-origin components are not acquired for the purpose of meetingthe anticipated needs of specified customers in Y. It is irrelevantthat A's operations may be based on U.S.-origin technology. (ix) Same as (viii), except that in anticipation of the orderfrom Y, A orders and receives the necessary materials from theUnited States. A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because the U.S.-origin goods were acquired for the purpose of filling an anticipatedorder from Y. (x) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,manufactures typewriters. It buys typewriter components both fromthe United States and from foreign sources. A sells its output invarious places throughout the world, including boycotting country Y.Its sales to Y vary from year to year, but have averagedapproximately 20 percent of sales for the past five years. A expectsthat its sales[[Page 12866]]to Y will remain at approximately that level in the years aheadalthough it has no contracts or orders from Y on hand. A's sales of typewriters to Y are not in U.S. commerce, becausethe U.S. components are not acquired for the purpose of filling anorder from Y. A general expectancy of future sales is not an``order'' within the meaning of this section. (xi) U.S. company A's corporate counsel provides legal advice toB, its controlled foreign subsidiary, on the applicability of thisPart to B's transactions. While provision of this legal advice is itself an activity inU.S. commerce, it does not, in and of itself, bring B's activitiesinto U.S. commerce. (xii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, isin the general construction business. A enters into a contract withboycotting country Y to construct a power plant in Y. In preparingengineering drawings and specifications, A uses the advice andassistance of B. A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's servicesare used for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y. B'sservices are not ancillary services, because the engineeringservices in connection with construction of the power plant are partof the services ultimately provided to Y by A. (xiii) Same as (xii), except that A gets no engineering adviceor assistance from B. However, B's corporate counsel provides legaladvice to A regarding the structure of the transaction. In addition,B's corporate counsel draws up the contract documents. A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce. The legalservices provided to A are ancillary services, because they are notpart of the services provided to Y by A in fulfillment of itscontract with Y. (xiv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,enters into a contract to construct an apartment complex inboycotting country Y. A will fulfill its contract completely withgoods and services from outside the United States. Pursuant to aprovision in the contract, B guarantees A's performance of thecontract. A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's guarantyof A's performance involves the acquisition of services from theUnited States for purposes of fulfilling the transaction with Y, andthose services are part of the services ultimately provided to Y. (xv) Same as (xiv), except that the guaranty of A's performanceis supplied by C, a non-U.S. person located outside the UnitedStates. However, unrelated to any particular transaction, B fromtime to time provides general financial, legal, and technicalservices to A. A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because theservices acquired from the United States are not acquired forpurposes of fulfilling the contract with Y. (xvi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has a contractwith boycotting country Y to conduct oil drilling operations in thatcountry. In conducting these operations, A from time to time seekscertain technical advice from B regarding the operation of thedrilling rigs. A's contract with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's servicesare sought for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y and arepart of the services ultimately provided to Y. (xvii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,enters into a contract to sell typewriters to boycotting country Y.A is located in non-boycotting country P. None of the components areacquired from the United States. A engages C, a U.S. shippingcompany, to transport the typewriters from P to Y. A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because in carrying A'sgoods, C is providing an ancillary service to A and not a service toY. (xviii) Same as (xvii), except that A's contract with Y callsfor title to pass to Y in P. In addition, the contract calls for Ato engage a carrier to make delivery to Y. A's sales to Y are in U.S. commerce, because in carrying Y'sgoods, C is providing a service to A which is ultimately provided toY. (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, hasgeneral product liability insurance with U.S. company C. Foreign-origin goods sold from time to time by A to boycotting country Y arecovered by the insurance policy. A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the insuranceprovided by C is an ancillary service provided to A which is notultimately provided to Y. (xx) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,manufactures automobiles abroad under a license agreement with B.From time to time, A sells such goods to boycotting country Y. A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the rightsconveyed by the license are not acquired for the specific purpose ofengaging in transactions with Y. (e) ``Intent''. (1) This part prohibits a United States person fromtaking or knowingly agreeing to take certain specified actions withintent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreignboycott. (2) A United States person has the intent to comply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is atleast one of the reasons for that person's decision whether to take aparticular prohibited action. So long as that is at least one of thereasons for that person's action, a violation occurs regardless ofwhether the prohibited action is also taken for non-boycott reasons.Stated differently, the fact that such action was taken for legitimatebusiness reasons does not remove that action from the scope of thispart if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott was also areason for the action. (3) Intent is a necessary element of any violation of this part. Itis not sufficient that one take action that is specifically prohibitedby this part. It is essential that one take such action with intent tocomply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.Accordingly, a person who inadvertently, without boycott intent, takesa prohibited action, does not commit any violation of this part. (4) Intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one'sbehavior. It does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott inquestion or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered orsupported. But it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibitedaction was taken must be established. (5) Reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. Forexample, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycottinformation, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and heknowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends tocomply with that boycott request. It is irrelevant that he may disagreewith or object to the boycott itself. Information will be deemed to befurnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing theinformation knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. On the otherhand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to beblacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferiorproduct, the requisite intent does not exist. (6) Actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply withan unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knewthat such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. On theother hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with ablacklisted person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicatethe existence of the requisite intent. (7) In seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists,all available evidence will be examined.Examples of ``Intent'' The following examples are intended to illustrate the factorswhich will be considered in determining whether the required intentexists. They are illustrative, not comprehensive. (i) U.S. person A does business in boycotting country Y. Inselecting firms to supply goods for shipment to Y, A choosessupplier B because B's products are less expensive and of higherquality than the comparable products of supplier C. A knows that Cis blacklisted, but that is not a reason for A's selection of B. A's choice of B rather than C is not action with intent tocomply with Y's boycott, because C's blacklist status is not areason for A's action. (ii) Same as (i), except that A chooses B rather than C in partbecause C is blacklisted by Y. Since C's blacklist status is a reason for A's choice, A'saction is taken with intent to comply with Y's boycott. (iii) U.S. person A bids on a tender issued by boycottingcountry Y. A inadvertently[[Page 12867]]fails to notice a prohibited certification which appears in thetender document. A's bid is accepted. A's action in bidding was not taken with intent to comply withY's boycott, because the boycott was not a reason for A's action. (iv) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, infavor of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipments of U.S. goodsto boycotting country Y. As A knows, such letters of creditroutinely contain conditions requiring prohibited certifications. Afails to take reasonable steps to prevent the implementation of suchletters of credit. A receives for implementation a letter of creditwhich in fact contains a prohibited condition but does not examinethe letter of credit to determine whether it contains such acondition. Although Y's boycott may not be a specific reason for A's actionin implementing the letter of credit with a prohibited condition,all available evidence shows that A's action was taken with intentto comply with the boycott, because A knows or should know that itsprocedures result in compliance with the boycott. (v) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, infavor of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipment of U.S. goods toboycotting country Y. As A knows, the documentation accompanyingsuch letters of credit sometimes contains prohibited certifications.In accordance with standard banking practices applicable to A, itdoes not examine such accompanying documentation. A receives aletter of credit in favor of a U.S. beneficiary. The letter ofcredit itself contains no prohibited conditions. However, theaccompanying documentation, which A does not examine, does containsuch a condition. All available evidence shows that A's action in implementing theletter of credit was not taken with intent to comply with theboycott, because A has no affirmative obligation to go beyondapplicable standard banking practices in implementing letters ofcredit. (vi) A, a U.S. company, is considering opening a manufacturingfacility in boycotted country X. A already has such a facility inboycotting country Y. After exploring the possibilities in X, Aconcludes that the market does not justify the move. A is aware thatif it did open a plant in X, Y might object because of Y's boycottof X. However Y's possible objection is not a reason for A'sdecision not to open a plant in X. A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is not actionwith intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott of X isnot a reason for A's decision. (vii) Same as (vi), except that after exploring the businesspossibilities in X, A concludes that the market does justify themove to X. However, A does not open the plant because of Y'spossible objections due to Y's boycott of X. A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is action takenwith intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott is areason for A's decision. (viii) A, a U.S. chemical manufacturer, receives a ``boycottquestionnaire'' from boycotting country Y asking, among otherthings, whether A has any plants located in boycotted country X. A,which has never supported Y's boycott of X, responds to Y'squestionnaire, indicating affirmatively that it does have plants inX and that it intends to continue to have plants in X. A's responding to Y's questionnaire is deemed to be action withintent to comply with Y's boycott because A knows that thequestionnaire is boycott-related. It is irrelevant that A does notalso wish to support Y's boycott. (ix) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. Inan attempt to secure its removal from the blacklist, A wishes tosupply to Y information which demonstrates that A does at least asmuch business in Y and other countries engaged in a boycott of X asit does in X. A intends to continue its business in X undiminishedand in fact is exploring and intends to continue exploring anexpansion of its activities in X without regard to Y's boycott. A may furnish the information, because in doing so it has nointent to comply with, further, or support Y's boycott. (x) U.S. company A has a manufacturing facility in boycottedcountry X. A receives an invitation to bid on a construction projectin boycotting country Y. The invitation states that all bidders mustcomplete a boycott questionnaire and send it in with the bid. Thequestionnaire asks for information about A's business relationshipswith X. Regardless of whether A's bid is successful, A intends tocontinue its business in X undiminished and in fact is exploring andintends to continue exploring an expansion of its activities in Xwithout regard to Y's boycott. A may not answer the questionnaire, because, despite A'sintentions with regard to its business operations in X, Y's requestfor completion of the questionnaire is for boycott purposes and byresponding, A's action would betaken with intent to comply with Y'sboycott. (Note: Example (ix) is distinguishable from (x), because in (ix)A is not responding to any boycott request or requirement. Instead,on its own initiative, it is supplying information to demonstratenon-discriminatory conduct as between X and Y without any intent tocomply with, further, or support Y's boycott.)Sec. 760.2 Prohibitions. (a) Refusals to do business.Prohibition Against Refusals To Do Business (1) No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse,require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require anyother person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country,with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycottedcountry, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or withany other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement withthe boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, ora request from or on behalf of the boycotting country. (2) Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consistsof action that excludes a person or country from a transaction forboycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United Statesperson chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis ortakes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection whenhe knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection isboycott-based. (3) Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this sectioninclude not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by acourse or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer andrefusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occurwhen a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunityand declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it. (4) A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list ofpersons with whom he will not deal (a so-called ``blacklist'') or aboycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal (a so-called``whitelist'') constitutes a refusal to do business. (5) An agreement by a United States person to comply generally withthe laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business oran agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply orgovern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in andof itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a personto assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal todo business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such aclause. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on ``Evasion.'') (6) If, for boycott reasons, a United States general managerchooses one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with onesupplier over another, or advises its client to do so, then the generalmanager's actions constitute a refusal to do business under thissection. However, it is not a refusal to do business under this sectionfor a United States person to provide management, procurement, or otherpre-award services for another person so long as the provision of suchpre-award services is customary for that firm (or industry of which thefirm is a part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycottingcharacter of the countries in which they are performed, and the UnitedStates person, in providing such services, does not act to exclude aperson or country from the transaction for boycott reasons, orotherwise take actions that are boycott-based. For example, a UnitedStates person under[[Page 12868]]contract to provide general management services in connection with aconstruction project in a boycotting country may compile lists ofqualified bidders for the client if that service is a customary one andif persons who are qualified are not excluded from that list becausethey are blacklisted. (7) With respect to post-award services, if a client makes aboycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States generalmanager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselvesrefusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or hasreason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It isirrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-awardservices.) Such actions include entering into a contract with theselected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice,executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspectionand shipment of the supplier's goods, or taking any other action toeffect the client's choice. (But see Sec. 760.3(c) of this part on``Compliance with Unilateral Selection'' as it may apply to post-awardservices.) (8) An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of thissection since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant notonly to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or onbehalf of, a boycotting country. (9) Agreements under this section may be either express or impliedby a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct requestfrom a boycotting country for action by a United States person to havebeen taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycottingcountry. (10) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respectto a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreigncommerce of the United States and only when such activities areundertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support anunsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a businessrelationship with or in the boycotted country, with any businessconcern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, withnational(s) or resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any otherperson does not indicate the existence of the required intent.Examples of Refusals and Agreements To Refuse To Do Business The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which, in a boycott situation, arefusal to do business or an agreement to refuse to do business isprohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.Refusals To Do Business (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order for its productsfrom boycotting country Y. To fill that order, A solicits bids fromU.S. companies B and C, manufacturers of components used in A'sproducts. A does not, however, solicit bids from U.S. companies D orE, which also manufacture such components, because it knows that Dand E are restricted from doing business in Y and that theirproducts are, therefore, not importable into that country. Company A may not refuse to solicit bids from D and E forboycott reasons, because to do so would constitute a refusal to dobusiness with those persons. (ii) A, a U.S. exporter, uses company B, a U.S. insurer, toinsure the shipment of its goods to all its overseas customers. Forthe first time, A receives an order for its products from boycottingcountry Y. Knowing that B is on the blacklist of Y, A arranges withcompany C, a non-blacklisted U.S. insurer, to insure the shipment ofits goods to Y. A's action constitutes a refusal to do business with B. (iii) A, a U.S. exporter, purchases all its liability insurancefrom company B, a U.S. company that does business in boycottedcountry X. A wishes to expand its operations into country Y, theboycotting country. Before doing so, A decides to switch frominsurer B to insurer C in anticipation of a request from Y that Asever its relations with B as a condition of doing business in Y. A may not switch insurers for this reason, because doing sowould constitute a refusal to do business with B. (iv) U.S. company A exports goods to boycotting country Y. Inselecting vessels to transport the goods to Y, A chooses only fromamong carriers which call at ports in Y. A's action is not a refusal to do business with carriers whichdo not call at ports in Y. (v) A, a U.S. bank with a branch office in boycotting country Y,sends representatives to boycotted country X to discuss plans foropening a branch office in X. Upon learning of these discussions, anofficial of the local boycott office in Y advises A's local branchmanager that if A opens an office in X it will no longer be allowedto do business in Y. As a result of this notification, A decides toabandon its plans to open a branch in X. Bank A may not abandon its plans to open a branch in X as aresult of Y's notification, because doing so would constitute arefusal to do business in boycotted country X. (vi) A, a U.S. company that manufactures office equipment, hasbeen restricted from doing business in boycotting country Y becauseof its business dealings with boycotted country X. In an effort tohave itself removed from Y's blacklist, A ceases its business in X. A's action constitutes a refusal to do business in boycottedcountry X. (vii) A, a U.S. computer company, does business in boycottingcountry Y. A decides to explore business opportunities in boycottedcountry X. After careful analysis of possible business opportunitiesin X, A decides, solely for business reasons, not to market itsproducts in X. A's decision not to proceed is not a refusal to do business,because it is not based on boycott considerations. A has noaffirmative obligation to do business in X. (viii) A, a U.S. oil company with operations in boycottingcountry Y, has regularly purchased equipment from U.S. petroleumequipment suppliers B, C, and D, none of whom is on the blacklist ofY. Because of its satisfactory relationship with B, C, and D, A hasnot dealt with other suppliers, including supplier E, who isblacklisted by Y. A's failure affirmatively to seek or secure business withblacklisted supplier E is not a refusal to do business with E. (ix) Same as (viii), except U.S. petroleum equipment supplier E,a company on boycotting country Y's blacklist, offers to supply U.S.oil company A with goods comparable to those provided by U.S.suppliers B, C, and D. A, because it has satisfactorily, establishedrelationships with suppliers B, C, and D, does not accept supplierE's offer. A's refusal of supplier E's offer is not a refusal to dobusiness, because it is based solely on non-boycott considerations.A has no affirmative obligation to do business with E. (x) A, a U.S. construction company, enters into a contract tobuild an office complex in boycotting country Y. A receives bidsfrom B and C, U.S. companies that are equally qualified suppliers ofelectrical cable for the project. A knows that B is blacklisted by Yand that C is not. A accepts C's bid, in part because C is asqualified as the other potential supplier and in part because C isnot blacklisted. A's decision to select supplier C instead of blacklistedsupplier B is a refusal to do business, because the boycott was oneof the reasons for A's decision. (xi) A, a U.S. general contractor, has been retained toconstruct a highway in boycotting country Y. A circulates aninvitation to bid to U.S. manufacturers of road-building equipment.One of the conditions listed in the invitation to bid is that, inorder for A to obtain prompt service, suppliers will be required tomaintain a supply of spare parts and a service facility in Y. Aincludes this condition solely for commercial reasons unrelated tothe boycott. Because of this condition, however, those suppliers onY's blacklist do not bid, since they would be unable to satisfy theparts and services requirements. A's action is not a refusal to do business, because thecontractual condition was included solely for legitimate businessreasons and was not boycott-based. (xii) Company A, a U.S. oil company, purchases drill bits fromU.S. suppliers for export to boycotting country Y. In its purchaseorders, A includes a provision requiring the supplier to makedelivery to A's facilities in Y and providing that title to thegoods does not pass until delivery has been made. As is customaryunder such an arrangement, the supplier bears all risks of loss,including loss from fire, theft, perils of the sea, and inability toclear customs, until title passes. Insistence on such an arrangement does not constitute a refusalto do business,[[Page 12869]]because this requirement is imposed on all suppliers whether theyare blacklisted or not. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on``Evasion''). (xiii) A, a U.S. engineering and construction company, contractswith a government agency in boycotting country Y to perform avariety of services in connection with the construction of a largeindustrial facility in Y. Pursuant to this contract, A analyzes themarket of prospective suppliers, compiles a suggested bidders list,analyzes the bids received, and makes recommendations to the client.The client independently selects and awards the contract to supplierC for boycott reasons. All of A's services are performed withoutregard to Y's blacklist or any other boycott considerations, and arethe type of services A provides clients in both boycotting and non-boycotting countries. A's actions do not constitute a refusal to do business, because,in the provision of pre-award services, A has not excluded the otherbidders and because A customarily provides such services to itsclients. (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that in compiling a list ofprospective suppliers, A deletes suppliers he knows his client willrefuse to select because they are blacklisted. A knows thatincluding the names of blacklisted suppliers will neither enhancetheir chances of being selected nor provide his client with a usefulservice, the function for which he has been retained. A's actions, which amount to furnishing a so-called``whitelist'', constitute refusals to do business, because A's pre-award services have not been furnished without regard to boycottconsiderations. (xv) A, a U.S. construction firm, provides its boycottingcountry client with a permissible list of prospective suppliers, B,C, D, and E. The client independently selects and awards thecontract to C, for boycott reasons, and then requests A to advise Cof his selection, negotiate the contract with C, arrange for theshipment, and inspect the goods upon arrival. A knows that C waschosen by the client for boycott reasons. A's action in complying with his client's direction is a refusalto do business, because A's post-award actions carry out hisclient's boycott-based decision. (Note: Whether A's action comeswithin the unilateral selection exception depends upon factorsdiscussed in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part). (xvi) Same as (xv), except that A is building the project on aturnkey basis and will retain title until completion. The clientinstructs A to contract only with C. A's action in contracting with C constitutes a refusal to dobusiness, because it is action that excludes blacklisted personsfrom the transaction for boycott reasons. (Note: Whether A's actioncomes within the unilateral selection exception depends upon factorsdiscussed in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part). (xvii) A, a U.S. exporter of machine tools, receives an orderfor drill presses from boycotting country Y. The cover letter fromY's procurement official states that A was selected over other U.S.manufacturers in part because A is not on Y's blacklist. A's action in filling this order is not a refusal to dobusiness, because A has not excluded anyone from the transaction. (xviii) A, a U.S. engineering firm under contract to construct adam in boycotting country Y, compiles, on a non-boycott basis, alist of potential heavy equipment suppliers, including informationon their qualifications and prior experience. A then solicits bidsfrom the top three firms on its list-B, C, and D-because they arethe best qualified. None of them happens to be blacklisted. A does not solicit bidsfrom E, F, or G, the next three firms on the list, one of whom is onY's blacklist. A's decision to solicit bids from only B, C, and D, is not arefusal to do business with any person, because the solicitedbidders were not selected for boycott reasons. (xix) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he isnot blacklisted. B meets all other conditions of the letter ofcredit but refuses to certify as to his blacklist status. A refusesto pay B on the letter of credit solely because B refuses to certifyas to his blacklist status. A has refused to do business with another person pursuant to aboycott requirement or request. (xx) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to provide acertification from the steamship line that the vessel carrying thegoods is not blacklisted. B seeks payment from A and meets all otherconditions of the letter of credit but refuses or is unable toprovide the certification from the steamship line about the vessel'sblacklist status. A refuses to pay B on the letter of credit solelybecause B cannot or will not provide the certification. A has required another person to refuse to do business pursuantto a boycott requirement or request by insisting that B obtain sucha certificate. (Either A or B may request an amendment to the letterof credit substituting a certificate of vessel eligibility, however.See Example (xxi) below). (xxi) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit from a bank inboycotting country Y in favor of U.S. beneficiary B. The letter ofcredit requires B to provide a certification from the steamship linethat the vessel carrying the goods is eligible to enter the ports inY. B seeks payment from A and meets all other conditions of theletter of credit. A refuses to pay B solely because B cannot or willnot provide the certification. A has neither refused, nor required another person to refuse, todo business with another person pursuant to a boycott requirement orrequest because the vessel eligibility certificate is a commonrequirement for non-boycott purposes. (xxii) U.S. bank A confirms a letter of credit in favor of U.S.beneficiary B. The letter of credit contains a requirement that Bcertify that he is not blacklisted. B presents the letter of creditto U.S. bank C, a correspondent of bank A. B does not present thecertificate of blacklist status to bank C, but, in accordance withthese rules, bank C pays B, and then presents the letter of creditand documentation to bank A for reimbursement. Bank A refuses toreimburse bank C because the blacklist certification of B is notincluded in the documentation. A has required another person to refuse to do business with aperson pursuant to a boycott requirement or request by insistingthat C obtain the certificate from B. (xxiii) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he isnot blacklisted. B fails to provide such a certification when hepresents the documents to A for payment. A notifies B that thecertification has not been submitted. A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant toa boycott requirement by notifying B of the omitted certificate. Amay not refuse to pay on the letter of credit, however, if B statesthat B will not provide such a certificate. (xxiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.beneficiary B from the issuing bank for the purpose of confirmation,negotiation or payment. The letter of credit requires B to certifythat he is not blacklisted. A notifies B that it is contrary to thepolicy of A to handle letters of credit containing this conditionand that, unless an amendment is obtained deleting this condition, Awill not implement the letter of credit. A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant toa boycott requirement, because A has indicated its policy againstimplementing the letter of credit containing the term without regardto B's ability or willingness to furnish such a certificate.Agreements To Refuse To Do Business (i) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency ofboycotting country Y to build a primary school. The proposedcontract contains a clause stating that A ``may not use goods orservices in the project that are produced or provided by any personrestricted from having a business relationship with country Y byreason of Y's boycott against country X''. A's action in entering into such a contract would constitute anagreement to refuse to do business, because it is an agreement toexclude blacklisted persons from the transaction. A may, however,renegotiate this clause so that it does not contain terms prohibitedby this part. (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of commercial refrigerators andfreezers, receives an invitation to bid from boycotting country Y.The tender states that the bidder must agree not to deal withcompanies on Y's blacklist. A does not know which companies are onthe blacklist, and A's bid makes no commitment regarding not dealingwith certain companies. A's bid in response to the tender isaccepted. At the point when A's bid is accepted, A has agreed to refuse todo business with blacklisted persons, because the terms of Y'stender are part of the contract between Y and A. (iii) A, a U.S. construction firm, is offered a contract toperform engineering and construction services in connection with aproject located in boycotting country Y. The contract contains aclause stating that, in the event of a contract dispute, the laws ofY will apply. A may enter into the contract. Agreement that the laws ofboycotting country Y will control in resolving a contract dispute isnot an agreement to refuse to do business.[[Page 12870]] (iv) Same as (iii), except that the contract contains a clausethat A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycottingcountry Y. A knows that Y has a number of boycott laws. Such an agreement is not, in and of itself, an agreement torefuse to do business. If, however, A subsequently refuses to dobusiness with someone because of the laws of Y, A's action would bea refusal to do business. (v) Same as (iv), except that the contract contains a clausethat A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycottingcountry Y, ``including boycott laws''. A's agreeing, without qualification, to comply with localboycott laws constitutes an agreement to refuse to do business. (vi) Same as (v), except that A inserts a proviso ``exceptinsofar as Y's laws conflict with U.S. laws'', or words to thateffect. Such an agreement is not an agreement to refuse to do business. (vii) A, a U.S. general contractor, is retained to construct apipeline in boycotting country Y. A provision in the proposedcontract stipulates that in purchasing equipment, supplies, andservices A must give preference to companies located in host countryY. A may agree to this contract provision. Agreeing to a ``buylocal'' contract provision is not an agreement to refuse to dobusiness, because A's agreement is not made for boycott reasons. (viii) A, a U.S. exporter planning to sell retail goods tocustomers in boycotting country Y, enters into a contract topurchase goods wholesale from B, a U.S. appliance manufacturer. A'scontract with B includes a provision stipulating that B may not usecomponents or services of blacklisted companies in the manufactureof its appliances. A's contract constitutes a refusal to do business, because itwould require another person, B, to refuse to do business with otherpersons for boycott reasons. B may not agree to such a contract,because it would be agreeing to refuse to do business with otherpersons for boycott reasons. (ix) Same as (viii), except that A and B reach an implicitunderstanding that B will not use components or services ofblacklisted companies in the manufacture of goods to be exported toY. In the manufacture of appliances to be sold to A for export tonon-boycotting countries, B uses components manufactured byblacklisted companies. The actions of both A and B constitute agreement to refuse to dobusiness. The agreement is implied by their pattern of conduct. (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Yopens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. Theletter of credit specifies that negotiation of the letter of creditwith a bank that appears on the country X boycott blacklist isprohibited. U.S. bank A, C's correspondent bank, advises B of theletter of credit. B presents documentation to bank A seeking to bepaid on the letter of credit, without amending or otherwise takingexception to the boycott condition. B has agreed to refuse to do business with blacklisted banksbecause, by presenting the letter of credit for payment, B hasaccepted all of its terms and conditions. (b) Discriminatory actions.Prohibition Against Taking Discriminatory Actions (1) No United States person may: (i) Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against anyindividual who is a United States person on the basis of race,religion, sex, or national origin; (ii) Discriminate against any corporation or other organizationwhich is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion,sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee ofsuch corporation or organization; (iii) Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described inparagraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or (iv) Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to takeany of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of thissection. (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory actionis taken by a United States person on its own or in response to anagreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country.This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to aUnited States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerceof the United States and only when such activities are undertaken withintent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreignboycott. (3) The section does not supersede or limit the operation of thecivil rights laws of the United States.Examples of Discriminatory Actions The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which the taking of particulardiscriminatory actions is prohibited. They are illustrative, notcomprehensive. (i) U.S. construction company A is awarded a contract to buildan office complex in boycotting country Y. A, believing thatemployees of a particular religion will not be permitted to work inY because of Y's boycott against country X, excludes U.S. persons ofthat religion from consideration for employment on the project. A's refusal to consider qualified U.S. persons of a particularreligion for work on the project in Y constitutes a prohibitedboycott-based discriminatory action against U.S. persons on thebasis of religion. (ii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract providesthat ``no persons of country X origin are to work on this project.'' A's agreement constitutes a prohibited boycott-based agreementto discriminate against U.S. persons, among others, on the basis ofnational origin. (iii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract providesthat ``no persons who are citizens, residents, or nationals ofcountry X are to work on this project.'' A's agreement does not constitute a boycott-based agreement todiscriminate against U.S. persons on the basis of race, religion,sex, or national origin, because the clause requires exclusion onthe basis of citizenship, residency, and nationality only. (iv) U.S. construction company A enters into a contract to builda school in boycotting country Y. Y's representative orally tells Athat no persons of country X origin are to work on the project. A may not comply, because to do so would constitutediscrimination on the basis of national origin. It makes no difference that A learned of Y's requirement orally.It makes no difference how A learns about Y's discriminatoryrequirement. (v) Boycotting country Y tenders an invitation to bid on aconstruction project in Y. The tender requires that the successfulbidder's personnel will be interviewed and that persons of aparticular religious faith will not be permitted to work on theproject. Y's requirement is based on its boycott of country X, themajority of whose citizens are of that particular faith. Agreement to this provision in the tender document by a U.S.person would constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based discrimination against U.S. persons of a particular religion. (vi) Same as (v), except that the tender specifies that ``womenwill not be allowed to work on this project.'' Agreement to this provision in the tender by a U.S. person doesnot constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-baseddiscrimination, because the restriction against employment of womenis not boycott-based. Such an agreement may, however, constitute aviolation of U.S. civil rights laws. (vii) A is a U.S. investment banking firm. As a condition ofparticipating in an underwriting of securities to be issued byboycotting country Y, A is required to exclude investment banksowned by persons of a particular faith from participation in theunderwriting. Y's requirement is based on its boycott of country X,the majority of whose citizens are of that particular faith. A's agreement to such a provision constitutes a prohibitedagreement to engage in boycott-based discrimination against U.S.persons on the basis of religion. Further, if A requires others toagree to such a condition, A would be acting to require anotherperson to engage in such discrimination. (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y tocertify that A will not use a six-pointed star on the packaging ofits products to be imported into Y. The requirement is part of theenforcement effort by Y of its boycott against country X. A may not so certify. The six-pointed star is a religioussymbol, and the certification by A that it will not use such asymbol constitutes a statement that A will not ship products made orhandled by persons of that religion. (ix) Same as (viii), except that A is asked to certify that nosymbol of boycotted country X will appear on the packaging of itsproducts imported into Y.[[Page 12871]] Such a certification conveys no statement about any person'sreligion and, thus, does not come within this prohibition. (c) Furnishing information about race, religion, sex, or nationalorigin.Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Race, Religion, Sex,or National Origin (1) No United States person may: (i) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or nationalorigin of any United States person; (ii) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or nationalorigin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporationor other organization which is a United States person; (iii) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race,religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person; or (iv) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race,religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, oremployee of any corporation or other organization which is a UnitedStates person. (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the information isspecifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the United Statesperson. It shall also apply whether the information requested orvolunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative. (3) Information about the place of birth of or the nationality ofthe parents of a United States person comes within this prohibition, asdoes information in the form of code words or symbols which couldidentify a United States person's race, religion, sex, or nationalorigin. (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect toa United States person's activities in the interstate or foreigncommerce of the United States and only when such activities areundertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support anunsanctioned foreign boycott.Examples of the Prohibition Against Furnishing DiscriminatoryInformation The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which the furnishing ofdiscriminatory information is prohibited. They are illustrative, notcomprehensive. (i) U.S. company A receives a boycott questionnaire fromboycotting country Y asking whether it is owned or controlled bypersons of a particular faith, whether it has any persons on itsboard of directors who are of that faith, and what the nationalorigin of its president is. The information is sought for purposesof enforcing Y's boycott against country X, and A knows or hasreason to know that the information is sought for that reason. A may not answer the questionnaire, because A would befurnishing information about the religion and national origin ofU.S. persons for purposes of complying with or supporting Y'sboycott against X. (ii) U.S. company A, located in the United States, is asked byboycotting country Y to certify that A has no persons of aparticular national origin on its board of directors. A knows thatY's purpose in asking for the certification is to enforce itsboycott against country X. A may not make such a certification, because A would befurnishing information about the national origin of U.S. persons forpurposes of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X. (iii) U.S. company A believes that boycotting country Y willselect A's bid over those of other bidders if A volunteers that ithas no shareholders, officers, or directors of a particular nationalorigin. A's belief is based on its knowledge that Y generallyrefuses, as part of its boycott against country X, to do businesswith companies owned, controlled, or managed by persons of thisparticular national origin. A may not volunteer this information, because it would befurnishing information about the national origin of U.S. persons forpurposes of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X. (iv) U.S. company A has a contract to construct an airport inboycotting country Y. Before A begins work, A is asked by Y toidentify the national origin of its employees who will work on thesite. A knows or has reason to know that Y is seeking thisinformation in order to enforce its boycott against X. A may not furnish this information, because A would be providinginformation about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposesof complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X. (v) Same as (iv), except that in order to assemble its workforce on site in Y, A sends visa forms to its employees and asksthat the forms be returned to A for transmittal to Y's consulate orembassy. A, itself, furnishes no information about its employees,but merely transmits the visa forms back and forth. In performing the ministerial function of transmitting visaforms, A is not furnishing information about any U.S. person's race,religion, sex, or national origin. (vi) Same as (iv), except that A is asked by Y to certify thatnone of its employees in Y will be women, because Y's laws prohibitwomen from working. Such a certification does not constitute a prohibited furnishingof information about any U.S. person's sex, since the reason theinformation is sought has nothing to do with Y's boycott of X. (vii) U.S. company A is considering establishing an office inboycotting country Y. In order to register to do business in Y, A isasked to furnish information concerning the nationalities of itscorporate officers and board of directors. A may furnish the information about the nationalities of itsofficers and directors, because in so doing A would not befurnishing information about the race, religion, sex, or nationalorigin of any U.S. person. (d) Furnishing information about business relationships withboycotted countries or blacklisted persons.Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Business RelationshipsWith Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted Persons (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree tofurnish information concerning his or any other person's past, presentor proposed business relationships: (i) With or in a boycotted country; (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of aboycotted country; (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to berestricted from having any business relationship with or in aboycotting country. (2) This prohibition shall apply: (i) Whether the information pertains to a business relationshipinvolving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction; legal or commercialrepresentation; shipping or other transportation transaction;insurance; investment; or any other type of business transaction orrelationship; and (ii) Whether the information is directly or indirectly requested oris furnished on the initiative of the United States person. (3) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normalbusiness information in a commercial context. Normal businessinformation may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technicalcompetence, or professional experience, and may be found in documentsnormally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosurestatements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, andtrade and business handbooks. Such information may also appear inspecifications or statements of experience and qualifications. (4) Normal business information furnished in a commercial contextdoes not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting theinformation may be a boycotting country or a national or residentthereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought fora legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness,technical competence, or professional experience), the information maybe furnished even if the information could be used, or without theknowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to beused, for boycott purposes. However, no information about businessrelationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted[[Page 12872]]countries, their residents or nationals, may be furnished in responseto a boycott request, even if the information is publicly available.Requests for such information from a boycott office will be presumed tobe boycott-based. (5) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect toa United States person's activities in the interstate or foreigncommerce of the United States and only when such activities areundertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support anunsanctioned foreign boycott.Examples Concerning Furnishing of Information The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which the furnishing of informationis prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive. (i) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract tobuild a dam in boycotting country Y. The invitation to bid, whichappears in a trade journal, specifies that each bidder must statethat he does not have any offices in boycotted country X. A knows orhas reason to know that the requirement is boycott-based. A may not make this statement, because it constitutesinformation about A's business relationships with X. (ii) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract toconstruct a school in boycotting country Y. Each bidder is requiredto submit copies of its annual report with its bid. Since A's annualreport describes A's worldwide operations, including the countriesin which it does business, it necessarily discloses whether A hasbusiness relations with boycotted country X. A has no reason to knowthat its report is being sought for boycott purposes. A, in furnishing its annual report, is supplying ordinarybusiness information in a commercial context. (iii) Same as (ii), except that accompanying the invitation tobid is a questionnaire from country Y's boycott office asking eachbidder to supply a copy of its annual report. A may not furnish the annual report despite its publicavailability, because it would be furnishing information in responseto a questionnaire from a boycott office. (iv) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. Forreasons unrelated to the boycott, A terminates its businessrelationships with boycotted country X. In exploring other marketingareas, A determines that boycotting country Y offers greatpotential.

A may not furnish the information, because it is informationabout A's business relationships with a boycotted country. (v) U.S. exporter A is seeking to sell its products toboycotting country Y. A is informed by Y that, as a condition ofsale, A must certify that it has no salesmen in boycotted country X.A knows or has reason to know that the condition is boycott-based. A may not furnish the certification, because it is informationabout A's business relationships in a boycotted country. (vi) U.S. engineering company A receives an invitation to bid onthe construction of a dam in boycotting country Y. As a condition ofthe bid, A is asked to certify that it does not have any offices inboycotted country X. A is also asked to furnish plans for other damsit has designed. A may not certify that it has no office in X, because this isinformation about its business relationships in a boycotted country.A may submit plans for other dams it has designed, because this isfurnishing normal business information, in a commercial context,relating to A's technical competence and professional experience. (vii) U.S. company A, in seeking to expand its exports toboycotting country Y, sends a sales representative to Y for a oneweek trip. During a meeting in Y with trade associationrepresentatives, A's representative desires to explain that neitherA nor any companies with which A deals has any business relationshipwith boycotted country X. The purpose of supplying such informationis to ensure that A does not get blacklisted. A's representative may not volunteer this information eventhough A, for reasons unrelated to the boycott, does not deal withX, because A's representative would be volunteering informationabout A's business relationships with X for boycott reasons. (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y tofurnish information concerning its business relationships withboycotted country X. A, knowing that Y is seeking the informationfor boycott purposes, refuses to furnish the information asked fordirectly, but proposes to respond by supplying a copy of its annualreport which lists the countries with which A is presently doingbusiness. A does not happen to be doing business with X. A may not respond to Y's request by supplying its annual report,because A knows that it would be responding to a boycott-basedrequest for information about its business relationships with X. (ix) U.S. company A receives a letter from a central boycottoffice asking A to ``clarify'' A's operations in boycotted countryX. A intends to continue its operations in X, but fears that notresponding to the request will result in its being placed onboycotting country Y's blacklist.

(xii) U.S. bank A plans to open a branch office in boycottingcountry Y. In order to do so, A is required to furnish certaininformation about its business operations, including the location ofits other branch offices. Such information is normally sought inother countries where A has opened a branch office, and A does nothave reason to know that Y is seeking the information for boycottreasons. A may furnish this information, even though in furnishing it Awould disclose information about its business relationships in aboycotted country, because it is being furnished in a normalbusiness context and A does not have reason to know that it issought for boycott reasons. (xiii) U.S. architectural firm A responds to an invitation tosubmit designs for an office complex in boycotting country Y. Theinvitation states that all bidders must include informationconcerning similar types of buildings they have designed. A has notdesigned such buildings in boycotted country X.

A may furnish this information, because this is furnishingnormal business information, in a commercial context, relating toA's technical competence and professional experience. (xiv) U.S. oil company A distributes to potential customerspromotional brochures and catalogs which give background informationon A's past projects.

A may do so, because this is furnishing normal businessinformation, in a commercial context, relating to professionalexperience. (xv) U.S. company A is interested in doing business withboycotting country Y. A wants to ask Y's Ministry of Trade whether,and if so why, A is on Y's blacklist or is otherwise restricted forboycott reasons from doing business with Y.

(xvi) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certifythat it is not owned by subjects or nationals of boycotted country Xand that it is not resident in boycotted country X. A may not furnish the certification, because it is informationabout A's business relationships with or in a boycotted country, orwith nationals of a boycotted country.

(4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect toa United States person's activities in the interstate or foreigncommerce of the United States and only when such activities areundertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support anunsanctioned foreign boycott.Examples of Prohibition Against Furnishing Information AboutAssociations With Charitable or Fraternal Organizations The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which the furnishing of informationconcerning associations with charitable or fraternal organizationsis prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive. (i) U.S. engineering firm A receives an invitation to bid fromboycotting country Y. The invitation includes a request to supplyinformation concerning any association which A's officers have withcharitable organization B, an organization which is known by A tocontribute financial support to boycotted country X. A knows or hasreason to know that the information is sought for boycott reasons. A may not furnish the information. (ii) U.S. construction company A, in an effort to establishbusiness dealings with boycotting country Y, proposes to furnishinformation to Y showing that no members of its board of directorsare in any way associated with charitable organizations whichsupport boycotted country X. A's purpose is to avoid any possibilityof its being blacklisted by Y. A may not furnish the information, because A's purpose in doingso is boycott-based.

In connectionwith his application, A furnishes a resume which happens to disclosehis affiliation with charitable organizations. A does so completelywithout reference to Y's boycott and without knowledge of anyboycott requirement of Y that pertains to A's application foremployment. The furnishing of a resume by A is not a boycott-relatedfurnishing of information about his association with charitableorganizations which support boycotted country X. (f) Letters of credit.Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit ContainingProhibited Conditions or Requirements (1) No United States person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwiseimplement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirementcompliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any UnitedStates person, as a result of the application of this section, beobligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit. (2) For purposes of this section, ``implementing'' a letter ofcredit includes: (i) Issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of acustomer; (ii) Honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit,any letter of credit; (iii) Paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand forpayment by the beneficiary; (iv) Confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsiblefor payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer; (v) Negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing adraft from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement tothe issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit; and (vi) Taking any other action to implement a letter of credit. (3) In the standard international letter of credit transactionfacilitating payment for the export of goods from the United States, abank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue arevocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the United Statesexporter. The customer usually requires, and the letter of creditprovides, that the issuing (or a confirming) bank will make payment tothe beneficiary against the bank's receipt of the documentationspecified in the letter of credit. Such documentation usually includescommercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence ofinsurance, but it may also include other required certifications ordocumentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and informationrelating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.

In addition, it applies only when the transaction to which theletter of credit applies is in United States commerce and thebeneficiary is a United States person.Implementation of Letters of Credit in the United States (7) A letter of credit implemented in the United States by a UnitedStates person located in the United States, including a permanentUnited States establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed toapply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor ofa United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies aUnited States address for the beneficiary. These presumptions may berebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude thatthe beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlyingtransaction is not in United States commerce. (8) Where a letter of credit implemented in the United States by aUnited States person located in the United States does not specify aUnited States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will bepresumed to be other than a United States person. This presumption maybe rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to concludethat the beneficiary is a United States person despite the foreignaddress.Implementation of Letters of Credit Outside the United States (9) A letter of credit implemented outside the United States by aUnited States person located outside the United States will be presumedto apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favorof a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies aUnited States address for the beneficiary and calls for documentsindicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating thatthe goods are of United States origin. These presumptions may berebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude thatthe beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlyingtransaction is not in United States commerce. (10) Where a letter of credit implemented outside the United Statesby a United States person located outside the United States does notspecify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiarywill be presumed to be other than a United States person. In addition,where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicatingshipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goodsare of United States origin, the transaction to which it applies willbe presumed to be outside United States commerce. The presumption thatthe beneficiary is other than a United States person may be rebutted byfacts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that thebeneficiary is a United States person. The presumption that thetransaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside UnitedStates commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably leadthe bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in UnitedStates commerce.Examples of the Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which this section applies to theimplementation of a letter of credit and in which suchimplementation is prohibited. They are illustrative, notcomprehensive.Implementation of Letters of Credit in United States Commerce (i) A, a U.S. bank located in the United States, opens a letterof credit in the United States in favor of B, a foreign companylocated outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies anon-U.S. address for the beneficiary. The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S. person,because it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may berebutted by facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that thebeneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address. (ii) A, a branch of a foreign bank located in the United States,opens a letter of credit in favor of B, a foreign company locatedoutside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a non-U.S.address for the beneficiary. The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S.person,because it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may berebutted by facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that thebeneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address. (iii) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States,opens a letter of credit in favor of B, a person with a U.S.address. The letter of credit calls for documents indicatingshipment of goods from the United States. The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction inU.S. commerce and to be in favor of a U.S. beneficiary because theletter of credit specifies a U.S. address for the beneficiary andcalls for documents indicating that the goods will be shipped fromthe United States. These presumptions may be rebutted by factsshowing that A could reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is nota U.S. person or that the underlying transaction is not in U.S.commerce. (iv) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States,opens a letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary, B, with anaddress outside the United States and calls for documents indicatingthat the goods are of U.S.-origin. A knows or has reason to knowthat although B has an address outside the United States, B is aU.S. person. The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction inU.S. commerce, because the letter of credit calls for shipment ofU.S.-origin goods. In addition, the letter of credit is presumed tobe in favor of a beneficiary who is a U.S. person, because A knowsor has reason to know that the beneficiary is a U.S. person despitethe foreign address. (v) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States,opens a letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary with a U.S.address. The letter of credit calls for documents indicatingshipment of foreign-origin goods. The letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a U.S.beneficiary but to apply to a transaction outside U.S. commerce,because it calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-origingoods. The presumption of non-U.S. commerce may be rebutted by factsshowing that A could reasonably conclude that the underlyingtransaction involves shipment of U.S.-origin goods or goods from theU.S.Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit (i) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Yopens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. Theletter of credit specifies as a condition of payment that B certifythat it does not do business with boycotted country X. Foreign bankC forwards the letter of credit it has opened to U.S. bank A forconfirmation. A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit,because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may notcomply. (ii) Same as (i), except U.S. bank A desires to advise thebeneficiary, U.S. company B, of the letter of credit. A may do so, because advising the beneficiary of the letter ofcredit (including the term which prevents A from implementing it) isnot implementation of the letter of credit. (iii) Same as (i), except foreign bank C sends a telegram toU.S. bank A stating the major terms and conditions of the letter ofcredit. The telegram does not reflect the boycott provision.Subsequently, C mails to A documents setting forth the terms andconditions of the letter of credit, including the prohibited boycottcondition. A may not further implement the letter of credit after itreceives the documents, because they reflect the prohibited boycottcondition in the letter of credit. A may advise the beneficiary andC of the existence of the letter of credit (including the boycottterm), and may perform any essentially ministerial acts necessary todispose of the letter of credit. (iv) Same as (iii), except that U.S. company B, based in part oninformation received from U.S. bank A, desires to obtain anamendment to the letter of credit which would eliminate or nullifythe language in the letter of credit which prevents A from paying orotherwise implementing it. Either company B or bank A may undertake, and the other maycooperate and[[Page 12875]]assist in, this endeavor. A could then pay or otherwise implementthe revised letter of credit, so long as the original prohibitedlanguage is of no force or effect. (v) Boycotting country Y requests a foreign bank in Y to open aletter of credit to effect payment for goods to be shipped by U.S.supplier B, the beneficiary of the letter of credit. The letter ofcredit contains prohibited boycott clauses. The foreign bankforwards a copy of the letter of credit to its branch office A, inthe United States. A may advise the beneficiary but may not implement the letter ofcredit, because it contains prohibited boycott conditions. (vi) On November 1, 1977, boycotting country Y orders goods fromU.S. company B. U.S. bank A is asked to implement, for the benefitof B, a letter of credit which contains a clause requiringdocumentation that the goods shipped are not of boycotted country Xorigin. A may implement the letter of credit, but after June 21, 1978,may accept only a positive certificate of origin as satisfactorydocumentation. (See Sec. 760.3(b) of this part on ``Import andShipping Document Requirements.'') (vii) Same as (vi), except that U.S. company B has a contractwith Y to supply a certain quantity of goods each month over a two-year period. B's contract was entered into on May 15, 1977, and thusqualifies for grace period treatment until December 31, 1978. Eachmonth, Y causes a letter of credit to be opened in favor of B inorder to effect payment. Such letters of credit call for negativecertificates of origin. A may accept negative certificates of origin in fulfillment ofthe terms of the letter of credit through December 31, 1978, becausethe underlying contract is entitled to a grace period through thatdate. (See Sec. 760.8 of this part on ``Grace Period.'') (viii) B is a foreign bank located outside the United States. Bmaintains an account with U.S. bank A, located in the United States.A letter of credit issued by B in favor of a U.S. beneficiaryprovides that any negotiating bank may obtain reimbursement from Aby certifying that all the terms and conditions of the letter ofcredit have been met and then drawing against B's account. Bnotifies A by cable of the issuance of a letter of credit and theexistence of reimbursement authorization; A does not receive a copyof the letter of credit. A may reimburse any negotiating bank, even when the underlyingletter of credit contains a prohibited boycott condition, because Adoes not know or have reason to know that the letter of creditcontains a prohibited boycott condition. (ix) Same as (viii), except that foreign bank B forwards a copyof the letter of credit to U.S. bank A, which then becomes aware ofthe prohibited boycott clause. A may not thereafter reimburse a negotiating bank or in any wayfurther implement the letter of credit, because it knows of theprohibited boycott condition. (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. exporter B andrequests a foreign bank in Y to open a letter of credit in favor ofB to cover the cost. The letter of credit contains a prohibitedboycott clause. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to advise andconfirm the letter of credit. Through inadvertence, A does notnotice the prohibited clause and confirms the letter of credit. Athereafter notices the clause and then refuses to honor B's draftagainst the letter of credit. B sues bank A for payment. A has an absolute defense against the obligation to make paymentunder this letter of credit. (Note that paragraph (ix) of thissection does not alter any other obligations or liabilities of theparties under appropriate law.) (xi) [Reserved] (xii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Aletter of credit which contains a prohibited boycott clause isopened in favor of B by a foreign bank in Y. The foreign bank asksU.S. bank A to advise and confirm the letter of credit, which itforwards to A. A may advise B that it has received the letter of credit(including the boycott term), but may not confirm the letter ofcredit with the prohibited clause. (xiii) Same as (xii), except U.S. bank A fails to tell B that itcannot process the letter of credit. B requests payment. A may not pay. If the prohibited language is eliminated ornullified as the result of renegotiation, A may then pay orotherwise implement the revised letter of credit. (xiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he isnot blacklisted. A may implement such a letter of credit, but it may not insistthat the certification be furnished, because by so insisting itwould be refusing to do business with a blacklisted person incompliance with a boycott. (xv) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S. opens a letter of creditin favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycottingcountry Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, butA knows that Y customarily requires the seller of goods to certifythat it has dealt with no blacklisted supplier. A, therefore,instructs B that it will not make payment under the letter of creditunless B makes such a certification. A's action in requiring the certification from B constitutesaction to require another person to refuse to do business withblacklisted persons. (xvi) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S., opens a letter ofcredit in favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods toboycotting country Y. The letter of credit contains no boycottconditions, but A has actual knowledge that B has agreed to supply acertification to Y that it has not dealt with blacklisted firms, asa condition of receiving the letter of credit in its favor. A may not implement the letter of credit, because it knows thatan implicit condition of the credit is a condition with which B maynot legally comply. (xvii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Yopens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. Theletter of credit includes the statement, ``Do not negotiate withblacklisted banks.'' C forwards the letter of credit it has openedto U.S. bank A for confirmation. A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit,because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may notcomply.Sec. 760.3 Exceptions to prohibitions. (a) Import requirements of a boycotting country.Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country (1) A United States person, in supplying goods or services to aboycotting country, or to a national or resident of a boycottingcountry, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of suchboycotting country which prohibit the import of: (i) Goods or services from the boycotted country; (ii) Goods produced or services provided by any business concernorganized under the laws of the boycotted country; or (iii) Goods produced or services provided by nationals or residentsof the boycotted country. (2) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with suchimport requirements whether or not he has received a specific requestto comply. By its terms, this exception applies only to transactionsinvolving imports into a boycotting country. A United States person maynot, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to dobusiness with a boycotted country or a national or resident of aboycotted country. (3) In taking action within the scope of this exception, a UnitedStates person is limited in the types of boycott-related information hecan supply. (See Sec. 760.2(d) of this part on ``Furnishing InformationAbout Business Relationships with Boycotted Countries or BlacklistedPersons'' and paragraph (c) of this section on ``Import and ShippingDocument Requirements.'')Examples of Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with the importrequirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They areillustrative, not comprehensive. (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order from boycottingcountry Y for its products, country X is boycotted by country Y, andthe import laws of Y prohibit the importation of goods produced ormanufactured in X. In filling this type of order, A would usuallyinclude some component parts produced in X. For the purpose of filling this order, A may substitutecomparable component parts in place of parts produced in X, becausethe import laws of Y prohibit the importation of goods manufacturedin X. (ii) Same as (i), except that A's contract with Y expresslyprovides that in fulfilling the contract A ``may not include partsor[[Page 12876]]components produced or manufactured in boycotted country X.'' A may agree to and comply with this contract provision, becauseY prohibits the importation of goods from X. (NOTE: After June 21,1978, A may not furnish negative certifications regarding the originof components in response to import and shipping documentrequirements.) (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, is awarded a contract toconstruct a plant in boycotting country Y. A accepts bids on goodsrequired under the contract, and the lowest bid is made by B, abusiness concern organized under the laws of X, a country boycottedby Y. Y prohibits the import of goods produced by companiesorganized under the laws of X. For purposes of this contract, A may reject B's bid and acceptanother, because B's goods would be refused entry in to Y because ofY's boycott against X. (iv) Same as (iii), except that A also rejects the low bid by Bfor work on a construction project in country M, a country notboycotted by Y. This exception does not apply, because A's action is not takenin order to comply with Y's requirements prohibiting the import ofproducts from boycotted country X. (v) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, contracts to provideservices to boycotting country Y. Y requests that A not employresidents or nationals of boycotted country X to provide thoseservices. A may agree, as a condition of the contract, not to haveservices furnished by nationals or residents of X, becauseimportation of such services is prohibited by Y. (vi) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a contract to supplymachine tools to boycotting country Y. Y insists that the contractcontain a provision whereby A agrees that none of the machine toolswill be produced by any business concern owned by nationals ofboycotted country X, even if the business concern is organized underthe laws of a non-boycotted country. A may not agree to this provision, because it is a restrictionon the import of goods produced by business concerns owned bynationals of a boycotted country even if the business concernsthemselves are organized under the laws of a non-boycotted country. (b) Shipment of goods to a boycotting country.Compliance With Requirements Regarding the Shipment of Goods to aBoycotting Country (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycottingcountry, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of thatcountry which prohibit the shipment of goods: (i) On a carrier of the boycotted country; or (ii) By a route other than that prescribed by the boycottingcountry or the recipient of the shipment. (2) A specific request that a United States person comply or agreeto comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of aboycotted country is not necessary if the United States person knows,or has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goodsto the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of theboycotting country. This exception applies whether a boycotting countryor the purchaser of the shipment: (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through aport of the boycotted country; or (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does notinclude a port in the boycotted country. (3) For purposes of this exception, the term carrier of a boycottedcountry means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country orwhich is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted countryor by nationals or residents of a boycotted country.Examples of Compliance With the Shipping Requirements of a BoycottingCountry The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with import andshipping document requirements of a boycotting country ispermissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive. (i) A is a U.S. exporter from whom boycotting country Y isimporting goods. Y directs that the goods not pass through a port ofboycotted country X. A may comply with Y's shipping instructions, because theypertain to the route of shipment of goods being shipped to Y. (ii) A, a U.S. fertilizer manufacturer, receives an order fromboycotting country Y for fertilizer. Y specifies in the order that Amay not ship the fertilizer on a carrier of boycotted country X. A may comply with this request, because it pertains to thecarrier of a boycotted country. (iii) B, a resident of boycotting country Y, orders textilegoods from A, a U.S. distributor, specifying that the shipment mustnot be made on a carrier owned or leased by nationals of boycottedcountry X and that the carrier must not pass through a port ofcountry X enroute to Y. A may comply or agree to comply with these requests, becausethey pertain to the shipment of goods to Y on a carrier of aboycotted country and the route such shipment will take. (iv) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. retailmerchant. The order specifies that the goods shipped by A ``may notbe shipped on a carrier registered in or owned by boycotted countryX.'' A may agree to this contract provision, because it pertains tothe carrier of a boycotted country. (v) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S.pharmaceutical company, and requests that the shipment not passthrough a port of country P, which is not a country boycotted by Y. This exception does not apply in a non-boycotting situation. Amay comply with the shipping instructions of Y, because in doing sohe would not violate any prohibition of this part. (c) Import and shipping document requirements.Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements of aBoycotting Country (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycottingcountry, may comply or agree to comply with import and shippingdocument requirements of that country, with respect to: (i) The country or origin of the goods; (ii) The name of the carrier; (iii) The route of the shipment; (iv) The name of the supplier of the shipment; and (v) The name of the provider of other services. (2) After June 21, 1978, all such information must be stated inpositive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms except forinformation with respect to the names of carriers or routes ofshipment, which may continue to be stated in negative terms inconjunction with shipments to a boycotting country, in order to complywith precautionary requirements protecting against war risks orconfiscation. The purpose of this delayed effective date, which isprovided by section 4A(a)(2)(B) of the Export Administration Act of1969, as amended, is to allow time for persons to adjust theirpractices to the use of import and shipping documentation stated inpositive rather than negative terms.Examples of Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with the importrequirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They areillustrative, not comprehensive. (i) Boycotting country Y contracts with A, a U.S. petroleumequipment manufacturer, for certain equipment. Y requires that goodsbeing imported into Y must be accompanied by a certification thatthe goods being supplied did not originate in boycotted country X. Until June 21, 1978, A may comply with such import requirementsin the terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not supply such acertification in negative terms but may identify instead the countryof origin of the goods in positive terms only. (ii) Same as (i), except that Y requires that the shippingdocumentation accompanying the goods specify the country of originof the goods. A may furnish the information. (iii) On February 1, 1978, A, a U.S. distributor, enters into atwo-year contract with boycotting country Y to make monthlyshipments of goods to Y. A clause in the contract requires that allshipments into the[[Page 12877]]country must be accompanied by a certification that the goods didnot originate in X, a country boycotted by Y. A may supply such a negative certification until June 21, 1978.After that date, A may state the origin of the goods on the shippingor import documents in positive terms only. (iv) A, a U.S. apparel manufacturer, has contracted to sellcertain of its products to B, a national of boycotting country Y.The form that must be submitted to customs officials of Y requiresthe shipper to certify that the goods contained in the shipment havenot been supplied by ``blacklisted'' persons. Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required inthe terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not furnish theinformation in negative terms but may certify, in positive termsonly, the name of the supplier of the goods. (v) Same as (iv), except the customs form requires certificationthat the insurer and freight forwarder used are not ``blacklisted.'' Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required inthe terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not comply with therequest but may supply a certification stating, in positive termsonly, the names of the insurer and freight forwarder. (vi) A, a U.S. petrochemical manufacturer, executes a salescontract with B, a resident of boycotting country Y. A provision ofA's contract with B requires that the bill of lading and othershipping documents contain certifications that the goods have notbeen shipped on a ``blacklisted'' carrier. Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required inthe terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not agree to supplya certification that the carrier is not ``blacklisted'' but maycertify the name of the carrier in positive terms only. (vii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requirescertification that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier whichflies the flag of, or is owned, chartered, leased, or operated byboycotted country X, or by nationals or residents of X. Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement toprotect against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at anytime. (viii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that theshipping documents certify the name of the carrier being used. A may, at any time, supply or agree to supply the requesteddocumentation regarding the name of the carrier, either in negativeor positive terms. (ix) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires acertification that the carrier will not call at a port in boycottedcountry X before making delivery in Y. Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement toprotect against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at anytime. (x) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that theshipping documents indicate the name of the insurer and freightforwarder. A may comply at any time, because the statement is not requiredto be made in negative or blacklisting terms. (xi) A, a U.S. exporter, is negotiating a contract to sellbicycles to boycotting country Y. Y insists that A agree to certifythat the goods will not be shipped on a vessel which has ever calledat a port in boycotted country X. As distinguished from a certification that goods will not beshipped on a vessel which will call enroute at a port of boycottedcountry X, such a certification is not a reasonable requirement toprotect against war risks or confiscation, and, hence, may not besupplied. (xii) Same as (xi), except that Y insists that A agree tocertify that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier that isineligible to enter Y's waters. Such a certification, which is not a reasonable requirement toprotect against war risks or confiscation may not be supplied. (xiii) A, a U.S. exporter, sells some of its products toboycotting country Y. A foreign bank located in Y opens a letter ofcredit to pay for the goods. The letter of credit requires that Asupply documentation certifying that ``the goods are notmanufactured in boycotted country X.'' A may make the required certification until June 21, 1978,because import and shipping document requirements of a boycottingcountry may be reflected in letters of credit. (d) Compliance with unilateral selection.Compliance With Unilateral and Specific Selection (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply in thenormal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection bya boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a residentof a boycotting country (including a United States person who is a bonafide resident of a boycotting country) of carriers, insurers, suppliersof services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specificgoods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary andcustomary that an insignificant part of the services be performedwithin the boycotting country, and with respect to goods, the items, inthe normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source ororigin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country byuniqueness of design or appearance or trademark, trade name, or otheridentification normally on the items themselves, including theirpackaging. (2) This exception pertains to what is permissible for a UnitedStates person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specificselection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. Itdoes not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection ispermitted; that question is covered, with respect to United Statespersons, in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with LocalLaw.'' Nor does it pertain to the United States person who is therecipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. Nothing inthis part prohibits or restricts a United States person from filling anorder himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis(e.g., because he is not blacklisted), so long as he does not himselftake any action prohibited by this part.Unilateral and Specific Character of the Selection (3) In order for this exception to apply, the selection with whicha United States person wishes to comply must be unilateral andspecific. (4) A ``specific'' selection is one which is stated in theaffirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods orservices. (5) A ``unilateral'' selection is one in which the discretion inmaking the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. Ifthe United States person who receives a unilateral selection hasprovided the buyer with any boycott-based assistance (includinginformation for purposes of helping the buyer select someone on aboycott basis), then the buyer's selection is not unilateral, andcompliance with that selection by a United States person does not comewithin this exception. (6) The provision of so-called ``pre-selection'' or ``pre-award''services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers,subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy theunilateral character of a selection, provided such services are notboycott-based. Lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must notexclude anyone because he is blacklisted. Moreover, such services mustbe of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm(or industry of which the firm is a part) as measured by the practicein non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. If such services arenot customarily provided in similar transactions or such services areprovided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted persons fromparticipating in a transaction or diminish their opportunity for suchparticipation, then the services may not be provided without destroyingthe unilateral character of any subsequent selection.Selection To Be Made by Boycotting Country Resident (7) In order for this exception to be available, the unilateral andspecific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by anational or resident of a boycotting country. Such a resident may be aUnited States person. For purposes of this exception, a United Statesperson will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if heis a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide[[Page 12878]]resident of a boycotting country even if such person's residency istemporary. (8) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a UnitedStates person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include: (i) Physical presence in the country; (ii) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons; (iii) Continuity of the residency; (iv) Intent to maintain the residency; (v) Prior residence in the country; (vi) Size and nature of presence in the country; (vii) Whether the person is registered to do business orincorporated in the country; (viii) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and (ix) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycottingand non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similarbusiness activities. Note to paragraph (d)(8) of this section: No one of the factorsis dispositive. All the circumstances will be examined closely toascertain whether there is, in fact, a bona fide residency.Residency established solely for purposes of avoidance of theapplication of this part, unrelated to legitimate business needs,does not constitute bona fide residency. (9) The boycotting country resident must be the one actually makingthe selection. If a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent,subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycottingcountry resident, it is not a selection by a resident within themeaning of this exception. (10) A selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merelytransmitted by another person to a United States person for executionis a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of thisexception.Duty of Inquiry (11) If a United States person receives, from another personlocated in the United States, what may be a unilateral selection by aboycotting country customer, and knows or has reason to know that theselection is made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of thetransmitting person to determine who actually made the selection. If heknows or has reason to know that the selection was made by other than aboycotting country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country,he may not comply. A course or pattern of conduct which a United Statesperson recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycottrestrictions will create a duty to inquire. (12) If the United States person does not know or have reason toknow that the selection it receives is boycott-based, its compliancewith such a selection does not offend any prohibition and thisexception is not needed.Selection of Services (13) This exception applies only to compliance with selections ofcertain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, andsuppliers of services to be performed ``within the boycottingcountry.'' Services to be performed wholly within the United States orwholly within any country other than the boycotting country are notcovered. (14) For purposes of this part, services are to be performed``within the boycotting country'' only if they are of a type whichwould customarily be performed by suppliers of those services withinthe country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of theservices performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and notinsignificant part of the total services performed. (15) What is ``customary and necessary'' for these purposes dependson the usual practice of the supplier of the services (or the industryof which he is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting aswell as boycotting countries, except where such practices areinstituted to accommodate this part.Selection of Goods (16) This exception applies only to compliance with selections ofcertain types of goods--goods that, in the normal course of business,are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of theirentry into the boycotting country. The definition of ``specificallyidentifiable goods'' is the same under this section as it is inparagraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.'' (17) Goods ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course ofbusiness are those items which at the time of their entry into aboycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin byuniqueness of design or appearance; or trademark, trade name, or otheridentification normally on the items themselves, including theirpackaging. Goods are ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal courseof business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection ofthe items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whetherinspection takes place. Goods are not considered to be ``specificallyidentifiable'' in the normal course of business if a trademark, tradename, or other form of identification not normally present is added tothe items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate thispart.General (18) If a unilateral selection meets the conditions described inparagraph (d) of this section, the United States person receiving theunilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows orhas reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. However, noUnited States person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateralselection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of theselection is to effect discrimination against any United States personon the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.Examples of Compliance With a Unilateral Selection The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining what constitutes a unilateral selection and thecircumstances in which compliance with such a selection ispermissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.Specific and Unilateral Selection (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer of road-grading equipment, is askedby boycotting country Y to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, acarrier which is not blacklisted by Y. A knows or has reason to knowthat Y's selection of B is boycott-based. A may comply with Y's request, or may agree to comply as acondition of the contract, because the selection is specific andunilateral. (ii) A, a U.S. contractor building an industrial facility inboycotting country Y is asked by B, a resident of Y, to use C as thesupplier of air conditioning equipment to be used in the facility. Cis not blacklisted by country Y. A knows or has reason to know thatB's request is boycott-based. A may comply with B's request, or may agree to comply as acondition of the contract, because the selection of C is specificand unilateral. (iii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of automotive equipment, is askedby boycotting country Y not to ship its goods to Y on U.S. carriers,B, C, or D. Carriers B, C, and D are blacklisted by boycottingcountry Y. A knows or has reason to know that Y's request isboycott-based. A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because nospecific selection of any particular carrier has been made. (iv) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by boycottingcountry Y, is provided by Y with a list of eligible U.S. insurersfrom which A may choose in insuring the shipment of its goods. Aknows or has reason to know that the list was compiled on a boycottbasis. A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request that Achoose from among the eligible insurers, because no specificselection of any particular insurer has been made. (v) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is negotiating to sellaircraft to boycotting country Y. During the negotiations, Y asks A[[Page 12879]]to identify the company which normally manufactures the engines forthe aircraft. A responds that they are normally manufactured by U.S.engine manufacturer B. B is blacklisted by Y. In making thepurchase, Y specifies that the engines for the aircraft should besupplied by U.S. engine manufacturer C. A may comply or agree to comply with Y's selection of C, becauseY's selection is unilateral and specific. (vi) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency ofboycotting country Y to build a pipeline. Y requests A to suggestqualified engineering firms to be used on-site in the constructionof the pipeline. It is customary for A, regardless of where itconducts its operations, to identify qualified engineering firms toits customers so that its customers may make their own selection ofthe firm to be engaged. Choice of engineering firm is customarily aprerogative of the customer. A provides a list of five engineeringfirms, B-F, excluding no firm because it may be blacklisted, andthen confers with and gives its recommendations to Y. A recommendsC, because C is the best qualified. Y then selects B, because C isblacklisted. A may comply with Y's selection of B, because the boycott-baseddecision is made by Y and is unilateral and specific. Since A's pre-award services are of the kind customarily provided in thesesituations, and since they are provided without reference to theboycott, they do not destroy the unilateral character of Y'sselection. (vii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, has an order to supply acertain number of planes to boycotting country Y. In connection withthe order, Y asks A to supply it with a list of qualified aircrafttire manufacturers so that Y can select the tires to be placed onthe planes. This is a highly unusual request, since, in A'sworldwide business operations, choice of tires is customarily madeby the manufacturer, not the customer. Nonetheless, A supplies alist of tire manufacturers, B, C, D, and E. Y chooses tiremanufacturer B because B is not blacklisted. Had A, as is customary,selected the tires, company C would have been chosen. C happens tobe blacklisted, and A knows that C's blacklist status was the reasonfor Y's selection of B. A's provision of a list of tire manufacturers for Y to choosefrom destroys the unilateral character of Y's selection, becausesuch a pre-selection service is not customary in A's worldwidebusiness operations. (viii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives an order fromU.S. company C, which is located in the United States, for the saleof aircraft to company D, a U.S. affiliate of C. D is a bona fideresident of boycotting country Y. C instructs A that ``in order toavoid boycott problems,'' A must use engines that are manufacturedby company B, a company that is not blacklisted by Y. Engines builtby B are unique in design and also bear B's trade name. Since A has reason to know that the selection is boycott-based,he must inquire of C whether the selection was in fact made by D. IfC informs A that the selection was made by D, A may comply. (ix) Same as (viii), except that C initially states that thedesignation was unilaterally and specifically made by D. A may accept C's statement without further investigation and maycomply with the selection, because C merely transmitted D'sunilateral and specific selection. (x) Same as (ix), except that C informs A that it, C, hasselected B on behalf of or as an agent of its affiliated companyresident in the boycotting country. A may not comply with this selection, because the decision wasnot made by a resident of the boycotting country. (xi) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, is advisingboycotting country Y on the selection of a contracting firm toconstruct a plant for the manufacture of agricultural chemicals. Asis customary in its business, A compiles a list of potentialcontractors on the basis of its evaluation of the capabilities ofthe respective candidates to perform the job. A has knowledge thatcompany B is blacklisted, but provides Y with the names of companiesB, C, D, and E, listing them in order of their qualifications. Yinstructs A to negotiate with C. A may comply with Y's instruction, because Y's selection isunilateral and specific. (xii) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by boycotting country Y notto ship goods on carriers B, C, or D, which are owned by nationalsof and are registered in country P, a country not boycotted by Y. A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request even though theselection is not specific, because A does not know or have reason toknow that the request is boycott-based.(Note: In example (xii), A has violated no prohibition, because itdoes not know or have reason to know that Y's instruction isboycott-based. Therefore, A could not act with the requisite intentto comply with the boycott.) (xiii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives a contract toconstruct a hotel in boycotting country Y. As part of the contract,A is required to furnish Y with lists of qualified suppliers ofvarious specifically identifiable items. A compiles lists of variousqualified suppliers wholly without reference to the boycott, andthereafter Y instructs A to negotiate with, enter into contractswith, and arrange for delivery from each of the suppliers which Ydesignates. A knows that Y's choices are made on a boycott basis. A may comply with Y's selections and carry out these post-awardservices for Y, because Y's selections were unilateral and specificand A's pre-award services were provided without reference to Y'sboycott.Examples of Boycotting Country Buyer(The factors in determining whether a United States person is a``bona fide resident'' of a boycotting country are the same as inparagraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.'' Seealso the examples in that section.) (i) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by B, a U.S. person who is abona fide resident of boycotting country Y, to ship goods on U.S.carrier C. C is not blacklisted by Y, and A knows that B has chosenon a boycott basis in order to comply with Y's boycott laws. A may comply or agree to comply with B's request, because B is abona fide resident of Y. (ii) A is a U.S. computer company whose subsidiary, B, is a bonafide resident of boycotting country Y. A receives an order from Bfor specific, identifiable products manufactured by company C inconnection with a computer which B is installing in Y. A may comply or agree to comply with B's unilateral and specificselection, so long as the discretion was in fact exercised by B, notA.(Note: Unilateral selection transactions involving related UnitedStates persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that theselection was in fact made by the bona fide resident of theboycotting country.) (iii) A, a U.S. engineering firm, has chief engineer B as itsresident engineer on a dam construction site in boycotting countryY. B's presence at the site is necessary in order to ensure propersupervision of the project. In order to comply with local law, Bselects equipment supplier C rather than D, who is blacklisted, anddirects A to purchase certain specific equipment from C for use inthe project. A may comply with this unilateral selection, because thedecision was made by a bona fide resident of Y.(As noted above, unilateral selections involving related UnitedStates persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that theselection was in fact made by the bona fide resident of theboycotting country.) (iv) B, a branch of U.S. bank A, is located in boycottingcountry Y. B is in need of office supplies and asks the home officein New York to make the necessary purchases. A contacts C, a U.S.company in the office supply business, and instructs C to purchasevarious items from certain specific companies and ship them directlyto B. In order to avoid any difficulties for B with respect to Y'sboycott laws, A is careful to specify only non-blacklisted companiesor suppliers. C knows that that was A's purpose. C may not complywith A's instruction, because the selection of suppliers was notmade by a resident of a boycotting country. (v) Same as (iv), except that A has given standing instructionsto B that whenever it needs office supplies, it should specifycertain suppliers designated by A. To avoid running afoul of Y'sboycott laws, A's designations consist exclusively of non-blacklisted firms. A receives an order from B with the suppliersdesignated in accordance with A's instructions. A may not comply with B's selection, because the selection wasnot in fact made by a bona fide resident of the boycotting country,but by a person located in the United States.Examples of Suppliers of Services (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country Y toship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a carrier which is not blacklistedby Y. A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request, becausecompliance with the unilateral and specific selection of carriers isexpressly permitted under this exception.[[Page 12880]] (ii) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by C, a nationalof boycotting country Y, is asked by C to insure the shipmentthrough U.S. insurer B. A may comply or agree to comply with C's request, becausecompliance with the unilateral and specific selection of an insureris expressly permitted under this exception. (iii) A, a U.S. construction company, is hired by C, an agencyof the government of boycotting country Y, to build a power plant inY. C specifies that A should subcontract the foundation work to U.S.contractor B. Part of the foundation design work will be done by Bin the United States. A may comply or agree to comply with Y's designation, because anecessary and not insignificant part of B's services are to beperformed within the boycotting country, and such services arecustomarily performed on-site. (iv) A, a U.S. contractor, is engaged by boycotting country Y tobuild a power plant. Y specifies that U.S. architectural firm Bshould be retained by A to design the plant. In order to design theplant, it is essential that B's personnel visit and become familiarwith the site, although the bulk of the design and drawing work willbe done in the United States. A may comply or agree to comply with Y's unilateral and specificselection of architectural firm B, because a necessary and notinsignificant part of B's services are to be performed within Y, andsuch on-site work is customarily involved in the provision ofarchitectural services. The fact that the bulk of the actual workmay be performed in the United States is irrelevant since the partto be performed within Y is necessary to B's effective performance. (v) Same as (iv), except that Y specifies that the turbine forthe power plant should be designed by U.S. engineer C. It is neithercustomary nor necessary for C to visit the site in order to do anyof his work, but C has informed A that he would probably want tovisit the site in Y if he were selected for the job. A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because,in the normal course of business, it is neither customary nornecessary for engineer C's services to be performed in Y. (vi) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives a contract fromboycotting country Y to manufacture jet engines for Y's use. Yspecifies that the engines should be designed by U.S. industrialengineering firm B. A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because,in the normal course of business, the services will not be performedin Y. (vii) U.S. company A has a contract to supply specially designedroad graders to boycotting country Y. Y has instructed A that itshould engage engineering firm B in the design work rather thanengineering firm C, which A normally uses, because C is blacklisted.When A contacts B, B informs A that one of B's personnel customarilyvisits the location in which any equipment B designs is used afterit is in use, in order to determine how good a design job B hasdone. Such visits are necessary from B's point of view to provide acheck on the quality of its work, and they are necessary from Y'spoint of view because they make it possible for Y to discusspossible design changes should deficiencies be detected. A may not comply with Y's selection of B, because the serviceswhich B would perform in Y are an insignificant part of the totalservices to be performed by B.Examples of Specifically Identifiable Goods(The test of what constitutes ``specifically identifiable goods''under this exception also applies to the term ``specificallyidentifiable goods'' as used in paragraph (g) of this section on``Compliance with Local Law.'') (i) A, a U.S. contractor, is constructing an apartment complex,on a turnkey basis, for boycotting country Y. Y instructs A to useonly kitchen appliances manufactured by U.S. company B in completingthe project. The appliances normally bear the manufacturer's nameand trademark. A may comply with Y's selection of B, because Y's unilateral andspecific selection is of goods identifiable as to source or originin the normal course of business at the time of their entry into Y. (ii) Same as (i), except that Y directs A to use lumbermanufactured only by U.S. company C. In the normal course ofbusiness, C neither stamps its name on the lumber nor identifiesitself as the manufacturer on the packaging. In addition, normalexport packaging does not identify the manufacturer. A may not comply with Y's selection, because the goods selectedare not identifiable by source or origin in the normal course ofbusiness at the time of their entry into Y. (iii) B, a U.S. contractor who is a bona fide resident ofboycotting country Y, is engaged in building roads. B retains theservices of A, a U.S. engineering firm, to assist it in procuringconstruction equipment. B directs A to purchase road graders onlyfrom manufacturer C because other road grader manufacturers which Amight use are blacklisted. C's road graders normally bear C'sinsignia. A may comply with B's selection of C, because the goods selectedare identifiable by source or origin in the normal course ofbusiness at the time of their entry into Y. (iv) A, a U.S. company, manufactures computer-operated machinetools. The computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the sideof the equipment and are readily identifiable by brand nameimprinted on the equipment. There are five or six U.S. manufacturersof such computers which will function interchangeably to operate themachine tools manufactured by A. B, a resident of boycotting countryY, contracts to buy the machine tools manufactured by A on thecondition that A incorporate, as the computer drive, a computermanufactured by U.S. company C. B's designation of C is made toavoid boycott problems which could be caused if computersmanufactured by some other company were used. A may comply with B's designation of C, because the goodsselected are identifiable by source or origin in the normal courseof business at the time of their entry into Y. (v) A, a U.S. wholesaler of electronic equipment, receives anorder from B, a U.S. manufacturer of radio equipment, who is a bonafide resident of boycotting country Y. B orders a variety ofelectrical components and specifies that all transistors must bepurchased from company C, which is not blacklisted by Y. Thetransistors requested by B do not normally bear the name of themanufacturer; however, they are typically shipped in cartons, andC's name and logo appear on the cartons. A may comply with B's selection, because the goods selected by Bare identifiable as to source or origin in the normal course ofbusiness at the time of their entry into Y by virtue of thecontainers or packaging used. (vi) A, a U.S. computer manufacturer, receives an order for acomputer from B, a university in boycotting country Y. B specifiesthat certain integrated circuits incorporated in the computer mustbe supplied by U.S. electronics company C. These circuits areincorporated into the computer and are not visible withoutdisassembling the computer. A may not comply or agree to comply with B's specific selectionof these components, because they are not identifiable as to theirsource or origin in the normal course of business at the time oftheir entry into Y. (vii) A, a U.S. clothing manufacturer, receives an order forshirts from B, a retailer resident in boycotting country Y. Bspecifies that the shirts are to be manufactured from cottonproduced by U.S. farming cooperative C. Such shirts will notidentify C or the source of the cotton. A may not comply or agree to comply with B's designation,because the cotton is not identifiable as to source or origin in thenormal course of business at the time of entry into Y. (viii) A, a U.S. contractor, is retained by B, a constructionfirm located in and wholly-owned by boycotting country Y, to assistB in procuring construction materials. B directs A to purchase arange of materials, including hardware, tools, and trucks, all ofwhich bear the name of the manufacturer stamped on the item. Inaddition, B directs A to purchase steel beams manufactured by U.S.company C. The name of manufacturer C normally does not appear onthe steel itself or on its export packaging. A may comply with B's selection of the hardware, tools, andtrucks, because they are identifiable as to source or origin in thenormal course of business at the time of entry into Y. A may notcomply with B's selection of steel beams, because the goods are notidentifiable as to source or origin by trade name, trademark,uniqueness or packaging at the time of their entry into Y.Examples of Discrimination on Basis of Race, Religion, Sex, or NationalOrigin (i) A, a U.S. paper manufacturer, is asked by boycotting countryY to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B. Y states that the reason forits choice of B is that, unlike U.S. vessel C, B is not owned bypersons of a particular faith. A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because Ahas reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effectreligious discrimination against a United States person.[[Page 12881]] (e) Shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycottingcountry's requirements.Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements Regarding Shipmentand Transshipment of Exports (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with theexport requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipmentsor transshipments of exports to: (i) A boycotted country; (ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country; (iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycottedcountry; or (iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country. (2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which aboycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country;on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass viathird parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or businessconcerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country,including those located in third countries. (3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions whicha boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments whenthe restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the exportshipments from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction ofthe boycotted country. This exception applies whether a boycottingcountry or the vendor of the shipment: (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through theboycotted country enroute to its final destination; or (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does notinclude the boycotted country. (4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse onan across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or anational or resident of a boycotted country.Examples of Compliance With a Boycotting Country's RequirementsRegarding Shipment or Transshipment of Exports The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with the exportrequirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They areillustrative, not comprehensive. (i) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to20 countries, including the United States, from boycotting countryY. Country Y's export regulations require that products not beexported from Y to boycotted country X. A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect tothe export of goods from Y to X. (ii) Same as (i), except that Y's export regulations requirethat goods not be exported from boycotting country Y to any businessconcern organized under the laws of boycotted country X. A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect tothe export of goods from Y to a business concern organized under thelaws of X, even if such concern is located in a country not involvedin Y's boycott of X. (iii) B, the operator of a storage facility in country M,contracts with A, a U.S. carrier, for the shipment of certain goodsmanufactured in boycotting country Y. A's contract with B contains aprovision stating that the goods to be transported may not beshipped or transshipped to boycotted country X. B informs A thatthis provision is a requirement of C, the manufacturer of goods whois a resident of boycotting country Y. Country M is not boycotted byY. A may agree to and comply with this provision, because such aprovision is required by the export regulations of boycottingcountry Y in order to prevent shipment of Y-origin goods to acountry boycotted by Y. (iv) A, a U.S. petroleum refiner located in the United States,purchases crude oil from boycotting country Y. A has a branchoperation in boycotted country X. Y requires, as a condition ofsale, that A agree not to ship or transship the crude oil orproducts refined in Y to A's branch in X. A may agree to and comply with these requirements, because theyare export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin productsfrom being shipped to a boycotted country. (v) A, a U.S. company, has a petrochemical plant in boycottingcountry Y. As a condition of securing an export license from Y, Amust agree that it will not ship or permit transshipment of any ofits output from the plant in Y to any companies which Y lists asbeing owned by nationals of boycotted country X. A may agree to this condition, because it is a restrictiondesigned to prevent Y-origin products from being exported to abusiness concern of boycotted country X or to nationals of boycottedcountry X. (vi) Same as (v), except that the condition imposed on A is thatY-origin goods may not be shipped or permitted to be transshipped toany companies which Y lists as being owned by persons whose nationalorigin is X. A may not agree to this condition, because it is a restrictiondesigned to prevent Y-origin goods from being exported to persons ofa particular national origin rather than to residents or nationalsof a particular boycotted country. (vii) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to20 countries, including the United States, from boycotting countryY. Y requires, as a condition of sale, that A not ship the productsto be exported from Y to or through boycotted country X. A may agree to and comply with this requirement because it is anexport requirement of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products fromcoming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycottedcountry. (viii) Same as (vii), except that boycotting country Y's exportregulations require that products to be exported from Y not passthrough a port of boycotted country X. A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations prohibiting Y-origin exports from passing through a port at boycotted country X,because they are export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from coming into contact with or under thejurisdiction of a boycotted country. (ix) Same as (vii), except that Y's export regulations requirethat A not transship the exported products ``in or at'' boycottedcountry X. A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect tothe transshipment of goods ``in or at'' X, because they are exportrequirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from cominginto contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted country. (f) Immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of aboycotting country.Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment Requirementsof a Boycotting Country (1) A United States individual may comply or agree to comply withthe immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of aboycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycottingcountry made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirementsfor employment within the boycotting country, provided that hefurnishes information only about himself or a member of his family, andnot about any other United States individual, including his employees,employers, or co-workers. (2) For purposes of this section, a United States individual meansa person who is a resident or national of the United States. Familymeans immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse,children, and other dependents living in the individual's home. (3) A United States person may not furnish information about itsemployees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on hisown to any request for information relating to immigration, passport,visa, or employment requirements. A United States person may alsoperform any ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications byindividuals. These include informing employees of boycotting countryvisa requirements at an appropriate time; typing, translation,messenger and similar services; and assisting in or arranging for theexpeditious processing of applications.[[Page 12882]]All such actions must be undertaken on a non-discriminatory basis. (4) A United States person may proceed with a project in aboycotting country even if certain of its employees or otherprospective participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycottreasons. But no employees or other participants may be selected inadvance in a manner designed to comply with a boycott.Examples of Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or EmploymentRequirements of a Boycotting Country The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with immigration,passport, visa, or employment requirements is permissible. They areillustrative, not comprehensive. (i) A, a U.S. individual employed by B, a U.S. manufacturer ofsporting goods with a plant in boycotting country Y, wishes toobtain a work visa so that he may transfer to the plant in Y.Country Y's immigration laws specify that anyone wishing to enterthe country or obtain a visa to work in the country must supplyinformation about his religion. This information is required forboycott purposes. A may furnish such information, because it is required by Y'simmigration laws. (ii) Same as (i), except that A is asked to supply suchinformation about other employees of B. A may not supply this information, because it is not informationabout himself or his family. (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, has been awarded aconstruction contract to be performed in boycotting country Y. Y'simmigration laws require that individuals applying for visas mustindicate race, religion, and place of birth. The information issought for boycott purposes. To avoid repeated rejections ofapplications for work visas by A's employees, A desires to furnishto country Y a list of its prospective and current employees andrequired information about each so that Y can make an initialscreening. A may not furnish such a list, because A would be furnishinginformation about the race, religion, and national origin of itsemployees. (iv) Same as (iii), except that A selects for work on theproject those of its current employees whom it believes will begranted work visas from boycotting country Y. A may not make a selection from among its employees in a mannerdesigned to comply with the boycott-based visa requirements of Y,but must allow all eligible employees to apply for visas. A maylater substitute an employee who obtains the necessary visa for onewho has had his application rejected. (v) Same as (iii), except that A selects employees for theproject and then allows each employee individually to apply for hisown visa. Two employees' applications are rejected, and A thensubstitutes two other employees who, in turn, submit their own visaapplications. A may take such action, because in so doing A is not acting incontravention of any prohibition of this part. (vi) Same as (v), except that A arranges for the translation,typing and processing of its employees' applications, and transmitsall the applications to the consulate of boycotting country Y. A may take such ministerial actions, because in so doing A isnot itself furnishing information with respect to race, religion,sex, or national origin, but is merely transmitting informationfurnished by its individual employees. (vii) A, a U.S. contractor, selects U.S. subcontractor B toperform certain engineering services in connection with A's projectin boycotting country Y. The work visa application submitted by theemployee B has proposed as chief engineer of this project isrejected by Y because his national origin is of boycotted country X.Subcontractor B thereupon withdraws. A may continue with the project and select anothersubcontractor, because A is not acting in contravention of anyprohibition of this part. (g) Compliance with local law. (1) This exception contains two parts. The first covers compliancewith local law with respect to a United States person's activitiesexclusively within a foreign country; the second covers compliance withlocal import laws by United States persons resident in a foreigncountry. Under both parts of this exception, local laws are laws of thehost country, whether derived from statutes, regulations, decrees, orother official sources having the effect of law in the host country.This exception is not available for compliance with presumed policiesor understandings of policies unless those policies are reflected inofficial sources having the effect of law. (2) Both parts of this exception apply only to United Statespersons resident in a foreign country. For purposes of this exception,a United States person will be considered to be a resident of a foreigncountry only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person maybe a bona fide resident of a foreign country even if such person'sresidency is temporary. (3)(i) Factors that will be considered in determining whether aUnited States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign countryinclude: (A) Physical presence in the country; (B) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons; (C) Continuity of the residency; (D) Intent to maintain the residency; (E) Prior residence in the country; (F) Size and nature of presence in the country; (G) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporatedin the country; (H) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and (I) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycottingand non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similarbusiness activities. (ii) No one of the factors in paragraph (g)(3) of this section isdispositive. All the circumstances involved will be closely examined toascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. Residencyestablished solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of thispart, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bonafide residency.Examples of Bona Fide Residency The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which a United States person may bea bona fide resident of a foreign country. For purposes ofillustration, each example discusses only one or two factors,instead of all relevant factors. They are illustrative, notcomprehensive. (i) A, a U.S. radio manufacturer located in the United States,receives a tender to bid on a contract to supply radios for a hotelto be built in boycotting country Y. After examining the proposal, Asends a bid from its New York office to Y. A is not a resident of Y, because it is not physically presentin Y. (ii) Same as (i), except that after receiving the tender, Asends its sales representative to Y. A does not usually have salesrepresentatives in countries when it bids from the United States,and this particular person's presence in Y is not necessary toenable A to make the bid. A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because it has no legitimatebusiness reasons for having its sales representative resident in Y. (iii) A, a U.S. bank, wishes to establish a branch office inboycotting country Y. In pursuit of that objective, A's personnelvisit Y to make the necessary arrangements. A intends to establish apermanent branch office in Y after the necessary arrangements aremade. A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because Adoes not yet have a permanent business operation in Y. (iv) Same as (iii), except A's personnel are required by Y'slaws to furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information inorder to establish a branch in Y. In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish thenon-discriminatory boycott information necessary to establishresidency to the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fideresident in that country could. If this information could not befurnished in such limited circumstances, the exception would beavailable only to firms resident in a boycotting country before theeffective date of this part. (v) A, a U.S. construction company, receives an invitation tobuild a power plant in boycotting country Y. After receipt of theinvitation, A's personnel visit Y in order to[[Page 12883]]survey the site and make necessary analyses in preparation forsubmitting a bid. The invitation requires that otherwise prohibitedboycott information be furnished with the bid. A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because Ahas no permanent business operation in Y. Therefore, A's personnelmay not furnish the prohibited information. (vi) Same as (v), except that A is considering establishing anoffice in boycotting country Y. A's personnel visit Y in order toregister A to do business in that country. A intends to establishongoing construction operations in Y. A's personnel are required byY's laws to furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott informationin order to register A to do business or incorporate a subsidiary inY. In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish non-discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish residencyto the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident in thatcountry could. If this information could not be furnished in suchlimited circumstances, the exception would be available only tofirms resident in a boycotting country before the effective date ofthis part. (vii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. oil company B, is located inboycotting country Y. A has been engaged in oil explorations in Yfor a number of years. A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its pre-existingcontinuous presence in Y for legitimate business reasons. (viii) Same as (vii), except that A has just been established inY and has not yet begun operations. A is a bona fide resident of Y, because it is present in Y forlegitimate business reasons and it intends to reside continuously. (ix) U.S. company A is a manufacturer of prefabricated homes. Abuilds a plant in boycotting country Y for purposes of assemblingcomponents made by A in the United States and shipped to Y. A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A'splant in Y is established for legitimate business reasons, and itintends to reside continuously. (x) U.S. company A has its principal place of business in theUnited States. A's sales agent visits boycotting country Y from timeto time for purposes of soliciting orders. A's sales agent is not a bona fide resident of Y, because suchperiodic visits to Y are insufficient to establish a bona fideresidency. (xi) A, a branch office of U.S. construction company B, islocated in boycotting country Y. The branch office has been inexistence for a number of years and has been performing variousmanagement services in connection with B's construction operationsin Y. A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its longstandingpresence in Y and its conduct of ongoing operations in Y. (xii) U.S. construction company A has never done any business inboycotting country Y. It is awarded a contract to construct ahospital in Y, and preparatory to beginning construction, sends itspersonnel to Y to set up operations. A's personnel are bona fide residents of Y, because they arepresent in Y for the purposes of carrying out A's legitimatebusiness purposes; they intend to reside continuously; and residencyis necessary to conduct their business. (xiii) U.S. company A manufactures furniture. All its sales inforeign countries are conducted from its offices in the UnitedStates. From time to time A has considered opening sales officesabroad, but it has concluded that it is more efficient to conductsales operations from the United States. Shortly after the effectivedate of this part, A sends a sales representative to boycottingcountry Y to open an office in and solicit orders from Y. It is morecostly to conduct operations from that office than to sell directlyfrom the United States, but A believes that if it establishes aresidence in Y, it will be in a better position to avoid conflictswith U.S. law in its sales to Y. A's sales representative is not a bona fide resident of Y,because the residency was established to avoid the application ofthis part and not for legitimate business reasons. (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that it is in fact more efficientto have a sales office in Y. In fact, without a sales office in Y, Awould find it difficult to explore business opportunities in Y. A isaware, however, that residency in Y would permit its salesrepresentative to comply with Y's boycott laws. A's sales representative is a bona fide resident of Y, because Ahas a legitimate business reason for establishing a sales office inY. (xv) U.S. company B is a computer manufacturer. B sellscomputers and related programming services tailored to the needs ofindividual clients. Because of the complex nature of the product, Bmust have sales representatives in any country where sales are made.B has a sales representative, A, in boycotting country Y. A spendstwo months of the year in Y, and the rest of the year in othercountries. B has a permanent sales office from which A operateswhile in Y, and the sales office is stocked with brochures and othersales materials. A is a bona fide resident of Y, because his presence in Y isnecessary to carry out B's legitimate business purposes; B maintainsa permanent office in Y; and B intends to continue doing business inY in the future. (xvi) A, a U.S. construction engineering company, is engaged byB, a U.S. general contracting company, to provide services inconnection with B's contract to construct a hospital complex inboycotting country Y. In order to perform those services, A'sengineers set up a temporary office in a trailer on the constructionsite in Y. A's work is expected to be completed within six months. A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's on-site office is necessary to the performance of its services for B,and because A's personnel are continuously there. (xvii) A, a U.S. company, sends one of its representatives toboycotting country Y to explore new sales possibilities for its lineof transistor radios. After spending several weeks in Y, A'srepresentative rents a post office box in Y, to which all personsinterested in A's products are directed to make inquiry. A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because rental of a postoffice box is not a sufficient presence in Y to constituteresidency. (xviii) A, a U.S. computer company, has a patent and trademarkregistered in the United States. In order to obtain registration ofits patent and trademark in boycotting country Y, A is required tofurnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information. A may not furnish the information, because A is not a bona fideresident of Y. (h) Activities exclusively within a foreign country. (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of aforeign country, including a boycotting country, may comply or agree tocomply with the laws of that country with respect to his activitiesexclusively within that country. These activities include: (i) Entering into contracts which provide that local law applies orgoverns, or that the parties will comply with such laws; (ii) Employing residents of the host country; (iii) Retaining local contractors to perform work within the hostcountry; (iv) Purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residentsof the host country; and (v) Furnishing information within the host country. (2) Activities exclusively within the country do not includeimporting goods or services from outside the host country, and,therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance withimport laws in connection with importing goods or services.Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Law With Respect toActivities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with local law ispermissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country (i) U.S. construction company A, a bona fide resident ofboycotting country Y, has a contract to build a school complex in Y.Pursuant to Y's boycott laws, the contract requires A to refuse topurchase supplies from certain local merchants. While Y permits suchmerchants to operate within Y, their freedom of action in Y isconstrained because of their relationship with boycotted country X. A may enter into the contract, because dealings with localmerchants are activities exclusively within Y. (ii) A, a banking subsidiary of U.S. bank B, is a bona fideresident of boycotting country Y. From time to time, A purchasesoffice supplies from the United States. A's purchase of office supplies is not an activity exclusivelywithin Y, because it involves the import of goods from abroad. (iii) A, a branch of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide resident ofboycotting country Y. Under[[Page 12884]]Y's boycott laws, A is required to supply information about whetherA has any dealings with boycotted country X. A compiles andfurnishes the information within Y and does so of its own knowledge. A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling andfurnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, Ais engaging in an activity exclusively within Y. (iv) Same as (iii), except that A is required to supplyinformation about B's dealings with X. From its own knowledge andwithout making any inquiry of B, A compiles and furnishes theinformation. A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling andfurnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, Ais engaging in an activity exclusively within Y. (v) Same as (iv), except that in making its responses, A asks Bto compile some of the information. A may not comply, because the gathering of the necessaryinformation takes place partially outside Y. (vi) U.S. company A has applied for a license to establish apermanent manufacturing facility in boycotting country Y. Under Y'sboycott law, A must agree, as a condition of the license, that itwill not sell any of its output to blacklisted foreign firms. A may not comply, because the agreement would govern activitiesof A which are not exclusively within Y.Discrimination Against United States Persons (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide residentof boycotting country Y. A manufactures air conditioners in itsplant in Y. Under Y's boycott laws, A must agree not to hirenationals of boycotted country X. A may agree to the restriction and may abide by it with respectto its recruitment of individuals within Y, because the recruitmentof such individuals is an activity exclusively within Y. However, Acannot abide by this restriction with respect to its recruitment ofindividuals outside Y, because this is not an activity exclusivelywithin Y. (ii) Same as (i), except that pursuant to Y's boycott laws, Amust agree not to hire anyone who is of a designated religion. A may not agree to this restriction, because the agreement callsfor discrimination against U.S. persons on the basis of religion. Itmakes no difference whether the recruitment of the U.S. personsoccurs within or without Y.(Note: The exception for compliance with local law does not apply toboycott-based refusals to employ U.S. persons on the basis of race,religion, sex, or national origin even if the activity isexclusively within the boycotting country.) (i) Compliance with local import law. (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of aforeign country, including a boycotting country, may, in importinggoods, materials or components into that country, comply or agree tocomply with the import laws of that country, provided that: (i) The items are for his own use or for his use in performingcontractual services within that country; and (ii) In the normal course of business, the items are identifiableas to their source or origin at the time of their entry into theforeign country by: (a) Uniqueness of design or appearance; or (b) Trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on theitems themselves, including their packaging. (2) The factors that will be considered in determining whether aUnited States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country arethose set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Bona fide residenceof a United States company's subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanentestablishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence onsuch United States company. Likewise, bona fide residence of a UnitedStates company's employee in a foreign country does not confer suchresidence on the entire company. (3) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreigncountry may take action under this exception through an agent outsidethe country, but the agent must act at the direction of the residentand not exercise his own discretion. Therefore, if a United Statesperson resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with aboycotting country's import law with respect to the importation ofqualified goods, he may direct his agent in the United States on theaction to be taken, but the United States agent himself may notexercise any discretion. (4) For purposes of this exception, the test that governs whethergoods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identicalto the test applied in paragraph (c) of this section on ``ComplianceWith Unilateral Selection'' to determine whether they are identifiableas to their source or origin in the normal course of business. (5) The availability of this exception for the import of goodsdepends on whether the goods are intended for the United Statesperson's own use at the time they are imported. It does not depend uponwho has title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreigncountry. (6) Goods are for the United States person's own use (including theperformance of contractual services within the foreign country) if: (i) They are to be consumed by the United States person; (ii) They are to remain in the United States person's possessionand to be used by that person; (iii) They are to be used by the United States person in performingcontractual services for another; (iv) They are to be further manufactured, incorporated into,refined into, or reprocessed into another product to be manufacturedfor another; or (v) They are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as afunctional part of, a project to be constructed for another. (7) Goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another arenot for the United States person's own use. Goods procured for anotherare not for one's own use, even if the furnishing of procurementservices is the business in which the United States person iscustomarily engaged. Nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquiredfor one's own use, even if the United States person is engaged in theretail business. Likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkeyproject are not for one's own use if they are not customarilyincorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed asa functional part of the project. (8) This part of the local law exception does not apply to theimport of services, even when the United States person importing suchservices is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country and isimporting them for his own use. In addition, this exception isavailable for a United States person who is a bona fide resident of aforeign country only when the individual or entity actually presentwithin that country takes action through the exercise of his owndiscretion. (9) Use of this exception will be monitored and continuallyreviewed to determine whether its continued availability is consistentwith the national interest. Its availability may be limited orwithdrawn as appropriate. In reviewing the continued availability ofthis exception, the effect that the inability to comply with localimport laws would have on the economic and other relations of theUnited States with boycotting countries will be considered. (10) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of aforeign country may comply or agree to comply with the host country'simport laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular lawsare boycott-related. However, no United States person may comply oragree to comply with any host country law which would require him todiscriminate against any United States person on the basis of race,religion, sex, or national origin, or to supply information about anyUnited States person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.[[Page 12885]]Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Import Law The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining the circumstances in which compliance with local importlaw is permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.Compliance by a Bona Fide Resident (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide residentof boycotting country Y and is engaged in oil drilling operations inY. In acquiring certain large, specifically identifiable productsfor carrying out its operations in Y, A chooses only from non-blacklisted firms because Y's import laws prohibit the importationof goods from blacklisted firms. However, with respect to smalleritems, B makes the selection on behalf of A and sends them to A inY. A may choose from non-blacklisted firms, because it is a U.S.person who is a bona fide resident in Y. However, because B is notresident in Y, B cannot make boycott-based selections to conformwith Y's import laws prohibiting the importation of goods fromblacklisted firms. (ii) Same as (i), except that after making its choices on thelarger items, A directs B to carry out its instructions by enteringinto appropriate contracts and making necessary shippingarrangements. B may carry out A's instructions provided that A, a bona fideresident of Y, has in fact made the choice and B is exercising nodiscretion, but is acting only as A's agent. (Note: Such transactions between related companies will bescrutinized carefully. A must in fact exercise the discretion andmake the selections. If the discretion is exercised by B, B would bein violation of this part.) (iii) U.S. construction company A has a contract to build aschool in boycotting country Y. A's employees set up operations in Yfor purposes of commencing construction. A's employees in Y adviseA's headquarters in the United States that Y's import laws prohibitimportation of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. A'sheadquarters then issues invitations to bid only to non-blacklistedfirms for certain specifically identifiable goods. A's headquarters' choice of non-blacklisted suppliers is not achoice made by a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Y,because the discretion in issuing the bids was exercised in theUnited States, not in Y. (iv) Same as (iii), except that A's employees in Y actually makethe decision regarding to whom the bids should be issued. The choices made by A's employees are choices made by U.S.persons who are bona fide residents of Y, because the discretion inchoosing was exercised solely in Y.(Note: Choices purportedly made by employees of U.S. companies whoare resident in boycotting countries will be carefully scrutinizedto ensure that the discretion was exercised entirely in theboycotting country.)Specifically Identifiable Goods The test and examples as to what constitutes specificallyidentifiable goods are identical to those applicable under paragraph(d) of this section on ``Compliance With Unilateral Selection.''Imports for U.S. Person's Own Use (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide residentof boycotting country Y. A plans to import computer operated machinetools to be installed in its automobile plant in boycotting countryY. The computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side ofthe equipment and are readily identifiable by brand name. A ordersthe tools from U.S. supplier C and specifies that C must incorporatecomputers manufactured by D, a non-blacklisted company. A would havechosen computers manufactured by E, except that E is blacklisted,and Y's import laws prohibit the importation of goods manufacturedby blacklisted firms. A may refuse to purchase E's computers, because A is importingthe computers for its own use in its manufacturing operations in Y. (ii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide residentof boycotting country Y. To meet the needs of its employees in Y, Aimports certain specifically identifiable commissary items for sale,such as cosmetics; and canteen items, such as candy. In selectingsuch items for importation into Y, A chooses items made only by non-blacklisted firms, because Y's import laws prohibit importation ofgoods from blacklisted firms. A may import these items only from non-blacklisted firms,because the importation of goods for consumption by A's employees isan importation for A's own use. (iii) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fideresident of boycotting country Y, has a contract to build a hospitalcomplex for the Ministry of Health in Y. Under the contract, A willbe general manager of the project with discretion to choose allsubcontractors and suppliers. The complex is to be built on aturnkey basis, with A retaining title to the property and bearingall financial risk until the complex is conveyed to Y. In choosingspecifically identifiable goods for import, such as central airconditioning units and plate glass, A excludes blacklisted suppliersin order to comply with Y's import laws. These goods are customarilyincorporated into, or permanently affixed as a functional part of,the project. A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specificallyidentifiable goods, because importation of goods by a generalcontractor to be incorporated into a construction project in Y is animportation of goods for A's own use. (iv) Same as (iii), except that, in addition, in choosing U.S.architects and engineers to work on the project, A excludesblacklisted firms, because Y's import laws prohibit the use ofservices rendered by blacklisted persons. A may not refuse to deal with blacklisted architectural orengineering firms, because this exception does not apply to theimport of services. It is irrelevant that, at some stage, thearchitectural or engineering drawings or plans may be brought to thesite in Y. This factor is insufficient to transform such servicesinto ``goods'' for purposes of this exception. (v) Same as (iii), except that the project is to be completed ona ``cost plus'' basis, with Y making progress payments to A atvarious stages of completion. A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specificallyidentifiable goods, because the importation of goods by A to beincorporated in a project A is under contract to complete is animportation of goods for its own use. The terms of payment areirrelevant. (vi) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fideresident of boycotting country Y, has a contract for theconstruction of an office building in Y on a turnkey basis. Inchoosing goods to be used or included in the office complex, Aorders wallboard, office partitions, and lighting fixtures from non-blacklisted manufacturers. A likewise orders desks, office chairs,typewriters, and office supplies from non-blacklisted manufacturers. Because they are customarily incorporated into or permanentlyaffixed as a functional part of an office building, the wallboard,office partitions, and lighting fixtures are for A's own use, and Amay select non-blacklisted suppliers of these goods in order tocomply with Y's import laws. Because they are not customarilyincorporated into or permanently affixed to the project, the desks,office chairs, typewriters, and office supplies are not for A's ownuse, and A may not make boycott-based selections of the suppliers ofthese goods. (vii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the business of sellingautomobiles, is a bona fide resident of boycotting country Y. Inordering automobiles from time to time for purposes of stocking itsinventory, A purchases from U.S. manufacturer B, but not U.S.manufacturer C, because C is blacklisted. Retail sales aresubsequently made from this inventory. A's import of automobiles from B is not an import for A's ownuse, because the importation of items for general inventory in aretail sales operation is not an importation for one's own use. (viii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the manufacture ofpharmaceutical products, is a bona fide resident of boycottingcountry Y. In importing chemicals for incorporation into thepharmaceutical products, A purchases from U.S. supplier B, but notU.S. supplier C, because C is blacklisted. A may import chemicals from B rather than C, because theimportation of specifically identifiable items for incorporationinto another product is an importation for one's own use. (ix) A, a U.S. management company which is a bona fide residentof boycotting country Y, has a contract with the Ministry ofEducation in Y to purchase supplies for Y's school system. From timeto time, A purchases goods from abroad for delivery to variousschools in Y. A's purchase of goods for Y's school system does not constitutean importation of goods for A's own use, because A is acting as aprocurement agent for another. A, therefore, cannot make boycott-based selections of suppliers of such school supplies.[[Page 12886]] (x) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident ofboycotting country Y, has a contract to make purchases for Y inconnection with a construction project in Y. A is not engaged in theconstruction of, or in any other activity in connection with, theproject. A's role is merely to purchase goods for Y and arrange fortheir delivery to Y. A is not purchasing goods for its own use, because A is actingas a procurement agent for Y. A, therefore, cannot make boycottselections of suppliers of such goods. (xi) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident ofboycotting country Y, imports specifically identifiable goods into Yfor exhibit by A at a trade fair in Y. In selecting goods forexhibit, A excludes items made by blacklisted firms. A's import of goods for its exhibit at a trade fair constitutesan import for A's own use. However, A may not sell in Y those goodsit imported for exhibit.For Use Within Boycotting Country A is a bona fide resident of boycotting countries Y and Z. Incompliance with Y's boycott laws, A chooses specificallyidentifiable goods for its oil drilling operations in Y and Z byexcluding blacklisted suppliers. The goods are first imported intoY. Those purchased for A's use in Z are then transshipped to Z. In selecting those goods for importation into Y, A is making animport selection for its own use, even though A may use some of theimported goods in Z. Further, the subsequent shipment from Y to Z ofthose goods purchased for use in Z is an import into Z for A's ownuse.Sec. 760.4 Evasion. (a) No United States person may engage in any transaction or takeany other action, either independently or through any other person,with intent to evade the provisions of this part. Nor may any UnitedStates person assist another United States person to violate or evadethe provisions of this part. (b) The exceptions set forth in Sec. 760.3(a) through (g) of thispart do not permit activities or agreements (express or implied by acourse of conduct, including a pattern of responses) which areotherwise prohibited by this part and which are not within the intentof such exceptions. However, activities within the coverage and intentof the exceptions set forth in this part do not constitute evasionregardless of how often such exceptions are utilized. (c) Use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended toplace a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him specialburdens because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycottreasons from having a business relationship with or in a boycottingcountry will be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part. (d) Unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk ofloss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on anotherbecause of the import laws of a boycotting country may constituteevasion. If they are introduced after January 21, 1978, their use willbe presumed to constitute evasion. This presumption may be rebutted bya showing that such a provision is in customary usage withoutdistinction between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and thatthere is a legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. On the otherhand, use of such a provision by a United States person subsequent toJanuary 21, 1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provisionhad been customarily used by that person prior to January 21, 1978. (e) Use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibitedactivity will also be regarded as evasion. Similarly, it is evasionunder this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from aUnited States parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complyingwith prohibited boycott requirements. However, alteration of a person'sstructure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion solong as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerationsand is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of theprohibitions of this part. The facts and circumstances of anarrangement or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whetherappearances conform to reality.Examples The following examples are intended to give guidance to personsin determining circumstances in which this section will apply. Theyare illustrative, not comprehensive. (i) A, a U.S. insurance company, receives a request fromboycotting country Y asking whether it does business in boycottedcountry X. Because furnishing such information is prohibited, Adeclines to answer and as a result is placed on Y's blacklist. Thefollowing year, A's annual report contains new information about A'sworldwide operations, including a list of all countries in which Adoes business. A then mails a copy of its annual report, which hasnever before contained such information, to officials of thegovernment of country Y. Absent some business justification unrelated to the boycott forchanging the annual report in this fashion, A's action constitutesevasion of this part. (ii) A, a U.S. construction firm resident in boycotting countryY, orders lumber from U.S. company B. A unilaterally selects B inpart because U.S. lumber producer C is blacklisted by Y and C'sproducts are therefore not importable. In placing its order with B,A requests that B stamp its name or logo on the lumber so that A``can be certain that it is, in fact, receiving B's products.'' Bdoes not normally so stamp its lumber, and A's purpose in making therequest is to appear to fit within the unilateral selectionexception of this part. Absent additional facts justifying A's action, A's actionconstitutes evasion of this part. (iii) A, a U.S. company, has been selling sewing machines toboycotting country Y for a number of years and routinely supplyingnegative certificates of origin. A is aware that the furnishing ofnegative certificates of origin will be prohibited after June 21,1978 and, therefore, arranges to have all future shipments runthrough a foreign corporation in a third country which will affixthe necessary certification before forwarding the machines on to Y. A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is adevice to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf. (iv) A, a U.S. company, has been selling hand calculators toboycotting country Y for a number of years and routinely suppliesnegative certificates of origin. A is aware that the furnishing ofsuch negative certificates will be prohibited after June 21, 1978. Athereupon ceases all direct sales to Y, and instead arranges to makeall future sales to distributor B in a third country. A knows B willstep in and make the sales to Y which A would otherwise have madedirectly. B will make the necessary negative certifications. A'swarranty, which it will continue to honor, runs to the purchaser inY. A's action constitutes evasion, because the diverting of ordersto B is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A'sbehalf. (v) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract withboycotting country Y to meet all Y's medical supply needs. Y informsA that before such a contract can be concluded, A must complete Y'sboycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited from answeringthe questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in Y to supplythe necessary information. A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is adevice to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf. (vi) A, a U.S. contractor which has not previously dealt withboycotting country Y, is awarded a construction contract by Y.Because it is customary in the construction industry for acontractor to establish an on-site facility for the duration of theproject, A establishes such an office, which satisfies therequirements for bona fide residency. Thereafter, A's office in Ytakes a number of actions permitted under the compliance with locallaw exception. A's actions do not constitute evasion, because A's facility in Ywas established for legitimate business reasons. (vii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, islocated in non-boycotting country M. A and B both make machine toolsfor sale in their respective marketing regions. B's marketing regionincludes boycotting country Y. After assessing the requirements ofthis part, B decides that it can no longer make machines for sale inY. Instead, A decides to expand its facilities in M in order toservice the Y market. The actions of A and B do not constitute evasion, because thereis a legitimate business reason for their actions. It is irrelevantthat the effect may be to place sales which would otherwise havebeen subject to this part beyond the reach of this part.[[Page 12887]] (viii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, from time to time receivespurchase orders from boycotting country Y which A fills from itsplant in the United States. A knows that it is about to receive anorder from Y which contains a request for a certification which A isprohibited from furnishing under this part. In order to permit thecertification to be made, A diverts the purchase order to itsforeign subsidiary. A's diversion of the purchase order constitutes evasion of thispart, because it is a device to mask prohibited activity carried outon A's behalf. (ix) A, a U.S. company, is engaged in assembling drilling rigsfor shipment to boycotting country Y. Because of potentialdifficulties in securing entry into Y of materials supplied byblacklisted firms, A insists that blacklisted firms take a 15percent discount on all materials which they supply to A. As aresult, no blacklisted firms are willing to transact with A. A's insistence on the discount for materials supplied byblacklisted firms constitutes evasion of this part, because it is adevice or scheme which is intended to place a special burden onblacklisted firms because of Y's boycott. (x) Same as (ix), except that shortly after the effective dateof this part, A insists that its suppliers sign contracts whichprovide that even after title passes from the supplier to A, thesupplier will bear the risk of loss and indemnify A if goods whichthe supplier has furnished are denied entry into Y for boycottreasons. A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is adevice or scheme which is intended to place a special burden onblacklisted persons because of Y's boycott. (xi) Same as (x), except that A customarily insisted on such anarrangement with its supplier prior to the effective date of thispart. A's action is presumed not to constitute evasion, because use ofthis contractual arrangement was customary for A prior to theeffective date of this part. (xii) A, a U.S. company, has a contract to supply automobilesub-assembly units to boycotting country Y. Shortly after theeffective date of this part, A insists that its suppliers signcontracts which provide that even after title passes to A, thesupplier will bear the risk of loss and indemnify A if goods whichthe supplier has furnished are denied entry into boycotting countryY for whatever reason. A's insistence on this arrangement is presumed to constituteevasion, because it is a device which is intended to place a specialburden on blacklisted firms because of Y's boycott. The presumptionmay be rebutted by competent evidence showing that use of such anarrangement is customary without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of the country to which it relates and thatthere is a legitimate non-boycott business reason for its use. (xiii) Same as (vii), except that A requires that all suppliersmake in-country delivery. A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is anordinary commercial practice to require in-country delivery ofgoods. (xiv) Same as (xii), except that A requires that title remainwith the supplier until delivery in Y has been made. A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is ordinarycommercial practice to require that title remain with the supplieruntil delivery has been made. This example is distinguishable fromexample (xii), because in example (xii) A had insisted on anextraordinary arrangement designed to require that the risk of lossremain with the supplier even after title had passed to A. (xv) U.S. bank A is contacted by U.S. company B to finance B'stransaction with boycotting country Y. Payment will be effectedthrough a letter of credit in favor of B at its U.S. address. Aknows that the letter of credit will contain restrictive boycottconditions which would bar its implementation by A if thebeneficiary were a U.S. person. A suggests to B that the beneficiaryshould be changed to C, a shell corporation in non-boycottingcountry M. The beneficiary is changed accordingly. A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because thearrangement is a device to mask prohibited activity on A's part. (xvi) Same as (xv), except that U.S. company B, the beneficiaryof the letter of credit, arranges to change the beneficiary to B'sforeign subsidiary so that A can implement the letter of credit. Aknows that this has been done. A's implementation of the letter of credit in the face of itsknowledge of B's action constitutes evasion of this part, becauseits action is part of a device to mask prohibited activity on A'spart. (xvii) U.S. bank A, located in the United States, is contactedby foreign company B to finance B's transaction with boycottingcountry Y. B is a controlled subsidiary of a U.S. company. Thetransaction which is to be financed with a letter of credit payableto B at its foreign address, requires B to certify that none of itsboard members are of a particular religious faith. Since B cannotlegally furnish the certificate, it asks A to convey the necessaryinformation to Y through A's bank branch in Y. Such informationwould be furnished wholly outside the letter of credit transaction. A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it isundertaken to assist B's violation of this part. (xviii) U.S. bank A is asked by foreign corporation B toimplement a letter of credit in favor of B so that B might performunder its long-term contract with boycotting country Y. Under theterms of the letter of credit, B is required to certify that none ofits suppliers is blacklisted. A knows that it cannot implement aletter of credit with this condition, so it tells B to negotiate theelimination of this requirement from the letter of credit andinstead supply the certification to Y directly. A's suggestion to B that it provide the negative certificationto Y directly constitutes evasion of this part, because A is takingan action through another person to mask prohibited activity on A'spart.Sec. 760.5 Reporting requirements. (a) Scope of reporting requirements. (1) A United States person who receives a request to take anyaction which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictivetrade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign countryagainst a country friendly to the United States or against any UnitedStates person must report such request to the Department of Commerce inaccordance with the requirements of this section. Such a request may beeither written or oral and may include a request to furnish informationor enter into or implement an agreement. It may also include asolicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks forinformation or that asks that a United States person take or refrainfrom taking a particular action. Such a request shall be reportedregardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissibleunder this part, except as otherwise provided by this section. (2) For purposes of this section, a request received by a UnitedStates person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that thepurpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further,support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott orrestrictive trade practice. (i) A request received by a United States person located in theUnited States is reportable if it is received in connection with atransaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of theUnited States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and(18) of this part. (ii) A request received by a United States person located outsidethe United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership,affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishmentwhich is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determinedunder Sec. 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received inconnection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreigncommerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(6)through (17) and (19) of this part. (iii) A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to aparticular transaction or activity, received by any United Statesperson is reportable when such person has or anticipates a businessrelationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale,purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) inthe interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determinedunder Sec. 760.1(d) of this part. (3) These reporting requirements apply to all United Statespersons. They apply whether the United States person receiving therequest is an exporter, bank or other financial institution,[[Page 12888]]insurer, freight forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United Statesperson subject to this part. (4) The acquisition of information about a boycotting country'sboycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets,legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications doesnot constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of thissection. In addition, a United States person who receives anunsolicited invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing aboycott request has not received a reportable request for purposes ofthis section where he does not respond to the invitation to bid orother proposal. (5) Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycottpurposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear andprecise guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of theDepartment's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost ofreporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continueto monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are notreportable: (i) A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier whichflies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered,leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residentsof a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect. (ii) A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a requestto refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request tocertify to either effect. (iii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certificationregarding the country of origin of goods. (iv) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certificationregarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shippedor the name of the provider of services. (v) A request to comply with the laws of another country exceptwhere the request expressly requires compliance with that country'sboycott laws. (vi) A request to an individual to supply information about himselfor a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, oremployment purposes. (vii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certificationindicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwiseindicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at aparticular destination. (viii) A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master,charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck orany other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible,permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, aparticular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws,rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries. (ix) A request to supply a certificate from an insurance companystating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent orrepresentative within a boycotting country and/or the name and addressof such agent. (x) A request to comply with a term or condition of a transactionthat provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify thepurchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for anyreason (``risk of loss clause'') if such clause was in use by thepurchaser prior to January 18, 1978. (6) No United States person may engage in any transaction or takeany other action, either independently or through any other person,with intent to evade the provisions of this part. (7) From time to time the Department will survey domestic concernsfor purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requestsreceived by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates withrespect to their activities outside United States commerce. Thispertains to requests which would be reportable under this section butfor the fact that the activities to which the requests relate areoutside United States commerce. The information requested will includethe number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, theaction(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countriesin which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, includingthe names of those surveyed, will be made public. (b) Manner of reporting. (1) Each reportable request must bereported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation tobid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycottrequest is received as part of the same transaction, only the firstsuch request need be reported. Individual shipments against the samepurchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of thesame transaction. Each different boycott request associated with agiven transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when therequest is received. (2) Each United States person actually receiving a reportablerequest must report that request. However, such person may designatesomeone else to report on his behalf. For example, a United Statescompany, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreignsubsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized, mayreport on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may reporton behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a persondesignated to report a request received by another receives anidentical request directed to him in connection with the sametransaction, he may file one report on behalf of himself and the otherperson. (3) Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another,the person receiving the request remains liable for any failure toreport or for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyonereporting on behalf of another is not relieved of his ownresponsibility for reporting any boycott request which he receives,even if it is an identical request in connection with the sametransaction. (4) Reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report ProcessingStaff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce,Room 6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230. Each submission must be made inaccordance with the following requirements: (i) Where the person receiving the request is a United Statesperson located in the United States, each report of requests receivedthrough June 30, 1979, must be postmarked by the last day of the monthfollowing the month in which the request was received. Thereafter, eachsubmission must be postmarked by the last day of the month followingthe calendar quarter in which the request was received (e.g., April 30for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March). (ii) Where the person receiving the request is a United Statesperson located outside the United States, each report of requestsreceived through June 30, 1979, must be postmarked by the last day ofthe second month following the month in which the request was received.Thereafter, each submission must be postmarked by the last day of thesecond month following the calendar quarter in which the request wasreceived (e.g., May 31 for the quarter consisting of January, February,and March). (5) At the reporting person's option, reports may be submitted oneither a single transaction form (Form BXA-621P, Report of RestrictiveTrade Practice or Boycott Request Single Transaction (revised 10-89))or on a multiple transaction form (Form BXA-6051P, Report of Requestfor Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott Multiple Transactions(revised 10-89)). Use of the multiple transaction form permits thereporting person to provide on one form all required informationrelating to as many as 75 reportable requests[[Page 12889]]received within any single reporting period. (6) Reports, whether submitted on the single transaction form or onthe multiple transaction form, must contain entries for everyapplicable item on the form, including whether the reporting personintends to take or has taken the action requested. If the reportingperson has not decided what action he will take by the time the reportis required to be filed, he must later report the action he decides totake within 10 business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filinga report on behalf of another must so indicate and identify that otherperson. (7) Each report of a boycott request must be accompanied by twocopies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the requestappears. Reports may also be accompanied by any additional informationrelating to the request as the reporting person desires to provideconcerning his response to the request. (8) Records containing information relating to a reportable boycottrequest, including a copy of any document(s) in which the requestappears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year periodafter receipt of the request. The Department may require that thesematerials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any timewithin that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additionalrecordkeeping requirements.) (c) Disclosure of information. (1) Reports of requests received onor after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filedwith the reports, have been and will continue to be made available forpublic inspection and copying, except for certain proprietaryinformation. With respect to reports of requests received on or afterAugust 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a UnitedStates person to whom the report relates would be placed at acompetitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of informationregarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles,materials, and supplies, including related technical data and otherinformation, whether contained in a report or in any accompanyingdocument(s), such information will not be publicly disclosed exceptupon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copyof the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of thissection, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that thedisclosure would not place the United States person involved at acompetitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the nationalinterest to withhold the information. In the event the Secretary ofCommerce considers making such a determination concerning competitivedisadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will begiven before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. Inno event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any informationcontained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph behonored. (2) Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report willbe made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must besubmitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reportingentity to delete the same information which it certified in the reportwould place a United States person at a competitive disadvantage ifdisclosed. In addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copyinformation that is considered confidential and that is not required tobe contained in the report (e.g., information related to foreignconsignee). This copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend``Public Inspection Copy.'' With respect to documents accompanyingreports received by the Department on or after July 1, 1979, the publicinspection copy will be made available as submitted whether or not ithas been appropriately edited by the reporting entity as provided bythis paragraph. (3) Reports and accompanying documents which are available to thepublic for inspection and copying are located in the BXA Freedom ofInformation Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department ofCommerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to thatfacility. (4) The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summariesof the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of Statefor such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with theSecretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out thepolicies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979.Examples The following examples are intended to give guidance indetermining what is reportable. They are illustrative, notcomprehensive. (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycottingcountry Y and is asked by Y to certify that it is not blacklisted byY's boycott office. The request to A is reportable, because it is a request to A tocomply with Y's boycott requirements. (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturing company, receives an order fortractors from boycotting country Y. Y's order specifies that thetires on the tractors be made by B, another U.S. company. A believesY has specified B as the tire supplier because otherwise A wouldhave used tires made by C, a blacklisted company, and Y will nottake shipment of tractors containing tires made by blacklistedcompanies. A must report Y's request for tires made by B, because A hasreason to know that B was chosen for boycott reasons. (iii) Same as (ii), except A knows that Y's request has nothingto do with the boycott but simply reflects Y's preference for tiresmade by B. Y's request is not reportable, because it is unrelated to Y'sboycott. (iv) Same as (ii), except A neither knows nor has reason to knowwhy Y has chosen B. Y's request is not reportable, because A neither knows nor hasreason to know that Y's request is based on Y's boycott. (v) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is aresident of boycotting country Y. A is a general contractor. Afterbeing supplied by A with a list of competent subcontractors, A'scustomer instructs A to use subcontractor C on the project. Abelieves that C was chosen because, among other things, the otherlisted subcontractors are blacklisted. The instruction to A by its customer that C be used on theproject is reportable, because it is a request to comply with Y'sboycott requirements. (vi) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, islocated in non-boycotting country P. A receives an order for washingmachines from boycotting country Y. Y instructs A that a negativecertificate of origin must accompany the shipment. The washingmachines are made wholly in P, without U.S. components. Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate oforigin is not reportable, because the transaction to which itrelates is not in U.S. commerce. (vii) Same as (vi), except that A obtains components from theUnited States for the purpose of filling the order from Y. Y'sinstruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin isreportable, because the transaction to which it relates is in U.S.commerce. (viii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives in the mail anunsolicited invitation to bid on a construction project inboycotting country Y. The invitation to bid requires those whorespond to certify that they do not have any plants or branchoffices in boycotted country X. A does not respond. A's receipt of the unsolicited invitation to bid is notreportable, because the request does not relate to any present oranticipated business of A with or in Y. (ix) Same as (viii), except that A receives a boycottquestionnaire from a central boycott office. A does not do businessin any of the boycotting countries involved, and does not anticipatedoing any business in those countries. A does not respond. A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is not reportable,because it does not relate to any present or anticipated business byA with or in a boycotting country. (x) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is seeking markets in which toexpand its exports. A[[Page 12890]]sends a representative to boycotting country Y to explore Y'spotential as a market for A's products. A's representative discussesits products but does not enter into any contracts on that trip. Adoes, however, hope that sales will materialize in the future.Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y. A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, becausethe request relates to A's anticipated business with or in aboycotting country. For purposes of determining whether a report isrequired, it makes no difference whether A responds to thequestionnaire, and it makes no difference that actual salescontracts are not in existence or do not materialize. (xi) Same as (x), except that A's representative enters into acontract to sell A's products to a buyer in boycotting country Y.Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y. A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, becauseit relates to A's present business with or in a boycotting country.For purposes of determining whether a report is required, it makesno difference whether A responds to the questionnaire. (xii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, purchases an exporter'sguidebook which includes the import requirements of boycottingcountry Y. The guidebook contains descriptions of actions which U.S.exporters must take in order to make delivery of goods to Y. A's acquisition of the guidebook is not reportable, because hehas not received a request from anyone. (xiii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for theshipment of goods to boycotting country Y at the request of B, aU.S. exporter. B asks A to assume responsibility to assure that thedocumentation accompanying the shipment is in compliance with Y'simport requirements. A examines an exporters' guidebook, determinesthat Y's import regulations require a certification that the insurerof the goods is not blacklisted and asks U.S. insurer C for such acertification. B's request to A is reportable by A, because it constitutes arequest to comply with Y's boycott as of the time A takes action tocomply with Y's boycott requirements in response to the request. A'srequest to C is reportable by C. (xiv) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipmentof U.S. goods to boycotting country Y. The manufacturer supplies Awith all the necessary documentation to accompany the shipment.Among the documents supplied by the manufacturer is his certificatethat he himself is not blacklisted. A transmits the documentationsupplied by the manufacturer. A's action in merely transmitting documents received from themanufacturer is not reportable, because A has received no request tocomply with Y's boycott. (xv) Same as (xiv), except that A is asked by U.S. exporter B toassume the responsibility to assure that the necessary documentationaccompanies the shipment whatever that documentation might be. Bforwards to A a letter of credit which requires that a negativecertificate of origin accompany the bill of lading. A supplies apositive certificate of origin. Both A and B must report receipt of the letter of credit,because it contains a request to both of them to comply with Y'sboycott. (xvi) Same as (xiv), except that the manufacturer fails tosupply a required negative certificate of origin, and A issubsequently asked by a consular official of Y to see to it that thecertificate is supplied. A supplies a positive certificate oforigin. The consular official's request to A is reportable by A, becauseA was asked to comply with Y's boycott requirements by supplying thenegative certificate of origin. (xvii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycottingcountry Y. Arrangements have been made for freight forwarder B tohandle the shipment and secure all necessary shippingcertifications. B notes that the letter of credit requires that themanufacturer supply a negative certificate of origin and B asks A todo so. A supplies a positive certificate of origin. B's request to A is reportable by A, because A is asked tocomply with Y's boycott requirements by providing the negativecertificate. (xviii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, isa resident of boycotting country Y. A is engaged in oil explorationand drilling operations in Y. In placing orders for drillingequipment to be shipped from the United States, A, in compliancewith Y's laws, selects only those suppliers who are not blacklisted. A's action in choosing non-blacklisted suppliers is notreportable, because A has not received a request to comply with Y'sboycott in making these selections. (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, isseeking permission to do business in boycotting country Y. Beforebeing granted such permission, A is asked to sign an agreement tocomply with Y's boycott laws. The request to A is reportable, because it is a request thatexpressly requires compliance with Y's boycott law and is receivedin connection with A's anticipated business in Y. (xx) A, a U.S. bank, is asked by a firm in boycotting country Yto confirm a letter of credit in favor of B, a U.S. company. Theletter of credit calls for a certificate from B that the goods to besupplied are not produced by a firm blacklisted by Y. A informs B ofthe letter of credit, including its certification condition, andsends B a copy. B must report the certification request contained in the letterof credit, and A must report the request to confirm the letter ofcredit containing the boycott condition, because both are beingasked to comply with Y's boycott. (xxi) Same as (xx), except that the letter of credit calls for acertificate from the beneficiary that the goods will not be shippedon a vessel that will call at a port in boycotted country X beforemaking delivery in Y. The request is not reportable, because it is a request of a typedeemed by this section to be in common use for non-boycott purposes. (xxii) A, a U.S. company, receives a letter of credit fromboycotting country Y stating that on no condition may a bankblacklisted by Y be permitted to negotiate the credit. A's receipt of the letter of credit is reportable, because itcontains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements. (xxiii) A, a U.S. bank, receives a demand draft from B, a U.S.company, in connection with B's shipment of goods to boycottingcountry Y. The draft contains a directive that it is valid in allcountries except boycotted country X. A's receipt of the demand draft is reportable, because itcontains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements. (xxiv) A, a U.S. exporter, receives an order from boycottingcountry Y. On the order is a legend that A's goods, invoices, andpackaging must not bear a six-pointed star or other symbol ofboycotted country X. A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains arequest to comply with Y's boycott requirements. (xxv) Same as (xxiv), except the order contains a statement thatgoods exported must not represent part of war reparations toboycotted country X. A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains arequest to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements. (xxvi) A, a U.S. contractor, is negotiating with boycottingcountry Y to build a school in Y. During the course of thenegotiations, Y suggests that one of the terms of the constructioncontract be that A agree not to import materials produced inboycotted country X. It is A's company policy not to agree to such acontractual clause, and A suggests that instead it agree that all ofthe necessary materials will be obtained from U.S. suppliers. Yagrees to A's suggestion and a contract is executed. A has received a reportable request, but, for purposes ofreporting, the request is deemed to be received when the contract isexecuted. (xxvii) Same as (xxvi), except Y does not accept A's suggestedalternative clause and negotiations break off. A's receipt of Y's request is reportable. For purposes ofreporting, it makes no difference that A was not successful in thenegotiations. The request is deemed to be received at the time thenegotiations break off. (xxviii) A, a U.S. insurance company, is insuring the shipmentof drilling equipment to boycotting country Y. The transaction isbeing financed by a letter of credit which requires that A certifythat it is not blacklisted by Y. Freight forwarder B asks A tosupply the certification in order to satisfy the requirements of theletter of credit. The request to A is reportable by A, because it is a request tocomply with Y's boycott requirements. (xxix) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is engaged from time-to-time insupplying drilling rigs to company B in boycotting country Y. Binsists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide that, evenafter title passes from the supplier to B, the supplier will bearthe risk of loss and indemnify B if goods which the supplier hasfurnished are denied entry into Y for whatever reason. A knows orhas reason to know that this contractual provision is required by Bbecause of Y's boycott, and that B has been using the provisionsince 1977. A receives an order from B which contains such a clause.[[Page 12891]] B's request is not reportable by A, because the request isdeemed to be not reportable by these regulations if the provisionwas in use by B prior to the effective date of the regulations,January 18, 1978. (xxx) Same as (xxix), except that A does not know when B beganusing the provision. Unless A receives information from B that B introduced the termprior to the effective date of the regulations, January 18, 1978, Amust report receipt of the request. (xxxi) A, a U.S. citizen, is a shipping clerk for B, a U.S.manufacturing company. In the course of his employment, A receivesan order for goods from boycotting country Y. The order specifiesthat none of the components of the goods is to be furnished byblacklisted firms. B must report the request received by its employee, A, acting inthe scope of his employment. Although A is a U.S. person, such anindividual does not have a separate obligation to report requestsreceived by him in his capacity as an employee of B. (xxxii) U.S. exporter A is negotiating a transaction withboycotting country Y. A knows that at the conclusion of thenegotiations he will be asked by Y to supply certain boycott-relatedinformation and that such a request is reportable. In an effort toforestall the request and thereby avoid having to file a report, Asupplies the information in advance. A is deemed to have received a reportable request. (xxxiii) A, a controlled foreign affiliate of U.S. company B,receives an order for computers from boycotting country Y andobtains components from the United States for the purpose of fillingthe order. Y instructs A that a negative certificate of origin mustaccompany the shipment. Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate oforigin is reportable by A. Moreover, A may designate B or any otherperson to report on its behalf. However, A remains liable for anyfailure to report or for any representations made on its behalf. (xxxiv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting countryY, receives a request from the customer in Y to state on the bill oflading that the vessel is allowed to enter Y's ports. The requestfurther states that a certificate from the owner or master of thevessel to that effect is acceptable. The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportableif it was received after January 21, 1978, because it is a requestof a type deemed to be not reportable by these regulations. (A maynot make such a statement on the bill of lading himself, if he knowsor has reason to know it is requested for a boycott purpose. (xxxv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting countryY, receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish acertificate from the owner of the vessel that the vessel ispermitted to call at Y's ports. The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportableif it was received after the effective date of these rules, becauseit is a request of a type deemed to be not reportable by theseregulations. (xxxvi) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting countryY, receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish acertificate from the insurance company indicating that the companyhas a duly authorized representative in country Y and giving thename of that representative. The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportableif it was received after the effective date of these rules, becauseit is a request of a type deemed to be not reportable by theseregulations.Supplement No. 1 to Part 760--Interpretations It has come to the Department's attention that some U.S. personsare being or may be asked to comply with new boycotting countryrequirements with respect to shipping and insurance certificationsand certificates of origin. It has also come to the Department'sattention that some U.S. persons are being or may be asked to agreeto new contractual provisions in connection with certain foreigngovernment or foreign government agency contracts. In order tomaximize its guidance with respect to section 8 of the ExportAdministration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) andpart 760 of the EAR, the Department hereby sets forth its views onthese certifications and contractual clauses.1 \1\ The Department originally issued this interpretationpursuant to the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1979 (PublicLaw 95-52) and the regulations on restrictive trade practices andboycotts (15 CFR part 369) published on January 25, 1978 (43 FR3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1,1979.---------------------------------------------------------------------------I. Certifications Sec. 760.2(d) of this part prohibits a U.S. person fromfurnishing or knowingly agreeing to furnish: ``Information concerning his or any other person's past, presentor proposed business relationships: (i) With or in a boycotted country; (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of aboycotted country; (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to berestricted from having any business relationship with or in aboycotting country.'' This prohibition, like all others under part 760, applies onlywith respect to a U.S. person's activities in the interstate orforeign commerce of the United States and only when such activitiesare undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support anunsanctioned foreign boycott. (Sec. 760.2(d)(5) of this part.) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normalbusiness information in a commercial context. ( Sec. 760.2(d)(3) ofthis part). Normal business information furnished in a commercialcontext does not cease to be such simply because the partysoliciting the information may be a boycotting country or a nationalor resident thereof. If the information is of a type which isgenerally sought for a legitimate business purpose (such asdetermining financial fitness, technical competence, or professionalexperience), the information may be furnished even if theinformation could be used, or without the knowledge of the personsupplying the information is intended to be used, for boycottpurposes. (Sec. 760.2(d)(4) of this part). The new certification requirements and the Department'sinterpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are asfollows: A. Certificate of origin. A certificate of origin is to beissued by the supplier or exporting company and authenticated by theexporting country, attesting that the goods exported to theboycotting country are of purely indigenous origin, and stating thename of the factory or the manufacturing company. To the extent thatthe goods as described on the certificate of origin are not solelyand exclusively products of their country of origin indicatedthereon, a declaration must be appended to the certificate of origingiving the name of the supplier/manufacturer and declaring: ``The undersigned, ____________, does hereby declare on behalfof the above-named supplier/manufacturer, that certain parts orcomponents of the goods described in the attached certificate oforigin are the products of such country or countries, other than thecountry named therein as specifically indicated hereunder:Country of Origin and Percentage of Value of Parts or ComponentsRelative to Total Shipment1.---------------------------------------------------------------------2.---------------------------------------------------------------------3.---------------------------------------------------------------------Dated:-----------------------------------------------------------------Signature-------------------------------------------------------------- Sworn to before me, this ________ day of ____________, 19 ____.Notary Seal.''Interpretation It is the Department's position that furnishing a positivecertificate of origin, such as the one set out above, falls withinthe exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliancewith the import and shipping document requirements of a boycottingcountry. See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i) and (ii)thereunder. B. Shipping certificate. A certificate must be appended to thebill of lading stating: (1) Name of vessel; (2) Nationality ofvessel; and (3) Owner of vessel, and declaring: ``The undersigned does hereby declare on behalf of the owner,master, or agent of the above-named vessel that said vessel is notregistered in the boycotted country or owned by nationals orresidents of the boycotted country and will not call at or passthrough any boycotted country port enroute to its boycotting countrydestination. ``The undersigned further declares that said vessel is otherwiseeligible to enter into the ports of the boycotting country inconformity with its laws and regulations. Sworn to before me, this ________ day of __________, 19 ____.Notary Seal.''Interpretation It is the Department's position that furnishing a certificate,such as the one set out above, stating: (1) The name of the vessel,(2) The nationality of the vessel, and (3) The owner of the vesseland further declaring that the vessel: (a) Is not registered in aboycotted country, (b) Is not owned by nationals or[[Page 12892]]residents of a boycotted country, and (c) Will not call at or passthrough a boycotted country port enroute to its destination in aboycotting country falls within the exception contained inSec. 760.3(b) of this part for compliance with the import andshipping document requirements of a boycotting country. SeeSec. 760.3(b) of this part and examples (vii), (viii), and (ix)thereunder. It is also the Department's position that the owner, charterer,or master of a vessel may certify that the vessel is ``eligible'' or``otherwise eligible'' to enter into the ports of a boycottingcountry in conformity with its laws and regulations. Furnishing sucha statement pertaining to one's own eligibility offends noprohibition under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example(xiv). On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declarationthat a vessel is ``eligible'' or ``otherwise eligible'' to enter theports of the boycotting country necessarily conveys the informationthat the vessel is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted fromhaving a business relationship with the boycotting country. SeeSec. 760.3(b) of this part, examples (vi), (xi), and (xii). Where aperson other than the vessel's owner, charterer, or master furnishessuch a statement, that is tantamount to his furnishing a statementthat he is not doing business with a blacklisted person or is doingbusiness only with nonblacklisted persons. Therefore, it is theDepartment's position that furnishing such a certification (whichdoes not reflect customary international commercial practice) byanyone other than the owner, charterer, or master of a vessel wouldfall within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this partunless it is clear from all the facts and circumstances that thecertification is not required for a boycott reason. SeeSec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4) of this part. However, in accordance withthe exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliancewith the import and shipping document requirements of a boycottingcountry, such a United States person may furnish such acertification until June 21, 1978. C. Insurance certificate. A certificate must be appended to theinsurance policy stating: (1) Name of insurance company; (2) Addressof its principal office; and (3) Country of its incorporation, anddeclaring: ``The undersigned, ________________, does hereby certify onbehalf of the above-named insurance company that the said companyhas a duly qualified and appointed agent or representative in theboycotting country whose name and address appear below: Name of agent/representative and address in the boycottingcountry. Sworn to before me this ________ day of ____________, 19____.Notary Seal.''Interpretation It is the Department's position that furnishing the name of theinsurance company falls within the exception contained inSec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with the import andshipping document requirements of a boycotting country. SeeSec. 760.3(c)(1)(v) of this part and examples (v) and (x)thereunder. In addition, it is the Department's position thatfurnishing a certificate, such as the one set out above, stating theaddress of the insurance company's principal office and its countryof incorporation offends no prohibition under part 760 unless theU.S. person furnishing the certificate knows or has reason to knowthat the information is sought for the purpose of determining thatthe insurance company is neither headquartered nor incorporated in aboycotted country. See Sec. 760.2(d)(1)(i) of this part. It is also the Department's position that the insurer, himself,may certify that he has a duly qualified and appointed agent orrepresentative in the boycotting country and may furnish the nameand address of his agent or representative. Furnishing such astatement pertaining to one's own status offends no prohibitionunder part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv). On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declarationthat an insurer ``has a duly qualified and appointed agent orrepresentative'' in the boycotting country necessarily conveys theinformation that the insurer is not blacklisted or otherwiserestricted from having a business relationship with the boycottingcountry. See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part, example (v). Therefore, itis the Department's position that furnishing such a certification byanyone other than the insurer would fall within the prohibition setforth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part unless it is clear from all thefacts and circumstances that the certification is not required for aboycott reason. See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part. However,in accordance with the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of thispart for compliance with the import and shipping documentrequirements of a boycotting country, such a U.S. person may furnishsuch a certification until June 21, 1978.II. Contractual Clauses The new contractual requirements and the Department'sinterpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are asfollows: A. Contractual clause regarding import laws of boycottingcountry. ``In connection with the performance of this contract theContractor/Supplier acknowledges that the import and customs lawsand regulations of the boycotting country shall apply to thefurnishing and shipment of any products or components thereof to theboycotting country. The Contractor/Supplier specificallyacknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws andregulations of the boycotting country prohibit, among other things,the importation into the boycotting country of products orcomponents thereof: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2)Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies organized underthe laws of the boycotted country; and (3) Manufactured, produced,or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted country.''Interpretation It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as theone set out in the first sentence above, that the import and customsrequirements of a boycotting country shall apply to the performanceof a contract does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibitionunder Part 760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) of this part and example (iii)under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' It isalso the Department's position that an agreement to comply generallywith the import and customs requirements of a boycotting countrydoes not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under part 760 ofthis part. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) of this part and examples (iv) and(v) under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' Inaddition, it is the Department's position that an agreement, such asthe one set out in the second sentence above, to comply with theboycotting country's import and customs requirements prohibiting theimportation of products or components: (1) Originating in theboycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished bycompanies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or (3)Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents ofthe boycotted country falls within the exception contained inSec. 760.3(a) of this part for compliance with the importrequirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(a) of this partand example (ii) thereunder. The Department notes that, after June 21, 1978, a United Statesperson may not furnish a negative certification regarding the originof goods or their components even though the certification isfurnished in response to the import and shipping documentrequirements of the boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) of thispart and examples (i), (ii), and (iii) thereunder, and Sec. 760.3(a)of this part and example (ii) thereunder. B. Contractual clause regarding unilateral and specificselection. ``The Government of the boycotting country (or the FirstParty), in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the finalunilateral and specific selection of any proposed carriers,insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within theboycotting country, or of specific goods to be furnished inaccordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.''Interpretation It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as theone set out above, falls within the exception contained inSec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliance with unilateralselections. However, the Department notes that whether a U.S. personmay subsequently comply or agree to comply with any particularselection depends upon whether that selection meets all therequirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliancewith unilateral selections. For example, the particular selectionmust be unilateral and specific, particular goods must bespecifically identifiable as to their source or origin at the timeof their entry into the boycotting country, and all otherrequirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part must beobserved.Supplement No. 2 to Part 760--Interpretation The Department hereby sets forth its views on whether thefurnishing of certain shipping and insurance certificates incompliance with boycotting country requirements violates theprovisions of section 8 of the Export[[Page 12893]]Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) andpart 760 of the EAR,1 as follows: \1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation onApril 21, 1978 (43 FR 16969) pursuant to the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-52) and the regulations onrestrictive trade practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 369) publishedon January 25, 1978 (43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 CFR editionrevised as of January 1, 1979.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) ``The owner, charterer or master of a vessel may certifythat the vessel is `eligible' or `otherwise eligible' to enter intothe ports of a boycotting country in conformity with its laws andregulations;'' (ii) ``The insurer, himself, may certify that he has a dulyqualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycottingcountry and may furnish the name and address of his agent orrepresentative.'' Furnishing such certifications by anyone other than: (i) The owner, charterer or master of a vessel, or (ii) The insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth inSec. 760.2(d) of this part, ``unless it is clear from all the factsand circumstances that these certifications are not required for aboycott reason.'' See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part. The Department has received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia aclarification that the shipping and insurance certifications arerequired by Saudi Arabia in order to: (i) Demonstrate that there are no applicable restrictions underSaudi laws or regulations pertaining to maritime matters such as theage of the ship, the condition of the ship, and similar matters thatwould bar entry of the vessel into Saudi ports; and (ii) Facilitate dealings with insurers by Saudi Arabianimporters whose ability to secure expeditious payments in the eventof damage to insured goods may be adversely affected by the absenceof a qualified agent or representative of the insurer in SaudiArabia. In the Department's judgment, this clarification constitutessufficient facts and circumstances to demonstrate that thecertifications are not required by Saudi Arabia for boycott reasons. On the basis of this clarification, it is the Department'sposition that any United States person may furnish such shipping andinsurance certificates required by Saudi Arabia without violatingSec. 760.2(d) of this part. Moreover, under these circumstances,receipt of requests for such shipping and insurance certificatesfrom Saudi Arabia is not reportable. It is still the Department's position that furnishing such acertificate pertaining to one's own eligibility offends noprohibition under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example(xiv). However, absent facts and circumstances clearly indicatingthat the certifications are required for ordinary commercial reasonsas demonstrated by the Saudi clarification, furnishingcertifications about the eligibility or blacklist status of anyother person would fall within the prohibition set forth inSec. 760.2(d) of this part, and receipt of requests for suchcertifications is reportable. It also remains the Department's position that where a UnitedStates person asks an insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods toself-certify, such request offends no prohibition under this part.However, where a United States person asks anyone other than aninsurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to self-certify, suchrequests will be considered by the Department as evidence of therequesting person's refusal to do business with those persons whocannot or will not furnish such a self-certification. For example,if an exporter-beneficiary of a letter of credit asks his componentsuppliers to self-certify, such a request will be considered asevidence of his refusal to do business with those componentsuppliers who cannot or will not furnish such a self-certification. The Department wishes to emphasize that notwithstanding the factthat self-certifications are permissible, it will closely scrutinizethe activities of all United States persons who provide such self-certifications, including insurers and carriers, to determine thatsuch persons have not taken any prohibited actions or entered intoany prohibited agreements in order to be able to furnish suchcertifications.Supplement No. 3 to Part 760--Interpretation Pursuant to Article 2, Annex II of the Peace Treaty betweenEgypt and Israel, Egypt's participation in the Arab economic boycottof Israel was formally terminated on January 25, 1980. On the basisof this action, it is the Department's position that certainrequests for information, action or agreement which were consideredboycott-related by implication now cannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited or reportable under theRegulations. For example, a request that an exporter certify thatthe vessel on which it is shipping its goods is eligible to enterArab Republic of Egypt ports has been considered a boycott-relatedrequest that the exporter could not comply with because Egypt has aboycott in force against Israel (see 43 FR 16969, April 21, 1978 orthe 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979). Such a requestafter January 25, 1980 would not be presumed boycott-related becausethe underlying boycott requirement/basis for the certification hasbeen eliminated. Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibitedfrom complying with a request received from Egyptian governmentofficials to furnish the place of birth of employees the company isseeking to take to Egypt, because there is no underlying boycott lawor policy that would give rise to a presumption that the request wasboycott-related. U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their faceboycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance orsupport of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to theRegulations, irrespective of the country or origin. For example,requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'',``Israel boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases orwords indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriateprovisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.Supplement No. 4 to Part 760--Interpretation The question has arisen how the definition of U.S. commerce inthe antiboycott regulations (15 CFR part 760) applies to a shipmentof foreign-made goods when U.S.-origin spare parts are included inthe shipment. Specifically, if the shipment of foreign goods fallsoutside the definition of U.S. commerce, will the inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts bring the entire transaction into U.S. commerce? Section 760.1(d)(12) of this part provides the generalguidelines for determining when U.S.-origin goods shipped from acontrolled in fact foreign subsidiary are outside U.S. commerce. Thetwo key tests of that provision are that the goods were (1) acquiredwithout reference to a specific order, and (2) further manufactured,incorporated or reprocessed into another product. Because theapplication of these two tests to spare parts does not conclusivelyanswer the U.S. commerce question, the Department is presenting thisclarification. In the cases brought to the Department's attention, an order forforeign-origin goods was placed with a controlled in fact foreignsubsidiary of a United States company. The foreign goods containedcomponents manufactured in the United States and in other countries,and the order included a request for extras of the U.S. manufacturedcomponents (spare parts) to allow the customer to repair the item.Both the foreign manufactured product and the U.S. spare parts wereto be shipped from the general inventory of the foreign subsidiary.Since the spare parts, if shipped by themselves, would be in U.S.commerce as that term is defined in the Regulations, the questionwas whether including them with the foreign manufactured item wouldbring the entire shipment into U.S. commerce. The Department hasdecided that it will not and presents the following specificguidance. As used above, the term ``spare parts'' refers to parts of thequantities and types normally and customarily ordered with a productand kept on hand in the event they are needed to assure promptrepair of the product. Parts, components or accessories that improveor change the basic operations or design characteristics, forexample, as to accuracy, capability or productivity, are not spareparts under this definition. Inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts in a shipment of productswhich is otherwise outside U.S. commerce will not bring thetransaction into U.S. commerce if the following conditions are met: (I) The parts included in the shipment are acquired from theUnited States by the controlled in fact foreign subsidiary withoutreference to a specific order from or transaction with a personoutside the United States; (II) The parts are identical to the corresponding United States-origin parts which have been manufactured, incorporated into orreprocessed into the completed product; (III) The parts are of the quantity and type normally andcustomarily ordered with the completed product and kept on hand bythe[[Page 12894]]firm or industry of which the firm is a part to assure prompt repairof the product; and (IV) The parts are covered by the same order as the completedproduct and are shipped with or at the same time as the originalproduct. The Department emphasizes that unless each of the aboveconditions is met, the inclusion of United States-origin spare partsin an order for a foreign-manufactured or assembled product willbring the entire transaction into the interstate or foreign commerceof the United States for purposes of part 760.Supplement No. 5 to Part 760--InterpretationA. Permissible Furnishing of Information The information outlined below may be furnished in response toboycott-related requests from boycotting countries or others. Thisinformation is, in the view of the Department, not prohibited by theRegulations. Thus, a person does not have to qualify under any ofthe exceptions to be able to make the following statements. Suchstatements can be made, however, only by the person indicated andunder the circumstances described. These statements should not beused as a point of departure or analogy for determining thepermissibility of other types of statements. The Department's viewthat these statements are not contrary to the prohibitions containedin antiboycott provisions of the Regulations is limited to thespecific statement in the specific context indicated. 1. A U.S. person may always provide its own name, address, placeof incorporation (``nationality''), and nature of business. 2. A U.S. person may state that it is not on a blacklist, orrestricted from doing business in a boycotting country. A companymay not make that statement about its subsidiaries or affiliates--only about itself. A U.S. person may not say that there is no reasonfor it to be blacklisted. To make that statement would providedirectly or by implication information that may not be provided. AU.S. person may inquire about the reasons it is blacklisted if itlearns that it is on a blacklist (see Sec. 760.2(d) of this partexample (xv)). 3. A U.S. person may describe in detail its past dealings withboycotting countries; may state in which boycotting countries itstrademarks are registered; and may specify in which boycottingcountries it is registered or qualified to do business. In general,a U.S. person is free to furnish any information it wishes about thenature and extent of its commercial dealings with boycottingcountries. 4. A U.S. person may state that many U.S. firms or individualshave similar names and that it believes that it may be confused witha similarly named entity. A U.S. person may not state that it doesor does not have an affiliation or relationship with such similarlynamed entity. 5. A U.S. person may state that the information requested is amatter of public record in the United States. However, the personmay not direct the inquirer to the location of that information, normay the U.S. person provide or cause to be provided suchinformation.B. Availability of the Compliance With Local Law Exception toEstablish a Foreign Branch Section 760.3(f) of this part, the Compliance With Local Lawexception, permits U.S. persons, who are bona fide residents of aboycotting country, to take certain limited, but otherwiseprohibited, actions, if they are required to do so in order tocomply with local law. Among these actions is the furnishing of non-discriminatoryinformation. Examples (iv) through (vi) under ``Examples of BonaFide Residency'' indicate that a company seeking to become a bonafide resident within a boycotting country may take advantage of theexception for the limited purpose of furnishing information requiredby local law to obtain resident status. Exactly when and how thisexception is available has been the subject of a number ofinquiries. It is the Department's view that the following conditionsmust be met for a non-resident company to be permitted to furnishotherwise prohibited information for the limited purpose of seekingto become a bona fide resident: 1. The company must have a legitimate business reason forseeking to establish a branch or other resident operation in theboycotting country. (Removal from the blacklist does not constitutesuch a reason.) 2. The local operation it seeks to establish must be similar orcomparable in nature and operation to ones the company operates inother parts of the world, unless local law or custom dictates asignificantly different form. 3. The person who visits the boycotting country to furnish theinformation must be the official whose responsibility ordinarilyincludes the creation and registration of foreign operations (i.e.,the chairman of the board cannot be flown in to answer boycottquestions unless the chairman of the board is the corporate officialwho ordinarily goes into a country to handle foreign registrations). 4. The information provided must be that which is ordinarilyknown to the person establishing the foreign branch. Obviously, atthe time of establishment, the foreign branch will have noinformation of its own knowledge. Rather, the information should bethat which the responsible person has of his own knowledge, or thathe would have with him as incidental and necessary to theregistration and establishment process. As a general rule, suchinformation would not include such things as copies of agreementswith boycotted country concerns or detailed information about theperson's dealings with blacklisted concerns. 5. It is not necessary that documents prepared in compliancewith this exception be drafted or executed within the boycottingcountry. The restrictions on the type of information which may beprovided and on who may provide it apply regardless of where thepapers are prepared or signed.Supplement No. 6 to Part 760--Interpretation The antiboycott regulations prohibit knowing agreements tocomply with certain prohibited requests and requirements ofboycotting countries, regardless of how these terms are stated.Similarly, the reporting rules require that a boycott related``solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks forinformation or that asks that a United States person take or refrainfrom taking a particular action'' be reported. Questions havefrequently arisen about how particular requirements in the form ofdirective or instructions are viewed under the antiboycottregulations, and we believe that it will add clarity to theregulations to provide a written interpretation of how three ofthese terms are treated under the law. The terms in question appearfrequently in letters of credit, but may also be found on purchaseorders or other shipping or sale documents. They have been broughtto the attention of the Department by numerous persons. The termsare, or are similar to, the following: (1) Goods of boycottedcountry origin are prohibited; (2) No six-pointed stars may be usedon the goods, packing or cases; (3) Neither goods nor packing shallbear any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country. (a) Goods of boycotted country origin prohibited. This term isvery common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may also appearfrom time-to-time in invitations to bid, contracts, or other tradedocuments. It imposes a condition or requirement compliance withwhich is prohibited, but permitted by an exception under theRegulations (see Sec. 760.2(a) and Sec. 760.3(b) of this part). Itis reportable by those parties to the letter of credit or othertransaction that are required to take or refrain from taking someboycott related action by the request. Thus the bank must report therequest because it is a term or condition of the letter of creditthat it is handling, and the exporter-beneficiary must report therequest because the exporter determines the origin of the goods. Thefreight forwarder does not have to report this request because theforwarder has no role or obligation in this part of the transaction.See Sec. 760.5, examples (xiii)-(xv) of this part. (b) No six-pointed stars may be used on the goods, packing orcases. This term appears from time-to-time on documents from avariety of countries. The Department has taken the position that thesix-pointed star is a religious symbol. See Sec. 760.2(b), example(viii) of this part. Agreeing to this term is prohibited by theRegulations and not excepted because it constitutes an agreement tofurnish information about the religion of a U.S. person. SeeSec. 760.2(c) of this part. If a person proceeds with a transactionin which this is a condition at any stage of the transaction, thatperson has agreed to the condition in violation of the Regulations.It is not enough to ignore the condition. Exception mustaffirmatively be taken to this term or it must be stricken from thedocuments of the transaction. It is reportable by all parties to thetransaction that are restricted by it. For example, unlike thesituation described in (a) above, the freight forwarder would haveto report this request because his role in the transaction wouldinvolve preparation of the packing and cases. The bank and exporterwould both have to report, of course, if it were a term in a letterof credit. Each party would be obligated affirmatively to seek anamendment or deletion of the term.[[Page 12895]] (c) Neither goods nor packaging shall bear any symbolsprohibited in the boycotting country. This term appears from time-to-time in letters of credit and shipping documents from SaudiArabia. In our view, it is neither prohibited, nor reportablebecause it is not boycott-related. There is a wide range of symbolsthat are prohibited in Saudi Arabia for a variety of reasons, manyhaving to do with that nation's cultural and religious beliefs. Onthis basis, we do not interpret the term to be boycott related. SeeSec. 760.2(a)(5) and Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(v) of this part.Supplement No. 7 to Part 760--InterpretationProhibited Refusal To Do Business When a boycotting country rejects for boycott-related reasons ashipment of goods sold by a United States person, the United Statesperson selling the goods may return them to its inventory or may re-ship them to other markets (the United States person may not returnthem to the original supplier and demand restitution). The U.S.person may then make a non-boycott based selection of anothersupplier and provide the goods necessary to meet its obligations tothe boycotting customer in that particular transaction withoutviolating Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. If the United States personreceives another order from the same boycotting country for similargoods, the Department has determined that a boycott-based refusal bya United States person to ship goods from the supplier whose goodswere previously rejected would constitute a prohibited refusal to dobusiness under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The Department willpresume that filling such an order with alternative goods isevidence of the person's refusal to deal with the original supplier. The Department recognizes the limitations this places on futuretransactions with a boycotting country once a shipment of goods hasbeen rejected. Because of this, the Department wishes to point outthat, when faced with a boycotting country's refusal to permit entryof the particular goods, a United States person may state itsobligation to abide by the requirements of United States law andindicate its readiness to comply with the unilateral and specificselection of goods by the boycotting country in accordance withSec. 760.3(c) of this part. That section provides, in pertinentpart, as follows: A United States person may comply or agree to comply in thenormal course of business with the unilateral and specific selectionby a boycotting country ________ of ________ specific goods,________ provided that ________ with respect to goods, the items, inthe normal course of business, are identifiable as to their sourceor origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by(a) uniqueness of design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name,or other identification normally on the items themselves, includingtheir packaging. The United States person may also provide certain services inadvance of the unilateral selection by the boycotting country, suchas the compilation of lists of qualified suppliers, so long as suchservices are customary to the type of business the United Statesperson is engaged in, and the services rendered are completely non-exclusionary in character (i.e., the list of qualified supplierswould have to include the supplier whose goods had previously beenrejected by the boycotting country, if they were fully qualified).See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this part for a discussion of therequirements for the provision of these services. The Department wishes to emphasize that the unilateral selectionexception in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part will be construed narrowly,and that all its requirements and conditions must be met, includingthe following:--Discretion for the selection must be exercised by a boycottingcountry; or by a national or resident of a boycotting country;--The selection must be stated in the affirmative specifying aparticular supplier of goods;--While a permissible selection may be boycott based, if the UnitedStates person knows or has reason to know that the purpose of theselection is to effect discrimination against any United Statesperson on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, theperson may not comply under any circumstances. The Department cautions United States persons confronted withthe problem or concern over the boycott-based rejection of goodsshipped to a boycotting country that the adoption of devices such as``risk of loss'' clauses, or conditions that make the supplierfinancially liable if his or her goods are rejected by theboycotting country for boycott reasons are presumed by theDepartment to be evasion of the statute and regulations, and as suchare prohibited by Sec. 760.4 of this part, unless adopted prior toJanuary 18, 1978. See Sec. 760.4(d) of this part.Supplement No. 8 to Part 760--InterpretationDefinition of Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the United States When United States persons (as defined by the antiboycottregulations) located within the United States purchase or sell goodsor services located outside the United States, they have engaged inan activity within the foreign commerce of the United States.Although the goods or services may never physically come within thegeographic boundaries of the several states or territories of theUnited States, legal ownership or title is transferred from aforeign nation to the United States person who is located in theUnited States. In the case of a purchase, subsequent resale wouldalso be within United States commerce. It is the Department's view that the terms ``sale'' and``purchase'' as used in the regulations are not limited to thosecircumstances where the goods or services are physically transferredto the person who acquires title. The EAR define the activities thatserve as the transactional basis for U.S. commerce as thoseinvolving the ``sale, purchase, or transfer'' of goods or services.In the Department's view, as used in the antiboycott regulations,``transfer'' contemplates physical movement of the goods or servicesbetween the several states or territories and a foreign country,while ``sale'' and ``purchase'' relate to the movement of ownershipor title. This interpretation applies only to those circumstances in whichthe person located within the United States buys or sells goods orservices for its own account. Where the United States person isengaged in the brokerage of foreign goods, i.e., bringing foreignbuyers and sellers together and assisting in the transfer of thegoods, the sale or purchase itself would not ordinarily beconsidered to be within U.S. commerce. The brokerage service,however, would be a service provided from the United States to theparties and thus an activity within U.S. commerce and subject to theantiboycott laws. See Sec. 760.1(d)(13) of this part. The Department cautions that United States persons who altertheir normal pattern of dealing to eliminate the passage ofownership of the goods or services to or from the several states orterritories of the United States in order to avoid the applicationof the antiboycott regulations would be in violation of Sec. 760.4of this part.Supplement No. 9 to Part 760--InterpretationActivities Exclusively Within a Boycotting Country--FurnishingInformation Sec. 760.3(h) of this part provides that a United States personwho is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country may comply withthe laws of that country with respect to his or her activitiesexclusively within the boycotting country. Among the types ofconduct permitted by this exception is ``furnishing informationwithin the host country'' Sec. 760.3(h)(1)(v) of this part. Forpurposes of the discussion which follows, the Department is assumingthat the person in question is a bona fide resident of theboycotting country as defined in Sec. 760.3(f) of this part, andthat the information to be provided is required by the laws orregulations of the boycotting country, as also defined inSec. 760.3(g) of this part. The only issue this interpretationaddresses is under what circumstances the provision of informationis ``an activity exclusively within the boycotting country.'' The activity of ``furnishing information'' consists of twoparts, the acquisition of the information and its subsequenttransmittal. Under the terms of this exception, the information maynot be acquired outside the country for the purpose of responding tothe requirement for information imposed by the boycotting country.Thus, if an American company which is a bona fide resident of aboycotting country is required to provide information about itsdealings with other U.S. firms, the company may not ask its parentcorporation in the United States for that information, or make anyother inquiry outside the boundaries of the boycotting country. Theinformation must be provided to the boycotting country authoritiesbased on information or knowledge available to the company and itspersonnel located within the boycotting country at the time theinquiry is received. See Sec. 760.3, (h) of this part, examples(iii), (iv), and (v). Much of the information in the company'spossession (transaction and corporate records) may have[[Page 12896]]actually originated outside the boycotting country, and much of theinformation known to the employees may have been acquired outsidethe boycotting country. This will not cause the information to falloutside the coverage of this exception, if the information was sentto the boycotting country or acquired by the individuals in normalcommercial context prior to and unrelated to a boycott inquiry orpurpose. It should be noted that if prohibited information (aboutbusiness relations with a boycotted country, for example) has beenforwarded to the affiliate in the boycotting country in anticipationof a possible boycott inquiry from the boycotting countrygovernment, the Department will not regard this as informationwithin the knowledge of the bona fide resident under the terms ofthe exception. However, if the bona fide resident possesses theinformation prior to receipt of a boycott-related inquiry andobtained it in a normal commercial context, the information can beprovided pursuant to this exception notwithstanding the fact that,at some point, the information came into the boycotting country fromthe outside. The second part of the analysis of ``furnishing information''deals with the limitation on the transmittal of the information. Itcan only be provided within the boundaries of the boycottingcountry. The bona fide resident may only provide the information tothe party that the boycotting country law requires (directly orthrough an agent or representative within the country) so long asthat party is located within the boycotting country. Thisapplication of the exception is somewhat easier, since it isrelatively simple to determine if the information is to be given tosomebody within the country. Note that in discussing what constitutes furnishing information``exclusively within'' the boycotting country, the Department doesnot address the nature of the transaction or activity that theinformation relates to. It is the Department's position that thenature of the transaction, including the inception or completion ofthe transaction, is not material in analyzing the availability ofthis exception. For example, if a shipment of goods imported into a boycottingcountry is held up at the time of entry, and information from thebona fide resident within that country is legally required to freethose goods, the fact that the information may relate to atransaction that began outside the boycotting country is notmaterial. The availability of the exception will be judged based onthe activity of the bona fide resident within the country. If theresident provides that information of his or her own knowledge, andprovides it to appropriate parties located exclusively within thecountry, the exception permits the information to be furnished. Factual variations may raise questions about the application ofthis exception and the effect of this interpretation. In an effortto anticipate some of these, the Department has set forth below anumber of questions and answers. They are incorporated as a part ofthis interpretation. 1. Q. Under this exception, can a company which is a U.S. personand a bona fide resident of the boycotting country provideinformation to the local boycott office? A. Yes, if local law requires the company to provide thisinformation to the boycott office and all the other requirements aremet. 2. Q. If the company knows that the local boycott office willforward the information to the Central Boycott Office, may it stillprovide the information to the local boycott office? A. Yes, if it is required by local law to furnish theinformation to the local boycott office and all the otherrequirements are met. The company has no control over what happensto the information after it is provided to the proper authorities.(There is obvious potential for evasion here, and the Departmentwill examine such occurrences closely.) 3. Q. Can a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Syriafurnish information to the Central Boycott Office in Damascus? A. No, unless the law in Syria specifically requires informationto be provided to the Central Boycott Office the exception will notapply. Syria has a local boycott office responsible for enforcingthe boycott in that country. 4. Q. If a company which is a U.S. person and a bona fideresident of the boycotting country has an import shipment held up incustoms of the boycotting country, and is required to provideinformation about the shipment to get it out of customs, may thecompany do so? A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. The act offurnishing the information is the activity taking place exclusivelywithin the boycotting country. The fact that the information isprovided corollary to a transaction that originates or terminatesoutside the boycotting country is not material. 5. Q. If the U.S. person and bona fide resident of theboycotting country is shipping goods out of the boycotting country,and is required to certify to customs officials of the country atthe time of export that the goods are not of Israeli origin, may hedo so even though the certification relates to an exporttransaction? A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. See number 4above.Supplement No. 10 to Part 760--Interpretation (a) The words ``Persian Gulf'' cannot appear on the document. This term is common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may befound in letters of credit from Bahrain. Although more commonlyappearing in letters of credit, the term may also appear in othertrade documents. It is the Department's view that this term reflects a historicaldispute between the Arabs and the Iranians over geographic placenames which in no way relates to existing economic boycotts. Thus,the term is neither prohibited nor reportable under the Regulations. (b) Certify that goods are of U.S.A. origin and contain noforeign parts. This term appears periodically on documents from a number ofArab countries. It is the Department's position that the statementis a positive certification of origin and, as such, falls within theexception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliancewith the import and shipping document requirements of a boycottingcountry. Even though a negative phrase is contained within thepositive clause, the phrase is a non exclusionary, non blacklistingstatement. In the Department's view, the additional phrase does notaffect the permissible status of the positive certificate, nor doesit make the request reportable Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(iii) of this part. (c) Legalization of documents by any Arab consulate exceptEgyptian Consulate permitted. This term appears from time to time in letters of credit butalso may appear in various other trade documents requiringlegalization and thus is not prohibited, and a request to complywith the statement is not reportable. Because a number of Arabstates do not have formal diplomatic relations with Egypt, they donot recognize Egyptian embassy actions. The absence of diplomaticrelations is the reason for the requirement. In the Department'sview this does not constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott orembargo against Egypt under the terms of the Export AdministrationAct. Thus the term is not prohibited, and a request to comply withthe statement is not reportable.Supplement No. 11 to Part 760--InterpretationDefinition of Unsolicited Invitation to Bid Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part states in part: In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicitedinvitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott requesthas not received a reportable request for purposes of this sectionwhere he does not respond to the invitation to bid or otherproposal. The Regulations do not define ``unsolicited'' in this context.Based on review of numerous situations, the Department has developedcertain criteria that it applies in determining if an invitation tobid or other proposal received by a U.S. person is in factunsolicited. The invitation is not unsolicited if, during a commerciallyreasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the invitation,a representative of the U.S. person contacted the company or agencyinvolved for the purpose of promoting business on behalf of thecompany. The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person hasadvertised the product or line of products that are the subject ofthe invitation in periodicals or publications that ordinarilycirculate to the country issuing the invitation during acommercially reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of theinvitation. The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has soldthe same or similar products to the company or agency issuing theinvitation within a commercially reasonable period of time beforethe issuance of the current invitation. The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person hasparticipated in a trade mission to or trade fair in the countryissuing the invitation within a commercially reasonable[[Page 12897]]period of time before the issuance of the invitation. Under Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part, the invitation is regardedas not reportable if the U.S. person receiving it does not respond.The Department has determined that a simple acknowledgment of theinvitation does not constitute a response for purposes of this rule.However, an acknowledgment that requests inclusion for futureinvitations will be considered a response, and a report is required. Where the person in receipt of an invitation containing aboycott term or condition is undecided about a response by the timea report would be required to be filed under the regulations, it isthe Department's view that the person must file a report as calledfor in the Regulations. The person filing the report may indicate atthe time of filing that he has not made a decision on the boycottrequest but must file a supplemental report as called for in theregulations at the time a decision is made (Sec. 760.5(a)(6) of thispart).Supplement No. 12 to Part 760--Interpretation The Department has taken the position that a U.S. person asdefined by Sec. 760.1(b) of this part may not make use of an agentto furnish information that the U.S. person is prohibited fromfurnishing pursuant to Sec. 760.2(d) of this part. Example (v) under Sec. 760.4 of this part (Evasion) provides: A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract withboycotting country Y to meet all of Y's medical supply needs. Yinforms A that before such a contract can be concluded, A mustcomplete Y's boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibitedfrom answering the questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent inY to supply the necessary information. A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is adevice to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf. This interpretation deals with the application of theRegulations to a commercial agent registration requirement recentlyimposed by the government of Saudi Arabia. The requirement providesthat nationals of Saudi Arabia seeking to register in Saudi Arabiaas commercial agents or representatives of foreign concerns mustfurnish certain boycott-related information about the foreignconcern prior to obtaining approval of the registration. The requirement has been imposed by the Ministry of Commerce ofSaudi Arabia, which is the government agency responsible forregulation of commercial agents and foreign commercialregistrations. The Ministry requires the agent or representative tostate the following: Declaration: I, the undersigned, hereby declare, in my capacityas (blank) that (name and address of foreign principal) is notpresently on the blacklist of the Office for the Boycott of Israeland that it and all its branches, if any, are bound by the decisionsissued by the Boycott Office and do not (1) participate in thecapital of, (2) license the manufacture of any products or granttrademarks or tradeware license to, (3) give experience or technicaladvice to, or (4) have any other relationship with other companieswhich are prohibited to be dealt with by the Boycott Office. Signed(name of commercial agent/representative/distributor). It is the Department's view that under the circumstancesspecifically outlined in this interpretation relating to the natureof the requirement, a U.S. person will not be held responsible for aviolation of this part when such statements are provided by itscommercial agent or representative, even when such statements aremade with the full knowledge of the U.S. person. Nature of the requirement. For a boycott-related commercialregistration requirement to fall within the coverage of thisinterpretation it must have the following characteristics: 1. The requirement for information imposed by the boycottingcountry applies to a national or other subject of the boycottingcountry qualified under the local laws of that country to functionas a commercial representative within that country; 2. The registration requirement relates to the registration ofthe commercial agent's or representative's authority to sell ordistribute goods within the boycotting country acquired from theforeign concern; 3. The requirement is a routine part of the registration processand is not applied selectively based on boycott-related criteria; 4. The requirement applies only to a commercial agent orrepresentative in the boycotting country and does not apply to theforeign concern itself; and 5. The requirement is imposed by the agency of the boycottingcountry responsible for regulating commercial agencies. The U.S. person whose agent is complying with the registrationrequirement continues to be subject to all the terms of theRegulations, and may not provide any prohibited information to theagent for purposes of the agent's compliance with the requirement. In addition, the authority granted to the commercial agent orrepresentative by the U.S. person must be consistent with standardcommercial practices and not involve any grants of authority beyondthose incidental to the commercial sales and distributorshipresponsibilities of the agent. Because the requirement does not apply to the U.S. person, noreporting obligation under Sec. 760.5 of this part would arise. This interpretation, like all others issued by the Departmentdiscussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the ExportAdministration Regulations, should be read narrowly. Circumstancesthat differ in any material way from those discussed in this noticewill be considered under the applicable provisions of theRegulations. Persons are particularly advised not to seek to applythis interpretation to circumstances in which U.S. principals seekto use agents to deal with boycott-related or potential blacklistingsituations.Supplement No. 13 to Part 760--InterpretationSummary This interpretation considers boycott-based contractual languagedealing with the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. Whilethis language borrows terms from the ``unilateral and specificselection'' exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part, itfails to meet the requirements of that exception. Compliance withthe requirements of the language constitutes a violation of theregulatory prohibition of boycott-based refusals to do business.Regulatory Background Section 760.2(a) of this part prohibits U.S. persons fromrefusing or knowingly agreeing to refuse to do business with otherpersons when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with,requirement of, or request of a boycotting country. That prohibitiondoes not extend to the performance of management, procurement orother pre-award services, however, notwithstanding knowledge thatthe ultimate selection may be boycott-based. To be permissible suchservices: (1) Must be customary for the firm or industry involvedand (2) must not exclude others from the transaction or involveother actions based on the boycott. See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of thispart, ``Refusals to Do Business'', and example (xiii). A specific exception is also made in the Regulations forcompliance (and agreements to comply) with a unilateral and specificselection of suppliers or subcontractors by a boycotting countrybuyer. See Sec. 760.3(d) of this part. In Supplement No. 1 to part760, the following form of contractual language was said to fallwithin that exception for compliance with unilateral and specificselection: The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party),in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the finalunilateral and specific selection of any proposed carriers,insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within theboycotting country, or of specific goods to be furnished inaccordance with the terms and conditions of this contract. The Department noted that the actual steps necessary to complywith any selection made under this agreement would also have to meetthe requirements of Sec. 760.3(c) of this part to claim the benefitof that exception. In other words, the discretion in selecting wouldhave to be exercised exclusively by the boycotting country customerand the selection would have to be stated in the affirmative, naminga particular supplier. See Sec. 760.3(d) (4) and (5) of this part.Analysis of the New Contractual Language The Office of Antiboycott Compliance has learned of theintroduction of a new contractual clause into tender documentsissued by boycotting country governments. This clause is, in manyrespects, similar to that dealt with in Supplement No. 1 to part760, but several critical differences exist. The clause states:Boycott of Boycotted Country In connection with the performance of this Agreement, Contractoracknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations ofboycotting country apply to the furnishing and shipment of anyproducts or components thereof to boycotting country. The Contractorspecifically acknowledges that the[[Page 12898]]aforementioned import and customs laws and regulations of boycottingcountry prohibit, among other things, the importation intoboycotting country of products or components thereof: (A)Originating in boycotted country; (B) Manufactured, produced andfurnish by companies organized under the laws of boycotted country;and (C) Manufactured, produced or furnished by Nationals orResidents of boycotted country. The Government, in its exclusive power, reserves its right tomake the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposedCarriers, Insurers, Suppliers of Services to be performed withinboycotting country or of specific goods to be furnished inaccordance with the terms and conditions of this Contract. To assist the Government in exercising its right under thepreceding paragraph, Contractor further agrees to provide a completelist of names and addresses of all his Sub-Contractors, Suppliers,Vendors and Consultants and any other suppliers of the service forthe project. The title of this clause makes clear that its provisions areintended to be boycott-related. The first paragraph acknowledges theapplicability of certain boycott-related requirements of theboycotting country's laws in language reviewed in part 760,Supplement No. 1, Part II.B. and found to constitute a permissibleagreement under the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) of thispart for compliance with the import requirements of a boycottingcountry. The second and third paragraphs together deal with theprocedure for selecting subcontractors and suppliers of services andgoods and, in the context of the clause as a whole, must be regardedas motivated by boycott considerations and intended to enable theboycotting country government to make boycott-based selections,including the elimination of blacklisted subcontractors andsuppliers. The question is whether the incorporation into these paragraphsof some language from the ``unilateral and specific selection''clause approved in Supplement No. 1 to part 760 suffices to take thelanguage outside Sec. 760.2(a) of this part's prohibition onboycott-based agreements to refuse to do business. While the firstsentence of this clause is consistent with the language discussed inSupplement No. 1 to part 760, the second sentence significantlyalters the effect of this clause. The effect is to draw thecontractor into the decision-making process, thereby destroying theunilateral character of the selection by the buyer. By agreeing tosubmit the names of the suppliers it plans to use, the contractor isagreeing to give the boycotting country buyer, who has retained theright of final selection, the ability to reject, for boycott-relatedreasons, any supplier the contractor has already chosen. Because therequirement appears in the contractual provision dealing with theboycott, the buyer's rejection of any supplier whose name is givento the buyer pursuant to this provision would be presumed to beboycott-based. By signing the contract, and thereby agreeing tocomply with all of its provisions, the contractor must either acceptthe buyer's rejection of any supplier, which is presumed to beboycott-based because of the context of this provision, or breachthe contract. In these circumstances, the contractor's method of choosing itssubcontractors and suppliers, in anticipation of the buyer'sboycott-based review, cannot be considered a permissible pre-awardservice because of the presumed intrusion of boycott-based criteriainto the selection process. Thus, assuming all other jurisdictionalrequirements necessary to establish a violation of part 760 are met,the signing of the contract by the contractor constitutes aviolation of Sec. 760.2(a) of this part because he is agreeing torefuse to do business for boycott reasons. The apparent attempt to bring this language within the exceptionfor compliance with unilateral and specific selections isineffective. The language does not place the discretion to choosesuppliers in the hands of the boycotting country buyer but dividesthis discretion between the buyer and his principal contractor.Knowing that the buyer will not accept a boycotted company assupplier or subcontractor, the contractor is asked to use hisdiscretion in selecting a single supplier or subcontractor for eachelement of the contract. The boycotting country buyer exercisesdiscretion only through accepting or rejecting the selected supplieror contractor as its boycott policies require. In thesecircumstances it cannot be said that the buyer is exercising rightof unilateral and specific selection which meets the criteria ofSec. 760.3(c) of this part. For this reason, agreement to thecontractual language discussed here would constitute an agreement torefuse to do business with any person rejected by the buyer andwould violate Sec. 760.2(a) of this part.Supplement No. 14 to Part 760--Interpretation (a) Contractual clause concerning import, customs and boycottlaws of a boycotting country. The following language has appeared in tender documents issuedby a boycotting country: Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that the import,Customs and boycott laws, rules and regulations of [name ofboycotting country] apply in importing to [name of boycottingcountry]. Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that under theselaws, rules and regulations, it is prohibited to import into [nameof the boycotting country] any products or parts thereof thatoriginated in [name of boycotted country]; were manufactured,produced or imported by companies formed under the laws of [name ofboycotted country]; or were manufactured, produced or imported bynationals or residents of [name of boycotted country]. Agreeing to the above contractual language is a prohibitedagreement to refuse to do business, under Sec. 760.2(a) of thispart. The first paragraph requires broad acknowledgment of theapplication of the boycotting country's boycott laws, rules andregulations. Unless this language is qualified to apply only toboycott restrictions with which U.S. persons may comply, agreementto it is prohibited. See Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, examples (v)and (vi) under ``Agreement to Refuse to Do Business.'' The second paragraph does not limit the scope of the boycottrestrictions referenced in the first paragraph. It states that theboycott laws include restrictions on goods originating in theboycotted country; manufactured, produced or supplied by companiesorganized under the laws of the boycotted country; or manufactured,produced or supplied by nationals or residents of the boycottedcountry. Each of these restrictions is within the exception forcompliance with the import requirements of the boycotting country(Sec. 760.3(a) of this part). However, the second paragraph's listof restrictions is not exclusive. Since the boycott laws generallyinclude more than what is listed and permissible under theantiboycott law, U.S. persons may not agree to the quoted clause.For example, a country's boycott laws may prohibit imports of goodsmanufactured by blacklisted firms. Except as provided bySec. 760.3(g) of this part, agreement to and compliance with thisboycott restriction would be prohibited under the antiboycott law. The above contractual language is distinguished from thecontract clause determined to be permissible in supplement 1, PartII, A, by its acknowledgment that the boycott requirements of theboycotting country apply. Although the first sentence of theSupplement 1 clause does not exclude the possible application ofboycott laws, it refers only to the import and customs laws of theboycotting country without mentioning the boycott laws as well. Asdiscussed fully in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, compliance with oragreement to the clause quoted there is, therefore, permissible. The contract clause quoted above, as well as the clause dealtwith in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, part II, A, is reportableunder Sec. 760.6(a)(1) of this part. (b) Letter of credit terms removing blacklist certificaterequirement if specified vessels used. The following terms frequently appear on letters of creditcovering shipment to Iraq: Shipment to be effected by Iraqi State Enterprise for MaritimeTransport Vessels or by United Arab Shipping Company (SAB) vessels,if available. If shipment is effected by any of the above company's [sic]vessels, black list certificate or evidence to that effect is notrequired. These terms are not reportable and compliance with them ispermissible. The first sentence, a directive to use Iraqi State Enterprisefor Maritime Transport or United Arab Shipping vessels, is neitherreportable nor prohibited because it is not considered by theDepartment to be boycott-related. The apparent reason for thedirective is Iraq's preference to have cargo shipped on its ownvessels (or, as in the case of United Arab Shipping, on vesselsowned by a company in part established and owned by the Iraqigovernment). Such ``cargo preference'' requirements, calling for theuse of an importing or exporting country's own ships, are commonthroughout the world and are imposed for non-boycott reasons. (SeeSec. 760.2(a) of this part, example (vii)[[Page 12899]]AGREEMENTS TO REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS.) In contrast, if the letter of credit contains a list of vesselsor carriers that appears to constitute a boycott-related whitelist,a directive to select a vessel from that list would be bothreportable and prohibited. When such a directive appears inconjunction with a term removing the blacklist certificaterequirement if these vessels are used, the Department will presumethat beneficiaries, banks and any other U.S. person receiving theletter of credit know that there is a boycott-related purpose forthe directive. The second sentence of the letter of credit language quotedabove does not, by itself, call for a blacklist certificate and isnot therefore, reportable. If a term elsewhere on the letter ofcredit imposes a blacklist certificate requirement, then that otherterm would be reportable. (c) Information not related to a particular transaction in U.S.commerce. Under Sec. 760.2 (c), (d) and (e), of this part U.S. persons areprohibited, with respect to their activities in U.S. commerce, fromfurnishing certain information. It is the Department's position thatthe required nexus with U.S. commerce is established when thefurnishing of information itself occurs in U.S. commerce. Even whenthe furnishing of information is not itself in U.S. commerce,however, the necessary relationship to U.S. commerce will beestablished if the furnishing of information relates to particulartransactions in U.S. commerce or to anticipated transactions in U.S.commerce. See, e.g. Sec. 760.2(d), examples (vii), (ix) and (xii) ofthis part. The simplest situation occurs where a U.S. person located in theUnited States furnishes information to a boycotting country. Thetransfer of information from the United States to a foreign countryis itself an activity in U.S. commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(1)(iv) ofthis part. In some circumstances, the furnishing of information by aU.S. person located outside the United States may also be anactivity in U.S. commerce. For example, the controlled foreignsubsidiary of a domestic concern might furnish to a boycottingcountry information the subsidiary obtained from the U.S.-locatedparent for that purpose. The subsidiary's furnishing would, in thesecircumstances, constitute an activity in U.S. commerce. SeeSec. 760.1(d)(8) of this part. Where the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S.commerce, the U.S. commerce requirement may be satisfied by the factthat the furnishing is related to an activity in U.S. foreign ordomestic commerce. For example, if a shipment of goods by acontrolled-in-fact foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company to aboycotting country gives rise to an inquiry from the boycottingcountry concerning the subsidiary's relationship with another firm,the Department regards any responsive furnishing of information bythe subsidiary as related to the shipment giving rise to theinquiry. If the shipment is in U.S. foreign or domestic commerce, asdefined by the regulations, then the Department regards thefurnishing to be related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subjectto the antiboycott regulations, whether or not the furnishing itselfis in U.S. commerce. In some circumstances, the Department may regard a furnishing ofinformation as related to a broader category of present andprospective transactions. For example, if a controlled-in-factforeign subsidiary of a U.S. company is requested to furnishinformation about its commercial dealings and it appears thatfailure to respond will result in its blacklisting, any responsivefurnishing of information will be regarded by the Department asrelating to all of the subsidiary's present and anticipated businessactivities with the inquiring boycotting country. Accordingly, ifany of these present or anticipated business activities are in U.S.commerce, the Department will regard the furnishing as related to anactivity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycottregulations. In deciding whether anticipated business activities will be inU.S. commerce, the Department will consider all of the surroundingcircumstances. Particular attention will be given to the history ofthe U.S. person's business activities with the boycotting countryand others, the nature of any activities occurring after afurnishing of information occurs and any relevant economic orcommercial factors which may affect these activities. For example, if a U.S. person has no activities with theboycotting country at present but all of its other internationalactivities are in U.S. commerce, as defined by the Regulations, thenthe Department is likely to regard any furnishing of information bythat person for the purpose of securing entry into the boycottingcountry's market as relating to anticipated activities in U.S.commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations. Similarly, ifsubsequent to the furnishing of information to the boycottingcountry for the purpose of securing entry into its markets, the U.S.person engages in transactions with that country which are in U.S.commerce, the Department is likely to regard the furnishing asrelated to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to theantiboycott regulations.Supplement No. 15 to Part 760--Interpretation Section 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part prohibits UnitedStates persons from furnishing certain types of information withintent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreignboycott against a country friendly to the United States. TheDepartment has been asked whether prohibited information may betransmitted--that is, passed to others by a United States person whohas not directly or indirectly authored the information--withoutsuch transmission constituting a furnishing of information inviolation of Sec. 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part. Throughoutthis interpretation, ``transmission'' is defined as the passing onby one person of information initially authored by another. TheDepartment believes that there is no distinction in the EAR betweentransmitting (as defined above) and furnishing prohibitedinformation under the EAR and that the transmission of prohibitedinformation with the requisite boycott intent is a furnishing ofinformation violative of the EAR. At the same time, however, thecircumstances relating to the transmitting party's involvement willbe carefully considered in determining whether that party intendedto comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. The EAR does not deal specifically with the relationship betweentransmitting and furnishing. However, the restrictions in the EAR onresponses to boycott-related conditions, both by direct and indirectactions and whether by primary parties or intermediaries, indicatethat U.S. persons who simply transmit prohibited information are tobe treated the same under the EAR as those who both author andfurnish prohibited information. This has been the Department'sposition in enforcement actions it has brought. The few references in the EAR to the transmission of informationby third parties are consistent with this position. Two examples,both relating to the prohibition against the furnishing ofinformation about U.S. persons' race, religion, sex, or nationalorigin (Sec. 760.2(c) of this part), deal explicitly withtransmitting information. These examples (Sec. 760.2(c) of thispart, example (v), and Sec. 760.3(f) of this part, example (vi))show that, in certain cases, when furnishing certain information ispermissible, either because it is not within a prohibition or isexcepted from a prohibition, transmitting it is also permissible.These examples concern information that may be furnished byindividuals about themselves or their families. The examples showthat employers may transmit to a boycotting country visaapplications or forms containing information about an employee'srace, religion, sex, or national origin if that employee is thesource of the information and authorizes its transmission. In otherwords, within the limits of ministerial action set forth in theseexamples, employees' actions in transmitting information areprotected by the exception available to the employee. Thedistinction between permissible and prohibited behavior rests not onthe definitional distinction between furnishing and transmitting,but on the excepted nature of the information furnished by theemployee. The information originating from the employee does notlose its excepted character because it is transmitted by theemployer. The Department's position regarding the furnishing andtransmission of certificates of one's own blacklist status rests ona similar basis and does not support the contention that thirdparties may transmit prohibited information authored by another.Such self-certifications do not violate any prohibitions in the EAR(see Supplement Nos. 1(I)(B), 2, and 5(A)(2); Sec. 760.2(f), example(xiv)). It is the Department's position that it is not prohibitedfor U.S. persons to transmit such self-certifications completed byothers. Once again, because furnishing the self-certification is notprohibited, third parties who transmit the self-certificationsoffend no prohibition. On the other hand, if a third party authoredinformation about another's blacklist status, the act oftransmitting that information would be prohibited. A third example in the EAR (Sec. 760.5, example (xiv) of thispart), which also concerns a permissible transmission of[[Page 12900]]boycott-related information, does not support the theory that one maytransmit prohibited information authored by another. This example dealswith the reporting requirements in Sec. 760.5 of this part--not theprohibitions--and merely illustrates that a person who receives andtransmits a self-certification has not received a reportable request. It is also the Department's position that a U.S. person violatesthe prohibitions against furnishing information by transmittingprohibited information even if that person has received noreportable request in the transaction. For example, where documentsaccompanying a letter of credit contain prohibited information, anegotiating bank that transmits the documents, with the requisiteboycott intent, to an issuing bank has not received a reportablerequest, but has furnished prohibited information. While the Department does not regard the suggested distinctionbetween transmitting and furnishing information as meaningful, thefacts relating to the third party's involvement may be important indetermining whether that party furnished information with therequired intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctionedforeign boycott. For example, if it is a standard business practicefor one participant in a transaction to obtain and pass on, withoutexamination, documents prepared by another party, it might bedifficult to maintain that the first participant intended to complywith a boycott by passing on information contained in the unexamineddocuments. Resolution of such intent questions, however, dependsupon an analysis of the individual facts and circumstances of thetransaction and the Department will continue to engage in suchanalysis on a case-by-case basis. This interpretation, like all others issued by the Departmentdiscussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the EAR,should be read narrowly. Circumstances that differ in any materialway from those discussed in this interpretation will be consideredunder the applicable provisions of the Regulations.Supplement No. 16 to Part 760--Interpretation Pursuant to Articles 5, 7, and 26 of the Treaty of Peace betweenthe State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan andimplementing legislation enacted by Jordan, Jordan's participationin the Arab economic boycott of Israel was formally terminated onAugust 16, 1995. On the basis of this action, it is the Department's positionthat certain requests for information, action or agreement fromJordan which were considered boycott-related by implication nowcannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not be prohibitedor reportable under the regulations. For example, a request that anexporter certify that the vessel on which it is shipping its goodsis eligible to enter Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ports has beenconsidered a boycott-related request that the exporter could notcomply with because Jordan has had a boycott in force againstIsrael. Such a request from Jordan after August 16, 1995 would notbe presumed boycott-related because the underlying boycottrequirement/basis for the certification has been eliminated.Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited from complyingwith a request received from Jordanian government officials tofurnish the place of birth of employees the company is seeking totake to Jordan because there is no underlying boycott law or policythat would give rise to a presumption that the request was boycott-related. U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their faceboycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance orsupport of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to theregulations, irrespective of the country of origin. For example,requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'',``Israel boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases orwords indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriateprovisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.PART 762--RECORDKEEPINGSec.762.1 Scope.762.2 Records to be retained.762.3 Records exempt from recordkeeping requirements.762.4 Original records required.762.5 Reproduction of original records.762.6 Period of retention.762.7 Producing and inspecting records.

Statutorily-mandated sanctions may beimposed on account of specified conduct related to weaponsproliferation. Such statutory sanctions are not civil or criminalpenalties, but restrict imports and procurement (See section 11A of theEAA, Multilateral Export Control Violations, and section 11C of theEAA, Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation), or restrict exportlicenses (See section 11B of the EAA, Missile Proliferation Violations,and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992). (2) Other sanctions and measures. (i) Seizure and forfeiture. Itemsthat have been, are being, or are intended to be, exported or shippedfrom or taken out of the United States in violation of the EAA, theEAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, aresubject to being seized and detained as are the vessels, vehicles, andaircraft carrying such items.

(A) The Department of State may deny licensesor approvals for the export or reexport of defense articles and defenseservices controlled under the Arms Export Control Act to personsindicted or convicted of specified criminal offenses, includingviolations of the EAA, or to persons denied export privileges by BXA oranother agency. (22 CFR 126.7(a) and 127.11(a).) (B) The Department of Defense, among other agencies, may suspendthe right of any person to contract with the United States Governmentbased on export control violations. (Federal Acquisition Regulations9.407-2.)Sec. 764.4 Reporting of violations. (a) Where to report. If a person learns that an export controlviolation of the EAR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify:Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration,U.S.Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., RoomH-4520, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-1208, Facsimile: (202)482-0964or, for violations of part 760 of the EAR:Office of Antiboycott Compliance, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S.Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., RoomH-6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-2381, Facsimile: (202)482-0913. (b) Failure to report violations. Failure to report potentialviolations may result in the unwarranted issuance of licenses orexports without the required licenses to the detriment of the interestsof the United States. (c) Reporting requirement distinguished. The reporting provisionsin paragraph (a) of this section are not ``reporting requirements''within the meaning of Sec. 764.2(i) of this part.Sec. 764.5 Voluntary self-disclosure. (a) General policy. BXA strongly encourages disclosure to OEE ifyou believe that you may have violated the EAR, or any order, licenseor authorization issued thereunder. Voluntary self-disclosure is amitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any,will be sought by OEE. (b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section do not apply to disclosures ofviolations relating to part 760 of the EAR. (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information isprovided to OEE for its review in determining whether to takeadministrative action under part 766 of the EAR for violations of theexport control provisions of the EAR. (3) The provisions of this section apply only when information isreceived by OEE for review prior to the time that OEE, or any otheragency of the United States Government, has learned the same orsubstantially similar information from another source and has commencedan investigation or inquiry in connection with that information. (4) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor indetermining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought byOEE, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factorsin a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solelywithin the discretion of OEE, and the mitigating effect of voluntaryself-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntaryself-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred tothe Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, OEEwould notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the consideration of that factor is within thediscretion of the Department of Justice. (5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under thissection unless the individual making the disclosure did so with thefull knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management. (6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they berelied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits,privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by anyperson, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, orother matter. (c) Information to be provided. (1) General. Any person wanting to disclose information thatconstitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlinedbelow, initially notify OEE as soon as possible after violations arediscovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all export-relatedtransactions where violations are suspected. (2) Initial notification. (i) The initial notification should be in writing and be sent toone of the addresses in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this part. The notificationshould include the name of the person making the disclosure and a briefdescription of the suspected violations. The notification shoulddescribe the general nature and extent of the violations. If the personmaking the disclosure subsequently[[Page 12905]]completes the narrative account required by Sec. 764.5(c)(3) of thispart, the disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date ofthe initial notification for purposes of Sec. 764.5(b)(3) of this part. (ii) OEE recognizes that there may be situations where it will notbe practical to make an initial notification in writing. For example,written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves theUnited States without the required license, yet there is still anopportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorizedpersons. In such situations, OEE should be contacted promptly at one ofthe offices listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this part. (3) Narrative account. After the initial notification, a thoroughreview should be conducted of all export-related transactions wherepossible violations are suspected. OEE recommends that the review covera period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification.If your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing todiscover violations that may later become the subject of aninvestigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receiveconsideration under this section. However, the failure to make suchdisclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless someother section of the EAR or other provision of law requires disclosure.Upon completion of the review, OEE should be furnished with a narrativeaccount that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so thattheir nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account shouldalso describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that mayhave been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occurin the future. The narrative account should include: (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment withoutthe required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges; (ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred; (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals andorganizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activitiesgiving rise to the violations; (iv) License numbers; (v) The description, quantity, value in U.S. dollars and ECCN orother classification of the items involved; and (vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances. (4) Supporting documentation. (i) The narrative account should be accompanied by copies ofdocuments that explain and support it, including: (A) Licensing documents such as licenses, license applications,import certificates and end-user statements; (B) Shipping documents such as Shipper's Export Declarations, airwaybills and bills of lading; and (C) Other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and otherevidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda,purchase orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures. (ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative accountmust be retained by the person making the disclosure until OEE requeststhem, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has beenmade. After a final decision, the documents should be handled inaccordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the EAR. (5) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating thatall of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledgeand belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organizationshould be signed by an official of the corporation or otherorganization with the authority to do so. Section 764.2(g) of thispart, relating to false or misleading representations, applies inconnection with the disclosure of information under this section. (6) Oral presentations. OEE believes that oral presentations aregenerally not necessary to augment the written narrative account andsupporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believesotherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with thedisclosure. (7) Where to make voluntary self-disclosures. The informationconstituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondencepertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted to:Office of Export Enforcement, Director, Intelligence Division, U.S.Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 70, Washington, D.C. 20044Office of Export Enforcement, Director, Intelligence Division, U.S.Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., RoomH-4520,Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-1208, Facsimile: (202)482-0964,or to any of the following field offices:Special Agent in Charge, Boston Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, New Boston Federal Building, 10 Causeway Street, Room 350,Boston, Massachusetts 02222, Tel: (617) 565-6030, Facsimile: (617) 835-6039Special Agent in Charge, Chicago Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, 2400 East Devon, Suite 300, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018,Tel: (312) 353-6640, Facsimile: (312) 353-8008Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, 525 Griffin Street, Room 622, Dallas, Texas 75202, Tel:(214) 767-9294, Facsimile: (214) 729-9299Special Agent in Charge, Los Angeles Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, 2601 Main Street, Suite 310, Irvine, California 92714-6299, Tel: (714) 251-9001, Facsimile: (714) 791-9103Special Agent in Charge, Miami Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, 200 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1260, Fort Lauderdale,Florida 33301, Tel: (954) 356-7540, Facsimile: (954) 356-7549Special Agent in Charge, New York Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, Teleport II, 2 Teleport Drive, Staten Island, New York10311-1001, Tel: (718) 370-0070, Facsimile: (718) 370-8226Special Agent in Charge, San Jose Field Office, Office of ExportEnforcement, 96 North 3rd Street, Suite 250, San Jose, California95112-5572, Tel: (408) 291-4204, Facsimile: (408) 291-4320Special Agent in Charge, Washington, D.C.

(d) Action by the Office of Export Enforcement. After OEE has beenprovided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, itwill acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person makingthe disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additionalaction, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. Asquickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, OEE maytake any of the following actions: (1) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on thefacts disclosed, it plans to take no action; (2) Issue a warning letter; (3) Issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.18 of theEAR and attempt to settle the matter; (4) Issue a charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.3 of the EAR if asettlement is not reached; and/or (5) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminalprosecution. (e) Criteria. For purposes of determining what administrativeaction to take and what sanctions, if any, to[[Page 12906]]seek, the fact that a voluntary self-disclosure has been made will be amitigating factor. OEE will take that factor into account along withother mitigating and aggravating factors when determining what, if any,administrative sanctions should be imposed. The factors that OEE willconsider are in its sole discretion, but may include: (1) The extent to which the purpose of the control is undermined bythe transaction; (2) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had properapplication been made; (3) The quantity and value of the items involved; (4) Why the violations occurred. For example, OEE may considerwhether the violations were intentional or inadvertent; the degree towhich the person responsible for the violation making the disclosurewas familiar with the EAR; and whether the violator has been thesubject of prior administrative or criminal action under the EAA or theEAR; (5) Whether, as a result of the information provided, OEE is ableto prevent any items exported illegally from reaching unauthorizedpersons or destinations; (6) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation; (7) Whether the person has instituted or improved an internalcompliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violations. (f) Treatment of unlawfully exported items after voluntary self-disclosure. (1) Any person taking certain actions with knowledge that aviolation of the EAA or the EAR has occurred has violated Sec. 764.2(e)of this part. Any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knowsthat a violation may have occurred. Therefore, at the time that avoluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure mayrequest permission from BXA to engage in the activities described inSec. 764.2(e) of this part that would otherwise be prohibited. If therequest is granted by the Office of Exporter Services in consultationwith OEE, future activities with respect to those items that wouldotherwise violate Sec. 764.2(e) of this part will not constituteviolations. However, even if permission is granted, the person makingthe voluntary self-disclosure is not absolved from liability for anyviolations disclosed nor relieved of the obligation to obtain anyrequired reexport authorizations. (2) A license to reexport items that are the subject of a voluntaryself-disclosure, and that have been exported contrary to the provisionsof the EAA or the EAR, may be requested from BXA in accordance with theprovisions of part 748 of the EAR. If the applicant for reexportauthorization knows that the items are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure, the request should state that a voluntary self-disclosurewas made in connection with the export of the commodities for whichreexport authorization is sought.Sec. 764.6 Protective administrative measures. (a) License Exception limitation. As provided in Sec. 740.2(b) ofthe EAR , all License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension,or revocation. (b) Revocation or suspension of licenses. As provided in Sec. 750.8of the EAR, all licenses are subject to revision, suspension, orrevocation. (c) Temporary denial orders. BXA may, in accordance withSec. 766.24 of the EAR, issue an order temporarily denying exportprivileges when such an order is necessary in the public interest toprevent the occurrence of an imminent violation. (d) Denial based on criminal conviction. BXA may, in accordancewith Sec. 766.25 of the EAR, issue an order denying the exportprivileges of any person who has been convicted of an offense specifiedin Sec. 11(h) of the EAA.Supplement No. 1 To Part 764--Standard Terms of Orders Denying ExportPrivileges (a) General. Orders denying export privileges may be ``standard''or ``non-standard.'' This Supplement specifies terms of the standardorder denying export privileges. All denial orders are published in theFederal Register. The failure by any person to comply with any denialorder is a violation of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).(See General Prohibition Four at Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR;Sec. 764.2(k) of this part.) All persons whose export privileges aredenied by any form of denial order are identified on the Denied PersonsList (Supplement No. 2 to this part), with an indication of whether anorder is standard or non-standard denoted in the ``Terms of order''column. The Denied Persons List also tells you where each denial ordercan be found in the Federal Register. Reference should be made to thetext of the denial order, as published in the Federal Register, tolearn the scope of any denial order, including any non-standard denialorder. Denial orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are to be construed,insofar as possible, as having the same scope and effect as thestandard denial order. The introduction to each denial order shall be specific to thatorder, and shall include: (1) The name and address of any deniedpersons and any related persons subject to the denial order; (2) thebasis for the denial order, such as final decision following charges ofviolation, settlement agreement, Sec. 11(h) of the EAA, or temporarydenial order request; (3) the period of denial, the effective date ofthe order, whether and for how long any portion of the denial of exportprivileges is suspended, and any conditions of probation; and (4)whether any or all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to theperson(s) named in the denial order or in which such person(s) has aninterest, are suspended or revoked. (b) Standard text. The standard denial order shall provide: ``It is therefore ordered: First, that [the denied person(s)] may not, directly or indirectly,participate in any way in any transaction involving any commodity,software or technology (hereinafter collectively referred to as``item'') exported or to be exported from the United States that issubject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or in any otheractivity subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to: A.

For purposesof this paragraph, servicing means installation, maintenance, repair,modification or testing. Third, that, after notice and opportunity for comment as providedin Sec. 766.23 of the EAR, any person, firm, corporation, or businessorganization related to the denied person by affiliation, ownership,control, or position of responsibility in the conduct of trade orrelated services may also be made subject to the provisions of thisorder. Fourth, that this order does not prohibit any export, reexport, orother transaction subject to the EAR where the only items involved thatare subject to the EAR are the foreign-produced direct product of U.S.-origin technology. This order, which constitutes the final agency action in thismatter, is effective immediately.''Supplement No. 2 To Part 764--Denied Persons List (a) General.

Thesole issues to be raised and ruled on in any such appeal are whetherthe person so named is related to the respondent and whether the orderis justified in order to prevent evasion. The recommended decision andorder of the administrative law judge shall be reviewed by the UnderSecretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.22 ofthis part.Sec. 766.24 Temporary denials. (a) General. The procedures in this section apply to temporarydenial orders issued on or after July 12, 1985. For temporary denialorders issued on or before July 11, 1985, the proceedings will begoverned by the applicable regulations in effect at the time thetemporary denial orders were issued. Without limiting any other actionBXA may take under the EAR with respect to any application, order,license or authorization issued under the EAA, BXA may ask theAssistant Secretary to issue a temporary denial order on an ex partebasis to prevent an imminent violation, as defined in this section, ofthe EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issuedthereunder. The temporary denial order will deny export privileges toany person named in the order as provided for in Sec. 764.3(a)(2) ofthe EAR. (b) Issuance. (1) The Assistant Secretary may issue an ordertemporarily denying to a person any or all of the export privilegesdescribed in part 764 of the EAR upon a showing by BXA that the orderis necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation ofthe EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issuedthereunder. (2) The temporary denial order shall define the imminent violationand state why it was issued without a hearing. Because all denialorders are public, the description of the imminent violation and thereasons for proceeding on an ex parte basis set forth therein shall bestated in a manner that is consistent with national security, foreignpolicy, business confidentiality, and investigative concerns. (3) A violation may be ``imminent'' either in time or in degree oflikelihood. To establish grounds for the temporary denial order, BXAmay show either that a violation is about to occur, or that the generalcircumstances of the matter under investigation or case under criminalor administrative charges demonstrate a likelihood of futureviolations. To indicate the likelihood of future violations, BXA mayshow that the violation under investigation or charges is significant,deliberate, covert and/or likely to occur again, rather than technicalor negligent, and that it is appropriate to give notice to companies inthe United States and abroad to cease dealing with the person in U.S.-origin items in order to reduce the likelihood that a person underinvestigation or charges continues to export or acquire abroad suchitems, risking subsequent disposition contrary to export controlrequirements. Lack of information establishing the precise time aviolation may occur does not preclude a finding that a violation isimminent, so long as there is sufficient reason to believe thelikelihood of a violation. (4) The temporary denial order will be issued for a period notexceeding 180 days. (5) Notice of the issuance of a temporary denial order on an exparte basis shall be given in accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of thispart upon issuance.[[Continued on page 12914]][Federal Register: March 25, 1996 (Rules and Regulations)][Page 12914-12964]From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov][[pp. 12914-12964]] Export Administration Regulation; Simplification of ExportAdministration Regulations[[Continued from page 12913]][[Page 12914]] (c) Related persons. A temporary denial order may be madeapplicable to related persons in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of thispart. (d) Renewal. (1) If, no later than 20 days before the expirationdate of a temporary denial order, BXA believes that renewal of thedenial order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminentviolation, BXA may file a written request setting forth the basis forits belief, including any additional or changed circumstances, askingthat the Assistant Secretary renew the temporary denial order, withmodifications, if any are appropriate, for an additional period notexceeding 180 days. BXA's request shall be delivered to the respondent,or any agent designated for this purpose, in accordance withSec. 766.5(b) of this part, which will constitute notice of the renewalapplication. (2) Non-resident respondents. To facilitate timely notice ofrenewal requests, a respondent not a resident of the United States maydesignate a local agent for this purpose and provide writtennotification of such designation to BXA in the manner set forth inSec. 766.5(b) of this part. (3) Hearing. (i) A respondent may oppose renewal of a temporarydenial order by filing with the Assistant Secretary a writtensubmission, supported by appropriate evidence, to be received not laterthan seven days before the expiration date of such order. For goodcause shown, the Assistant Secretary may consider submissions receivednot later than five days before the expiration date. The AssistantSecretary ordinarily will not allow discovery; however, for good causeshown in respondent's submission, he/she may allow the parties to takelimited discovery, consisting of a request for production of documents.If requested by the respondent in the written submission, the AssistantSecretary shall hold a hearing on the renewal application. The hearingshall be on the record and ordinarily will consist only of oralargument. The only issue to be considered on BXA's request for renewalis whether the temporary denial order should be continued to prevent animminent violation as defined herein. (ii) Any person designated as a related person may not opposeissuance or renewal of the temporary denial order, but may file anappeal in accordance with Sec. 766.2(3)(c) of this part. (iii) If no written opposition to BXA's renewal request is receivedwithin the specified time, the Assistant Secretary may issue the orderrenewing the temporary denial order without a hearing. (4) A temporary denial order may be renewed more than once. (e) Appeals. (1) Filing. (i) A respondent may, at any time, file anappeal of the initial or renewed temporary denial order with theadministrative law judge. (ii) The filing of an appeal shall stay neither the effectivenessof the temporary denial order nor any application for renewal, nor willit operate to bar the Assistant Secretary's consideration of anyrenewal application. (2) Grounds. A respondent may appeal on the grounds that thefinding that the order is necessary in the public interest to preventan imminent violation is unsupported. (3) Appeal procedure. A full written statement in support of theappeal must be filed with the appeal together with appropriateevidence, and be simultaneously served on BXA, which shall have sevendays from receipt to file a reply. Service on the administrative lawjudge shall be addressed to the Office of the Administrative Law Judge,U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-6716, 14th Street and ConstitutionAvenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on BXA shall be as setforth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this part. The administrative law judgenormally will not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals. (4) Recommended Decision. Within 10 working days after an appeal isfiled, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decisionto the Under Secretary, and serve copies on the parties, recommendingwhether the issuance or the renewal of the temporary denial ordershould be affirmed, modified or vacated. (5) Final decision. Within five working days after receipt of therecommended decision, the Under Secretary shall issue a written orderaccepting, rejecting or modifying the recommended decision. Because ofthe time constraints, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily belimited to the written record for decision, including the transcript ofany hearing. The issuance or renewal of the temporary denial ordershall be affirmed only if there is reason to believe that the temporarydenial order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminentviolation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or otherauthorization issued under the EAA. The Under Secretary's written orderis final and is not subject to judicial review, except as provided inparagraph (g) of this section. (f) Delivery. A copy of any temporary denial order issued orrenewed and any final decision on appeal shall be published in theFederal Register and shall be delivered to BXA and to the respondent,or any agent designated for this purpose, and to any related person inthe same manner as provided in Sec. 766.5 of this part for filing forpapers other than a charging letter. (g) Judicial review. A respondent temporarily denied exportprivileges by order of the Under Secretary may appeal to the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pursuant to 50U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(d)(3).Sec. 766.25 Administrative action denying permission to apply for oruse export licenses.

(b) Scope. This part applies only to the extent that items arecontrolled for national security purposes. (c) Types of programs. There are two general programs of foreignavailability: (1) Foreign availability to controlled countries. In this categoryare denied license assessments (see Secs. 768.4(b) and 768.7 of thispart) and decontrol assessments (see Secs. 768.4(c) and 768.7 of thispart). (2) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. In thiscategory are denied license assessments, decontrol assessments, andevaluations of eligibility for expedited licensing (see Sec. 768.8 ofthis part). (d) Definitions.

Assessment criteria. Statutorily established criteria that must beassessed for the Secretary to make a determination with respect toforeign availability. They are, available-in-fact, from a non-U.S.source, in sufficient quantity so as to render the control ineffective,and of comparable quality. (See Sec. 768.6 of this part). Available-in-fact. An item is available-in-fact to a country if itis produced within the country or if it may be obtained by that countryfrom a third country. Ordinarily, items will not be consideredavailable-in-fact to non-controlled countries if the items areavailable only under a validated national security license or acomparable authorization from a country that maintains export controlson such items cooperatively with the United States. Claimant. Any party who makes a foreign availability submission,excluding TACs. Comparable quality. An item is of comparable quality to an itemcontrolled under the EAR if it possesses the characteristics specifiedin the Commerce Control List (CCL) for that item and is alike in keycharacteristics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; (2)technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) maintainabilityand service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant to the purposefor which the control was placed on the item. Controlled countries.

A foreign availability assessmentconducted as a result of a claimant's allegation of foreignavailability for an item (or items) that BXA has denied or has issued aletter of intent to deny a license. If the Secretary determines thatforeign availability exists, BXA's approval of a license will belimited to the items, countries, and quantities in the allegation. Determination. The Secretary's decision that foreign availabilitywithin the meaning of the EAA does or does not exist. (See Sec. 768.7of this part). Expedited licensing procedure eligibility evaluation. An evaluationthat BXA initiates for the purpose of determining whether an item iseligible for the expedited licensing procedure. (See Sec. 768.8 of thispart). Expedited licensing procedures. Under expedited licensingprocedures, BXA reviews and processes a license application for theexport of an eligible item to a non-controlled country within statutorytime limits. Licenses are deemed approved unless BXA denies within thestatutory time limits (See Sec. 768.8 of this part). Foreign availability submission (FAS). An allegation of foreignavailability a claimant makes, supported by reasonable evidence, andsubmits to BXA. (See Sec. 768.5 of this part). Item. Any commodity, software, or technology.

A Presidential decision tomaintain export controls on an item notwithstanding its foreignavailability as determined under the EAA. The President's decision isbased on his/her determination that the absence of the controls wouldprove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Oncethe President makes such a decision, the President must actively pursuenegotiations to eliminate foreign availability with the governments ofthe sources of foreign availability. (See Sec. 768.7 of this part). Non-controlled countries. Any country not defined as a controlledcountry by this section. Non-U.S. source/foreign source. A person located outside thejurisdiction of the United States (as defined in part 772 of the EAR). Reasonable evidence. Relevant information that is credible. Reliable evidence.

An item is of similar quality to an item that iscontrolled under the EAR if it is substantially alike in keycharacteristics that may include, but are not limited to: (1) Function;(2) technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4)maintainability and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevantto the purpose for which the control was placed on the item. Sufficient quantity. The amount of an item that would render theU.S. export control, or the denial of the license in question,ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, it isthe quantity that meets the military needs of that country so that U.S.exports of the item to that country would not make a significantcontribution to its military potential. Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). A Committee created undersection 5(h) of the EAA that advises and assists the Secretary ofCommerce, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department, agency,or official of the Government of the United States to which thePresident delegates authority under the EAA on export control mattersrelated to specific areas of controlled items. TAC certification. A statement that a TAC submits to BXA, supportedby reasonable evidence, documented as in a FAS, that foreignavailability to a controlled country exists for an item that fallswithin the TAC's area of technical expertise.Sec. 768.2 Foreign availability described. (a) Foreign availability. Foreign availability exists when theSecretary determines that an item is comparable in quality to an itemsubject to U.S. national security export controls, and is available-in-fact to a country, from a non-U.S. source, in sufficient quantities torender the U.S. export control of that item or the denial of a licenseineffective. For a controlled country, such control or denial is``ineffective'' when maintaining such control or denying a specificlicense would not restrict the availability of items that would make asignificant contribution to the military potential of the controlledcountry or combination of countries detrimental to the nationalsecurity of the United States (see sections 5(a) and 3(2)(A) of theEAA.) (b) Types of foreign availability. There are two types of foreignavailability: (1) Foreign availability to a controlled country; and (2) Foreign availability to a non-controlled country.(Note to paragraph (b) of this section: See Sec. 768.7 of this partfor delineation of the foreign availability assessment procedures,and Sec. 768.6 of this part for the criteria used in determiningforeign availability)Sec. 768.3 Foreign availability assessment. (a) Foreign availability assessment. A foreign availabilityassessment is an evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts to assess theforeign availability of a given item according to the assessmentcriteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered byBXA, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments ofDefense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TACcommittees, and industry. BXA uses the results of the analysis informulating its recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreignavailability exists for a given item. If the Secretary determines thatforeign availability exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item fornational security reasons or approve the license in question if thereis no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the Presidentexercises a National Security Override (see Sec. 768.7 of this part). (b) Types of assessments. There are two types of foreignavailability assessments: (1) Denied license assessment; and (2) Decontrol assessment. (c) Expedited licensing procedures. See Sec. 768.8 of this part forthe evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensingprocedures.Sec. 768.4 Initiation of an assessment. (a) Assessment request. To initiate an assessment, each claimant orTAC must submit a FAS or a TAC Certification to BXA. TACs areauthorized to certify foreign availability only to controlledcountries. Claimants can allege foreign availability for eithercontrolled or non-controlled countries. (b) Denied license assessment. A claimant whose license applicationBXA has denied, or for which it has issued a letter of intent to denyon national security grounds, may request that BXA initiate a deniedlicense assessment by submitting a Foreign Availability Submission(FAS) within 90 days after denial of the license. As part of itssubmission, the claimant must request that the specified licenseapplication be approved on the grounds of foreign availability. Theevidence must relate to the particular export as described on thelicense application and to the alleged comparable item. If foreignavailability is found, the Secretary will approve the license for thespecific items, countries, and quantities listed on the application.The denied license assessment procedure, however, is not intended toresult in the removal of the U.S. export control on an item byincrementally providing a country with amounts that, taken together,would constitute a sufficient quantity of an item. The Secretary willnot approve on foreign availability grounds a denied license if theapproval of such license would itself render the U.S. export controlineffective in achieving its purpose. In the case of a positivedetermination, the Secretary will determine whether a decontrolassessment is warranted. If so, then BXA will initiate a decontrolassessment. (c) Decontrol assessment. (1) Any claimant may at any time requestthat BXA initiate a decontrol assessment by a FAS to BXA allegingforeign availability to any country or countries. (2) A TAC may request that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment atany time by submitting a TAC Certification to BXA that there is foreignavailability to a controlled country for items that fall within thearea of the TAC's technical expertise. (3) The Secretary, on his/her own initiative, may initiate adecontrol assessment. (d) BXA mailing address. All foreign availability submissions andTAC certifications should be submitted to: Department of Commerce,Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,NW, Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.[[Page 12917]]Sec. 768.5 Contents of foreign availability submissions and TechnicalAdvisory Committee certifications. (a) All foreign availability submissions must contain, in additionto information on product or technology alleged to be available fromforeign sources, at least: (1) The name of the claimant; (2) The claimant's mailing and business address; (3) The claimant's telephone number; and (4) A contact point and telephone number. (b) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications shouldcontain as much evidence as is available to support the claim,including, but not limited to: (1) Product names and model designations of the items alleged to becomparable; (2) Extent to which the alleged comparable item is based on U.S.technology; (3) Names and locations of the non-U.S. sources and the basis forclaiming that the item is a non-U.S. source item; (4) Key performance elements, attributes, and characteristics ofthe items on which a qualitative comparison may be made; (5) Non-U.S. source's production quantities and/or sales of thealleged comparable items and marketing efforts; (6) Estimated market demand and the economic impact of the control; (7) Product names, model designations, and value of U.S. controlledparts and components incorporated in the items alleged to becomparable; and (8) The basis for the claim that the item is available-in-fact tothe country or countries for which foreign availability is alleged. (c) Supporting evidence of foreign availability may include, but isnot limited to, the following: (1) Foreign manufacturers' catalogs, brochures, operation ormaintenance manuals; (2) Articles from reputable trade and technical publications; (3) Photographs; (4) Depositions based on eyewitness accounts; and (5) Other credible evidence. Note to paragraph (c) of this section: See Supplement No. 1 topart 768 for additional examples of supporting evidence. (d) Upon receipt of a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will review itto determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the beliefthat foreign availability may exist. If BXA determines the FAS or TACcertification is lacking in supporting evidence, BXA will seekadditional evidence from appropriate sources, including the claimant orTAC. BXA will initiate the assessment when it determines that it hassufficient evidence that foreign availability may exist. Claimant andTAC certified assessments will be deemed to be initiated as of the dateof such determination. (e) Claimants and TACs are advised to review the foreignavailability assessment criteria described in Sec. 768.6 of this partand the examples of evidence described in Supplement No. 1 to part 768when assembling supporting evidence for inclusion in the FAS or TACcertification.Sec. 768.6 Criteria. BXA will evaluate the evidence contained in a FAS or TACcertification and all other evidence gathered in the assessment processin accordance with certain criteria that must be met before BXA canrecommend a positive determination to the Secretary. The criteria aredefined in Sec. 768.1(d) of this part. In order to initiate anassessment, each FAS and TAC certification should address each of thesecriteria. The criteria are statutorily prescribed and are: (a) Available-in-fact; (b) Non-U.S. source; (c) Sufficient quantity; and (d) Comparable quality.Sec. 768.7 Procedures. (a) Initiation of an assessment. (1) Once BXA accepts a FAS or TACcertification of foreign availability, BXA will notify the claimant orTAC that it is initiating the assessment. (2) BXA will publish a Federal Register notice of the initiation ofany assessment. (3) BXA will notify the Departments of Defense and State, theintelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and theircontractors that may have information concerning the item on which BXAhas initiated an assessment. Each such department, agency, andcontractor shall provide BXA all relevant information concerning theitem. BXA will invite interested departments and agencies toparticipate in the assessment process (See paragraph (e) of thissection). (b) Data gathering. BXA will seek and consider all availableinformation that bears upon the presence or absence of foreignavailability, including but not limited to that evidence described inSec. 768.5 (b) and (c) of this part. As soon as BXA initiates theassessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, includingan analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries,technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departmentsof Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularlysought from: industry sources worldwide; other U.S. organizations;foreign governments; commercial, academic and classified data bases;scientific and engineering research and development organizations; andinternational trade fairs. (c) Analysis. BXA will conduct its analysis by evaluating whetherthe reasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of theforeign availability criteria provides a sufficient basis to recommenda determination that foreign availability does or does not exist. (d) Recommendation and determination. (1) Upon completion of eachassessment, BXA, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that theSecretary make a determination either that there is or that there isnot foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. Theassessment upon which BXA bases its recommendation will accompany therecommendation to the Secretary. (2) BXA will recommend on the basis of its analysis that theSecretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country whenthe available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable qualityis available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, insufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing nationalsecurity export control, or denial of the license application inquestion on national security grounds, would be ineffective inachieving its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denialis ``ineffective'' when comparable items are available-in-fact fromforeign sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining suchcontrol or denying a license would not be effective in restricting theavailability of items that would make a significant contribution to themilitary potential of any country or combination of countriesdetrimental to the national security of the United States. (3) The Secretary will make the determination of foreignavailability on the basis of the BXA assessment and recommendation; theSecretary's determination will take into account the evidence providedto BXA, the recommendations of the Secretaries of Defense and State andany other interested agencies, and any other information that theSecretary considers relevant.[[Page 12918]] (4) For all decontrol and denied license assessments (under section5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a FAS, the Secretary will make adetermination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment andwill notify the claimant. The Secretary will submit positivedeterminations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies. (5) The deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated andTAC-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines forclaimant-initiated assessments (see paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) ofthis section). (e) Interagency review. BXA will notify all appropriate U.S.agencies and Departments upon the initiation of an assessment and willinvite their participation in the assessment process. BXA will provideall interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review sourcematerial, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon theirreceipt or production. For claimant-initiated assessments, BXA willprovide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments tointerested agencies and departments for their review following theSecretary's determination of foreign availability. For self-initiatedand TAC-initiated assessments, BXA will provide all interested agenciesan opportunity to review and comment on the assessment. (f) Notification. (1) No later than 5 months after the initiationof an assessment based on a FAS (claimant assessments), the Secretarywill inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication inthe Federal Register a notice that: (i) Foreign availability exists, and (A) The requirement of a license has been removed or the licenseapplication in question has been approved; or (B) The President has determined that for national securitypurposes the export controls must be maintained or the licenseapplication must be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, andthat appropriate steps to eliminate the foreign availability are beinginitiated; or (C) In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under theformer COCOM regime, the U.S. Government will conduct any necessaryconsultations concerning the proposed decontrol or approval of thelicense with the former COCOM regime for a period of up to 4 monthsfrom the date of the publication of the determination in the FederalRegister (the U.S. Government may remove the license requirement forexports to non-controlled countries pending completion of the formerCOCOM regime review process); or (ii) Foreign availability does not exist. (2) For all TAC certification assessments, the Secretary will makea foreign availability determination within 90 days followinginitiation of the assessment. BXA will prepare and submit a report tothe TAC and to the Congress stating that: (i) The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removedthe license requirement; or (ii) The Secretary has found foreign availability, but hasrecommended to the President that negotiations be undertaken toeliminate the foreign availability; or (iii) The Secretary has not found foreign availability. (3) There is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiatedby the Secretary or for the resulting determination. However, BXA willmake every effort to complete such assessments and determinationspromptly. (g) Foreign availability to controlled countries. When theSecretary determines that an item controlled for national securityreasons is available to a controlled country and the President does notissue a National Security Override (NSO), BXA will submit thedetermination to the Department of State, along with a draft proposalfor the multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former COCOMregime approval of the license. The Department of State will submit theproposal or the license for former COCOM regime review. The formerCOCOM regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal. (h) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. If theSecretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlledcountries exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for export toall non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, orapprove the license in question, unless the President exercises aNational Security Override. (i) Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. (1) ThePresident may determine that an export control must be maintainednotwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. Such adetermination is called a National Security Override (NSO) and is basedon the President's decision that the absence of the control would provedetrimental to the United States national security. Unless extended (asdescribed in paragraph (i)(7) of this section), an NSO is effective for6 months. Where the President invokes an NSO, the U.S. Government willactively pursue negotiations with the government of any source countryduring the 6 month period to eliminate the availability. (2) There are two types of National Security Overrides: (i) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resultingfrom an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(f) of the EAA(claimant and self-initiated assessments); and (ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resultingfrom an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-certification assessments). (3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that thePresident exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controlsor deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreignavailability. (4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that thePresident exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controlsnotwithstanding the finding of foreign availability. (5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated undersection 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and UrbanAffairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations ofthe House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of therequired negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of thenational security interest that necessitates the retention of controls. (6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated undersection 5(f) of the EAA, BXA will publish notices in the FederalRegister consisting of: (i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability; (ii) The President's decision to exercise the NSO; (iii) A concise statement of the basis for the President'sdecision; and (iv) An estimate of the economic impact of the decision. (7) The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up toan additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, thePresident certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing,and determines that the absence of the controls would continue to bedetrimental to the United States national security. (8) After the conclusion of negotiations, BXA will retain thecontrol only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. Ifforeign availability is not eliminated, BXA will decontrol the item byremoving the requirement for a license for the export of the item tothe destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that thenegotiations are successful and the[[Page 12919]]foreign availability is eliminated, BXA will remove the licenserequirement for the export of the item to any country that has agreedto eliminate foreign availability. (j) Changes in foreign availability. If BXA becomes aware ofconditions, including new evidence, that affect a previousdetermination that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BXAmay review the conditions. If BXA finds that the foreign availabilitypreviously determined no longer exists, or that foreign availabilitynot earlier found now does exist, BXA will make a recommendation to theSecretary of Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. TheSecretary of Commerce will make a determination, and BXA will publish aFederal Register notice of the determination.Sec. 768.8 Eligibility of expedited licensing procedures for non-controlled countries. (a) BXA determines the eligibility of an item for expeditedlicensing procedures on the basis of an evaluation of the foreignavailability of the item. Eligibility is specific to the items and thecountries to which they are found to be available. (b) BXA will initiate an eligibility evaluation: (1) On its own initiative; (2) On receipt of a FAS; or (3) On receipt of a TAC certification. (c) Upon initiation of an eligibility evaluation following receiptof either a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will notify the claimant orTAC of the receipt and initiation of an evaluation and publish aFederal Register notice of the initiation of the evaluation. (d) The criteria for determining eligibility for expeditedlicensing procedures are: (1) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-controlled country from a foreign source; (2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S.-controlled item; and (3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-controlled country without effective restrictions. (e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretaryof Commerce will make a determination of foreign availability on thebasis of the BXA evaluation and recommendation, taking intoconsideration the evidence the Secretaries of Defense, State, and otherinterested agencies provide to BXA and any other information that theSecretary considers relevant. (f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the FAS or TAC certification,BXA will publish the Secretary's determination in the Federal Register,that the item will or will not be eligible for expedited licensingprocedures to the stated countries and, where appropriate, amendSupplement No. 2 to part 768. (g) Following completion of a self-initiated evaluation, BXA willbe notified of the Secretary's determination and, where appropriate,Supplement No. 2 to part 768 will be amended. (h) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications toinitiate an expedited licensing procedure evaluation must be clearlydesignated on their face as a request for expedited licensing procedureand must specify the items, quantities and countries alleged eligible.Submissions and certifications should be sent to: Department ofCommerce, Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.Sec. 768.9 Appeals of negative foreign availability determinations. Appeals of negative determinations will be conducted according tothe standards and procedures described in part 756 of the EAR. APresidential decision (NSO) to deny a license or continue controlsnotwithstanding a determination of foreign availability is not subjectto appeal.Sec. 768.10 Removal of controls on less sophisticated items. Where the Secretary has removed national security controls on anitem for foreign availability reasons, the Secretary will also removecontrols on similar items that are controlled for national securityreasons and whose functions, technological approach, performancethresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for nationalsecurity export controls do not exceed the technical parameters of theitem that BXA has decontrolled for foreign availability reasons.Supplement No. 1 to Part 768--Evidence of Foreign Availability This Supplement provides a list of examples of evidence that theBureau of Export Administration (BXA) has found to be useful inconducting assessments of foreign availability. A claimant submittingevidence supporting a claim of foreign availability should review thislist for suggestions as evidence is collected. Acceptable evidenceindicating possible foreign availability is not limited to theseexamples, nor is any one of these examples, usually, in and of itself,necessarily sufficient to meet a foreign availability criterion. Acombination of several types of evidence for each criterion usually isrequired. A Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) should include asmuch evidence as possible on all four of the criteria listed below. BXAcombines the submitted evidence with the evidence that it collects fromother sources. BXA evaluates all evidence, taking into account factorsthat may include, but are not limited to: Information concerning thesource of the evidence, corroborative or contradictory indications, andexperience concerning the reliability or reasonableness of suchevidence. BXA will assess all relevant evidence to determine whethereach of the four criteria has been met. Where possible, all informationshould be in writing. If information is based on third partydocumentation, the submitter should provide such documentation to BXA.If information is based on oral statements a third party made, thesubmitter should provide a memorandum of the conversation to BXA if thesubmitter cannot obtain a written memorandum from the source. BXA willamend this informational list as it identifies new examples ofevidence. (a) Examples of evidence of foreign availability: The following are intended as examples of evidence that BXA willconsider in evaluating foreign availability. BXA will evaluate allevidence according to the provisions in Sec. 768.7(c) of this part inorder for it to be used in support of a foreign availabilitydetermination. This list is illustrative only.

Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60FR 42767, August 17, 1995).Sec. 770.1 Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFRchapter VII, subchapter C. This part provides commodity, technology,and software interpretations. These interpretations clarify the scopeof controls where such scope is not readily apparent from the CommerceControl List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) andother provisions of the Export Administration Regulations.Sec. 770.2 Commodity interpretations. (a) Interpretation 1: Anti-friction bearing or bearing systems andspecially designed parts. (1) Anti-friction bearings or bearing systemsshipped as spares or replacements are classified under Export ControlClassification Numbers (ECCNs) 2A001, 2A002, 2A003, 2A004, 2A005, and2A006 (ball, roller, or needle-roller bearings and parts). This appliesto separate shipments of anti-friction bearings or bearing systems andanti-friction bearings or bearing systems shipped with machinery orequipment for which they are intended to be used as spares orreplacement parts. (2) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system physicallyincorporated in a segment of a machine or in a complete machine priorto shipment loses its identity as a bearing. In this scenario, themachine or segment of machinery containing the bearing is the itemsubject to export control requirements. (3) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system not incorporated ina segment of a machine prior to shipment, but shipped as a component ofa complete unassembled (knocked-down) machine, is considered acomponent of a machine. In this scenario, the complete machine is theitem subject to export license requirements. (b) Interpretation 2: Classification of ``parts'' of machinery,equipment, or other items. (1) An assembled machine or unit ofequipment is being exported. In instances where one or more assembledmachines or units of equipment are being exported, the individualcomponent parts that are physically incorporated into the machine orequipment do not require a license. The license or general exceptionunder which the complete machine or unit of equipment is exported willalso cover its component parts, provided that the parts are normal andusual components of the machine or equipment being exported, or thatthe physical incorporation is not used as a device to evade therequirement for a license. (2) Parts are exported as spares, replacements, for resale, or forstock. In instances where parts are exported as spares, replacements,for resale, or for stock, a license is required only if the appropriateentry for the part specifies that a license is required for theintended destination. (c) Interpretation 3: Wire or cable cut to length. (1) Wire orcable may be included as a component of a system or piece of equipment,whether or not the[[Page 12921]]wire or cable is cut to length and whether or not it is fitted withconnectors at one or both ends, so long as it is in normal quantitynecessary to make the original installation of the equipment and isnecessary to its operation. (2) Wire or cable exported as replacement or spares, or for furthermanufacture is controlled under the applicable wire or cable ECCN only.This includes wire or cable, whether or not cut to length or fittedwith connectors at one or both ends. (d) Interpretation 4: Telecommunications equipment and systems.Control equipment for paging systems (broadcast radio or selectivelysignalled receiving systems) is defined as circuit switching equipmentin Category 5 of the CCL. (e) Interpretation 5: Numerical control systems. (1) Classificationof ``Numerical Control'' Units. ``Numerical control'' units for machinetools, regardless of their configurations or architectures, arecontrolled by their functional characteristics as described in ECCN2B001.a. ``Numerical control'' units include computers with add-on``motion control boards''. A computer with add-on ``motion controlboards'' for machine tools may be controlled under ECCN 2B001.a evenwhen the computer alone without ``motion control boards'' is notsubject to licensing requirements under Category 4 and the ``motioncontrol boards'' are not controlled under ECCN 2B001.b. (2) Export documentation requirement. (i) When preparing a licenseapplication for a numerical control system, the machine tool and thecontrol unit are classified separately. If either the machine tool orthe control unit requires a license, then the entire unit requires alicense. If either a machine tool or a control unit is exportedseparately from the system, the exported component is classified on thelicense application without regard to the other parts of a possiblesystem. (ii) When preparing the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), asystem being shipped complete (i.e., machine and control unit), shouldbe reported under the Schedule B number for each machine. When either acontrol unit or a machine is shipped separately, it should be reportedunder the Schedule B number appropriate for the individual item beingexported. (f) Interpretation 6: Parts, accessories, and equipment exported asscrap. Parts, accessories, or equipment that are being shipped as scrapshould be described on the SED in sufficient detail to be identifiedunder the proper ECCN. When commodities declared as parts, accessories,or equipment are shipped in bulk, or are otherwise not packaged,packed, or sorted in accordance with normal trade practices, theCustoms Officer may require evidence that the shipment is not scrap.Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bills of sale, ordersand correspondence indicating whether the commodities are scrap or arebeing exported for use as parts, accessories, or equipment. (g) Interpretation 7: Scrap arms, ammunition, and implements ofwar. Arms, ammunition, and implements of war, as defined in the U.S.Munitions List, and are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Departmentof State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), except for the following,which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce: (1) Cartridge and shell cases that have been rendered uselessbeyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity bymeans of excessive heating, flame treatment, mangling, crushing,cutting, or by any other method are ``scrap''. (2) Cartridge and shell cases that have been sold by the armedservices as ``scrap'', whether or not they have been heated, flame-treated, mangled, crushed, cut, or reduced to scrap by any othermethod. (3) Other commodities that may have been on the U.S. Munitions Listare ``scrap'', and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Departmentof Commerce, if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibilityof restoration to their original identify only by means of mangling,crushing, or cutting. When in doubt as to whether a commodity coveredby the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters shouldconsult the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State,Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office ofExporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington,DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap. (h) Interpretation 8: Military automotive vehicles and parts forsuch vehicles. (1) Military automotive vehicles. (i) For purposes ofU.S. export controls, military automotive vehicles ``possessing orbuilt to current military specifications differing materially fromnormal commercial specifications'' may include, but are not limited to,the following characteristics: (A) Special fittings for mounting ordnance or military equipment; (B) Bullet-proof glass; (C) Armor plate; (D) Fungus preventive treatment; (E) Twenty-four volt electrical systems; (F) Shielded electrical system (electronic emission suppression);or (G) Puncture-proof or run-flat tires. (ii) Automotive vehicles fall into two categories. (A) Military automotive vehicles on the Munitions List, new andused. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily combat(fighting) vehicles, with or without armor and/or armament, ``designedfor specific fighting function.'' These automotive vehicles arelicensed for export by the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120through 130). (B) Military automotive vehicles not on the U.S. Munitions List,new and used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarilytransport vehicles designed for non-combat military purposes(transporting cargo, personnel and/or equipment, and/or for to wingother vehicles and equipment over land and roads in close support offighting vehicles and troops). These automotive vehicles are licensedfor export by the U.S. Department of Commerce. (iii) Parts for military automotive vehicles. Functional parts aredefined as those parts making up the power train of the vehicles,including the electrical system, the cooling system, the fuel system,and the control system (brake and steering mechanism), the front andrear axle assemblies including the wheels, the chassis frame, springsand shock absorbers. Parts specifically designed for militaryautomotive vehicles on the Munitions List are licensed for export bythe U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130). (iv) General instructions. Manufacturers of non-Munitions Listautomotive vehicles and/or parts will know whether their products meetthe conditions described in this paragraph (h). Merchant exporters andother parties who are not sure whether their products (automotivevehicles and/or parts) meet these conditions should check with theirsuppliers for the required information before making a shipment undergeneral exception or submitting an application to BXA for a license. (2) [Reserved] (i) Interpretation 9: Aircraft, parts, accessories and components.Aircraft, parts, accessories, and components defined in Categories VIIIand IX of the Munitions List are under the export licensing authorityof the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130). Allother aircraft, and parts, accessories and components therefor, areunder the export licensing[[Page 12922]]authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The following aircraft,parts, accessories and components are under the licensing authority ofthe U.S. Department of Commerce: (1) Any aircraft (except an aircraft that has been demilitarized,but including aircraft specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section)that conforms to a Federal Aviation Agency type certificate in thenormal, utility, acrobatic, transport, or restricted category, providedsuch aircraft has not been equipped with or modified to includemilitary equipment, such as gun mounts, turrets, rocket launchers, orsimilar equipment designed for military combat or military trainingpurposes. (2) Only the following military aircraft, demilitarized (aircraftnot specifically equipped, reequipped, or modified for militaryoperations): (i) Cargo, bearing designations ``C-45 through C-118 inclusive,''and ``C-121''; (ii) Trainers, bearing a ``T'' designation and using pistonengines; (iii) Utility, bearing a ``U'' designation and using pistonengines; (iv) Liaison, bearing an ``L'' designation; and (v) Observation, bearing an ``O'' designation and using pistonengines.

770.3 Interpretations related to exports of technology andsoftware to destinations in Country Group D:1. (a) Introduction. This section is intended to provide youadditional guidance on how to determine whether your technology orsoftware would be eligible for a License Exception, may be exportedunder NLR, or require a license, for export to Country Group D:1. (b) Scope of licenses. The export of technology and software undera license is authorized only to the extent specifically indicated onthe face of the license. The only technology and software related toequipment exports that may be exported without a license is technologydescribed in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR; operatingtechnology and software described in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR; salestechnology described in Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR; and software updatesdescribed in Sec. 740.8(c) of the EAR. (c) Commingled technology and software. (1) U.S.-origin technologydoes not lose its U.S.-origin when it is redrawn, used, consulted, orotherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other technology of anyother origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar technical dataprepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation,or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which isbased on or utilizes any U.S.-origin technology, is subject to the EARis the same manner as the original U.S.-origin technology, includinglicense requirements, unless the commingled technology is not subjectto the EAR by reason of the de minimis exclusions described atSec. 732.4 of the EAR. (2) U.S.-origin software that is incorporated into or commingledwith foreign-origin software does not lose its U.S.-origin. Suchcommingled software is subject to the EAR is the same manner as theoriginal U.S.-origin software, including license requirements, unlessthe commingled software is not subject to the EAR by reason of the deminimis exclusions described at Sec. 732.4 of the EAR. (d) Certain License Exception. The following questions and answersare intended to further clarify the scope of technology and softwareeligible for a License Exception. (1)(i) Question 1. (A) Our engineers, in installing or repairingequipment, use techniques (experience as well as proprietary knowledgeof the internal componentry or specifications of the equipment) thatexceed what is provided in the standard manuals or instructions(including training) given to the customer. In some cases, it is also acondition of the license that such information provided to the customerbe constrained to the minimum necessary for normal installation,maintenance and operation situations. (B) Can we send an engineer (with knowledge and experience) to thecustomer site to perform the installation or repair, under theprovisions of License Exception for operating technology and software(OTS) described in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR, if it is understood thathe is restricted by our normal business practices to performing thework without imparting the knowledge or technology to the customerpersonnel? (ii) Answer 1. Export of technology includes release of U.S.-origindata in a foreign country, and ``release'' includes ``application tosituations abroad of personal knowledge or technical experienceacquired in the United States.'' As the release of technology in thecircumstances described here would exceed that permitted under theLicense Exception for operating technology and software described inSec. 740.8(a) of the EAR, a license would be required even though thetechnician could apply the data without disclosing it to the customer. (2)(i) Question 2. We plan, according to our normal businesspractices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that wehave exported under a license, License Exception, or NLR. The trainingis contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to takeplace in part in the customer's facility and in part in the U.S. Can wenow proceed with this training at both locations under a LicenseException? (ii) Answer 2. (A) Provided that this is your normal training, andinvolves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructionsfor the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of LicenseException for operating technology and software (OTS) described inSec. 740.8(a), the training may be provided within the limits of thatLicense Exception. The location of the training is not significant, asthe export occurs at the time and place of the actual transfer orimparting of the technology to the customer's engineers. (B) Any training beyond that covered under the provisions ofLicense Exception for operating technology and software (OTS) describedin Sec. 740.8(a), but specifically represented in your licenseapplication as required for this customer installation, and in factauthorized on the face of the license or a separate technology license,may not be undertaken while the license is suspended or revoked.Sec. 770.4 Interpretations related to chemical mixtures--de minimisexceptions examples. (a)(1) Introduction: The following are examples for applying the deminimis exceptions for chemical mixtures containing precursor andintermediate chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350. (2) In ECCN 1C350, Note 2, paragraphs (c) and (d) within theMixtures Exemptions state that a validated license is required when atleast one of the listed chemicals constitutes more than 10% or 25%,respectively, of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis. (b)(1) Example One. A mixture contains the following components: (i) 90% polymer polyol (a liquid raw material used to makepolyurethane polymers); and (ii) 10% Australia Group (AG)-controlled chemical eligible for 25%de minimis exemption. Note to paragraph (b) of this section: The polymer does notdissolve the AG-controlled chemical. (2) In this example, the polymer polyol does not dissolve the AG-controlled chemical (the only other component of the mixture).Therefore, the polyol is NOT considered a solvent, and theconcentration of the polymer polyol is included in the concentrationcalculation. As a result, the AG-controlled chemical's concentration is10% when calculated on a solvent-free basis (.10/1.00). Accordingly,this concentration is below the threshold concentration of 25%applicable to specific AG-controlled chemicals under the chemicalmixtures rule and can be exported under NLR to all destinations exceptIran, Sudan, Syria, and Country Group E:2 in Supplement No. 1 to part740 of the EAR. (3) To determine the classification of this mixture, it isnecessary to determine whether the polymer is capable of functioning asa solvent for the other components of the mixture. If the polymerpolyol is capable of functioning as a solvent for the controlled AGchemical, then the polymer component is omitted from the concentrationcalculation. If the polymer polyol is not capable of functioning as asolvent for the AG chemical, then the polymer component is included inthe concentration calculation.[[Page 12925]] (c)(1) Example Two: An automotive coolant (antifreeze) is a mixtureof the following components: (i) 75% ethylene glycol; (ii) 10% additive package; and (iii) 15% water. Note to paragraph (c) of this section: The ``additive package''contains an AG-controlled chemical that is eligible for the 10% deminimis exemption. This chemical is added as a stabilizer andrepresents 9% of the total mixture. The remaining components of theadditive package are various dyes and stabilizers that represent 1%of the total mixture. Ethylene glycol serves as the basic functionalingredient that prevents the engine block from freezing, and doesnot dissolve the other components of the mixture. The water is addedto keep the mixture in solution. (2) To determine if this mixture requires a license it is necessaryto calculate the concentration of the AG-controlled chemical on asolvent-free basis. Since the water dissolves all of the othercomponents of the mixture, water is considered a ``solvent'' and thequantity of water present is not included in the calculation of the AG-chemical concentration. Consequently, the concentration of the AGchemical is approximately 11% (.09/.85), and the mixture is classifiedunder ECCN 1C350. Accordingly, since this concentration is above thethreshold concentration of 10% applicable to this category of AG-controlled chemical under the chemical mixtures rule, a license isrequired to all destinations except AG member countries. (d)(1) Example Three. A pesticide formulation consists of an AG-controlled chemical that is eligible for the 25% de minimis exemption,and an active ingredient that is not AG-controlled. The formulation isdiluted with water to allow safe, effective, and economic application.The resulting mixture is 15% AG chemical, 40% active ingredient and 45%water. Although the water is added as a diluent, it dissolves the othercomponents of the mixture. (2) Since the water dissolves all components in the mixture, it isconsidered a solvent even though it was added as a diluent. The percentconcentration of the AG-controlled chemical calculated on a solventfree basis is .15/.55 = 27%, and the mixture is therefore classifiedunder ECCN 1C350. Accordingly, since this concentration is above thethreshold concentration of 25% applicable to this category of AG-controlled chemicals under the chemical mixtures rule, a license isrequired to all destinations except AG member countries. (e)(1) Example Four. A mixture contains the following components: (i) 10% water; (ii) 22% Chemical A; (iii) 21% Chemical B; (iv) 20% Chemical C; (v) 19% Chemical D; and (vi) 8% Chemical E. Note to paragraph (e) of this section: The water is added todissolve the other components of the mixture. Chemicals A, B, C, andD are AG-controlled chemicals each eligible for 25% de minimisexemption. Chemical E is an AG-controlled chemical eligible for 10%de minimis exemption. (2) In this example, water is considered a solvent since itdissolves all components in the mixture. Therefore, the quantity ofwater present in the mixture is not included in calculating theconcentrations of the controlled chemicals on a solvent-free basis. Theconcentrations of the controlled chemicals are as follows: Chemical A24%; Chemical B 23%; Chemical C 22%; Chemical D 21%; Chemical E 9%. Itis important to note that in this example, even though the cumulativeamount of the mixture (90%) consists of controlled chemicals, each oneof the controlled chemicals is below the de minimis level for itscategory. Consequently, this mixture can be exported under NLR to alldestinations except Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Country Group E:2 inSupplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.PART 772--DEFINITIONS OF TERMS Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;E.O. 12924, 59 FR 43437, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August15, 1995 (60 FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

In calculating the percentage ofan AG controlled chemical in a mixture (solution), any otherchemical must be excluded if it was not added for usual commercialpurposes, but was added for the sole purpose of circumventing theExport Administration Regulations. 2. ``Solvent Free Basis Requirement.'' When calculating thepercentage, by weight, of components in a chemical mixture, you mustexclude from the calculation any component of the mixture that actsas a solvent. 3. Solvent--For purposes of this ECCN ``A substance capable ofdissolving another substance to form a uniformly dispersed mixture(solution)''. Solvents are liquids at standard temperature andpressure (STP). In no instance is an AG controlled chemical considereda ``solvent''. All ingredients of mixtures are expressed in terms ofweight. The solvent component of the mixture converts it into asolution. 3. Compounds: A license is not required under this entry forchemical compounds created with any chemicals identified in thisECCN 1C350, unless those compounds are also identified in thisentry. 4. Special Comprehensive License: See part 752 of the EAR foreligibility. Technical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a ``mixture'' isdefined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or morecomponents that do not react together under normal storageconditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride(Item 25 in List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous,and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. All de minimis exclusions of this entry extend to allmixtures including those that contain no solvents. 4. A Solvent is defined as a substance capable of dissolvinganother substance to form a uniformly dispersed mixture (solution).For examples and clarification of the term ``solvent free'' basis,see Supplement No. 3 to part 774 of the EAR.License Exceptions LVS: N/A GBS: N/A CIV: N/AList of Items Controlled Unit: Liters or kilograms, as appropriate Related Controls: N/A Related Definition: See part 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonymsfor the chemicals listed in this entry.

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating orsurface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy,composite, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heatedsubstrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in thevicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desiredelemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy forthis decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided bythe heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or ``laser''irradiation. Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flowout-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermaldecomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVDprocesses. Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack processare produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as thepack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated isnot in contact with the powder mixture. b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is anoverlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure lessthan 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporizethe coating material. This process results in the condensation, ordeposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positionedsubstrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during thecoating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinarymodification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, orplasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also acommon modification in this technique. The use of monitors toprovide in-process measurement of optical characteristics andthickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. SpecificTE-PVD processes are as follows: 1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporatethe material which forms the coating; 2. Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heatingsources capable of producing a controlled and uniform flux ofevaporated coating species; 3. ``Laser'' Evaporation uses either pulsed or continuous wave``laser'' beams to heat the material which forms the coating; 4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of thematerial which forms the coating and has an arc dischargeestablished on the surface by a momentary contact of a groundtrigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surfacecreating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a coneattached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, orthe chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sightdeposition. Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arcdeposition with non-biased substrates. c. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVDprocess in which a plasma[[Page 12974]]or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, anda negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitatethe extraction of the species to be deposited from the plasma. Theintroduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within theprocess chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-processmeasurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatingsare ordinary modifications of the process. d. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlaycoating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture(a pack), that consists of: 1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usuallyaluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); 2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and 3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate andpowder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated tobetween 1,030 K (757 deg. C) to 1,375 K (1,102 deg. C) forsufficient time to deposit the coating. e. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun(spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder orwire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards asubstrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasmaspraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or highvelocity plasma spraying carried out underwater. Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmosphericpressure. Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocityexceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 deg. C) at 0.1 MPa. f. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating oroverlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with anorganic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to asubstrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air oroven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. g. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on amomentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are acceleratedby an electric field towards the surface of a target (coatingmaterial). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient tocause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on anappropriately positioned substrate. Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactivesputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coatingand rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputterdeposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coatingmaterials. Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used toactivate the deposition. h. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process inwhich the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through apotential gradient and implanted into the surface region of thesubstrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation isperformed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapordeposition or sputter deposition.Accompanying Technical Information to Table on Deposition Techniques 1. ``Technology'' for pretreatments of the substrates listed inthe Table, as follows: a.

Information on How to Calculate ``Composite TheoreticalPerformance'' (``CTP''): Technical Note: ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (CTP).Abbreviations Used in This Technical NoteCE ``computing element'' (typically an arithmetic logical unit)FP floating pointXP fixed pointt execution timeXOR exclusive ORCPU central processing unitTP theoretical performance (of a single CE)CTP ``composite theoretical performance'' (multiple CEs)R effective calculating rateWL word lengthL word length adjustment* multiply Execution time `t' is expressed in microseconds, TP and ``CTP''are expressed in Mtops (millions of theoretical operations persecond) and WL is expressed in bits.Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method ``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given inmillions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops). Incalculating the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') ofan aggregation of ``Computing Elements'' (``CEs''), the followingthree steps are required: 1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for each``computing element'' (``CE''); 2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effectivecalculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP)for each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''),combine the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting in a``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation.Details for these steps are given in the following section. Note 1: For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements''(``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, thecalculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps:first, aggregate the group of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'')sharing memory, second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using thecalculation method for multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') notsharing memory. Note 2: ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited toinput/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive,communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated intothe ``CTP'' calculation. The following table shows the method of calculating the``Effective Calculating Rate'' (R) for each ``Computing Element''(``CE''): Step 1: The effective calculating rate R. For Computing Elements(CEs) Implementing: Effective calculating Rate, R Note: Every ``CE'' must be evaluated independently[[Page 12993]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.014 If no add is implemented use: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.015 If neither add nor multiply is implemented use the fastestavailable arithmetic operation as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.016 See Notes X and Y. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.017 See Notes X and Y. Both FP and XP (R). Calculate both Rxp, Rfp. For simple logic processors not implementing any of thespecified arithmetic operations.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.018 Where tlog is the execute time of the XOR, or for logichardware not implementing the XOR, the fastest simple logicoperation. See Notes X and Z. For special logic processors not using any of the specifiedarithmetic or logic operations. R = Rt x WL/64 Where R is the number of results per second, WL is the number ofbits upon which the logic operation occurs, and 64 is a factor tonormalize to a 64 bit operation. Note W: For a pipelined ``CE'' capable of executing up to onearithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipelineis full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effectivecalculating rate (R) for such a ``CE'' is the faster of thepipelined rate or non-pipelined execution rate. Note X: For a ``CE'' that performs multiple operations of aspecific type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle ortwo identical logic operations per cycle), the execution time t isgiven by:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.019 ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that perform different types ofarithmetic or logic operations in a single machine cycle are to betreated as multiple separate ``computing elements'' (``CEs'')performing simultaneously (e.g., a ``CE'' performing an addition anda multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two ``CEs'', thefirst performing an addition in one cycle and the second performinga multiplication in one cycle). If a single ``Computing element'' (``CE'') has both scalarfunction and vector function, use the shorter execution time value. Note Y: For the ``CE'' that does not implement FP add or FPmultiply, but that performs FP divide:[[Page 12994]][GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.020 If the ``CE'' implements FP reciprocal, but not FP add, FPmultiply or FP divide, then:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.021 If the divide is not implemented, the fp reciprocal should beused. If none of the specified instructions is implemented, theeffective floating point (FP) rate is 0. Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instructionperforms a single logic manipulation of no more than two operands ofgiven lengths. In complex logic operations, a single instructionperforms multiple logic manipulations to produce one or more resultsfrom two or more operands. Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengthsconsidering both pipelined operations (if supported), and non-pipelined operations, using the fastest executing instruction foreach operand length based on: 1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Excludeextraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on apredetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0or 1). If no register-to-register operations are implemented,continue with (2). 2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-registeroperations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3). 3. Memory-to-memory. In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified bythe manufacturer. Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL: Adjust the effective rate R (or Rt) by the word lengthadjustment L as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.022 Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is theoperand length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of differentlengths, select the largest word length.) The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of afloating point processor or unit is considered to be one ``computingElement'' (``CE'') with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number ofbits in the data representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes ofthe ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') calculations. This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processorsthat do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP = R. Select the maximum resulting value of TP for: Each XP-only ``CE'' (Rxp); Each FP-only ``CE'' (Rfp); Each combined FP and XP ``CE'' (R); Each simple logic processor not implementing any of thespecified arithmetic operations; and Each special logic processor not using any of the specifiedarithmetic or logic operations. Step 3: ``CTP'' for aggregations of ``CEs'', including CPU's: For a CPU with a single ``CE'', ``CTP'' = TP (for CEs performingboth fixed and floating point operations, TP = max (TPfp,TPxp)). ``CTP'' for aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' operatingsimultaneously is calculated as follows: Note 1: For aggregations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' torun simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs'' thatprovides the largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of eachcontributing ``CE'' is to be calculated at its maximum valuetheoretically possible before the ``CTP'' of the combination isderived. N.B.: To determine the possible combinations of simultaneouslyoperating ``CEs'', generate an instruction sequence that initiatesoperations in multiple ``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE''(the one needing the largest number of cycles to complete itsoperation) and ending with the fastest ``CE''. At each cycle of thesequence, the combination of ``CEs'' that are in operation duringthat cycle is a possible combination. The instruction sequence musttake into account all hardware and/or architectural constraints onoverlapping operations. Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly maycontain multiple ``CEs''. Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when thecomputer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneousoperation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer. Note 4: ``CTP'' values are not to be aggregated for ``CE''-combinations (inter)connected by ``Local Area Networks'', Wide AreaNetworks, Input/Output shared connections/devices, I/O controllersand any communication interconnection implemented by ``software''. Note 5: ``CTP'' values must be aggregated for multiple ``CEs''specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operatingsimultaneously and sharing memory,-- or multiple memory/``CE''--combinations operating simultaneously utilizing specially designedhardware. This aggregation does not apply to ``electronicassemblies'' controlled by 4A003.c. ``CTP'' = TP1 + C2 * TP2 + . . . + Cn *TPn, where the TPs are ordered by value, with TP1, beingthe highest, TP2 being the second highest, . . . and TPnbeing the lowest. Ci is a coefficient determined by thestrength of the interconnection between ``CEs'', as follows: For multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously and sharingmemory:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.023 Note 1: When the ``CTP'' calculated by the above method does notexceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculateCi:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.024 where m = the number of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' sharingaccess. Provided: 1. The TPi of each ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' does notexceed 30 Mtops; 2. The ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' share access to main memory(excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and 3. Only one ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' can have use of thechannel at any given time. N.B.: This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3. Note 2: ``CEs'' share memory if they access a common segment ofsolid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, mainmemory, or other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such asdisk drives, tape drives, or RAM disks are not included. For multiple ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' not sharing memory,interconnected by one or more data channels:Ci=0.75*ki (i=2, . . ., 32) (see NOTE on ki factor)=0.60*ki (i=33, . . ., 64)=0.45*ki (i=65, . . ., 256)=0.30*ki (i>256) The value of Ci is based on the number of ``CEs'', not thenumber of nodes.where ki=min (Si/Kr, 1), and Kr=normalizing factor of 20 MByte/s. Si=sum of the maximum data rates (in units of MBytes/s) forall data channels connected to the ith ``CE'' or group of``CEs'' sharing memory. When calculating a Ci for a group of ``CEs'', the number ofthe first ``CE'' in a group determines the proper limit for Ci.For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 ``CEs''each, the 22nd group will contain ``CE''64, ``CE''65 and``CE''66 . The proper limit for Ci for this group is 0.60. Aggregation (of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'') should be from thefastest-to-slowest; i.e.:[[Page 12995]] TP1TP2TP3; and in the caseof TPi=TPi+1, from the largest to smallest, i.e.: CiCi+1 Note: The ki factor is not to be applied to ``CEs'' to 2 to12 if the TP i / of the ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' is more than 50Mtops; i.e., Ci for ``CEs'' 2 to 12 is 0.75.Category 5--Telecommunications and Information Security Notice: Category 5 entries are divided into two sections.
