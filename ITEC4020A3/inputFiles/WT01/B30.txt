Although the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has reporteda drop in casual drug use, no indication exists that progress has beenmade on the second front of the drug war--the fight against hard-coredrug use.  ONDCP, if reauthorized, must do a better job of assessingprogress being made under the national drug control strategies.  Also,ONDCP and the federal drug control agencies need to cooperate more todevelop, assess, and coordinate national drug control policy.  Inparticular, ONDCP and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)have had major disagreements over the collection of drug data, and ONDCPhas threatened to withhold clearance of drug surveys to obtain HHScompliance with ONDCP requests--a move that GAO considers inappropriate.The three-tiered budget review and certification process envisioned bythe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 has proven impractical.  Because ofstaff constraints and other factors, ONDCP has limited its reviewsmainly to agency budgets and has only selectively certifiedprogram-level budgets.  The Pentagon submits its drug budget to ONDCPbut does not provide a breakdown of separate "agency" drug budgets,making budget comparisons among agencies difficult.  Because of thecontinuing need for a central planning agency to lead and coordinate thenation's drug control efforts, GAO concludes that ONDCP should bereauthorized.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  T-GGD-94-7     TITLE:  Drug Control: Reauthorization of the Office of National              Drug Control Policy      DATE:  10/05/93   SUBJECT:  Drug abuse             National policies             Interagency relations             Law enforcement             Drug trafficking             Narcotics             Budget administration             Intelligence gathering operations             Controlled substances             Data collection operationsIDENTIFIER:  National Drug Control Strategy             ------------------------------------------------------------------------We regret that electronic text of GAO Testimony is not available at this time.

ThurmanRanking Minority MemberSubcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and Criminal JusticeCommittee on Government Reform and OversightHouse of RepresentativesThe Honorable Gary A.  ConditHouse of RepresentativesU.S.  Attorneys litigate for the government in criminal and civilproceedings.  They prosecute individuals charged with violations offederal criminal law.  They also represent the government in civilcases and collect money and property owed to the government.  Bystatute, U.S.  Attorneys are under substantial supervisory control ofthe Attorney General.  For example, the Attorney General isauthorized to supervise all litigation involving the United Statesand to direct all U.S.  Attorneys and their assistant U.S.  Attorneysin the discharge of their duties.\1The Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys (EOUSA), located in theDepartment of Justice, provides assistance and coordination servicesfor 93 U.S.  Attorneys.  In practice, the U.S.  Attorneys exercise alarge degree of independence and discretion in the handling of theircases.  This independence and discretion stem from several factors,including historic precedent, the appointment process for U.S. Attorneys, and their ties to the districts they serve. In view of the independence and discretion exercised by U.S. Attorneys in determining which cases to prosecute and recent growthin the size and cost of their operations, the Chairman of the formerSubcommittee on Information, Justice, Transportation and Agriculture,House Committee on Government Operations, asked us to review severalissues relating to U.S.  Attorney priorities.  Specifically, he asked(1) how the Justice Department communicates national priorities tothe U.S.  Attorneys, (2) how selected U.S.  Attorneys establish theirpriorities and coordinate them with law enforcement agencies in theirdistricts, and (3) what, if any, measures Justice uses to assess U.S. Attorneys' effectiveness in meeting national priorities. During the course of this review, Congress enacted the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA).\2 The law requires thatJustice and all federal agencies will set goals, measure performance,and report results.  We considered Justice's processes for settingpriorities and measuring results in the context of the GPRA'srequirements, which are to be phased in over the period of 1997 to2000. --------------------\1 28 U.S.C.  519. \2 Public Law 103-62.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Justice did not have a specific process for communicating nationallaw enforcement priorities over the past 10 years.  Nationalpriorities were communicated to U.S.  Attorneys through a variety offormal and informal channels, such as Attorney General speeches,press conferences, testimony before Congress, budget memorandums, andin discussions at seminars and conferences.  Often, priorities werebroadly stated, covering a wide range of crime types.  An EOUSAofficial said that national priorities had been so broad and wideranging that almost every major crime type could be classified as apriority. Although Justice continued to communicate priorities to U.S. Attorneys through a variety of channels in 1994, it moved towardsetting more focused law enforcement priorities.  The AttorneyGeneral expressed commitment to principles of strategic managementand clear articulation of priorities, goals, and missions for U.S. Attorneys.  She ranked violent crime and health-care fraud as thenation's number one and two law enforcement priorities, respectively,and took specific steps to implement these priorities. Justice did not require U.S.  Attorneys to have processes in place toestablish and communicate their local priorities.  Seven of the eightU.S.  Attorneys we visited did not have formal processes to establishpriorities and communicate them to law enforcement components intheir districts.  Their priorities were set informally on the basisof the Attorney General's priorities, as well as on the crimeproblems and socioeconomic characteristics of their districts.  Forexample, government program and procurement fraud was a priority forone U.S.  Attorney in part because his district was the home of manydefense contractors. The U.S.  Attorneys we interviewed were generally satisfied withtheir input into the development of national priorities. Investigative agency personnel we visited generally said that theyunderstood the priorities of the U.S.  Attorneys.  These personnelfelt that the priorities of the U.S.  Attorneys were closely oradequately coordinated with the priorities of their own offices. Caseloads and workloads for U.S.  Attorneys' Offices nationwide, andfor the eight districts we visited, indicated that most cases filedand attorney time spent in fiscal year 1993 were in three broadpriority program areas--drugs, economic/white-collar crimes, andviolent crimes.  Within these broad program areas, criminal caseloadand workload statistics varied for the U.S.  Attorneys we visited. See appendix II for an analysis of EOUSA statistics on criminalcaseloads and workloads. Justice had no requirements for U.S.  Attorneys to measure their owneffectiveness, and none of the U.S.  Attorneys we visited haddeveloped set processes for doing so, although they noted varioussources of information that they thought provided indicators of theeffectiveness of their operations.  Justice's evaluation program,which officials said was the primary means of assessing theactivities of individual U.S.  Attorneys' Offices, covered the issueof priority-setting broadly, if at all, in the evaluation reportsthat were available at the time of our review.  According to EOUSA,changes were made to the evaluation program beginning in 1994 thatincorporated new methods of determining whether U.S.  Attorneys wereaddressing national priorities. Due to the unreliability of some data and the lack of other data,EOUSA could not fully use its information systems to determine howU.S.  Attorneys were addressing national and local prosecutorialpriorities.  Some existing measures of U.S.  Attorneys' caseloads andworkloads appeared to be inaccurate.  The information systems did notcollect some other information that may be useful in determining howU.S.  Attorneys address national and local priorities and for otherresource management purposes. At the end of 1994, Justice was developing plans to implement theGPRA's requirements to measure performance.  Justice determined thatperformance goals and performance indicators would be required forU.S.  Attorneys collectively, rather than for individual U.S. Attorneys.  The Attorney General asked Justice components to reviewexisting data to see what elements would be useful as indicators ofperformance required to implement the GPRA.  EOUSA had initiatedsteps to improve the quality of its information management systems,though additional efforts were needed.  For example, though we didnot make a reliability assessment of the automated informationsystems used by EOUSA to produce annual statistical reports, itappeared, on the basis of discussions with EOUSA and U.S.  Attorneys'Offices personnel and review of evaluation reports on the U.S. Attorneys' Offices we visited, that data did not accurately reflectthe caseloads and workloads of all of the offices.  Quality controlmeasures to ensure the accuracy of performance indicators werelacking, and Justice did not measure the complexity of cases handledby U.S.  Attorneys.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2The 93 U.S.  Attorneys, serving 94 federal judicial districts,\3operated out of 195 staffed offices in fiscal year 1993.  They had anoperating budget of nearly $800 million, and more than 4,000attorneys and nearly 5,000 support personnel to assist them.  Thebudget and staff for U.S.  Attorneys grew substantially in the pastdecade.  Between fiscal years 1984 and l993, the overall U.S. Attorney budget, adjusted for inflation, more than doubled from $340million to $796 million.  The average number of personnel in U.S. Attorney offices also more than doubled in that period from 4,429 to9,006. --------------------\3 The same U.S.  Attorney serves the District of Guam and theDistrict of the Northern Mariana Islands.       HISTORIC AND POLITICAL      FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO      INDEPENDENCE OF U.S.       ATTORNEYS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1Since the earliest days of the nation's history, almost a centurybefore the Justice Department was established, U.S.  Attorneys haveprosecuted cases in the federal judicial districts.  The JudiciaryAct of 1789 directed the president to appoint an attorney for eachfederal judicial district to prosecute all crimes and offensesagainst the United States and all civil actions in which the UnitedStates was concerned.\4 At that time, U.S.  Attorneys prosecuted onlycrimes specifically mentioned in the Constitution, such as piracy,treason, and counterfeiting. U.S.  Attorneys functioned without supervision by any executiveagency for about 40 years.  In 1820, Congress paved the way for somecentral oversight of U.S.  Attorneys.  Congress gave the presidentpower to designate an officer within the Department of the Treasuryto oversee U.S.  Attorneys' activities.  About 10 years later,Congress created the position of Solicitor of the Treasury to overseeU.S.  Attorneys.  Authority over U.S.  Attorneys shifted to theAttorney General after the Civil War.  The Attorney General receivedstatutory authority to supervise U.S.  Attorneys in 1870 when theDepartment of Justice was established. In 1953, EOUSA was established in the office of the Deputy AttorneyGeneral.  Among other things, EOUSA was to (1) maintain a check onthe overall performance of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices throughinspections, (2) serve as liaison between U.S.  Attorneys' Officesand other parts of Justice, and (3) facilitate the exchange ofinformation and ideas among U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and betweenthose offices and other parts of Justice.  Including personnel ondetail from U.S.  Attorney Offices and professional and supportpersonnel, EOUSA consisted of about 277 staff as of February 1995. The Attorney General is responsible for setting national lawenforcement priorities and accounting to Congress for how Justiceresources are used to address them.  The Attorney General is thechief legal officer of the federal government and exercises authorityand responsibility over enforcement of the federal criminal law.  Ashead of Justice, the Attorney General is responsible for theperformance of the Department's components and functions.  Thisincludes both its investigative components, such as the FederalBureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA), and its litigating components, such as the U.S.  Attorneys'Offices.  With reference to the U.S.  Attorneys, the law providesthat the Attorney General shall supervise all litigation to which theUnited States is a party and shall direct all U.S.  Attorneys andassistant U.S.  Attorneys in the discharge of their duties.  TheAttorney General's responsibility for resource allocation withinJustice includes determining staffing and funding levels for U.S. Attorneys' Offices. As a practical matter, however, the Attorney General's authority overU.S.  Attorneys is mitigated by the fact that it is the president whohas the authority to appoint U.S.  Attorneys, subject to Senateconfirmation, and to remove them.  Justice participates in theappointment process by providing the president with the names ofqualified nominees.  The local standing of U.S.  Attorneys alsocontributed to their unusual degree of independence.  As onecommentator observed:\5     "The [Justice] Department relies upon [U.S.  Attorneys] to     implement national legal policy as it is shaped by the political     process in Washington, D.C.  Yet, unlike most other field     personnel implementing centrally determined policies, they     belong to and identify with the community in which they serve.      Because their appointment depends upon their political standing     in the community, U.S.  Attorneys frequently feel they owe their     position to local political personalities and interests.  They     perform their legal duties in their home territories and plan to     remain in the community and pursue a legal or political career     there when they leave office.  Thus, local claims on their     attention, time, and policies come to rival the demands of     national policy and headquarters directives."--------------------\4 1 Stat.  73, 92-93.  The Judiciary Act also provided for theappointment of the Attorney General to represent the United States inlitigation before the Supreme Court and to furnish legal advice tothe president and department heads. \5 Eisenstein, Counsel for the United States:  U.S.  Attorneys in thePolitical and Legal Systems (1978).       IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT      PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT      ON FEDERAL AGENCIES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2The enactment of the GPRA will require Justice and all federalagencies to set goals, measure performance, and report results. Goals must be stated in a way that will allow assessments of whetherthey have been met.  Programs may be consolidated or disaggregated,as long as any consolidation of programs does not omit or minimizethe significance of a major program. By September 1997, each agency is to have submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) and Congress a 5-year strategic plan forits program activities.  The strategic plan should articulate theorganization's fundamental mission and lay out its long-term goalsand objectives for accomplishing that mission.  This plan is to beupdated every 3 years and should serve as the starting point andbasic underpinning of the agency's goal-setting and performancemeasurement process. GPRA does not require that the goals and objectives be stated asdepartment priorities.  The goals and objectives could focus on anyof a number of issues affecting a department's direction, services,or values.  For example, a departmental goal could be to improveefficiency, measured by a specific decrease in the average time toperform a certain task or a specific increase in the number of formsprocessed or letters written. Beginning with fiscal year 1999, agencies are to have developedannual program performance plans for submission to OMB and Congress. Program performance plans are to link agencies' daily operations tothe broad goals and objectives established in the strategic plans. The performance plans are to define target levels in objective,measurable terms so that actual achievement can be compared againstthe targets.  When a target has not been met, an explanation of whynot, and what actions would be needed to achieve the unmet goals, isrequired.    OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND   METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3Our objectives were to determine  how Justice communicates national prosecutorial priorities to U.S.      Attorneys;  how selected U.S.  Attorneys establish their priorities, including     whether they consider national prosecutorial priorities and     coordinate their priorities with those of federal law     enforcement agencies and state prosecutors; and  what, if any, measures Justice uses to assess U.S.  Attorneys'     effectiveness in meeting national priorities. We conducted our review at Justice headquarters and in eight U.S. Attorney districts.  The eight districts we visited were the CentralDistrict of California, the Southern District of Florida, the WesternDistrict of Michigan, the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York,the Northern District of Texas, and the Districts of Maine andMaryland.  These districts were judgmentally selected to obtain ageographic representation and a combination of large and smalloffices.  The 8 districts did not constitute a statisticallyrepresentative sample of all 94 districts. We interviewed officials at Justice headquarters.  In each district,we did structured interviews with the U.S.  Attorney and otherrepresentatives of the U.S.  Attorney's Office, representatives offederal law enforcement agencies and other federal agencies that dealwith U.S.  Attorneys, and state prosecutors.  At Justice headquartersand in the districts, we reviewed records and documents containingdata on priorities, organization, staffing, and operations of U.S. Attorney Offices.  We also reviewed prosecution guidelines and 10evaluation reports done between 1990 and 1993 at the 8 offices wevisited, and we analyzed caseload and workload data for each office. Our discussions on effectiveness measures focused on the status ofefforts by Justice to comply with the GPRA. We provided a draft of this report for comment to the AttorneyGeneral and received written comments from the Director of EOUSA. The comments are summarized on pages 26 through 28 and reprinted inappendix III. We did our work between January 1993 and December 1994 in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards.  A detaileddescription of our objectives, scope, and methodology is contained inappendix I.    PAST ATTORNEYS GENERAL   COMMUNICATED BROAD NATIONAL   PRIORITIES THROUGH A VARIETY OF   FORUMS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Over the last 10 years, Attorneys General did not issue prosecutorialpriorities through any specific process.  According to EOUSA, Justicedid not issue any "definitive lists" of prosecutorial priorities ormaintain historical records documenting priorities over time. Rather, Attorneys General communicated priorities through a varietyof forums, such as in budget requests to Congress, congressionaltestimony, speeches, and press conferences.  In addition, informationon priorities was included in memorandums to U.S.  Attorneys andother Justice components as a part of the process of developingbudget requests each fiscal year.  An EOUSA official said that thisoften resulted in a wide range of crimes being named as prioritiesand provided little specific guidance to U.S.  Attorneys on how tobest direct their resources. According to the eight U.S.  Attorneys we visited, the AttorneyGeneral communicated national priorities to them through channelssuch as Attorney General and Justice directives, policies, andmemorandums.  Priorities were also communicated through means such asdiscussions at meetings, training sessions, seminars, andconferences. Some priorities cited over this period were stated as specific crimetypes.  Examples of specifically stated priorities included narcoticstrafficking, public corruption, counterintelligence, andenvironmental crimes. Other priorities were broadly stated, encompassing a wide range ofcrime types.  For example, in most of the fiscal years from 1980 to1994, white-collar crime was designated as a priority in Justice'sbudget guidance.  White-collar crime encompasses many offensesincluding:  securities and commodities fraud, financial institutionfraud, antitrust violations, health-care fraud, computer fraud,public corruption, insurance fraud, bank embezzlement, federalprocurement fraud, and bankruptcy fraud.  Given its breadth, such apriority provided little guidance as to the relative importance ofthe individual crimes or offenses of which it was constituted. An EOUSA official told us that a criticism of national priorities inthe past was that everything was a priority.  We noted, for example,that for fiscal year 1994, a total of 17 priorities were enunciatedin various Attorney General speeches, testimony, and budgetmemorandums.    JUSTICE MOVED TOWARD   COMMUNICATING MORE SPECIFIC   NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT   PRIORITIES IN 1994------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5EOUSA officials told us that they thought Justice would articulatepriorities with more specificity in the future than it had in thepast.  Actions by the Attorney General in 1994 offered specificguidance about how top-ranked priorities should be implemented.  Evenso, the guidance left U.S.  Attorneys considerable discretion on howbest to approach priority crime categories in their districts. First, the Attorney General ranked her two top priorities--violentcrime and health-care fraud, respectively.  Second, she issuedwritten guidance to U.S.  Attorneys explaining what she wanted doneto implement the violent crime priority.  A national antiviolentcrime initiative was undertaken in early 1994.  Each U.S.  Attorneywas to designate a senior attorney to be a violent crime coordinator. Each U.S.  Attorney was also to meet with federal, state, and locallaw enforcement agencies in their districts to form a new, orstrengthen an existing, violent crime working group.  Each U.S. Attorney was to do a survey to identify and prioritize the violentcrime problems that were susceptible to a coordinated federal, state,and local attack.  Then, each U.S.  Attorney was to develop a plan toimplement the national initiative. Justice also is considering how best to develop indicators of theeffectiveness of U.S.  Attorneys' implementation of antiviolent crimeinitiatives.  The Acting Chief of Justice's Criminal Division Sectionon Terrorism and Violent Crime said that Justice will probablyrequire some type of reporting from U.S.  Attorneys on the results oftheir antiviolent crime efforts, but officials had not determinedwhat the reporting measures would be as of February 1995. U.S.  Attorneys were not asked to develop plans for implementing theAttorney General's health-care fraud priority program.  However, theAttorney General did take some steps to indicate the importance ofthis priority program.  She designated a Special Counsel forHealth-Care Fraud within Justice to coordinate all of Justice'shealth-care fraud activities.  The Special Counsel has formed anExecutive Level Health-Care Fraud Policy Group composed ofrepresentatives from Justice and other agencies to provide a forumfor discussing and addressing interagency issues.  Working throughthe Attorney General's Advisory Committee of U.S.  Attorneys, theSpecial Counsel also has requested that each U.S.  Attorney (1)designate an Assistant U.S.  Attorney to be the health-care fraudcoordinator for their district and (2) participate in localhealth-care fraud working groups, many of which are made up ofrepresentatives from federal, state, and local investigative andprosecutive agencies, as well as private insurance companyinvestigators.    U.S.  ATTORNEYS HAD INPUT INTO   THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL   PRIORITIES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6U.S.  Attorneys we visited were satisfied with their input intosetting national prosecutive priorities.  They told us that theyexpressed their views about which crime types should be consideredpriorities primarily through the Attorney General's AdvisoryCommittee of U.S.  Attorneys and its subcommittees. The Advisory Committee was formed in 1973 to address topics ofconcern to the Attorney General or U.S.  Attorneys.  A mix ofgeographic regions and office sizes are represented on the AdvisoryCommittee, which is composed of the Attorney General and a rotatinggroup of 15 U.S.  Attorneys who are appointed for staggered 3-yearterms.  U.S.  Attorneys who do not serve on the full committee mayparticipate on subcommittees.  Seven of the eight U.S.  Attorneys weinterviewed said that they had input on what national prosecutorialpriorities should be primarily through their involvement with theAdvisory Committee. An EOUSA official noted that the Advisory Committee was helpful notonly as a forum for the Attorney General and U.S.  Attorneys todiscuss national priorities, but also as a mechanism to encourageconsistency in how U.S.  Attorneys respond to the priorities.  Hebelieved that when U.S.  Attorneys meet and discuss appropriateresponses to priorities, this could lead to similar responses inoffices around the country.  If an approach is working well in oneU.S.  Attorney's Office, other U.S.  Attorneys may try the sameapproach.    U.S.  ATTORNEYS STRESSED THE   NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY IN   ESTABLISHING NATIONAL   PRIORITIES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7The U.S.  Attorneys we visited cited flexibility, discretion, and thelatitude to focus on local concerns as key components of a nationalpriority-setting process.  Six of the eight U.S.  Attorneys weinterviewed said that the priorities communicated to them reflectedan appropriate balance between generalities and specifics andprovided a useful national framework for deciding which prosecutionsto emphasize.  Summaries of comments made by these intervieweesfollow:   The national priorities have generally been good ones, and we have     had the flexibility to react appropriately to them at the     district level.  Very few national priorities apply to every     district, and I think the Attorney General recognizes that we     cannot gratuitously respond to every priority that comes down.      For example, if health-care fraud is not a problem in a     particular district, the U.S.  Attorney should not be compelled     to turn the district upside down looking for those cases to     address a national priority.  In our district, we have no     problem with organized crime, so we do not devote resources     there.   The priorities Justice articulates are the right ones.  Where the     Department falls short is in translating priorities into action.      It is bothersome that more work is not going on in some areas.      For example, we know that the problems are there in the student     loan program, with securities fraud and government contract     fraud, but agents do not have the expertise to work these cases     and attorneys have limited knowledge of them.  White-collar     crime is a priority, but the FBI here has only one out of four     of its squads working white- collar cases.  That one squad     covers financial institution fraud, health-care fraud, and every     other kind of white-collar crime. One interviewee said that he does not pay much attention to nationalpriorities, preferring to trust his staff's judgment, focus on localinterests, and prosecute anything that is big enough to warrant hisoffice's attention.  Another said that he had no problem withguidance from Justice, but would disapprove of Justice's exercisingspecific approval or control over the types of cases U.S.  Attorneysprosecute. Supervisors in several U.S.  Attorneys' Offices stressed that "bigcases" were prosecuted whether or not they were designated aspriority crime types.  One U.S.  Attorney noted that what a caseneeds is what a case gets, priority crime type or not.  How much of apriority the case is depends, in part, on the common sense of theattorney and supervisor assigned to the case.    MOST U.S.  ATTORNEYS SET LOCAL   PRIORITIES AND COORDINATED WITH   OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES   INFORMALLY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8With one exception, the U.S.  Attorneys we visited did not useformal, structured processes to establish their priorities.  Theyusually arrived at priorities informally, after considering theAttorney General's priorities, their own experience and knowledge ofthe district, and input from their staff and representatives of otherlaw enforcement agencies that investigated the federal mattersbrought to them for prosecution. The U.S.  Attorneys we interviewed told us that they exercised broaddiscretion in establishing the priorities for their offices. However, almost all of those we interviewed said that the AttorneyGeneral's priorities as a whole were considered when setting localprosecutive priorities.  Most of the U.S.  Attorneys we visited citedhealth-care fraud, violent crime, and narcotics trafficking asnational priorities that were adopted locally.  However, the degreeto which they adopted national priorities varied depending on theexistence and significance of a particular crime type within theirdistricts. A district's geographic, social, and economic characteristics werecited as important determinants of the U.S.  Attorney's priorities,as were the impact, severity, and pervasiveness of particular crimes. The U.S.  Attorneys we visited provided the following examples of whycertain crimes were local priorities.   In the Northern District of Texas, white-collar crime was a high     priority because the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area is a     major corporate service center for the southwest.  Narcotics     trafficking was a significant priority because of the district's     proximity to the Mexican border.  Government program and     procurement fraud was a priority because many defense     contractors were located in the area.   In the Eastern District of New York, organized crime was a priority     because the area is the residence of or venue for activities of     major organized crime figures. Although they each tended to place more importance on certainpriorities than others, seven of the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Officeswe visited did not rank their priorities.  One U.S.  Attorney, forexample, said that there was no formal ranking of priorities, butthat some issues were more important than others.  He said that thelevel of importance depended, in part, on the strength of hisrelationship with the particular investigative agency responsible forthat priority crime.  Another U.S.  Attorney said that the relativeamount of resources devoted to particular priorities depended on thelevel and types of crime occurring in the district at any given pointin time.  Accordingly, the relative importance of priorities to oneanother may change often.  A supervisory attorney in one office saidthat the top nine priority crimes were ranked, but he also noted thatthere was no problem deviating from priorities if there werelegitimate reasons for doing so, such as significant nonprioritycases to prosecute. Most of the U.S.  Attorneys we visited told us that designating aparticular crime type as a priority generally meant that it receivedmore resources than nonpriority crime types.  For example, assigningassistant U.S.  Attorneys to enforcement task forces or specialprosecutive units were ways to emphasize priority crime areas.    ONE U.S.  ATTORNEY USED A MORE   FORMAL PROCESS TO SET   PRIORITIES THAN THE OTHER   DISTRICTS WE VISITED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9One district we visited, Maryland, used a new, more formal processthan the other seven districts we visited for setting prosecutivepriorities in 1994.  According to Maryland's U.S.  Attorney, in thefirst step of the process, her office determined the crime concernsin the district and the appropriate federal responses throughmeetings with business and community leaders and state and local lawenforcement officials throughout the state.  She said that she andher staff also met with officials of the federal law enforcementagencies working in the district.  The FBI and DEA, for example,provided information on significant areas affecting community safetyand security under their jurisdictions.  Representatives of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S.  Secret Service providedinformation on postal theft and counterfeiting issues. In a March 1994 memorandum, the U.S.  Attorney announced areorganization of her office according to priority program areas,which were based on input from within her office and their client lawenforcement agencies.  Prosecutors were assigned to work in specificpriority areas.  Under each of the priority areas, the U.S.  Attorneyidentified the types of cases that the investigative agencies shoulddevelop and/or strategies to use in investigating those cases.  Shealso revised prosecutive guidelines to emphasize the priority crimeareas. At the time of our review, it was too soon to determine whether thenew process was judged by law enforcement officials in the districtto be an improvement in the U.S.  Attorneys' Office operatingprocedures.    U.S.  ATTORNEYS COORDINATED   WITH INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES ON   PRIORITIES----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10All of the eight U.S.  Attorneys we visited said that theycoordinated their priorities with federal and local law enforcementagencies.  Representatives of federal investigative agencies wevisited generally indicated that they had a good understanding of thetypes of cases the U.S.  Attorneys would accept for prosecution andthat their priorities were closely or adequately coordinated withthose of the U.S.  Attorneys. Interaction with federal investigative agencies influenced thepriorities developed by the U.S.  Attorneys we visited in a varietyof ways.  One U.S.  Attorney, for example, told us that in developingpriorities, she routinely considered information provided by federaland state investigative agencies.  In this district, telemarketingfraud was designated a priority on the basis of consultations withthe federal investigative agencies.  Another U.S.  Attorney said heemphasized specific violent crimes, such as carjackings, in part onthe basis of the results of meetings with officials of the FBI, DEA,the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms(ATF), and other law enforcement agencies in his district. To gain an understanding of how well they felt they understood thepriorities of the U.S.  Attorneys with whom they worked, weinterviewed 63 federal investigative agency supervisors in the 8districts.  We asked the supervisors whether they felt that they hada good understanding of the types of cases the U.S.  Attorneys intheir jurisdictions would accept for prosecution.  Fifty-nine of theinterviewees said that they had a good understanding of thepriorities, while four said that they did not. The interviewees said that the U.S.  Attorney's priorities werecommunicated to them via written prosecutive guidelines and throughongoing informal communication among agents and assistant U.S. Attorneys.  The lines of communication included discussions ofongoing cases and conversations at law enforcement meetings.  Severalinterviewees also noted that U.S.  Attorneys' priorities werecommunicated by the allocation of resources, with more attorneysassigned to work on priority cases. We asked these investigative agency supervisors to describe theinterrelationship between their investigative agencies' prioritiesand the U.S.  Attorney's priorities by choosing a response from amongthe following categories:   Our priorities and those of the U.S.  Attorney are closely     coordinated.   Our priorities and those of the U.S.  Attorney are adequately     coordinated.   Our priorities and those of the U.S.  Attorney are not adequately     coordinated.   None of these responses describes the interrelationship. The vast majority of investigative agency supervisors we interviewedthought that priorities were at least adequately coordinated. Thirty-five interviewees said that their priorities and those of theU.S.  Attorney for the district were closely coordinated.  Nineteeninterviewees said that the priorities were adequately coordinated. Two interviewees said that priorities were not adequatelycoordinated, and seven interviewees did not select any of theseresponses to the structured interview question.  In the two instancesin two different districts that interviewees said priorities were notadequately coordinated, the reason given was that the priorities oftheir agencies did not match those of the U.S.  Attorney. U.S.  Attorneys we visited also received informal input from stateprosecutors, especially in the area of violent crime.  U.S. Attorneys said that they usually became aware of the stateprosecutors' priorities by meeting informally with them on cases withstate and federal implications or through participation in taskforces. State prosecutors' priorities indirectly affected some U.S. Attorneys' priorities.  For example, one U.S.  Attorney said that heroffice worked closely with the state on violent crime cases and thathistorically this relationship had worked well.  However, recentstate legislation increasing state penalties has caused both sides tore-examine their roles in violent crime prosecutions.    EFFORTS TO MEASURE PROSECUTIVE   PERFORMANCE DIFFER----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11U.S.  Attorneys we visited had no discrete processes for measuringthe effectiveness of their prosecutive activities, but they said thatinformation from a variety of sources provided indicators of theeffectiveness of their operations in fighting crime in theirdistricts.  EOUSA's primary evaluation mechanism was its evaluationprogram, under which a broad review of the overall operations of eachU.S.  Attorney's Office was conducted every several years.  Accordingto program instructions, the evaluation was to include an assessmentof how U.S.  Attorneys were implementing the Attorney General'spriorities.  The subject of priorities was generally covered broadly,if at all, in the evaluation reports we reviewed; and Justice did notrequire that U.S.  Attorneys implement recommendations made byevaluation teams.       U.S.  ATTORNEYS WE VISITED      CITED A VARIETY OF      SUBJECTIVE MEASURES OF      EFFECTIVENESS--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11.1In discussions on how they determined their effectiveness inaddressing crime in their districts, U.S.  Attorneys we visited didnot cite any single objective measure, but they noted severalsubjective forms of feedback and information from a variety ofsources that could provide indicators of effectiveness.  For example,several U.S.  Attorneys said that they gauged the generaleffectiveness of their offices through discussions with and/orfeedback from their staffs and the investigative agencies.  OtherU.S.  Attorneys mentioned, as indicators of effectiveness, the numberof cases they prosecuted and decreases in certain types of criminalactivity in the district.  Also mentioned by U.S.  Attorneys aseffectiveness measures were economic indicators, such as the price ofdrugs, and success in coordinating the efforts of various lawenforcement agencies in the district.  A supervisor in one U.S. Attorney's Office believed that effectiveness could be measured bythe impact that cases had on the community.  For example, he saidthat dismantling the leadership of an organized crime group orfoiling a major plot to distribute drugs could have significantimpact.  However, the U.S.  Attorney had no formal performancemeasures to assess the impact such prosecutions had on illegalactivities in the district.       JUSTICE'S EVALUATION REPORTS      FOR MOST OFFICES WE VISITED      GAVE LITTLE ATTENTION TO      IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIORITIES--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11.2According to EOUSA officials, Justice's primary mechanism forassessing the activities of U.S.  Attorney Offices, including howU.S.  Attorneys were implementing the Attorney General's priorities,was its evaluation program.  The subject of priorities was generallycovered broadly, if at all, in the evaluation reports we reviewed;and Justice did not require U.S.  Attorneys to implement theevaluation teams' recommendations. According to an evaluation program manager, evaluation teams composedof Assistant U.S.  Attorneys visited each U.S.  Attorney's Officeevery 3 to 4 years to perform a broad review of its overalloperations.  About 115 to 120 Assistant U.S.  Attorneys served asevaluators, doing three or fewer evaluations each year.  Evaluationprogram guidance required that teams be led by a legal managementevaluator, who was responsible for coordinating and managing allpre-evaluation activities, the on- site evaluation, and thesubmission of written evaluation reports.  Administrative andfinancial litigation evaluations were conducted simultaneously withlegal management evaluations, resulting in reviews of U.S. Attorneys' entire operations. As required by EOUSA's Evaluation Manual, at the end of each on- sitevisit, the evaluation team was to provide a briefing on preliminaryfindings to the U.S.  Attorney and any key staff the U.S.  Attorneyinvited to attend.  The team was then to prepare a draft writtenreport for submission to EOUSA.  According to EOUSA officials, theEOUSA director was to forward the draft report to the U.S.  Attorney,who was responsible for reviewing it and responding to, but notnecessarily implementing, any recommendations.  If the evaluationteam was satisfied with the U.S.  Attorney's action or proposedaction to address a recommendation or was convinced by the U.S. Attorney that the recommendation was not appropriate, therecommendation was to be dropped from the final report. One of the purposes of the evaluation program was to determinewhether the Attorney General's priorities were being carried out bythe U.S.  Attorneys.  The evaluation team was to make thisdetermination primarily on the basis of interviews of personnel. Other methodologies available to them included examination of casemanagement data and reviews of cases.  According to an EOUSArepresentative, however, evaluators did not look at actual case filesunless some problem was identified.  Evaluators, in conducting theirevaluations, generally looked at printouts from the case trackingsystems and relied heavily on the results of interviews withpersonnel in the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices. Our review of 10 legal management evaluation reports prepared duringthe period from 1990 through 1993 for the 8 districts we visitedshowed variance in the extent to which compliance with nationalpriorities was specifically reported.  In seven of the evaluationreports, evaluators made no written assessment of whether or notnational priorities were addressed.  In another two evaluationreports, evaluators made general assessments about whether nationalpriorities were addressed.  In one evaluation report, evaluatorstreated the issue of national priorities in some detail, relatingresources and case reviews to priorities. The general statements made about work in national priority areas intwo reports were:   Overall cases here are quality cases.  Many are very complex and     high profile.  The cases brought are consistent with the     priorities of the Attorney General.   The office is doing a very good job of conducting the government's     litigation.  Justice priorities and policies are followed and     applied appropriately. A summary of the evaluation comments relating priorities to resourcesand case reviews in more detail follows:   The office seems posed and prepared to address any of the law     enforcement priorities set nationally by the Attorney General,     as well as those that have emerged from district-level criminal     problems.  This commitment to well-defined law enforcement goals     is reflected in the prosecution teams set in place by the U.S.      Attorney.  He is well aware, for example, that there is a large     number of toxic dump sites in his district and has tasked .  .      .  a unit to step up enforcement efforts in all environmental     matters.  The same high priority and follow-through is evident     in the area of defense procurement fraud.  Hard-hitting     enforcement efforts against drug traffickers is a clear     priority, and the dedication of five full-time Assistant U.S.      Attorneys for the task demonstrates that priority. The Evaluation Manual, as updated in July 1993, contained a sectionon recommendations, but it did not state whether in any instancessuch recommendations were binding on U.S.  Attorneys.  An EOUSAofficial said that U.S.  Attorneys were in the best position to knowhow to direct the resources of their districts to crime categories. He said that draft evaluation team recommendations were reviewed bythe EOUSA director and deputy director.  Before issuing the finalevaluation reports, evaluators were to follow up to see if anychanges were made on the basis of the evaluation results, but U.S. Attorneys were not required to make any of the recommended changes totheir operations.  The official said that EOUSA planned to considerhaving a team available to help U.S.  Attorneys implementrecommendations. In commenting on a draft of this report, EOUSA said that the vastmajority of the recommendations made by evaluators have beenimplemented by U.S.  Attorneys.  It said that the EOUSA director ordeputy director or the Deputy Attorney General would have requiredimplementation of a significant or important recommendation if thereasons for not doing so were flawed, and it noted that fact wouldnot necessarily be known by individual members of EOUSA's evaluationand review staff. EOUSA also noted in its comments that changes were made to theevaluation program in l994 including updated training of evaluatorsand additional methods to determine whether the Department'spriorities were being addressed appropriately.  These methodsincluded review of dedicated attorney and support resources tocertain types of crimes and interviews with federal, state, and locallaw enforcement agencies.    CASELOAD AND WORKLOAD DATA   APPEARED TO BE INACCURATE----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12Due to the apparent unreliability of some data and the lack of otherdata, EOUSA could not fully use its existing information systems todetermine how U.S.  Attorneys were addressing national and localprosecutorial priorities.  Assessments of what information will berequired and how to ensure its accuracy are indispensable if EOUSA isto rely on its information system to help measure performance, asenvisioned by the GPRA. The Attorney General, in seeking input from Justice components to theDepartment's fiscal year 1996 budget request, asked for a review ofexisting data to identify which elements would be useful asindicators of performance and which elements would not be helpful. The Attorney General's instructions stated the following:      "In selecting performance indicators, components should     completely review all existing workload data and adapt those     items that are useful and results-oriented.  Component program,     planning/evaluation, and budget offices are urged to work     together to develop new performance indicators that focus on     program outputs and outcomes, and less on program input and     process indicators.      [Text omitted.]     "It is recognized and expected that in a number of instances,     new indicators will be identified for which no baseline data are     available."Some existing measures of U.S.  Attorneys' Offices workloads andcaseloads were inaccurate, limiting their usefulness in measuringperformance and responsiveness of U.S.  Attorneys to addressingnational priorities.  Officials at Justice headquarters and U.S. Attorneys' Offices told us that some statistical data in the casemanagement system and in the system used to track attorney time wereinaccurate and incomplete.  Evaluation reports on several of the U.S. Attorneys' Offices we reviewed also documented inaccuracies in thesesystems.  EOUSA has not studied the reliability of its casemanagement information system by checking data against case files inU.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  However, EOUSA had a project underwayaimed at improving the quality of the automated data. The caseload and workload data systems did not collect someinformation that could have been useful in determining how U.S. Attorneys were addressing national and local priorities, as well asserving other resource management purposes and measuring performanceas required by the GPRA.  For example, Justice did not measure thecomplexity of the cases prosecuted.  It would be difficult to measureperformance without knowing whether cases reported in the informationsystem were complex, time-consuming cases, or comparatively simplecases involving little prosecutor time.  Nor did Justice account fortime spent by prosecutors on other than case-specific activities,such as coordinating task forces, conducting crime surveys, anddeveloping prosecutive strategies with state and local officials, asfinite categories of resource use.  Knowledge of the time spent onsuch nonprosecutive activities would have been helpful to theAttorney General since she has asked prosecutors to do work involvingplanning, coordinating, and managing law enforcement resources. In commenting on a draft of this report, EOUSA stated that it hadbegun to account for time spent by prosecutors on other thancase-specific activities.  It cited as an example that, as of October1994, it included time spent in areas related to community coalitionbuilding, Weed and Seed, and/or Law Enforcement CoordinatingCommittee (LECC) programs in the time category of "CrimePrevention/LECC."      SOME CASE MANAGEMENT DATA      APPEARED UNRELIABLE--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.1We did not make a reliability assessment of the automated informationsystems used by EOUSA to produce annual statistical reports on U.S. Attorneys' caseloads.  However, on the basis of discussions withrepresentatives of EOUSA and U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and review ofevaluation reports on the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited, itappeared that the data did not accurately reflect the caseloads andworkloads of all of the offices.  EOUSA and U.S.  Attorneys' Officeofficials told us that some caseload statistics were more reliablethan others.  The number of cases filed by U.S.  Attorneys in federaldistrict court was one data element that information managementofficials said was particularly reliable because it could be checkedagainst statistics maintained by the courts. Because offices we visited used different criteria to count cases anddeclinations (criminal matters that were not prosecuted), comparisonsof caseloads among districts could be misleading.  For example, EOUSAofficials said that there was some variation in the way differentU.S.  Attorneys counted criminal matters and some declinations. Several offices we visited did not include misdemeanors in theircaseload statistics.  But one office did include such data, therebygiving its criminal caseload the appearance of being larger than itactually was relative to other offices.  A data analyst in a largeoffice said that double-counting of defendants was routine.  She saidthat defendants were sometimes listed under their names and againlisted under the names of their criminal operations.  She also notedthat if two Assistant U.S.  Attorneys were involved in a trial, thetrial may be counted twice in the data management system because bothattorneys would have noted it in their personal statistics. EOUSA evaluations of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we reviewed,conducted from 1991 through 1993, documented problems with thereliability and usefulness of the case management systems.  Only 1evaluation of the 10 evaluations we reviewed reported that the caseinformation system was generally accurate and used by the U.S. Attorney as a management tool.  Eight evaluations reported problemsof varying degrees of seriousness, while the reliability andusefulness of the case management system was not reported in oneevaluation.  Examples of some of the problems noted follow:   One evaluation team found that nearly 300 cases in 1 office were     assigned to "mystery" Assistant U.S.  Attorneys who did not     appear on any office rosters.  This evaluation team found over     1,000 cases that they thought could be eliminated from the civil     case docket of about 5,000 cases.   At another location, an evaluation team found case lists from the     information system to be "chronically incorrect" and noted that     improvements were needed to keep track of workload and to avoid     spending extraordinary amounts of time trying to correct the     information.   A third evaluation team noted that it appeared that cases were     being carried when there was no activity, thereby artificially     inflating the caseload.       EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CASE      MANAGEMENT INFORMATION--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.2According to the EOUSA Information Systems Manager, EOUSA tried toimprove the accuracy of the case management data, but had notattempted to verify its accuracy by matching data on the informationmanagement system to records in U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  EOUSAconsolidated data tapes from U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and producedlistings identifying some errors, such as nonexistent crime codes. EOUSA also worked on improving the quality of its case-trackingsystems in an effort called "Operation Garbage Out." The goals ofthis effort were to update the databases in each U.S.  Attorney'sOffice to reflect correct and current information, provide trainingin using the data system, recommend steps to improve the quality ofthe data system, and increase management accountability for and lineattorney involvement in the quality of the local database. In phase one of the effort, U.S.  Attorneys were asked to review allpending cases that were older than 5 years and close those cases thatneeded to be closed.  As a result of this effort, more than 10percent of the U.S.  Attorneys' pending caseloads were dropped.  Inphase two, U.S.  Attorneys were asked to certify that all cases, notjust the old cases, had been reviewed to ensure that they wereclassified accurately.  Phase three involved EOUSA looking at casemanagement data in greater detail, four districts at a time, focusingon errors that were common across districts.  The results of thelater phases of the Operation Garbage Out effort were not availableat the time of our review. An EOUSA official said that there had been some discussion aboutpossibly checking the validity of data reported on the casemanagement system against records in U.S.  Attorneys' Offices, but nodecision had been made on whether to do such a validity check.  As ofDecember 1994, the EOUSA Information Systems Manager said thatdiscussions about a new formal program for information qualitymanagement were underway, but no timeframe had been set on when theprogram would be implemented. The official said that plans were also being made for developing anew case management system and introducing it nationally for all U.S. Attorneys' Offices in mid-1996.  One improvement she anticipated withthe new system was that it would allow for inclusion of specializedinformation on priority programs.       SOME WORKLOAD DATA APPEARED      INACCURATE--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.3Discussions with personnel in U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and review ofevaluation reports on the U.S.  Attorney Offices we visited indicatedthat data on the amount of time prosecutors spend on variousprosecutive activities were inaccurate.  According to EOUSAofficials, prosecutors completed resource summary reports (USA Form5) at least monthly, estimating the percentage of time they spentworking during the month in 24 criminal division crime categories and25 civil division categories.  No guidance existed on how prosecutorswere to determine which categories to use for various types of work. In commenting on a draft of our report, EOUSA provided guidance datedDecember 27, 1994, on how to charge time to various categories ofcriminal and civil cases. Administrative staff were to compile the information on all of theUSA Form 5s completed in their offices and send it to EOUSA eachmonth.  EOUSA was to consolidate the information into a singledatabase.  During our review, EOUSA was working toward automatedtransmission of USA Form 5 data from U.S.  Attorneys' Offices toJustice headquarters. Representatives of some of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visitedindicated that the time-tracking data were inaccurate and unreliable. One concern expressed was that some attorneys were not diligent inreporting their time; therefore, work was underreported or did notaccurately reflect the types of prosecutions the office handled. Another concern was that there was uncertainty about which timecategories to charge for some work, particularly on economic crimecases.  One Assistant U.S.  Attorney said, for example, thatdistinctions between credit card fraud and bank fraud or credit cardfraud and telemarketing fraud were not always clear.  Thus, data onhours worked on each of these crime types could be inconsistent fromone office to another and one attorney to another. Evaluation reports we reviewed also documented inaccuracies inreporting time spent on various types of cases.  For example, oneevaluation report noted that civil section attorneys in the officecompleted USA Form 5s monthly from memory or by estimation.  Anotherevaluation report found that some prosecutors were reluctant to keepand report necessary USA Form 5 information, although theadministrative officer indicated that continued efforts were beingmade to get all staff to cooperate. EOUSA officials said that no efforts had been made to verify theaccuracy of the data showing attorney time spent on various types ofcases.       ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT      INFORMATION COULD BE USEFUL--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.4In the course of our review, we noted two measures that Justice didnot include in its information systems that could have helped toassess how U.S.  Attorneys addressed priority programs.  Thesemeasures may have also served other management purposes, such asresource allocation and performance measurement, as required by theGPRA.  These measures were (1) attorney time spent on coordination,outreach, and other nonprosecutive functions and (2) case complexity. Knowledge of the time spent on nonprosecutive activities would havebeen helpful to the Attorney General since she asked prosecutors todo work involving planning, coordinating, and managing lawenforcement resources and community outreach.  The resource summaryinformation system that was in place at the time of our review didnot measure time spent by attorneys on these functions. A key challenge that the Attorney General gave U.S.  Attorneys attheir January 1994 conference was to increase their efforts tocoordinate the work of law enforcement agencies to avoid overlap anddirect investigative resources in the best manner possible.  Also, akey component of Justice's antiviolent crime initiative is tocooperate with other law enforcement authorities.  The work that theU.S.  Attorneys put into the initiative by organizing and attendingtask force meetings and surveying the law enforcement community wasnot reflected in raw numbers of cases. We asked supervisory attorneys in several U.S.  Attorneys' Officeshow they accounted for time spent on such tasks as planning,coordinating task forces, and surveying the community about crimeconcerns.  The attorneys said the time would probably come under aparticular crime type such as "violent crime," or under the generalcategory of "management and administration." They said thatdistinctions between time spent on prosecutive functions versusplanning, community outreach, and coordinating and managing resourceswas not reflected. One supervisory Assistant U.S.  Attorney noted that some of the workin his office was not really measured by any time-charge activity. He said attorneys spent a fair amount of time talking to high schoolsand community groups; helping police departments apply for grants;bringing federal, state, and local investigative resources togetherto address crime problems; and doing other types of nonprosecutivetasks.  The attorney said that such time would have been charged inhis office either to the subject matter of the meetings or to ageneral category of management and administration. It is difficult to measure performance without knowing whether casesreported in the information system are complex, time- consuming casesor comparatively simple cases that involve little prosecutor time. Justice does not assess the complexity, quality, or impact of casesprosecuted, although two U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited madeassessments of case complexity on their own.  Supervisors assignedcomplexity ratings to cases on scales from one to three. A case filed is statistically one case whether it was aplea-bargained, relatively low-level drug prosecution requiring a fewhours of one prosecutor's time or a complex drug traffickingconspiracy case that took several years and a large amount ofattorney resources to prosecute.  The amount of time spent byattorneys prosecuting various cases could serve as one indicator ofcomplexity. The EOUSA Information Systems Manager said that the new informationmanagement system, scheduled to be piloted during 1995, would have adata field for offices to assign complexity weightings to cases. However, no data on that field would be collected nationally.  U.S. Attorneys' Offices would have the option to use or not use the fieldas a local management tool.  The manager noted that without specificcase weighting criteria, offices might tend to skew weights to thehigh side if they were being compared to case weights in otheroffices.    CONCLUSIONS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :13As the nation's chief law enforcement officer and head of the JusticeDepartment, the Attorney General is responsible and accountable toCongress for ensuring that the federal law enforcement componentswithin Justice are effectively coordinated, that Justice resourcesare effectively applied, and that national law enforcement prioritiesare addressed appropriately.  Enactment of the GPRA reinforces theimportance of these responsibilities.  To accomplish them, theAttorney General needs clear information on how U.S.  Attorneyresources are directed nationwide to various law enforcementpriorities. At the same time, U.S.  Attorneys need to retain flexibility toaddress the specific crime problems that exist in their districts andto adapt national priorities to best meet local conditions.  Closeconsultation between Justice and the U.S.  Attorneys is essential tostrike an appropriate balance. The Attorney General's recent identification and ranking of two topnational priorities moved Justice in the direction of setting morefocused national law enforcement priorities, as did her requirementthat U.S.  Attorneys take actions to implement the two priorities. While these steps focused national priorities, they also affordedU.S.  Attorneys considerable discretion in deciding which specificsteps to take in their districts to implement the two priorities. More accurate and complete data would help Justice to betterdetermine how U.S.  Attorneys are implementing national and localpriority programs and to comply with the GPRA.  Although EOUSA wascontinuing to take steps to improve the accuracy of its informationsystems, the caseload and workload data contained inaccuracies thatcould hinder Justice's efforts to measure performance and track howwell U.S.  Attorneys are implementing national priorities andotherwise applying their resources.  As Justice moves into the GPRAenvironment and considers whether data elements that it collected inthe past are needed to measure performance and results and whetheradditional data elements would be useful as performance indicators,it will be important to ensure that the data it collects are completeand accurate.    RECOMMENDATION----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :14We recommend that, as the Department of Justice evaluates what datawill be selected as indicators of U.S.  Attorney performance to meetthe GPRA requirements, the Attorney General direct EOUSA to developquality control measures to ensure the accuracy of the data to becollected.  EOUSA should give specific consideration to developingmeasures of case complexity to be used by all U.S.  Attorneys.    AGENCY COMMENTS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :15We provided a draft of this report for comment to the AttorneyGeneral and received comments from the Director of EOUSA.  Thecomments and our responses are summarized below.  EOUSA's commentsare reprinted in appendix III. EOUSA reiterated that in our review of eight different U.S. Attorneys' Offices of varying sizes, serving communities with diversedemographic characteristics, none was unaware or neglectful of theAttorney General's priorities. In the draft of this report, we suggested that EOUSA considerestablishing workload categories to measure time spent onnonprosecutive attorney activities, such as organizing and attendingtask force meetings.  EOUSA said that as of October 1994, it began toaccount for time spent by attorneys on other than case-specificactivities, and because of this, we did not include the suggestion inour final report.  EOUSA also said that our statement that it did nothave guidance for attorneys on how to charge time to various types ofcases was inaccurate.  The guidance EOUSA provided to illustrate thispoint was dated December 27, 1994, which was after our audit work wascompleted.  We added this information to the report. EOUSA noted difficulties that would arise in developing measures ofcase complexity to be used by all U.S.  Attorneys and said that itmay not be feasible to develop such measures.  However, experiencesof individual U.S.  Attorneys may be of value in exploring ways tomeasure complexity.  Two of the eight U.S.  Attorneys we visited haddeveloped systems of rating complexity on scales of one to three.  Inaddition, we were advised that the Deputy Attorney General's Officewas exploring the use of full- time attorney equivalents charged tocases as a measure of case complexity to help make decisions onstaffing allocations for U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  If more work timegoes into prosecuting a smaller number of fraud cases compared to alarger number of drug cases, that would be an indicator ofcomplexity.  If standards for measuring complexity were developed foruse by all U.S.  Attorneys, the EOUSA evaluation program could serveas a means to assess the consistency in which various U.S.  Attorneysapply the standards for their caseloads. We agree that development of a system to measure case complexity is adifficult challenge.  However, unless EOUSA attempts to do so, itwill not have definitive data on feasibility.  Without knowingwhether cases reported in the information system are complex andtime-consuming or comparatively simple cases involving littleprosecutor time, performance measurement will have little objectivevalue. EOUSA did not mention our recommendation that it develop qualitycontrol measures to ensure the accuracy of data to be collected asperformance indicators.  However, the senior counsel to EOUSA'sdirector told us, in a follow-up discussion, that EOUSA generallyagrees with the recommendation and is continuing to work to improvethe accuracy of its data. EOUSA stated that its evaluation program remains the primarymechanism for monitoring U.S.  Attorneys' implementation of priorityprograms, but noted that, as we relied on evaluation reports donebetween 1990 and 1993, we did not take into account changes in theprocess that began in 1994.  For example, EOUSA said that evaluationreports are being modified to report priority programs in a moreorganized and recognizable format.  We agree that we did not assessany improvements to the program that occurred in 1994 because ourmethodology for reviewing evaluation reports was to obtain the mostrecent reports available for each of the eight U.S.  Attorneys'Offices we visited.  For the Districts of Maine and Eastern New York,we reviewed evaluations done in 1990 and the final reports forevaluations done in 1993 when they became available.  As noted in ourreport, evaluation teams visit U.S.  Attorneys Office about every 3to 4 years.  In addition, there was a lag time of several monthsbetween the date of the evaluation and the date the final report wasavailable for our review.  Thus, we assessed all of the evaluationreports available during the course of our audit work. EOUSA disagreed with a statement in our report that, according to anEOUSA official, U.S.  Attorneys were not required to make changes totheir operations recommended by evaluation teams.  EOUSA stated thatmembers of its evaluation and review staff may not be aware that topEOUSA management or the Deputy Attorney General could require a U.S. Attorney to implement a specific recommendation.  EOUSA did notprovide any specifics on processes through which such a requirementwould be made, nor examples of when or how often such requirementsare made of U.S.  Attorneys.  The handbook followed for legalmanagement evaluations, as updated in July 1993, contained a sectionon recommendations, but it did not state whether in any instancessuch recommendations were binding on U.S.  Attorneys.  Because thisinformation was not specified in the written guidance, we followed upwith EOUSA's director for evaluation and review and included in ourreport his statement that recommendations were not binding. --------------------------------------------------------- Letter :15.1We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, theOffice of Management and Budget, and the House and Senate JudiciaryCommittees.  It will also be made available to others upon request. Major contributors are listed in appendix IV.  If you have anyquestions, please contact me on (202) 512-8777. Norman J.  RabkinDirector, Administration of Justice IssuesOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix IThe Chairman of the former House Government Operations Subcommitteeon Government Information, Justice, and Agriculture\1asked us to review several issues relating to U.S.  Attorneys'prosecutorial priorities. Specifically, we agreed to determine the following:   how the Department of Justice communicates national prosecutorial     priorities to U.S.  Attorneys;  how selected U.S.  Attorneys establish their priorities, including     whether they consider national prosecutorial priorities and     coordinate their priorities with those of federal law     enforcement agencies and state prosecutors; and  what, if any, measures Justice uses to assess U.S.  Attorneys'     effectiveness in meeting national priorities. To address the first objective, we interviewed Justice officials andobtained documentation on how national prosecutorial priorities aredeveloped and communicated.  We reviewed budget memorandumsaddressing priorities, as well as Attorney General speeches,testimonies, and communications.  We also asked U.S.  Attorneys hownational priorities were communicated to them. To address the second objective, we did structured interviews ineight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  We interviewed U.S.  Attorneys\2and key staff in each U.S.  Attorneys' Office.  We also didstructured interviews with officials of eight federal investigativeagencies and a state prosecutor in each U.S.  Attorney district toaddress how U.S.  Attorneys' priorities were communicated and whetherthey were coordinated with other law enforcement officials. In addressing the second objective, we also reviewed case managementdata on the number of cases and matters filed and declined by type ofcrime for fiscal years 1980 through 1993.  We reviewed data on U.S. Attorney work years for fiscal years 1980 through 1993, and wereviewed data on hours attorneys spent working on various types ofcases nationally and for the eight selected districts for fiscal year1993.  We reviewed guidelines established by the eight U.S. Attorneys for determining whether to accept cases for federalprosecution. To address the third objective, we interviewed Justice officials andU.S.  Attorneys and reviewed evaluation reports to determine whatqualitative and quantitative measures were in place to evaluate theeffectiveness of the operations of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  TheGovernment Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 requiresfederal agencies to implement a system to set goals, measureperformance, and report results.  We focused our discussions for thisobjective on the status of efforts by Justice to comply with the law. --------------------\1 In the 104th Congress, jurisdiction changed to the newlyestablished Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairsand Criminal Justice of the Committee on Government Reform andOversight. \2 In the Southern District of New York we interviewed a firstassistant U.S.  Attorney who was an Acting U.S.  Attorney at the timeof our visit.    SELECTION OF U.S.  ATTORNEYS'   OFFICES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1Table I.1 lists the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited and providesinformation on the criminal and civil cases filed in each officeduring fiscal year 1993.  The districts were the Central District ofCalifornia, the Southern District of Florida, the Western District ofMichigan, the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, theNorthern District of Texas, and the Districts of Maine and Maryland. We judgmentally selected these districts to include variousgeographical regions of the country and small, medium, and largeoffices. Table I.1 also shows that the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices combinedfiled about 18 percent of both the criminal and civil cases that werefiled in district courts in fiscal year 1993.

SELECTION OF INTERVIEWEES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2We did structured interviews with U.S.  Attorneys or acting U.S. Attorneys and their first assistants and the chiefs of their criminaland civil divisions in the eight districts.  We asked them how theyestablished priorities for their offices, how national prioritieswere communicated to them, how they coordinated priorities withfederal, state, and local investigative agencies and with stateprosecutors, and how they measured their effectiveness in the missionof fighting crime in their districts.  We pretested the structuredinterview instruments with U.S.  Attorneys' Office representatives inSouthern New York and Maryland, and we made clarifications andrefinements on the basis of the comments we received. We also talked with other division and section chiefs in theseoffices about prosecutions of specific types of cases, and we talkedwith personnel responsible for the data management systems about howinformation on caseload and workload was compiled. In addition, we did structured interviews with representatives ofinvestigative agency field offices and with one state prosecutor ineach of the eight court districts.  We asked investigative agencypersonnel for general information about their caseloads, workloads,and priorities, as well as how they coordinated their priorities withthe U.S.  Attorney.  We asked the state prosecutors how the U.S. Attorney coordinated priorities with them and how the priorities ofthe U.S.  Attorney affected the operations of their offices. Investigative agency interviewees included field personnel for theJustice investigative agencies.  These were the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), andImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  We interviewedrepresentatives of the Treasury Department investigative agencies. These agencies were the Secret Service, Customs Service, InternalRevenue Service (IRS) Criminal Division, and the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  We also interviewed representatives fromtwo other judgmentally selected agencies in each district.  Wepretested these interview instruments with selected law enforcementpersonnel in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York and theDistrict of Maryland before we used them in the other locations. Table I.3 lists the judgmentally selected agencies we selected tointerview in each field location.

ANALYSIS OF EOUSA STATISTICS ONCRIMINAL CASELOADS AND WORKLOADSNATIONWIDE AND FOR EIGHT U.S. ATTORNEYS' OFFICES========================================================== Appendix II   U.S.  ATTORNEYS' CRIMINAL   CASELOADS AND WORKLOADS VARIED-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1Analysis of the Executive Office of U.S.  Attorneys' (EOUSA)statistics on criminal caseloads and workloads for each of the eightU.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited showed that most cases filed andtime spent corresponded to the stated priorities of the U.S. Attorneys.  Criminal caseload and workload were concentrated in 3broad program areas in these offices and for the 93 U.S.  Attorneys'Offices nationwide.  These areas were drug,\1economic/white-collar,\2 and violent crimes.\3 The eight offices wevisited also had organizational units dedicated to at least two ofthese three program areas. Caseloads and attorney time spent within the three broad programareas of drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crimes varied inthe offices we visited.  For example, drug cases filed ranged from 13percent to 49 percent of the total criminal caseload in theseoffices.  Attorney time spent on economic/white-collar crimeprosecutions ranged from 25 percent to 48 percent of total attorneytime spent on criminal prosecutions. Our caseload analysis was based on statistics on criminal cases filedby U.S.  Attorneys in federal district courts during fiscal year1993.  Based on discussions with headquarters and districtinformation management system personnel, cases filed appeared to bethe most reliable statistic in the EOUSA case management system.  Ourworkload analysis used EOUSA resource summary reports through whichU.S.  Attorneys reported on the number of full-time equivalentattorney positions and the amount of time spent in various crimecategories.  Because we had concerns about the accuracy of thisinformation, both data sets should be viewed as general indicators ofcaseload and workload.  (See pp.  18 through 24.)--------------------\1 Drug offenses include drug dealing, drug possession, and crimesprosecuted through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forceprogram. \2 Economic/White-collar crimes include official corruption;health-care fraud; environmental, health, and safety crimes;financial institution fraud; and other frauds, such as telemarketing,computer, securities, and bankruptcy. \3 Violent crimes include firearms violations, bank robbery, andother violent crimes.    ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES   FOCUS ON THREE BROAD CRIME   AREAS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2The predominance of drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crimeprosecutions in U.S.  Attorneys' caseloads and workloads isconsistent with the organizational structure and concentration ofresources in the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited.  Alleight of the offices had units dedicated to at least two of the threemajor crime areas.  The eight offices all had specialized units fordrug prosecutions.  They all also had units dedicated to specifictypes of economic/white-collar crime, such as financial institutionfraud, business/securities fraud, or public corruption.  Within theviolent crime program area, one of the offices had a specializedviolent criminal enterprises unit.  Two other offices conductedviolent crime prosecutions under a narcotics and violent crime unit. The other five districts prosecuted violent crimes throughnonspecialized units, such as a general crimes unit. Similarly, the resources attached to these units accounted for asubstantial portion, and in some cases, a majority of the resourcesof the offices' criminal divisions.  In seven districts for whichdata were available, 51 percent of the criminal division prosecutorswere assigned to units dedicated to drug, economic/white-collar, andviolent crimes.  In four of those seven districts, more than half ofthe prosecutors were assigned to those three crime areas.    MOST CASES FILED IN COURT BY   U.S.  ATTORNEYS INVOLVED DRUG,   ECONOMIC/WHITE-COLLAR, AND   VIOLENT CRIMES-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3As shown in Figure II.1, nationwide about 28.5 percent of all casesfiled involved drug crimes, about 28.8 percent involvedeconomic/white-collar crimes, and about 15.6 percent involved violentcrimes.  The remaining 27.1 percent of cases filed involved othertypes of prosecutions, including organized crime, immigration, and awide range of other federal criminal violations.

However, the percentage of case filings for eachof the three crime areas varied widely among the eight districts.

MOST ATTORNEY TIME WAS SPENT ON   DRUG, ECONOMIC/WHITE-COLLAR,   AND VIOLENT CRIME CASES-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4As shown in Figure II.14, in fiscal year 1993, nationwide about 32percent of criminal prosecutors' time was spent on drug cases, about32 percent was spent on economic/white-collar cases, and about 11percent was spent on violent crime cases.  The remaining 25 percentof the criminal prosecutors' time was spent on other types of cases,including organized crime, immigration, criminal forfeitures andappeals, and other criminal violations.

Source:  GAO analysis of EOUSA data. Criminal prosecutors in the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visitedspent most of their time working in the three large programareas--drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crimes.  In each ofthese offices, the combined total time devoted by prosecutors tothese three program areas accounted for a substantial majority of theoffice's total prosecutive time--from 61 percent in the EasternDistrict of New York to 82 percent in the District of Maryland.

While the largest amount of attorney time in all of the districts wasspent in the three large program areas combined, time devoted to eacharea varied among districts, particularly for drug andeconomic/white-collar crime prosecutions.  For example, the amount ofattorney time spent on drug cases ranged from the equivalent of 26percent of attorney positions in the Central District of Californiaand the Northern District of Texas to 37 percent in the SouthernDistrict of Florida and the District of Maryland.  Attorney timespent on economic/white-collar crimes ranged from the equivalent of25 percent of attorney positions in the Eastern District of New Yorkto 48 percent in the Northern District of Texas.  The amount ofattorney time spent on violent crime ranged from the equivalent of 4percent of attorney positions in the Southern District of Florida andthe Eastern and Southern Districts of New York to 12 percent ofattorney positions in the Central District of California. Figures II.23 through II.26 compare the percent of attorney timespent in the three largest program areas in each of the districts tothe percent of attorney time spent nationally.

GAO COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:51.  While we discussed the role of the Attorney General's AdvisoryCommittee of U.S.  Attorneys as a forum for U.S.  Attorneys to haveinput into setting national prosecutive priorities, we did notexplore the involvement of this group in coordinating prioritiesamong Justice components because we focused on coordination among lawenforcement agencies at the level of individual U.S.  Attorneydistricts. 2.  We noted that priorities were communicated to U.S.  Attorneysthrough a variety of forums, including most of those EOUSA cited. Among the forums we cited as examples were Attorney General andJustice directives, training sessions, seminars, and conferences. (See p.  8.)3.  We recognized that Law Enforcement Coordination Committees (LECC)were important forums of inter-district communication in several ofthe U.S.  Attorney districts we visited.  We referred to LECCsbroadly as law enforcement meetings when citing them as forums forU.S.  Attorneys to communicate priorities to federal, state, andlocal investigative agency personnel.  (See p.  14.)4.  We agree that we had no means of assessing whether evaluatorsreviewed how U.S.  Attorneys addressed national priorities but thendid not mention their findings in their written reports.  We reviewedfinal evaluation reports, but we were not provided with evaluators'working papers and notes. 5.  While we devoted some attention to efforts by EOUSA to improvethe accuracy of its case management data, including discussion ofactions taken in various phases of its "Operation Garbage Out"program, we did not note specifically that EOUSA sent U.S.  Attorneyserror listings on a periodic basis.

GrassleyUnited States SenateAt your request, we identified programs in the Department ofDefense's (DOD) future funding plans for fiscal years 1995-99 for the13 broad categories you selected.  The categories areenvironmental (includes environmental cleanup, compliance, andrestoration);defense conversion (includes funding to advance manufacturing andother technologies, to encourage the development of dual-usetechnologies, and for other programs;DOD dependents schools and Junior ROTC;basic research (includes programs to advance basic and appliedresearch in universities and DOD laboratories);counter-drug programs;humanitarian and foreign assistance programs;civilian separation pay and military temporary early retirementauthority;grants to universities and colleges;operation of the 89th Military Airlift Wing at Andrews Air ForceBase;medical education and noncombat-related medical research;support for foreign military sales;antiterrorism activities; andpay and allowances to incarcerated military personnel.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1DOD planned funding of about $13 billion to $15 billion annually forprograms in these 13 categories when the President submitted hisfiscal year 1995 budget in February 1994.  Program estimates may havechanged as a result of congressional action and subsequentadjustments to the Future Years Defense Program.\1 We list theprograms included in these categories in appendix I and describe theprograms in appendix II. Over half of the planned funds for these programs are in theoperations and maintenance account, which traditionally has fundedcombat training and other readiness-related items.  The largest partof the remaining funds are in the research, development, test, andevaluation (RDT&E) account. --------------------\1 DOD was unable to provide us the fiscal years 1996-2001 FutureYears Defense Program in time to include more current estimates inthis report.    PLANNED FUNDING FOR THE   CATEGORIES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2The planned funding estimates for 12 of the 13 categories for fiscalyears 1995-99 are shown in table 1.  DOD was unable to provideplanned funding estimates for pay and allowances to incarceratedmilitary personnel, so we discuss this category separately.  We alsopresent data reported by the Congressional Research Service onprograms that were earmarked by Congress.

Note:  Totals may not add due to rounding.       PAY AND ALLOWANCES TO      INCARCERATED MILITARY      PERSONNEL---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1DOD could not provide future funding estimates for its pay andallowances to incarcerated military personnel.  However, the DefenseFinance and Accounting Service estimates that DOD currently paysabout $1 million monthly to over 750 prisoners. Most military personnel in confinement continue to receive pay andallowances while awaiting trial or other disposition.  Someincarcerated military personnel continue to receive pay andallowances after a sentence has been rendered.  Any forfeiture of payis determined by court members or military judges within prescribedguidelines.  Under Section 857 of Title 10 of the United States Code,forfeiture may not be applied to any pay or allowances accrued beforea convening authority approves the sentence.       FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS      EARMARKED BY CONGRESS IN THE      FISCAL YEAR 1995 BUDGET---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2In October 1994, the Congressional Research Service reported onprograms in the fiscal year 1995 defense legislation that were notrequested by DOD but were earmarked by Congress.\2 While they may notbe programmed in DOD's future funding plans, some of these programswould qualify for inclusion in the environmental and medical researchcategories.  For example,Congress earmarked $103 million for environmental cleanup,conservation, or compliance at a number of military activities. Congress earmarked $307 million for medical research.  This included$150 million for breast cancer research, $50 million for cooperativeDOD and Veterans Administration medical research, $40 million forwomen's health research, and $34 million for bone marrow research. --------------------\2 "Items in FY 1995 defense legislation that may not be directlyrelated to traditional military capabilities" (Oct.  31, 1994).    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3Funding projections through fiscal year 1999 were drawn primarilyfrom the 1995 Future Years Defense Program published in February1994.\3 Program descriptions were taken primarily from the DOD FutureYears Defense Program Structure Handbook.  We verified our data withthe Office of the Comptroller, DOD.  In addition to our work at DOD,we interviewed officials and reviewed pertinent reports from theCongressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service. Data on payments to incarcerated military personnel were obtainedfrom the military services and the Defense Finance and AccountingService in Crystal City, Virginia.  We did not obtain written agencycomments.  However, we discussed a draft of this report withresponsible agency officials and have included their comments asappropriate. We conducted our review in January and February 1995 in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards. --------------------\3 Program estimates in DOD's Future Years Defense Program areexpressed in total obligational authority.  Total obligationalauthority is the sum of (a) new budget authority provided for a givenfiscal year; (b) any balances brought forward from prior years thatmay remain available for obligation; and (c) any other amountsauthorized to be credited to a specific fund or account during thatyear, including transfers between funds or accounts. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1We are providing copies of this report to appropriate House andSenate Committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Air Force, theArmy, and the Navy; and the Director, Office of Management andBudget.

Next tothe program titles are the corresponding program element numbers thatappear in the Future Years Defense Program.    ENVIRONMENTAL-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1      ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE      (0101856, 0202056, 0702856,      AND NUMEROUS OTHER PROGRAM      ELEMENTS)------------------------------------------------------ Appendix II:1.1This program includes activities relating to environmentalcompliance, conservation, pollution prevention, and the developmentof environmental technology.  Costs required to comply withapplicable environmental laws, regulations, criteria, and standardsinclude:  workforce, training, travel, supplies, permits, fees,support equipment, and service and construction contracts.       ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION      (0708008)------------------------------------------------------ Appendix II:1.2This program covers active and formerly used DOD lands.  It includesidentification, investigation, and cleanup of contamination fromhazardous substances and waste; correction of other environmentaldamage at formerly owned or used sites, such as unexploded ordnancedetection and disposal; demolition and removal of unsafe buildingsand structures; debris removal; and reductions in DOD's hazardouswaste generation.  The program includes workforce, equipment,facilities, and the associated costs specifically identified andmeasurable to the Defense Environmental Restoration Program.       BRAC CLEANUP COSTS (INCLUDED      IN OVERALL BRAC FUNDING      0208004)------------------------------------------------------ Appendix II:1.3This program comprises environmental cleanup activities at DOD basesselected to be closed under the base realignment and closure plan. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, andLiability Act, the U.S.  government cannot transfer land outsidefederal ownership until it warrants that all remedial actionnecessary to protect human health and the environment has been taken.    DEFENSE CONVERSION-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2      DEFENSE REINVESTMENT      (0603570)------------------------------------------------------ Appendix II:2.1This program includes RDT&E funds to support advanced,pre-competitive undertakings that enhance U.S.  technologiesidentified in the DOD Critical Technologies Plan.  The program's goalis to enhance the industrial manufacturing capabilities of U.S. industry and promote the development of critical dual-usetechnologies and advanced manufacturing processes.

FordRanking Minority MemberSubcommittee on Human ResourcesCommittee on Ways and MeansHouse of RepresentativesDear Mr.  Ford: Foster children are among the most vulnerable individuals in thewelfare population.  As a group, they are sicker than homelesschildren and children living in the poorest sections of inner cities. Of particular concern is the health of young foster children sinceconditions left untreated during the first 3 years of life caninfluence functioning into adulthood and impede a child's ability tobecome self-sufficient later in life.  Yet, little comprehensiveinformation is available about the provision of health-relatedservices to meet the needs of young foster children. Last year, we reported that the population of young fosterchildren--those 36 months of age and younger--changed significantlybetween the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\1 The average monthlynumber of children in foster care nationwide increased 53 percent,from 280,000 to 429,000, during this period.  The total foster carepopulation in the three states reviewed increased 66 percent between1986 and 1991, while the number of young foster children more thandoubled--increasing by 110 percent.  In addition, we found that agreater proportion of young children entered the system because ofsome form of neglect; came from families where at least one of theparents was abusing drugs; had serious health-related problems; andwere at risk for future problems as a result of prenatal drugexposure. Understanding the ability of state child welfare agencies to meet theneeds of foster children is critical as policymakers considerrestructuring federal welfare policies and responsibilities.  Federalmonies are currently used to assist states with the cost of fostercare.  Legislation being considered by the 104th Congress would givethe states even greater responsibility for foster children throughblock grants. Our earlier work responded to your request that we compare andcontrast the population sizes and distinctive characteristics ofyoung foster children between 1986 and 1991.  This report responds tothe remaining issues in that request regarding the service needs ofyoung foster children.  Specifically, this report providesinformation on (1) the health-related services needed and received byyoung children in foster care, (2) the relationship between thereceipt of health-related services and foster care placements withrelatives versus placements with nonrelatives, and (3) whatresponsible agencies are doing to ensure that these children arereceiving needed health-related services. To develop this information we reviewed foster care programs inCalifornia, New York, and Pennsylvania, the states with the largestaverage monthly foster care populations in 1991.  In addition, weanalyzed random samples of case files from Los Angeles County, NewYork City,\2 and Philadelphia County from a combined population of22,755 young foster children.  These locations cared for asubstantial portion of each state's young foster children:  44percent in California, 81 percent in New York, and 29 percent inPennsylvania.  We analyzed electronic databases as provided to us bystate and county officials to select our samples and determine thenumber of children placed with relatives and nonrelatives.  Our scopeand methodology are discussed further in appendix I. --------------------\1 We reported on young foster children in Los Angeles County, NewYork City, and Philadelphia County.  See Foster Care:  Parental DrugAbuse Has Alarming Impact on Young Children (GAO/HEHS-94-89, Apr.  4,1994). \2 New York City comprises five boroughs and is treated in the statedatabase as a county.  In this report, we refer to it as a county.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Our work indicates that a significant proportion of young fosterchildren did not receive critical health-related services in thethree locations reviewed--Los Angeles County, New York City, andPhiladelphia County.  Despite state and county foster care agencyregulations requiring comprehensive routine health care,\3 anestimated 12 percent of young foster children received no routinehealth care, 34 percent received no immunizations, and 32 percent hadat least some identified health needs that were not met. Furthermore, an estimated 78 percent of young foster children were athigh risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result ofparental drug abuse, yet only an estimated 9 percent of young fosterchildren were tested for it.  Early identification of HIV-infectedchildren begins with HIV risk assessment.  Without earlyidentification, HIV-infected children with mild or no symptoms cannotreceive the early medical care that is known to be effective withyoung children. We also found that young foster children placed with relativesreceived fewer health-related services of all kinds than childrenplaced with nonrelative foster parents.  Other research indicatesthat relative caregivers often receive less monitoring and assistancefrom caseworkers.  For California and New York--the states whereplacement data were available--the number of young children placedwith relatives increased by 379 percent between 1986 and 1991, whilethe number of young children placed with nonrelative foster parentsincreased by 54 percent.  Consequently, because a larger number offoster children were placed with relatives in 1991 than in 1986,substantially more children were subjected to the lower likelihood ofreceiving services associated with kinship care. Local foster care agencies continue to grapple with designingprograms to meet the health-related service needs of children.  Inthe locations reviewed, agencies have revised health-related fostercare regulations and modified their programs in efforts to improvethe delivery of health care to foster children.  Although theDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently increased itstechnical assistance to states by contracting for National ResourceCenters,\4 none is designated to assist states with health-relatedprograms for foster children.  Furthermore, while HHS audits statesfor compliance with federally mandated safeguards for fosterchildren, these audits omit review of compliance with health-relatedsafeguards.  Given the importance of health care during the first 3years of life, an improved response to the health needs of thisvulnerable population is vital. --------------------\3 County foster care regulations state the frequency for required,comprehensive medical examinations for well children.  We refer tothis type of examination as comprehensive routine health care. \4 The National Resource Centers assist HHS' Administration forChildren and Families staff in responding to states' questions andprovide free technical assistance to states.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2Responsibility for providing care and services to foster children isshared by federal, state, and county governments, with HHS havingresponsibility for oversight of federal foster care programs.  TheAdministration for Children and Families (ACF) within HHS helps thestates to develop plans required under title IV-B of the SocialSecurity Act; reviews and approves those plans; conducts audits tocertify states' compliance with the safeguards for foster children,thereby making states eligible for additional federal funds; andallocates funds to states, among other duties. The Social Security Act of 1935 was amended twice to includesafeguards for foster children.  The Adoption Assistance and ChildWelfare Act of 1980 (P.L.  96-272) added most of thesesafeguards--such as requirements that the case file contain a planfor appropriate care and services, as determined by state and localfoster care policies; periodic court or administrative reviews; and areunification program to return children to their parents.  This actalso authorized HHS to provide technical assistance to aid states indeveloping programs to meet the requirements of the law. Furthermore, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-239) added other safeguards to the Social Security Act, includinga requirement to maintain health records for foster children. A combination of federal, state, and county funds may be used toprovide services to young foster children.  States may participate infederal programs authorized by the Social Security Act such as titleIV-B, matching grants for various child welfare services; title IV-E,an uncapped entitlement for a portion of the maintenance of fosterchildren who are eligible under the Aid to Families With DependentChildren (AFDC) program; title XIX, Medicaid, an entitlement for aportion of medical services; or title XX, block grants for a widearray of social services for children.  In addition, the Education ofthe Handicapped Act, part H, authorizes grants to states for earlyintervention programs for handicapped infants and toddlers. Except for federal title IV-E expenditures, data were unavailable toestimate federal, state, and county expenditures for services forfoster children.  In the last 10 years, federal title IV-Eexpenditures for the administration and maintenance of AFDC-eligiblefoster children increased from about $546 million in 1985 to anestimated $2.9 billion in 1995.  When foster children do not meettitle IV-E eligibility for federal funding, states must bear the fullcost for maintaining these children.  However, some states pass atleast a portion of these costs to their counties.    YOUNG FOSTER CHILDREN IN THE   LOCATIONS REVIEWED DID NOT   ALWAYS RECEIVE NEEDED   HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3All young children need routine, comprehensive medical monitoring,treatment for minor illnesses, and immunizations to grow up healthy. In the three locations reviewed, state and county regulations requirethat children in foster care receive periodic medical examinationsand treatment.\5 Research indicates that children at risk for serioushealth problems as a result of prenatal drug exposure often needadditional assessments and specialized care.  Child developmentexperts generally agree that health care is particularly importantduring the first 36 months of life as language, motor, psychological,and social skills develop.  Conditions left untreated during thefirst 3 years of life can influence functioning into adulthood. Some young foster children in the locations we reviewed did notreceive even the most basic health service--required routine care. In addition, many children had identified health-related needs thatwere not met, including the need for specialized services.  Fostercare agencies refer foster parents to community-based programs andpractitioners, rather than providing the services directly.  Fosterchildren in the locations reviewed are eligible for Medicaid to coverthe cost of these health-related community-based services. --------------------\5 Regulations include a requirement that children receive an initialexamination when they enter foster care.  Los Angeles County and NewYork City require an examination within 30 days of entry into fostercare; Philadelphia County requires an examination within 60 days. Children who received a comprehensive examination within 90 daysbefore entering foster care are exempt from this requirement.       ROUTINE HEALTH CARE MAY NOT      BE ENSURED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1Despite state and county foster care regulations, comprehensiveroutine health care for young foster children may not be ensured. Specifically, an estimated 12 percent of the children received noroutine health care, and 34 percent received no immunizations in thethree locations reviewed.  Furthermore, case files at all threelocations did not reflect the exact nature or extent of what serviceswere provided in many cases.  Thus, children we noted as havingreceived routine medical care may have received as little care as onevisit with a physician for treatment of a minor illness rather thancomprehensive or ongoing medical care.  (See table II.1 in app.  II.)While Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT)services are one way to ensure that children receive comprehensivemedical examinations, only an estimated 1 percent of the young fosterchildren in the locations reviewed received EPSDT services.  EPSDTservices are specific, comprehensive medical examinations andfollow-up treatment that states must offer to Medicaid-eligiblechildren.  EPSDT examinations can serve as an effective safeguard ofa child's overall health and development and as a gateway to otherhealth-related services.  (See table II.1 in app.  II.)Children with no known health problems were less likely to receiveroutine care than children who were at risk for or had serious healthproblems.\6 For the locations reviewed, an estimated 28 percent ofthe children with no known serious health problems did not receiveany health-related services.  By comparison, only 6 percent ofchildren who were at high risk for serious health problems because ofprenatal drug exposure and 2 percent of children with seriousphysical health problems did not receive any health-related services. Without routine health care, children with no known health problemsare not monitored to identify and treat health and developmentalproblems as they occur.  (See table II.2 in app.  II.)--------------------\6 Serious health problems of children in our review include fetalalcohol syndrome, low birth weight, cardiac defects or heartproblems, HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), anddevelopmental delays.       SPECIALIZED HEALTH NEEDS OF      YOUNG FOSTER CHILDREN WERE      UNMET---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2In addition to routine health care, young foster children need manyspecialized health-related services.  As we previously reported, anestimated 58 percent of young foster children in the three locationsreviewed had serious physical health problems, and 62 percent were athigh risk for serious health problems as a result of prenatal drugexposure.  Many of these children may need health-related servicesand treatment beyond those needed by the average child.  (See fig.  1and table II.3 inapp.  II.)   Figure 1:  Specialized Services   Received in Three Counties   (See figure in printed   edition.)\a Includes treatment for asthma, syphilis, seizures, and kidneyproblems. \b Includes blood, laboratory, and radiology. \c Includes developmental, psychological, and cardiological. \d Includes care for HIV, pneumonia, and failure to thrive, as wellas surgery. \e Includes apnea monitors, infant stimulation, and speech therapy. \f Includes therapeutic day care and Head Start services. Source:  Case file review. Although young foster children received a wide variety of servicesfrom health care providers, many children had identifiedhealth-related needs that were not met.  Based on informationcollected from case files, we matched the health-related needsidentified and the services received for each child and estimatedthat one-third of the children in the locations reviewed had someidentified needs that were not met.\7 These unmet needs includedpulmonary and speech therapy; psychotherapy; developmentalassessments; infant stimulation services; cardiological, urological,and neurological examinations; and testing for sickle cell anemia,syphilis, and HIV.  (See fig.  2 and table II.4 in app.  II.)   Figure 2:  Extent to Which   Identified Needs Were Met in   Three Counties   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Point estimates do not total 100 percent because of roundingand records lacking data on identified needs. \a The point estimates for the three locations varied widely in thesetwo categories. Source:  Case file review. Of those children with no identified health-related needs, aboutone-half in each location received no routine health care, and lessthan one-half received a toxicology screen at birth to detect recentprenatal drug exposure.  Thus, many of these children may have hadhealth-related needs that were not identified and, consequently, werenot met. --------------------\7 The number of identified needs per child ranged from 1 to 14 andaveraged approximately 5.    HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN NEED TO   BE IDENTIFIED EARLY, BUT RISK   ASSESSMENTS OFTEN DID NOT TAKE   PLACE------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4One particularly critical health need of young foster children is HIVrisk assessment\8 because most young children in the locationsreviewed are at risk for the infection as a result of parental drugabuse.  Without risk assessment, a child's HIV status may not bedetermined early because HIV-infected children can remainasymptomatic or exhibit only minimal signs of infection for years. Recent medical advances in early identification and treatment canenhance and prolong the lives of these children.  Earlyidentification is also critical because HIV-infected children shouldreceive modified immunizations to prevent adverse reactions, andtheir exposure to infectious illnesses such as measles or chickenpox--which are particularly hazardous to these children--should beminimized. While state laws, and the county policies based on them, do notprohibit HIV testing or the disclosure of test results, some canhamper HIV testing and disclosure.  State laws and county foster carepolicies, where they exist, vary widely.  In some locations,including the three reviewed, these laws and policies impede HIVtesting and disclosure by specifying the risk factors that must bepresent in order to request HIV testing; who has the authority toconsent to testing; and to whom HIV test results can be disclosed. For example, for the 36 states with HIV testing policies as of 1992,one-half of the foster care agencies in the states with testingpolicies may not have authority to consent to an HIV test for achild, even when the child was identified by the agency as being athigh risk for HIV. --------------------\8 An HIV risk assessment compares a child's family history andhealth condition against the foster care agency's specified HIV riskfactors to make an informed determination about whether a childshould be tested for HIV.       THE NUMBER OF HIV-INFECTED      CHILDREN IS LARGELY UNKNOWN      AS FEW CHILDREN ARE TESTED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1Foster care agencies in the locations reviewed do not know the fullextent of their caseloads that is at high risk for HIV since nomechanism exists to ensure that all young foster children areassessed for HIV risk.  While two of the three locations we reviewedcurrently have some HIV risk assessment requirements, one locationdid not require risk assessments for all foster children untilrecently, and the other has not implemented clear assessmentprocedures.  HIV risk has long been associated with intravenous druguse, but more recent research has established an equally strong linkbetween HIV risk and the lifestyle of nonintravenous cocaine andcrack users.  Using New York City's current HIV risk factors, whichinclude nonintravenous drug use, we assessed our 1991 population ofyoung foster children on the basis of one risk factor, parental drugabuse.  Accordingly, we estimated that at least 78 percent of thechildren in the three locations reviewed were at high risk for HIV. We estimated that only 9 percent of the young foster children in thelocations reviewed were actually tested for HIV, despite the largeproportion at high risk and statistics indicating that these arelocations with a high incidence of HIV.  The American Academy ofPediatrics Task Force on Pediatric AIDS recommends HIV testing forall foster children with high-risk factors or in areas with a highincidence of HIV to facilitate appropriate medical treatment andfollow-up.  We estimated the HIV infection rate for children born in1993 and found that the three states reviewed ranked 2nd, 14th, and26th, based on national data from the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) on blind HIV testing of newborns.  (See table II.5in app.  II.)Few data are available on the number of foster children infected withHIV.  One study reported that the number of foster children in NewYork City known to be born to HIV-infected mothers increased 26percent from 1991 to 1993.  While data were not available forCalifornia and Pennsylvania, 1988 research found that Los Angeles hadthe fastest growing rate of AIDS cases in the nation.  Furthermore,anecdotal evidence suggests that in the Los Angeles area, and thewest coast in general, most AIDS in women is due to heterosexualcontact.  However, according to experts on pediatric AIDS, fostercare agencies do not commonly recognize a history of high-riskheterosexual contact as sufficient grounds for HIV testing.    CHILDREN PLACED WITH RELATIVES   IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND NEW   YORK CITY WERE LESS LIKELY TO   RECEIVE HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Young children placed exclusively with relatives--known as kinshipcare--were less likely to receive health-related services thanchildren placed exclusively with nonrelatives--known as traditionalfoster care.\9 Specifically, children placed in kinship care werenearly three times as likely as those placed in traditional fostercare to have received no routine health care.  Moreover, thesechildren were less likely to receive health-related services of allkinds.  Since studies indicate that children in kinship care remainin foster care longer, and they receive a lower level of service, thelikelihood is greater that these children will go without neededservices for longer periods.  (See fig.  3 and table II.6 in app. II.)   Figure 3:  Services Received by   Placement Type in Los Angeles   County and New York City   (See figure in printed   edition.)\a Consists of varying amounts of medical practitioner care and/orEPSDT examinations. \b Includes children who received at least one immunization andexcludes children who were under 90 days of age. \c Differences are statistically significant at the 90-percentconfidence level. \d Includes treatment for asthma, syphilis, seizures, and kidneyproblems. \e Includes blood, laboratory, and radiology. \f Includes developmental, psychological, and cardiological. \g Includes care for HIV, pneumonia, and failure to thrive, as wellas surgery. \h Includes apnea monitors, infant stimulation, and speech therapy. \i Includes therapeutic day care and Head Start services. \j Consists of children placed exclusively in traditional fostercare. \k Consists of children placed exclusively in kinship care. Young children placed in kinship care in the two locations reviewedwere also an estimated three times more likely than those placed intraditional foster care to be at risk for future problems because ofprenatal drug exposure.\10 Furthermore, because drug-exposed childrenare more likely to be at risk for HIV and developmental delays, theneed for health-related services for children in kinship care is evenmore critical.  Yet, only 11 percent of children placed exclusivelyin kinship care received specialized examinations, such asdevelopmental evaluations; whereas, 42 percent of those placedexclusively in traditional foster care received specializedexaminations.  (See table II.6 in app.  II.)While we did not determine why children in kinship care received lesshealth-related care, or compare other aspects of care by placementtype, we reviewed key studies on kinship care.  Research found thatfoster care agencies treat kinship care placements and traditionalfoster care placements differently.  Studies indicate thatcaseworkers generally provide less monitoring and assistance tokinship care placements.  Some states have policies requiring lessfrequent caseworker visitations to kinship care homes, although thesehomes are more likely to be unlicensed.  For example, a 1992 HHSstudy found that in 30 states, children may be placed in kinship carehomes whether or not the homes meet minimum standards designed toensure the safety and suitability of foster homes and foster parents. Mandatory orientation and training for foster parents are the mostfrequently waived licensing requirements for kinship caregivers.  A1994 Child Welfare League of America report on kinship care found fewstudies that focused on either kinship care providers or the childrenin their care.  These studies, which were limited in scope, providedlittle information regarding the advantages of different types ofplacement. --------------------\9 We used only Los Angeles County and New York City data in ouranalysis of county case file data regarding kinship and traditionalfoster care placements.  Because the sample for Philadelphia Countycontained only one child who was placed exclusively in kinship care,we eliminated that location from this analysis. \10 This analysis excluded children who were at risk for serioushealth problems and also had serious health conditions.  When thesechildren were included in the analysis, young children placedexclusively in kinship care were about as likely as those placedexclusively in traditional foster care to be at risk for futureproblems as a result of prenatal drug exposure.       KINSHIP CARE INCREASED      DRAMATICALLY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Analysis of the California and New York state databases showed thenumber of children of all ages in kinship care increased by over 350percent between 1986 and 1991, and this percentage increase was evenhigher for young foster children, at 379 percent.\11 (See fig.  4 andtable II.7 in app.  II.)   Figure 4:  Increase in Kinship   and Traditional Foster Care in   California and New York Between   1986 and 1991   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Counts represent all children in foster care at the end of thecalendar years. \a Part of the increase in kinship care placements is due to alawsuit filed in the New York Supreme Court, Eugene F.  v.  Gross,which sought to require New York City to follow regulations toformally include children who are placed with relatives in the fostercare caseload and make them eligible for services. Source:  State electronic databases. The dramatic increase of children in kinship care between 1986 and1991 resulted in nearly equal numbers of placements in kinship andtraditional foster care in the three counties reviewed.  We estimatedthat 49 percent of the young children had been placed in kinship careat some time during the 1991 review period, while 53 percent had beenplaced in traditional foster care.  (See table II.8 in app.  II.)Some studies contend that the increase in kinship placements may havebeen due, at least initially, to a shortage of traditional fosterhomes.  Other studies posit that this increase may be the result ofstate and county interpretations of the Adoption Assistance and ChildWelfare Act of 1980 as implying a preference for relative placements. In recognizing that foster care would continue to be a necessarychild welfare service, this act required states to place children inthe "least restrictive (most family-like) setting available," whichhas been interpreted by many states as implying a preference forkinship care.  As of 1992, 44 states commonly placed foster childrenin kinship care, and 29 states had policies in place requiring fostercare agencies to give preference to relatives of foster children. --------------------\11 Pennsylvania does not have a statewide foster care database.    HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF FOSTER   CHILDREN OFTEN GO UNMET DESPITE   AGENCY EFFORTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6The foster care agencies reviewed struggle to ensure that thehealth-related needs of children in their care are met.  Aboutone-third of all states, including the three reviewed, haveestablished only broad guidelines within which counties administerfoster care programs.  Thus, counties in these states develop andimplement programs with considerable autonomy, which results in avariety of approaches being used. County foster care agencies in the locations reviewed have alteredtheir health-related policies, regulations, and programs in effortsto improve the agencies' ability to meet the health needs of fosterchildren.  For example, one of the foster care agencies we reviewedcontinues to develop and implement recordkeeping systems in anattempt to improve its ability to ensure that foster children receiveneeded services.  The agency is currently implementing its thirdvariation of a medical recordkeeping system in recent years. Implementation of the first two versions was unsuccessful, and thethird was too recently implemented for us to determine its success. However, because the third version is substantially similar to itspredecessors, its likelihood of success is limited. Other efforts by this agency have focused on establishing medicalclinics for foster children.  It established a comprehensiveassessment center at the county-run children's emergency shelter, butthat effort appears to have met with only limited success.  Medicalstaff at the center told us that it is seldom used by foster childrenof any age who reside outside the shelter.  The foster care agency isalso supporting the development of an ambitious and complex system ofmultidisciplinary assessment and medical clinics for foster children. This most recent effort, while promising, depends on factors largelyoutside the control of the foster care agency, such as the continuinginvolvement of the academia-based physicians who proposed the systemand the viability of a complex design for funding services. Furthermore, the system needs strong support from within the agencyand procedures that direct foster children to the new systemif--unlike the current assessment center--it is to reach even asustainable level of utilization. Recognizing that states need assistance in improving their childwelfare programs, including foster care, ACF recently increased itstechnical assistance efforts.  Within the past year, HHS contractedfor 10 National Resource Centers to assist ACF staff in responding tostates' questions and to provide free technical assistance to states. Each resource center specializes in a child welfare issue such aspermanency planning, abandoned infants, or special needs adoption. However, none of the resource centers is designated to help stateswith ensuring health-related services for foster children. ACF also audits states to certify states' compliance with thesafeguards for foster children specified in the Social Security Act. However, the audits do not examine compliance with all safeguards. The safeguards include a requirement that case files of fosterchildren contain up-to-date health-related information, such asrecords of immunizations and a child's health conditions.  Wepreviously reported that HHS did not audit states on their compliancewith all required safeguards for foster children, and we recommendedthat it expand its audits to include all safeguards.\12In March 1995, ACF officials confirmed that their audits still do notexamine whether states are complying with the health-relatedsafeguards.  An HHS determination that a state has passed itscompliance audit entitles the state to receive the full federal childwelfare funding available by law.  However, since HHS does not auditfor compliance with the health-related safeguards, states have nofederal financial incentive to comply with them.  ACF plans toinclude these safeguards in future audits, according to the sameofficials. --------------------\12 Foster Care:  Incomplete Implementation of the Reforms andUnknown Effectiveness (GAO/PEMD-89-17, Aug.  14, 1989).    CONCLUSIONS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7Important health-related needs, including routine medicalexaminations and various specialized services, remained unmet fornearly one-third of the young foster children in the locationsreviewed.  Additionally, most young foster children in the locationsreviewed were at high risk for HIV as a result of parental drugabuse, yet few children were actually tested for the infection. Furthermore, those in kinship care were less likely than those placedin traditional foster care to receive needed health-related services. Despite federal safeguards for foster children, as well asregulations of responsible agencies to ensure adequate health carefor foster children, agencies continue to struggle to meet thecomplex health needs of young children.  Federal efforts to helpstates design and implement effective foster care health programshave been extremely limited, as evidenced by the lack of both ACFaudits and technical assistance to states on health-related issues. Our work confirms our earlier recommendation that ACF audits beexpanded to include all foster care safeguards.  We continue tobelieve that ACF should take this action. Finally, foster care agencies have been slow to respond to onecritical health need--HIV risk assessment--which is the first step inidentifying HIV-infected children so that they can receiveappropriate and timely health care.  Yet, even if all foster childrenwere systematically assessed, HIV testing of high-risk children canstill be hampered by state laws and county policies.  Finally, whilewe do not know why children in kinship care generally receive fewerhealth-related services than children in traditional care, researchindicates that kinship caregivers receive less monitoring andassistance from foster care agencies than traditional fostercaregivers. These findings are particularly disturbing given the vulnerablenature of the population of young foster children.  Whether thefederal government retains the foster care program in its currentform or creates block grants to the states, these issues warrantattention.    AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR   EVALUATION------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8We provided HHS as well as the cognizant social services agencies ofthe three states and locations reviewed with the opportunity tocomment on a draft of this report.  We received comments\13 from thestate of New York, New York City, and Los Angeles County. Philadelphia County responded that it could not comment on thespecifics of the report because of a pending lawsuit.  However, itindicated a few general concerns.  We did not receive comments fromHHS, the state of California, or the state of Pennsylvania. One aspect of our report was commented on by three respondents.  NewYork State, Los Angeles County, and Philadelphia County expressedconcern about the age of our data.  While our report is based on 1991data, those were the most current data available when the studybegan.  To ensure the continuing usefulness of the data and otheraspects of our study, we continued to monitor the locations reviewedthrough spring 1995 to determine if any changes in policies andprograms had occurred that could substantially alter our conclusions. While some promising changes have occurred, either the locations thatprovided comments to our draft provided us with no data to supporttheir assertions that the delivery of services has improved or it istoo early to determine the impact of the changes.  For example, NewYork City commented that it is implementing a state early careintervention program and has trained staff in the use of the program. However, it is too early to judge the impact of this new effort. Another aspect of our report was commented on by two respondents. New York State and Philadelphia County questioned the appropriatenessof combining the results of our analysis of cases across the threelocations reviewed.  As we stated in the report, we determined thatthe conclusions drawn from our analysis were similar for eachlocation with two exceptions:  Philadelphia County was dropped fromanalyses of kinship care, and data depicted in figure 2 included twocategories where the results varied widely by location.  With theseexceptions, the results were sufficiently consistent across all threelocations that we do not believe that presenting the aggregateresults unfairly portrays the situations in any of the locations. --------------------\13 We received comments from the New York State Department of SocialServices, the New York City Human Resources Administration, the LosAngeles County Department of Children and Family Services, and thePhiladelphia Department of Human Services.       THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND      NEW YORK CITY COMMENTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.1The state of New York questioned the adequacy of the sample size.  Wearrived at our sample size using accepted statistical procedures thatgave us an adequate level of precision at the 95-percent confidencelevel to support our findings.  Our detailed methodology is presentedin appendix I and the confidence intervals are presented in appendixII. The state also expressed doubts about the accuracy of several of ourstatistical findings, conveying its belief that an ongoing statestudy regarding foster care medical services will produce differentresults.  It believes that its ongoing study will produce a morefavorable picture of its ability to meet the needs of fosterchildren.  However, we cannot evaluate this opinion because the statedid not provide us with any results from this study.  Furthermore,the state provided little information on the methodology beingemployed, and we do not know whether the state plans to conduct suchanalyses as would make it possible to compare their results withours. New York City raised different issues related to our methodology.  Itquestioned whether inadequate caseworker recordkeeping provided anincomplete depiction of the health-related services received by youngfoster children.  Before beginning the case file review, to test thefeasibility of using this method, we reviewed the case files of asmall sample of children and then requested the foster care agenciesin the three locations reviewed to provide information on those samechildren from all possible sources, including service providers andfoster parents.  In general, we found that the additional informationprovided from these other sources did not change the conclusions wehad reached on the basis of our case file review regarding the levelof services these children received.  On this basis, we concludedthat the information in the case files would be sufficient for ouranalytical purposes. New York State agrees with the importance of risk assessment for HIVand agrees that it does not know the full extent of HIV-infectedchildren in foster care.  However, it disagrees that this occurs inNew York City because of a lack of a mechanism to carry out riskassessments.  Furthermore, the state asserted that more children arenow being assessed and tested for HIV as a result of changes in itspolicies.  We agree that this state has the most comprehensivepolicies on risk assessment of the three locations reviewed.  Forthis reason, we used a portion of their risk assessment policies ascriteria in one analysis.  However, the large gap we reported betweenthe number of children who were at risk for HIV, based on one NewYork City risk criterion, and the number actually tested indicatedthat the mechanisms in place did not ensure that their procedureswere consistently carried out.  While it is possible that recentchanges in New York State or New York City policies may have improvedthe ability to identify HIV-infected children, state officialspointed out that they have not been able to formally implementregulations that would put their latest policy changes in placebecause of a state moratorium on regulatory action. New York State agrees that children placed in kinship care were lesslikely to receive services than children placed in traditional fostercare, and this finding was confirmed by the state's own study. However, it disagrees with the inclusion in the report of data on thegrowth in kinship care because it asserts that such data do notreflect the proportion of children actually in kinship care andtraditional foster care.  We agree that it is useful to understandthe proportion of children in different types of care, and thisinformation is included in the report.  However, we believe thatpresenting data on the large growth in kinship care placementsbetween 1986 and 1991 is also useful to understand that theutilization of kinship care has changed significantly since themid-1980s. New York State agrees with our conclusion that periodic reviews forcompliance with federal standards are appropriate.  It also madetechnical comments on our characterizations of county versus stateregulations and of New York City as a county, and our description ofHIV testing policies.  On the basis of these comments, we modifiedthe report as appropriate.       LOS ANGELES COUNTY COMMENTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.2Los Angeles County commented that its current internal audits ofmedical assessments show that compliance is at approximately 90percent.  We agree with that estimate of the receipt of requiredmedical examinations, which we refer to as routine care.  As statedin our report, about 12 percent of young foster children did notreceive any routine health care; Los Angeles County's currentestimate of 10-percent noncompliance with its regulations regardingmedical assessments falls within our 95-percent confidence intervalcited in appendix II. Los Angeles County also commented that it has made a number ofchanges over the last few years that were designed to meet the healthcare needs of foster children.  Specifically, it discussed the HIVrisk assessment policy, the comprehensive multidisciplinaryassessment center it established at a children's emergency shelter,and the new system of multidisciplinary assessment and medicalclinics.  We acknowledge that Los Angeles County has a policy ofevaluation for risk of exposure to HIV as an ongoing process for allfoster children.  However, in September 1994, numerous county programofficials told us that the county has no procedures to systematicallyensure that risk assessments take place; consequently, this policydoes not ensure that foster children who are at high risk for HIVwill be identified and tested.  In addition, in fall 1994, we visitedthe assessment center at the children's emergency shelter andinterviewed key program officials and medical staff.  We acknowledgethat this assessment center was designed to provide a variety ofcomprehensive health-related evaluations.  However, as stated in ourreport, this assessment center is little used by foster children whoreside outside the emergency shelter.  Finally, as we stated in ourreport, we agree that the multidisciplinary medical clinics are apromising approach to meeting the complex health-related needs ofyoung foster children.  However, it was not until September 1994 thatthe first of the seven planned assessment center clinics was fundedto hire staff; thus, this system is in its infancy and issubstantially untested. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.3We will send copies of this letter to the Secretary of Health andHuman Services and program officials in the states reviewed.  We willalso send copies to all state welfare program directors and makecopies available to others on request.  Please contact me at (202)512-7215 if you or your staff have any questions.  Other GAO contactsand contributors are listed in appendix III. Sincerely yours,Jane L.  RossDirector, Income Security IssuesSCOPE AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix ITo accomplish the objectives of our review, we obtained and analyzeddata on state foster care programs and the children in them from thethree states with the largest average monthly foster care populationsin 1991--California, New York, and Pennsylvania.  Over 50 percent ofthe nation's foster children are under the jurisdiction of thesethree states. We used a variety of approaches to meet our objectives.  We analyzedelectronic state and county foster care databases; conducted a casefile review based on generalizable random samples; interviewed HHS,state, and county foster care officials; conducted a telephone surveyof child welfare advocacy groups and other child welfare experts;conducted group interviews with foster parents and caseworkers;reviewed foster care and related literature; reviewed applicableportions of the Social Security Act and other legislation; andreviewed foster care agency regulations and other documents.  Studiescited in this report are listed in the bibliography.    STATEWIDE DATA--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1To determine the number of foster children in different types ofplacements in the states, we analyzed electronic foster caredatabases for the two states where they were available, Californiaand New York.  State officials provided us with automated records forall children who were in foster care at any time during calendaryears 1986 and 1991.  We could not obtain comparable electronicrecords for Pennsylvania as that state has not established anautomated case record system.\14--------------------\14 For the three states reviewed, the 110-percent increase in youngfoster children that was previously reported combines data fromelectronic databases and aggregate state data.  For California andNew York, states with electronic databases, the counts are for fosterchildren under the age of 3 years.  For Pennsylvania, the count isfor foster children under the age of 5 years, as that state'saggregate data did not break out children under age 3 years.    COUNTY CASE FILE DATA--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2To determine the health-related services needed and received by youngfoster children, their health conditions, and the types of placementsthey were in, we reviewed statistically representative samples offoster care case files for the county with the largest foster carepopulation in 1991 for each of the states reviewed:  Los AngelesCounty, New York City,\15 and Philadelphia County.  To identify thoselocations, we again used the state foster care databases forCalifornia and New York; for Pennsylvania, we relied on informationprovided by state officials.  Philadelphia County officials providedus with an electronic database of the records for foster children inthat county in 1991. Before drawing the sample, we narrowed the databases to include onlyfoster children whose third birthday occurred no later than December31, 1991.  This resulted in population sizes of 8,249 for Los AngelesCounty, 13,171 for New York City, and 1,335 for Philadelphia County. Then we selected random samples from each of these locationsresulting in a total sample of 414 children.  The population sizesand initial sample sizes are shown in table I.1.                          Table I.1                    Initial Population and Sample Sizes for                  Children in Foster Care                                                Percentage                                                of initial                             Initial     Final      sample                Population    sample    sample        used--------------  ----------  --------  --------  ----------Los Angeles          8,249       137       114        83.2 CountyNew York City       13,171       150       142        94.7Philadelphia         1,335       127       104        81.9 County==========================================================Total               22,755       414       360      89.8\a----------------------------------------------------------\a Percentage total is a weighted average showing the percentage ofthe total population covered by the final samples. We requested all foster care case files for each child in the sample. A few cases were dropped from the sample because the children did notmeet the criterion of being in foster care during the review year orwere not of the appropriate age.  Other cases were dropped becausecounty officials could not locate the records.  Finally, we droppedcases of children who were in foster care during our review periodfor less than 30 days in Los Angeles County and New York City, andless than 60 days in Philadelphia County.  We did this to eliminatecases in which a child's tenure in foster care was shorter than thetime foster care agencies were allowed, by their local regulations,to complete initial medical examinations.  This resulted in finalsamples totaling 360 young foster children in our three locations. We examined the foster care case files for the period covering achild's first entry into foster care until the end of the review yearor until the child was discharged from foster care, whicheveroccurred earlier.  We used an automated data collection instrument torecord information from the case files.  The recorded information wasreviewed for accuracy by the individual preparing it beforefinalizing each electronic record.  We also reviewed the case filedata for consistent coding among individuals; minor adjustments weremade to the coding as a result of that review. We analyzed the case file data using univariate and bivariateanalyses, descriptive statistical methods.  We found that for some ofthe data, the results varied among the three locations; however, theconclusions we drew from the analyses of each location were similar. Thus, the locations could be combined for analysis.  Finally, whencombining these data, we weighted them to adjust for disproportionatesampling and produced aggregate estimates.  However, the resultspertain to only the three locations combined and do not necessarilyreflect populations of foster children at the state or nationallevel. For data derived from the case file review, the percentage estimatesreported in the letter and the numerical estimates reported inappendix II are point estimates.  Because the estimates are based oncombined results from three samples, each is subject to samplingerror.  The size of the sampling error reflects the precision of theestimate; the smaller the error, the more precise the estimate. Sampling errors for the estimates were calculated at the 95-percentconfidence level except where noted.  We are 95-percent confidentthat the actual percentages fall within the confidence intervalsreported in appendix II.  In other words, there is a 5-percent chancethat the confidence intervals do not contain the actual populationpercentages. --------------------\15 New York City comprises five boroughs and is treated in the statedatabase as a county.       ANALYSIS OF PLACEMENT TYPE      AND SERVICE DELIVERY------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.1For the analysis comparing the subpopulations of children in kinshipand traditional foster care, we used only records of children who hadbeen placed exclusively in kinship care or exclusively in traditionalfoster care.  Furthermore, because the sample for Philadelphia Countycontained only one child who was placed exclusively in kinship care,we eliminated that location from this analysis.  The subpopulationsizes are shown in table I.2.

We conductedour review for both reports between November 1992 and March 1995 inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Weanalyzed the electronic databases as provided to us by state andcounty officials, and we performed limited tests of the completenessof the case files. ANALYSIS RESULTS========================================================== Appendix IIThis appendix presents the numerical values for the data discussed inthe body of this report.  Where appropriate, point estimates andconfidence intervals are provided.  The appendix includes case filereview results for the review year 1991 and statewide data forcalendar years 1986 and 1991.

We did thisto eliminate cases in which a child's tenure in foster care wasshorter than the time foster care agencies are allowed, by theirlocal regulations, to complete initial medical examinations. \b Children are exempt from initial examination requirements if theyreceived an equivalent examination within 90 days before enteringfoster care.  Of children who received no routine care during ourreview period, three were required, because of their age at entry andlength of stay, to have an initial examination if they did not havean examination 90 days before entering foster care.  We believe,based on the case file data, that these children did not meet theprior examination requirement. \c Includes children who received at least one immunization andexcludes children who were under 90 days of age.

Forty-four states and theDistrict of Columbia participated in this study.  The six states thatdid not participate were Idaho, Indiana, Nebraska, North Dakota,South Dakota, and Vermont.  While the District of Columbia was theonly nonstate location included in this comparison of estimatedHIV-infected newborns, it ranked first. \a Reflects the estimates of children who are HIV-infected, excludingthose who falsely test positive at birth.  CDC's estimates of thenumber of HIV-infected newborns are based on a 25-percenttransmission rate; in other words, one-quarter of the number ofnewborns who test HIV-positive at birth are estimated to beHIV-infected rather than merely carrying their HIV-infected mothers'antibodies.

Despite law enforcement efforts, the flow of drugs along the southwestborder continues, and unless border control efforts become moreeffective, illegal immigration is expected to increase during the nextdecade. A 1993 study commissioned by the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy recommended that the Border Patrol try to prevent illegal alienentry rather than catch illegal aliens once they have entered thecountry. The study suggested using (1) multiple physical barriers insome areas to prevent entry and (2) more highway checkpoints and othermeasures to prevent drugs and illegal aliens that have entered theUnited States from leaving border areas. Officials GAO spoke withexpressed support for a "prevention strategy," and preliminary resultsfrom recent prevention initiatives in San Diego and El Paso aregenerally encouraging. However, some drug smuggling and illegalimmigration seem to have been rerouted from these two sectors to othersouthwest border areas where enforcement is less effective. In August1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) approved anational strategy to prevent illegal entry that builds on the agency'ssuccess in San Diego and El Paso. Although this plan appearsencouraging, GAO concludes that it is too early to tell what impact itwill eventually have on drug smuggling and illegal immigration along thesouthwest border.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  GGD-95-30     TITLE:  Border Control: Revised Strategy Is Showing Some Positive              Results      DATE:  12/29/94   SUBJECT:  Illegal aliens             Detention facilities             Deportation             Immigration or emigration             International relations             Law enforcement             Narcotics             Drug traffickingIDENTIFIER:  San Diego (CA)             El Paso (TX)             INS Operation Hold-the-Line             *************************************************************************** This file contains an ASCII representation of the text of a GAO        ** report.

ConditChairman, Subcommittee on Information, Justice, Transportation and AgricultureCommittee on Government OperationsHouse of RepresentativesDear Mr.  Chairman: This report responds to your request concerning the adequacy ofUnited States efforts to secure the southwest border.  Specifically,you asked us to (1) determine the extent of the threat from drugsmuggling and illegal immigration and (2) identify ways to enhancesecurity between the ports of entry.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Although the full extent of drug smuggling and illegal immigration isunknown, both pose a serious threat along the southwest border. Experts estimate that most of the cocaine and most of the illegalaliens entering the United States enter from Mexico across thesouthwest border.  Despite law enforcement efforts, the flow of drugscontinues, and unless border control efforts become more effective,illegal immigration is expected to increase over the next decade. A 1993 study commissioned by the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy (ONDCP) identified ways to enhance security along thesouthwest border between the ports of entry.  The study recommendedthat the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) Border Patrolfocus on preventing illegal alien entry instead of on apprehendingaliens once they have entered the country.  To implement thisstrategy, the study recommended using (1) multiple physical barriersin certain areas to prevent entry and (2) additional highwaycheckpoints and other measures to prevent drugs and illegal aliensthat succeeded in entering the United States from leaving borderareas.  Previous studies have made similar recommendations. There was widespread support for a "prevention strategy" among theofficials with whom we spoke, and preliminary results from recentprevention initiatives in two Border Patrol sectors--San Diego, CA,and El Paso, TX--are generally encouraging.  However, some drugsmuggling and illegal immigration seems to have been rerouted fromthese two sectors to other southwest border areas where enforcementis less effective. In August 1994, the INS Commissioner approved a national BorderPatrol strategic plan that focuses on preventing illegal entry.  INS'national strategy builds on the success its San Diego and El Pasosectors have reportedly had in reducing illegal entry.  INS plans toimplement its strategy in phases over several years, concentratinginitially in the two areas traditionally having the greatest illegalactivity--San Diego and El Paso.  The strategy contains variousindicators with which INS plans to measure the success of itsefforts. On the basis of the initial positive results in San Diego and ElPaso, INS' national strategy appears encouraging.  However, since itwill take several years to implement the strategy, it is too early totell what impact it will eventually have on drug smuggling andillegal immigration along the southwest border.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2Within INS, the Border Patrol is the agency responsible for securingthe border between the ports of entry.  The Border Patrol's missionis to maintain control of the international boundaries between theports of entry by detecting and preventing smuggling and illegalentry of aliens into the United States.  In addition, in 1991, ONDCPdesignated the Border Patrol the primary agency for narcoticsinterdiction between the ports of entry. To accomplish its mission, the Border Patrol (1) patrols theinternational boundaries and (2) inspects passengers and vehicles atcheckpoints located along highways leading from border areas, at busand rail stations, and at air terminals.  The Border Patrol usesvehicles and aircraft to patrol areas between the ports of entry andelectronic equipment, such as sensors and low-light-leveltelevisions, to detect illegal entry into the country.  The BorderPatrol carries out its mission in 21 sectors.  Nine of these sectorsare located along the southwest border with Mexico.\1 As of September30, 1994, about 3,747 agents were assigned to the 9 sectors,representing 88 percent of Border Patrol agents nationwide. The following other federal entities support land border controlefforts between the ports of entry along the southwest border. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), the nation's principal tacticaldrug intelligence facility, prepares assessments on the threat ofdrug smuggling. Operation Alliance prepares border control strategies and coordinatesdrug enforcement activities of 17 federal and numerous state andlocal law enforcement agencies combating drug smuggling. Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6), located in El Paso, coordinatesmilitary support for drug enforcement efforts. In September 1991, ONDCP tasked Sandia National Laboratories, throughINS, to do a "systematic analysis of the security along the UnitedStates/Mexico Border between the ports of entry and to recommendmeasures by which control of the border could be improved." ONDCPchose Sandia because of its expertise in designing physical securitysystems.  In January 1993, Sandia issued its report entitledSystematic Analysis of the Southwest Border.  We refer to this as theSandia study throughout our report.  According to the study, toconduct its analysis, Sandia personnel visited all nine Border Patrolsouthwest border sectors, toured various Border Patrol facilities,and interviewed both chief patrol agents and Border Patrol agents. They viewed much of the southwest border from either the ground orthe air and reviewed a number of previous studies related to bordercontrol. --------------------\1 These nine sectors are located in San Diego and El Centro, CA;Yuma and Tucson, AZ; and El Paso, Del Rio, Marfa, Laredo, andMcAllen, TX.    OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND   METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3In addressing our objectives to (1) determine the extent of thethreat from drug smuggling and illegal immigration and (2) identifyways to enhance security between the ports of entry, weinterviewed intelligence officials responsible for determining thethreat from drug smuggling and illegal immigration and reviewedrelated documentation;reviewed the Sandia study and discussed the study's findings with itsauthors and various INS officials responsible for border control;reviewed EPIC, Department of State, and Operation Alliance reports todetermine the threat from drug smuggling;visited the San Diego and El Paso Border Patrol sectors and discussedwith sector officials their recent border control initiatives;analyzed INS data from its management information systems related toapprehensions and narcotics seizures to obtain additional informationon the threat from drug smuggling and illegal immigration along thesouthwest border; andinterviewed INS headquarters officials to determine plans forimproving border security. As agreed with the Subcommittee, our focus was control of the landborder between the ports of entry.  We did not evaluate bordercontrol activities at the ports of entry or efforts related tosmuggling by air and sea.  We did not verify the accuracy andcompleteness of the data we obtained from INS' management informationsystems. We did our work between October 1993 and September 1994 in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards.  We discussedthe results of our work with the Acting Chief of the Border Patroland other INS officials.  Their comments are presented on page 27.    DRUG SMUGGLING AND ILLEGAL   IMMIGRATION ARE SERIOUS THREATS   ALONG THE SOUTHWEST BORDER------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4      DRUG SMUGGLING---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1Although the full extent is unknown, drug smuggling is a seriousthreat along the southwest border.  The Department of State's 1993International Narcotics Control Strategy Report indicated that Mexicois a transit country for South American cocaine destined for theUnited States and a major country of origin for heroin and marijuana. According to the report, between 50 and 70 percent of the cocainesmuggled into the United States transited Mexico, entering primarilyby land across the southwest border.  In addition, about 23 percentof the heroin smuggled into the United States originated in Mexico. INS data showed that Border Patrol narcotics seizures along thesouthwest border have risen over the last few years.  Between fiscalyears 1990 and 1993, the number of Border Patrol narcotics seizuresrose from around 4,200 to around 6,400, an increase of about 50percent.  The amount of cocaine seized nearly doubled from about14,000 pounds in 1990 to about 27,000 pounds in 1993. According to a June 1992 Operation Alliance report,\2 the primarysmuggling route across the southwest border was by land.  The reportpointed out that although cocaine was the primary drug threat,followed by marijuana, the heroin threat was growing.  The reportstated that in spite of law enforcement agencies' efforts to counterdrug smuggling, the flow of drugs between the ports of entry alongthe southwest border continued due to vast open areas and arelatively low law enforcement presence.  The report concluded that"our successes are insignificant when compared to the threat.  Ourcollective efforts are currently only a minor irritant to thesmugglers."The Sandia study deemed drug smuggling a serious threat all along thesouthwest border.  For example, the study deemed drug smuggling aserious threat in south Texas and the southern Arizona border area,which is dubbed "Cocaine Alley." Figure 1 shows the seizure of over1,000 pounds of cocaine by Border Patrol agents in San Diego.  Figure2 shows a panel truck stopped by El Paso Border Patrol agents (seefig.  2A), with narcotics hidden in its interior panels (see fig. 2B).  Agents seized nearly 250 pounds of marijuana (see fig.  2C).

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2Illegal immigration is also a serious threat to the United States. In 1993, we estimated that the total inflow of illegal aliens intothis country in 1988 ranged from 1.3 million to 3.9 million.\3 Themajor component of the inflow, 1.2 million to 3.2 million, wasMexicans crossing the southwest border, with most entering betweenthe ports of entry.  Much of the inflow represented short-term visitsto the United States. In June 1994, INS estimated there were about 3.8 million undocumentedmigrants residing in the United States.  About half of the unlawfulresidents entered unlawfully across the borders, while the other halfentered as visitors but did not leave.  The estimates were based onan analysis of INS and Bureau of the Census data and, according toINS, experts have embraced these estimates as the best available. The 1993 Sandia study characterized the southwest border as "beingoverrun." For example, in the San Diego sector, the study noted thatas many as 6,000 aliens attempted to enter the United Statesillegally every night along the first 7-1/2 miles of border beginningat the Pacific Ocean.  One of the reasons given in the study for thissituation was that most of the border fencing in the San Diego sectorand other urban areas was "poorly maintained" and "totallyineffective" (see fig.  3).  However, as discussed on page 15, INSrecently completed a new fence in the San Diego sector and plansadditional fencing in other sectors. (See figure in printed edition.)Figure 3:  Ineffective Fencing in theSan Diego Sector Before Recent Border Patrol InitiativesSource:  Border Patrol. Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border declinedbetween 1986 and 1989 but, although still below the 1986 level,apprehensions have gradually risen since then (see fig.  4).  Figure5 illustrates the prominence of the San Diego and El Paso sectors asborder-crossing locations.  In fiscal year 1993, these two sectorsaccounted for two-thirds of the 1.2 million southwest borderapprehensions.    Figure 4:  Southwest Border   Apprehensions Rising Since 1989   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Border Patrol data.    Figure 5:  Most 1993 Southwest   Border Apprehensions Occurred   in the San Diego and El Paso   Sectors   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Border Patrol data. Although the southwest border is approximately 1,600 miles long, muchof it is difficult to cross by foot or vehicle due to rugged terrain,desert, or natural barriers such as some portions of the Rio GrandeRiver.  Our analysis of INS data showed that in fiscal year 1992 overhalf of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 ofthe 1,600 border miles--13 miles along the border between San Diegoand Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles along the border between El Paso andCiudad Juarez, Mexico.  However, as we discussed on pages 23 to 25,recent border control initiatives in San Diego and El Paso appear tohave rerouted some illegal immigrants to other southwest borderareas. Unless border control efforts become more effective, illegalimmigration is expected to increase.  In September 1993, we reportedthat the flow of illegal aliens across the southwest border isexpected to increase during the next decade because Mexico's economyis unlikely to absorb all of the new job seekers that are expected toenter the labor force.\4--------------------\3 Illegal Aliens:  Despite Data Limitations, Current Methods ProvideBetter Population Estimates (GAO/PEMD-93-25, Aug.  5, 1993).  Due todata limitations, 1988 was the most recent year for which we couldmake a reliable estimate. \4 North American Free Trade Agreement:  Assessment of Major Issues,Volume 2 (GAO/GGD-93-137, Sept.  9, 1993).    SANDIA STUDY RECOMMENDED   CHANGING BORDER CONTROL TACTICS   FROM APPREHENDING ALIENS TO   PREVENTING ILLEGAL ENTRY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5The Border Patrol's traditional tactic of discouraging illegal entryhas been to apprehend aliens once they have entered the UnitedStates.  According to the Sandia study's authors, this tactic wasinefficient and diminished the Border Patrol's ability to control theborder.  In addition, the authors said the only good border controlstrategy is one that prevents people from crossing the border.  Thestudy concluded that the way to prevent illegal entry is to impose"effective barriers on the free flow of traffic." The study notedthat where it is not possible or practical to keep drugs and illegalaliens from entering the United States, they should be stopped at theearliest opportunity.  In addition, the Sandia study concluded that"control of the illegal alien and drug traffic can be gained" andrecommended that the Border Patrol change its tactics fromapprehending illegal aliens after they have entered the United Statesto preventing illegal entry into the United States.       USE MULTIPLE BARRIERS AND      MORE CHECKPOINTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1A goal of a "prevention" strategy would be to significantly increasethe difficulty of crossing the border illegally.  The Sandia studyconcluded that single barriers, which had been used thus far, had notproven effective in preventing either drugs or illegal aliens fromentering the country.  Consequently, the study recommended (1)multiple lighted barriers in urban border areas to prevent the entryof large volumes of drugs and illegal aliens, with patrol roadsbetween the barriers and (2) enhanced checkpoint operations toprevent those drugs and illegal aliens that succeeded in crossing theborder from leaving the border area.  (See fig.  6 for an artist'sillustration of the Sandia study's proposed three-fence barriersystem.)   Figure 6:  Artist's   Illustration of the Three-Fence   Barrier System   (See figure in printed   edition.)   Source:  January 1993 Sandia   National Laboratories' study.   (See figure in printed   edition.)According to the Sandia study, multiple barriers in urban areas wouldprovide the Border Patrol a greater ability to (1) discourage asignificant number of illegal border crossers, (2) detect intrudersearly and delay them as long as possible, and (3) channel asignificantly reduced level of traffic to places where border patrolagents can adequately deal with it.  The Sandia study recommendedmultiple barriers along approximately 90 miles, or less than 6percent of the southwest border. Because of rugged terrain, segments of the southwest border cannot becontrolled at the immediate border.  The alternative the Sandia studyrecommended for these areas is to use highway checkpoints to containthose aliens who cross the border illegally.  The study recommendedmore checkpoints be established and that all operate full time.  TheBorder Patrol's use of part-time checkpoints allows violators tocross unobserved after the checkpoint is closed. Except for the proposed multiple-fence system, many of the Sandiastudy's recommendations were not new and, according to Border Patrolofficials, had been made previously by their own personnel.  Forexample, a January 1989 study recommended many of the same measuressuch as barriers, checkpoints, and enhanced electronic surveillanceequipment.  The study was conducted by a retired head of the BorderPatrol for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\5--------------------\5 Ten Steps to Securing America's Borders, Federation for AmericanImmigration Reform, January 1989, Washington, D.C.    RESOURCES REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT   SANDIA STUDY'S RECOMMENDATIONS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6The Sandia study estimated it would initially cost an additional $260million to implement its recommendations with annual recurring costsof about $69 million.  Most of the initial costs are associated withphysical barriers and checkpoints. Ultimately, implementing the Sandia study's recommendations mayrequire only a slightly larger Border Patrol force.  According to thestudy, as physical barriers and checkpoints were completed, thenumber of Border Patrol agents required would increase.  However, thestudy noted that as control was gained at the border, the number ofagents could be allowed to decrease to a number not significantlylarger than the 3,640 agents that were deployed along the southwestborder when the study began in December 1991.    PREVENTION STRATEGY HAS   WIDESPREAD SUPPORT------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7The Border Patrol officials we spoke with (including the actingchief, acting deputy chief, San Diego and El Paso chief patrolagents, and a regional Border Patrol official) all agreed with theSandia study's conclusion that the Border Patrol should focus onpreventing illegal entry rather than on apprehending illegal aliens. In addition, officials of EPIC, Operation Alliance, JTF-6, and themayor and police officials of El Paso support the concept of tryingto prevent entry rather than apprehending aliens. This strategy is also in line with our past positions on controllingillegal immigration.  In June 1993, we testified before the HouseSubcommittee on International Law, Immigration and Refugees,Committee on the Judiciary, that "the key to controlling the illegalentry of aliens is to prevent their initial arrival."\6--------------------\6 Immigration Enforcement:  Problems in Controlling the Flow ofIllegal Aliens (GAO/T-GGD-93-39, June 30, 1993).    RECENT SAN DIEGO AND EL PASO   BORDER PATROL INITIATIVES ARE   CONSISTENT WITH SANDIA STUDY'S   FINDINGS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8Major Border Patrol initiatives in the San Diego and El Paso sectorsare consistent with the Sandia study's findings.  Both sectors havebegun initiatives that focus on preventing illegal entry rather thanon apprehending aliens.       SAN DIEGO SECTOR ERECTED      PHYSICAL BARRIERS AND      LIGHTING---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.1In 1990, the San Diego sector's chief patrol agent began aninitiative to erect physical barriers, primarily to deter drugsmuggling.  With the assistance of JTF-6, the San Diego sectorinstalled 10-foot welded steel fencing along approximately 14 milesof border where sector officials believed the majority of drugs andillegal aliens crossed within the sector.  The new fence, completedin late 1993, is substantially stronger than previous chain linkfencing.  JTF-6 is also installing high-intensity lights and a secondand third fence at strategic locations along the same 14 miles.  Asof February 1994, JTF-6 had installed lights along about 4-1/2 of the13 miles. The Sandia study recommended similar measures.  For example, thestudy recommended that the sector erect multiple lighted physicalbarriers along the same stretch of border where the sector erectedits new fence.       EL PASO SECTOR INITIATED      "OPERATION HOLD-THE-LINE"---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.2Before September 1993, like San Diego, the El Paso sector's strategyemphasized apprehending aliens rather than preventing illegal entry. However, as apprehensions increased so did the opportunities forconfrontation between illegal aliens and El Paso Border Patrolagents.  These increased opportunities for confrontation led toallegations of abuse against agents.  Under the sector's apprehensionstrategy, El Paso's chief patrol agent told us that the border areawas in "complete chaos." The chief estimated there were up to 8,000to 10,000 illegal border crossings daily, and only 1 out of 8 alienswas apprehended. The apprehension strategy also created several problems in thecommunity. El Paso citizens and others complained about this approach inmeetings with the sector's chief patrol agent.  They believed thatthe Border Patrol did not try to prevent entry but, in fact, used theincreased numbers of apprehensions as a primary factor in justifyingits budget. Some local residents felt their civil rights were being violated bythe Border Patrol.  For example, students and teachers at a localhigh school filed a federal lawsuit to stop harassment after El Pasosector agents confronted a coach believing he was an aliensmuggler.\7Illegal aliens also had a significant impact on the city's crimerates.  El Paso police officials estimated that undocumented alienscommitted 75 to 80 percent of all auto thefts, as well as manyburglaries.  The Mayor of El Paso told us that illegal immigrationcosts the city about $30 to $50 million per year. In light of these problems, El Paso's chief patrol agent began aninitiative in September 1993 to change the sector's border controlstrategy to one of preventing illegal entry.  The sector stationedall available agents immediately at a 20-mile stretch of the borderin highly visible Border Patrol vehicles.  The primary goal of thenew strategy--Operation Hold-the-Line--was preventing significantnumbers of aliens from entering the El Paso metropolitan area.\8Those who still tried to cross the border illegally were routed toless populated areas where they could be more easily apprehended. The El Paso sector's goal of preventing illegal entry is similar tothe one recommended by the Sandia study, although the tactics aredifferent.  Sandia recommended multiple physical barriers to prevententry; the sector employs agents as a human barrier.  However, thesector eventually plans to construct additional lighted fencing,which is generally consistent with the Sandia study recommendations. --------------------\7 The parties eventually reached an out-of-court settlement. \8 Operation Hold-the-Line was initially called "Operation Blockade."   PREVENTION STRATEGY APPEARS   ENCOURAGING------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9Preliminary results in San Diego and El Paso suggest that theprevention strategy has reduced illegal entry in these sectors. Other benefits include less border crime, less confrontation betweenBorder Patrol agents and illegal aliens, and strong public support.       SAN DIEGO SECTOR---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.1Although the San Diego sector's border control initiative has notbeen fully implemented, indications are that the new tactics arereducing the number of aliens crossing the border illegally in theSan Diego area.  As shown in figure 7, sector apprehensions were down20 percent in fiscal year 1994 compared to 1992 and dropped below1990 levels, the year the sector began implementing its new bordercontrol tactics.  Apprehensions decreased even though the sectorincreased the amount of time spent on border enforcement nearly 41percent between 1990 and 1994.    Figure 7:  San Diego Sector's   Fiscal Year 1994 Border   Apprehensions Are Down From   Previous Years   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Border Patrol data. Also, apprehensions at highway checkpoints away from the borderdeclined 24 percent between fiscal years 1990 and 1993 even thoughthe amount of time spent performing traffic checks increased 22percent. During our review, we toured the most heavily trafficked portion ofthe San Diego sector border and found visible evidence of the newtactics'(See figure in printed edition.)Figure 8:  Effect of New Initiativeon Illegal Border Crossings in San Diego Sectoreffect on illegal border crossing.  As figure 8A shows, before thenew border control tactics, hundreds of aliens would line up alongthe U.S.  side of the border during daylight hours, waiting for anopportunity to go northward.  However, as illustrated in figure 8B,after the new border patrol tactics were initiated, large groups ofaliens no longer waited to cross during the day, which according to aBorder Patrol official is typical. Also, as shown in figure 8C, formerly there were large gaps in borderfencing allowing aliens to easily cross the border.  However, figure8D shows that these gaps in the fencing have now been closed. (See figure in printed edition.)Source:  Border Patrol. In addition, according to San Diego sector officials, violent crimeand confrontations between Border Patrol agents and illegal alienshave been reduced because the fencing has prevented large groups ofaliens from gathering.  For example, murders in the border areasadjacent to the fencing dropped from nine in 1990 to none between1991 and June 1994.  According to the sector's chief patrol agent, asof February 1994, there had not been any incidents during the last 2years where San Diego Border Patrol agents had used deadly forceagainst illegal aliens.  Also, reported incidents of assaults, rapes,and robberies in this area have declined.       EL PASO SECTOR---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.2El Paso sector officials cited several indications that the sector'snew prevention strategy is working.  For example, according to theBorder Patrol, the number of aliens attempting to illegally cross theborder through the El Paso sector has decreased significantly. According to the chief patrol agent, before Operation Hold-the-Line,there were up to 10,000 illegal border crossings daily.  In February1994, the sector estimated that only about 500 people a day wereillegally crossing the border.  A March 1994 sector intelligencereport indicated the new strategy had deterred many aliens inMexico's interior from coming to the El Paso border area. There has been a sharp drop in El Paso sector apprehensions sinceimplementation of its new strategy.  As figure 9 shows, the El Pasosector's illegal alien apprehensions in fiscal year 1994 were down 72percent compared to fiscal year 1993.  Two factors influencing thisdecrease are the deterrent effect of the new border control strategyand, as discussed on pages 23 to 25, the rerouting of some illegalaliens to other southwest border areas.    Figure 9:  El Paso Sector's   Fiscal Year 1994 Border   Apprehensions Are Down Sharply   From Previous Years   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Border Patrol data. According to sector officials, many illegal border crossers try toleave El Paso via the airport.  With the implementation of theprevention strategy in the El Paso sector, the number ofapprehensions made at El Paso's International Airport wassignificantly reduced, indicating that fewer aliens are crossing theborder illegally in El Paso.  According to INS data, in fiscal year1993, the sector averaged about 3,700 apprehensions a month at theairport.  As of June 1994, the sector was averaging about 700apprehensions a month, an 81-percent decrease. The El Paso public strongly supports the sector's new strategy.  Apoll taken in February 1994 showed 84 percent in favor of thesector's strategy.\9 Complaints against the Border Patrol from bothlocal residents and illegal aliens have decreased since the start ofOperation Hold-the-Line.  According to sector officials, only oneallegation of abuse was made in the first 5 months of the operation. Although they did not have any specific data, local police officialssaid complaints to the police department of harassment by BorderPatrol officers are "way down."Police officials also attribute a drop in certain crimes to OperationHold-the-Line.  For example, there were nearly one-third fewerburglaries and one-fourth fewer motor vehicle thefts in the 3 monthsafter the operation began in September 1993 than in the same 3 monthsin 1992. Two studies also concluded that Operation Hold-the-Line has beensuccessful in deterring illegal immigration in El Paso.\10 A December1993 study of Operation Hold-the-Line by the Center for ImmigrationStudies concluded that the operation "has proven to be successful"and the new preventative deployment was "both more humane and moreeffective." According to this study, the operation represented aviable long-term approach to more successful border control.  A July1994 study requested by the U.S.  Commission on Immigration Reformfound that the operation significantly reduced illegal crossings andhad resulted in less crime and fewer allegations against BorderPatrol agents in El Paso.  In addition, the study found that thestrategy has broad public support.  However, the study also foundthat the redeployment of agents and longer work shifts have erodedmorale among agents, and the strategy is labor-intensive.  Anyexpansion without additional agents would stretch present resources. Although successful in significantly reducing illegal entry into ElPaso, according to sector officials, the new strategy weakened somesector operations.  For example, the El Paso sector took importantresources from checkpoint operations resulting in some checkpointsbeing closed over 50 percent of the time.  The Sandia study, however,recommended that El Paso increase the number of checkpoints andoperate all checkpoints 24 hours a day. --------------------\9 An exit poll of democratic primary voters taken on February 26 and27, 1994.

SAN DIEGO AND EL PASO SECTORS'   INITIATIVES HAVE REROUTED DRUGS   AND ALIENS TO OTHER SOUTHWEST   BORDER AREAS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10The San Diego and El Paso sectors' initiatives appear to havererouted drugs and illegal aliens to other parts of the southwestborder.  For example, the July 1994 study of Operation Hold-the- Linefound that the operation had less of an effect on those illegalaliens headed for the interior of the United States.  These aliensapparently adapted to the prevention strategy by finding new routesinto the United States. In addition, interviews with apprehended illegal aliens have revealedthat smugglers are now telling those traveling from the interior ofMexico that it is easier to cross into Nogales, AZ, rather than intoSan Diego or El Paso, according to Tucson's Deputy Chief PatrolAgent.  In addition, according to the deputy, some smugglers arereported to be moving their operations from San Diego to Nogales. A comparison of Tucson and El Paso sector apprehensions appears tosupport the premise that the recent San Diego and El Paso initiativeshave increased illegal entry through other southwest border sectors. As figure 10 shows, since the start of the initiative in the El Pasosector, Tucson sector apprehensions have increased about 50 percent(about 93,000 in fiscal year 1993 compared to 139,000 in fiscal year1994).  El Paso apprehensions, on the other hand, dropped 72 percent(about 286,000 to about 80,000 over the same period).    Figure 10:  Tucson Sector's   Fiscal Year 1994 Border   Apprehensions Have Increased as   El Paso Apprehensions Have   Dropped   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Border Patrol data. Another indication that illegal alien entry may be moving to othersectors is that while the San Diego sector's fiscal year 1993apprehensions were 6 percent lower than fiscal year 1992,apprehensions in the remaining southwest border sectors increasedabout 17 percent (see fig.  11).    Figure 11:  San Diego Sector's   Fiscal Year 1993 Border   Apprehensions Have Declined   While Other Southwest Border   Sectors' Have Increased   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Border Patrol data. Drug trafficking has also apparently been affected.  According toEPIC's December 1993 Monthly Threat Brief, El Paso's OperationHold-the-Line has lead to changes in smuggling methods.  Instead offording the Rio Grande River, some smugglers have attempted to movedrugs through ports of entry and to areas east and west of El Paso,around the sector's 20-mile line of agents. According to a San Diego sector official, the new fence has virtuallyeliminated the number of drug and alien smugglers driving across theborder in the San Diego area.  However, the sector has noticed anincrease in drug smuggling in the mountainous areas east of SanDiego.  In addition, the amount of cocaine seized in the El Centrosector, the sector adjacent to San Diego, increased dramatically from698 pounds in fiscal year 1991 to nearly 18,000 pounds in fiscal year1993.    INS' NATIONAL BORDER CONTROL   STRATEGY----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11In August 1994, the INS Commissioner approved a national BorderPatrol strategic plan for gaining control of the nation's borders. The strategy focuses on preventing illegal entry and builds on thesuccess INS has reportedly had in San Diego and El Paso.  INS plansto put more agents along the border and use more lighting, fencing,and other barriers.  On the basis of the national border controlstrategy, each southwest border sector developed its own strategyidentifying specific actions that need to be taken. INS plans to use a phased approach to implementing its border controlstrategy.  In its first phase, INS plans to focus its resources inthe two sectors where most illegal immigration has traditionallyoccurred--San Diego and El Paso.  As border control is improved inSan Diego and El Paso, INS anticipates that other areas willexperience an increase in illegal entry.  Therefore, the second phasetargets the Tucson sector and the south Texas area.  The third phasetargets the rest of the southwest border, and phase four targets therest of the U.S.  border. INS has identified certain indicators that it plans to use in each ofthese phases to determine whether its efforts are successful.  Theproposed indicators include (1) an eventual reduction inapprehensions and recidivism, (2) an increase in attempted fraudulentadmissions at ports of entry, (3) a shift in the flow to othersectors, and (4) fewer illegal immigrants in the interior of theUnited States. To achieve border control, the strategy recognizes the need tocoordinate with other INS programs as well as other federal agenciessuch as the Department of Defense, Customs Service, and the DrugEnforcement Administration, as well as state and local lawenforcement agencies. INS officials told us that it will take several years to implementthe strategy and that INS did not have a specific time frame or costfigures for these improvements.  INS officials believe thattechnology improvements, such as improved fencing and surveillancecameras, would make border control strategies more effective. According to the Acting Chief of the Border Patrol, theseimprovements would reduce the need for significant numbers ofadditional agents.  INS plans to closely monitor the strategy'sprogress to determine the appropriate mix of personnel and othertypes of resources needed to gain control of the U.S.  border.    CONCLUSIONS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12We believe the new national border control strategy shows promise forreducing illegal entry since the strategy (1) builds on the reportedsuccess the San Diego and El Paso sectors have had in reducingillegal immigration, (2) is consistent with recommendations made inprevious comprehensive studies conducted by border control andphysical security experts, and (3) has widespread public andgovernment support.  However, since it will take several years toimplement the strategy, it is too early to tell what impact it willeventually have on drug smuggling and illegal immigration along thesouthwest border.    AGENCY COMMENTS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :13On October 25, 1994, we met with the Acting Chief of the BorderPatrol and other INS officials to discuss the results of our work. These officials generally agreed with the information and conclusionspresented in this report.  They emphasized the importance ofsustained financial support to fully implement the national bordercontrol strategy. --------------------------------------------------------- Letter :13.1We plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from itsissue date, unless you publicly release its contents earlier.

The National Performance Review (NPR), done under the direction of theVice President, seeks ways to make the government work better and costless.  The NPR recommendations are grouped into four areas: cutting redtape, putting customers first, empowering employees to get results, andcutting back to basics.  The NPR report contains 384 recommendationscovering 27 federal agencies and 14 government systems, such asprocurement and budgeting.  The NPR report emphasizes many of the basicthemes that GAO has been stressing for years, including the need tostrengthen agency management and to focus management and accountabilityon the results of programs.  Accordingly, GAO agrees with virtually allof the NPR report's recommendations and believes that their successfulimplementation will significantly help the government to overcome itsmanagement and programmatic problems.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  OCG-94-1     TITLE:  Management Reform: GAO's Comments on the National              Performance Review's Recommendations      DATE:  12/03/93   SUBJECT:  Public administration             Personnel management             Accountability             Program management             Agency evaluation             General management reviews             Oversight by Congress             Planning             Financial management             Interagency relationsIDENTIFIER:  National Performance Review             GMR             Cover================================================================ COVERReport to Congressional RequestersDecember 1993MANAGEMENT REFORM - GAO'S COMMENTSON THE NATIONAL PERFORMANCEREVIEW'S RECOMMENDATIONSGAO/OCG-94-1Comments on NPR's Recommendations Letter=============================================================== LETTERB-255769December 3, 1993The Honorable John Conyers, Jr., ChairmanThe Honorable William F.

The NPR report'srecommendations were organized by four key principles:  "cutting redtape, putting customers first, empowering employees to get results,and cutting back to basics." The NPR report contained 384 majorrecommendations covering 27 federal agencies and 14 governmentsystems, such as procurement and budgeting. This report provides our initial comments on the NPR report'srecommendations on the basis of our work, and is the first part of aplanned long-term body of work on the NPR.  In subsequent work, wewill monitor the degree to which the NPR's recommendations have beenimplemented and evaluate the extent to which the recommendationseffectively address the management and programmatic problems the NPRidentified. --------------------\1 From Red Tape to Results:  Creating a Government That Works Betterand Costs Less, report of the National Performance Review, VicePresident Al Gore, September 7, 1993.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The NPR report emphasized many of the basic themes that we havestressed for years, including the need to strengthen managementwithin agencies and to focus management and accountability on theresults of programs.  Accordingly, we generally agree with most ofthe NPR report's recommendations and believe that successfulimplementation of those recommendations can make an importantcontribution in addressing the federal government's management andprogrammatic problems. The ultimate success of the NPR, however, will depend upon thedetailed strategies and specific actions developed to implement itsrecommendations.  The administration must forge a strong, coordinatedpartnership with Congress to develop these strategies.  As part ofthat partnership, priority attention must be given to improvingagencies' management capacities so that they can assume additionalauthority and responsibility contemplated by the NPR and be heldaccountable for programmatic outcomes.  A key to improvedaccountability is strengthened financial management, includingaudited financial statements.  Moreover, the fundamental managementchanges that are needed require the active and sustained attention ofthe top political and career leadership in the agencies. Despite its wide scope, the NPR report contained some recommendationsthat were too general for us to comment.  The NPR report also wassilent on a number of critical management and program issuesconfronting the federal government that our work has shown needprompt attention.  These additional areas of concern are detailed inthe individual sections accompanying this letter. .. .   OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND   METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5This initial examination of the NPR report's recommendations had twoobjectives.  Our first objective was to review the NPR report'srecommendations.  On the basis of our work, we placed each NPRrecommendation in one of four categories: (1) We agree with the NPR recommendation. (2) We generally agree with the NPR recommendation. (3) We disagree with the NPR recommendation. (4) We have insufficient information on which to judge the merits ofthe NPR recommendation either because we have not done work in thespecific area addressed by the recommendation or the recommendationwas too vague for us to comment. We did not review the NPR's estimated savings from implementing itsrecommendations.  The Congressional Budget Office already hasanalyzed some of the NPR report's recommendations from thatperspective. Our second objective was to identify major management andprogrammatic areas of concern that were not addressed in the NPRreport.  We understand that the NPR report's recommendations will besupplemented by a series of detailed monographs, so some of theseareas may be addressed in the subsequent NPR monographs. . .

               7--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ)=========================================================== Chapter 14      OVERALL SUMMARY------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:0.1As discussed in our December 1992 transition series report on JusticeIssues, during the last decade federal, state, and local governmentshave substantially increased funding for law enforcement as a resultof mounting public concern over crime (especially drugs andviolence).  Despite committing billions to the criminal justicesystem and filling the nation's jails and prisons, the expectation ofreduced vulnerability to crime has not been achieved.  Furthermore,inaccurate financial data, unrealiable financial and informationsystems, and poor internal controls could result in the loss ofmillions of dollars.  Given the existing criminal threat and tightbudget environment, government policymakers need to focus on gettingthe most from the existing criminal justice system resources byexploring ways to (1) strengthen the Department of Justice'sleadership and management functions; (2) better investigate andprosecute white collar crime; (3) make needed immigration policy andmanagement decisions; (4) respond to a rapid rise in the federalprison population; and (5) make antidrug efforts more effective. NPR's recommendations are targeted to improving the criminal justicesystem in each of these five areas.  For example, NPR is seeking tostrengthen the Attorney General's oversight of law enforcementactivities, and consolidate some activities, as a means to improvethe coordination and structure of federal law enforcement.  Wesupport such efforts, but in the search for increased efficiency andeffectiveness, it should be recognized that some fragmentation andinefficiencies in the criminal justice system represent a trade-offfor avoiding abuses that history has shown may occur from too muchcentralized police authority.          GAO CONTACT----------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:0.1.1Henry R.  Wray, Director, Administration of Justice Issues, GeneralGovernment Division, (202) 512-5156.    RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH GAO   AGREES--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:1DOJ02:  Improve Border ManagementFederal border management should be significantly improved.  NPRrecommends a series of actions to be taken by Customs and INS to makethese improvements. GAO CommentsCustoms and INS have a long history of interagency rivalry, poorcoordination, and ineffective cooperation, despite sharingresponsibility for primary inspections at land border ports of entry. We have recommended that OMB, working with the Treasury, Justice, andState Departments, develop a proposal for ending the dual managementof border inspections. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:1.1DOJ03:  Redirect and Better Coordinate Resources Dedicated toInterdiction of DrugsThis recommendation outlines changes that can be made to bettercoordinate federal programs directed at the air interdiction ofdrugs. GAO CommentsWe agree.  Given worldwide drug production capacity, domestic demand,and the resourcefulness of drug smugglers to adapt to U.S. enforcement initiatives, the overall availability of drugs in thiscountry has not been diminished despite substantial increases in airinterdiction efforts and related drug seizures.  The commitment ofresources should not be made without considering the potentialeffectiveness of alternative efforts, both supply and demand, andshould be based on achieving measurable goals.  Also, to bettercoordinate agency efforts, improvements in information systeminteroperability, data integrity, security, and overall intelligenceinformation management are needed. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:1.2DOJ08:  Reinvent the Immigration and Naturalization Service'sOrganization and ManagementNPR recommends a number of changes in INS organization and managementprocesses to provide an improved management structure and a strategicvision for the agency. GAO CommentsWe concur.  Over the past decade, weak management systems andinconsistent leadership at INS led to segmented autonomous programs,each attempting to deal with its own set of problems without muchattention to the impact on other INS programs.  Without coherentoverall direction and basic management reforms, the organization hasbeen unable to effectively address changing enforcementresponsibilities and long-standing service delivery problems. Further, we have recommended the appointment of an AssociateCommissioner for Financial Management as the focal point fordeveloping an overall financial management plan.    RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH GAO   GENERALLY AGREES--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2DOJ01:  Improve the Coordination and Structure of Federal LawEnforcement AgenciesNPR recommends the designation of the Attorney General as theDirector of Law Enforcement to coordinate federal law enforcementefforts.  It also recommends changes in the alignment of federal lawenforcement responsibilities. GAO CommentsWe support the need for greater coordination of the numerous agenciesinvolved in federal law enforcement.  The decentralized operations,including the 94 U.S.  Attorneys and the various investigativeagencies within Justice and Treasury, complicate efforts by theDepartment of Justice to coordinate and direct a wide variety ofinitiatives and programs to fight crime.  We have not taken aposition as to whether the various law enforcement agencies should beconsolidated into one or more agencies. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.1DOJ04:  Improve Department of Justice Debt Collection EffortsThis recommendation would make improvements in the Justice debtcollection effort, including giving the department the ability toretain a small percentage of debts collected and allowing Justice tocredit its working capital fund with a percentage of debt collectionsto be used for the creation of a centralized debt tracking andinformation system. GAO CommentsWe agree that the Department of Justice, as well as theAdministrative Office of the U.S.  Courts, need to improve their debtcollection efforts and financial and other information systems.  Ouranalysis has shown that the government had collected less than 5percent of the fines and restitution ordered in major financialinstitution fraud cases.  We have not, however, studied thealternative financing method recommended by NPR. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.2DOJ05:  Improve the Bureau of Prisons Education, Job Training, andFinancial Responsibilities ProgramsNPR makes a series of recommendations for improving prison education,training, and inmate financial responsibility policies. GAO CommentsWe agree that the Bureau of Prisons should strengthen its inmateeducation and training programs.  Many inmates leave prison withoutmarketable job skills, English language proficiency, or completing asecondary education, yet are expected to become assimilated intosociety, i.e., become law-abiding productive citizens.  We have notexamined inmate financial responsibility policies and have no commenton those recommendations. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.3DOJ06:  Improve the Management of Federal Assets Targeted forDispositionImprovements are needed in the methods by which the federalgovernment disposes of various assets. GAO CommentsWe have assessed the asset disposition activities of selectedagencies--General Services Administration, Resolution TrustCorporation, Customs Service, Marshals Service, and Internal RevenueService--and have identified the need for improvements by theseagencies.  We have recommended that the Attorney General and theSecretary of the Treasury continue to pursue consolidating themanagement and disposition of noncash seized property inventories. We have also initiated work to evaluate asset disposition practiceson a governmentwide basis, but as yet do not have enough informationto comment on the recommendation from this broader perspective. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.4DOJ07:  Reduce the Duplication of Drug Intelligence Systems andImprove Computer SecurityNPR recommends several changes to eliminate duplication in thefederal drug intelligence system. GAO CommentsWe agree in principle but are uncertain as to the specifics of therecommendation.  Fragmentation and duplication in the intelligencearea are an outgrowth of the overlap in responsibilities among thenumerous law enforcement and defense agencies involved in counteringdrug-trafficking activities.  We have also reported on inadequatephysical and operational controls over computer security, absence ofcontingency plans, and lack of computer security training at theDepartment of Justice.  We believe that strong leadership, such as bythe Office of National Drug Control Policy (the office responsiblefor overseeing the implementation of national drug policies) is a keyfactor in streamlining the intelligence effort without compromisingsecurity. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.5DOJ12:  Streamline Background Investigations for Federal EmployeesThe current method of completing background examinations on federalemployees is time-consuming and inefficient.  This recommendationoutlines improvements to streamline the process without sacrificingthoroughness. GAO CommentsWe have not specifically reviewed this issue with respect to Justiceemployees.  But, given our past work at other agencies, we endorsethe concept of streamlining background investigations provided thatthoroughness is not jeopardized, particularly with respect to theinvestigation of employees for sensitive positions such as those inlaw enforcement. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.6DOJ16:  Develop Lower Cost Solutions to Federal Prison Space ProblemsThis recommendation describes approaches to solving existing prisonspace problems. GAO CommentsWe agree that lower cost solutions need to be pursued, andimplemented where feasible, but it is not yet clear whether NPR'srecommendation will be limited to lowering the cost of prison designand construction or encompass options for reducing the number ofpersons sent to prison.  Between fiscal years 1986 and 1992, thefederal inmate population grew from 41,500 to more than 89,000, inpart reflecting changes in sentencing policies.  Absent a change inthose policies, the rapid growth in the federal prison population canbe expected to continue, requiring additional prison capacity.    RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH GAO   DISAGREES--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:3None.    RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHICH GAO   HAS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO   JUDGE--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4DOJ09:  Make the Department of Justice Operate More Effectively asthe U.S.  Government Law FirmJustice should undertake several improvements in the way it managesits litigation functions to improve service to its customers andbetter manage its case load. GAO CommentsWe believe that improving litigation service to customers is a goalthat should be pursued by the Department.  We have reported on theneed for uniform and accurate litigative case management data and onweaknesses in ADP management and operations, most notably in the areaof ADP security.  We have not made an in-depth evaluation of otheralternatives to existing litigation practices. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.1DOJ10:  Improve White Collar Fraud Civil EnforcementCivil fraud recovery should be established as a priority and thedepartment should take steps to improve its white collar fraudenforcement. GAO CommentsWe recognize that civil fraud recoveries are an important aspect ofwhite collar fraud enforcement.  See our comments on relatedrecommendation DOJ04.  We have not studied other alternatives toexisting practices. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.2DOJ11:  Reduce the Duplication of Law Enforcement Training FacilitiesOverlap and duplication in the provision of federal law enforcementtraining facilities should be examined.  Multi-agency training needsshould be accommodated through existing facilities in lieu of theconstruction of new facilities by individual agencies. GAO CommentsAlthough we have not studied this issue, this is an area where wewould agree that further examination could prove worthwhile.  Lawenforcement agencies, while having unique missions that requireindividualized training, frequently have overlapping jurisdictionsand perform functions that require similar or identical knowledge andskills. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.3DOJ13:  Adjust Civil Monetary Penalties to the Inflation IndexCivil monetary penalties have not been adjusted to keep up withinflation.  Under this recommendation, a "catch-up" adjustment wouldbe made and the need for additional inflation adjustments would beautomatically reassessed every four years. GAO CommentsAt this time we have insufficient information to assess the basis foror desirability of this recommendation.  Our work on civil debt andcriminal fines indicates that a major problem is collecting thecriminal and civil fines and penalties now imposed.  Recent Justiceestimates indicate that the total amount of unpaid criminal debtexceeded $1.6 billion, and the balance continues to grow. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.4DOJ14:  Improve Federal Courthouse SecurityThis recommendation is intended to address concerns of the U.S. Marshals Service concerning security at federal courthouses. GAO CommentsWe recognize that federal courthouses need to be secure and MarshalsService resources need to be targeted at the greatest security needsbased on systematic assessments of potential risk.  We have not yetcompleted our ongoing review of courthouse and judicial securityissues and thus have not taken a position on these matters. ------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.5DOJ15:  Improve the Professionalism of the U.S.  Marshals ServiceU.S.  Marshals should be selected based on merit by the Director ofthe U.S.  Marshals Service and reduce some positions. GAO CommentsWhile we endorse the concept of improving the professionalism of theMarshals Service and reducing unnecessary positions where feasible,we have not studied this issue and thus do not have sufficientinformation on which to take a position.

Schools have adopted a broad range ofsolutions to curb violence.  The four programs GAO visited--inCalifornia, Ohio, and New York--are examples of some of the promisingapproaches schools have initiated to address violence.  Researchsuggests that the most promising school-based violence-preventionprograms involve at least some of seven key characteristics, including acomprehensive approach, starting early, and involving parents.  Althoughfew prevention programs have been evaluated, some federal agencies arenow funding evaluations to examine various violence-prevention programapproaches.  The results, which should be available in three to fiveyears, will help determine which programs work best at curbing violence.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  HEHS-95-106     TITLE:  School Safety: Promising Initiatives for Addressing School              Violence      DATE:  04/25/95   SUBJECT:  Juvenile delinquency             Crime prevention             Crimes or offenses             Interagency relations             Educational programs             Education program evaluation             Students             Education or training             Public schoolsIDENTIFIER:  Anaheim (CA)             Dayton (OH)             New York (NY)             Paramount (CA)             Go to High School, Go to College Project (Atlanta, GA)             Beacons Initiative (New York, NY)             SMART Program (Anaheim, CA)             PACT Program (Dayton, OH)             *************************************************************************** This file contains an ASCII representation of the text of a GAO        ** report.

DoddRanking Minority MemberSubcommittee on Children and FamiliesUnited States SenateDear Senator Dodd: The incidence of school violence--searches for weapons, shootings,gang activity, fighting, and other instances of disruptivebehavior--has risen to unacceptable levels.  Nearly 3 million crimesoccur in or near the nation's 85,000 public schools every year\1--about one every 6 seconds.  Further, the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 105 violentschool-related deaths occurred during the past 2 years.  Suchconditions create environments that impede teaching and learning andmake parents reluctant to send their children to school.  In fact, arecent national survey listed school order and safety as parents' toppriority--right along with teaching the basics (reading, writing, andarithmetic).\2 Ending the epidemic of youth violence will not beeasy.  According to violence-prevention experts, no simple solutionexists.  However, individuals, groups, and community organizationsare beginning to work with schools to develop programs aimed atstopping youth violence before it starts. This report responds to your request for information about some ofthe programs used by schools to curb violence.  As agreed with yourstaff, we (1) examined four promising prevention programs, obtainingteacher and student views on these efforts; and reviewed evaluationdata on these programs; (2) identified key characteristics typicallyassociated with promising school-based violence-prevention programs;and (3) identified federally sponsored evaluations ofviolence-prevention programs operating in schools. To answer your questions, we reviewed the research literature onyouth violence-prevention, and interviewed violence-preventionprogram directors, federal agency officials, and acknowledgedexperts.  In addition, we visited four programs in four cities thathave shown signs of success.  During visits, we talked with students,teachers, and school administrators.  In addition, we interviewedfederal agency officials concerning their efforts to evaluateviolence-prevention programs.  (See app.  VII for more details on ourscope and methodology). --------------------\1 National Crime Victimization Survey, Bureau of Justice Statistics,U.S.  Department of Justice (1991). \2 "First Things First:  What Americans Expect From the PublicSchools," Public Agenda, New York, New York (1994).    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The four school-based violence-prevention programs that we visitedall show initial signs of success.  Schools in the Anaheim,California, program, stressing school management and order issues,reported reductions in the incidents of student fighting, graffiti,and defiance of authority.  Paramount, California, schools uses anantigang curriculum to reduce gang membership among students whoparticipated in the program.  The Dayton, Ohio, program providesstudents with social skills and anger-management training.  Accordingto program officials, student participants had fewer juvenile courtcharges than a comparable group of students.  Similarly, a New YorkCity program has used conflict-resolution and peer-mediation trainingto reduce student fighting.  For example, 71 percent of teachersobserved less physical violence among student participants. Violence-prevention literature and experts consistently associate atleast seven characteristics with promising school-basedviolence-prevention programs.  These characteristics are (1) acomprehensive approach, (2) an early start and long-term commitment,(3) strong leadership and disciplinary policies, (4) staffdevelopment, (5) parental involvement, (6) interagency partnershipsand community linkages, and (7) a culturally sensitive anddevelopmentally appropriate approach.  For example, teaching studentsearly about making positive choices and linking school-based programsto community groups, such as law enforcement or service agencies, areapproaches associated with promising programs. Although few violence-prevention programs have been evaluated,efforts are underway to identify successful approaches for curbingschool violence.  For example, during fiscal years 1992 and 1993, weidentified 26 federal grants (approximately $28 million) that help toevaluate the effectiveness of various school-basedviolence-prevention programs.  In addition, recent actions toincrease collaboration among federal agencies could also enhanceefforts to identify promising programs by providing opportunities forsharing expertise and resources.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2During the past decade, the Congress has expressed its concern forstudent safety and school security through numerous hearings and theintroduction of several bills aimed at reducing youth violence.  In1994, a desire to help make schools safe prompted the Congress topass two bills explicitly targeting school violence: The Safe Schools Act of 1994 authorizes the Secretary of Education tomake grants to local school districts with high rates of youthviolence.  Schools may use these grants to support educationalactivities to reduce violence and promote safety.  For fiscal year1994, approximately $20 million was appropriated for this program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 authorizesthe Secretary of Education to make grants to states to preventviolence in and around schools as well as to deter the use of illegaldrugs and alcohol.  Allowable activities include violence-preventionand education programs for students, training and technicalassistance, and developing comprehensive violence and drug preventionprograms that involve parents and coordination with community groupsand agencies.\3 Fiscal year 1995 appropriations for this program wereapproximately $482 million.\4In addition, in 1994 the Congress passed the Family and CommunityEndeavor Schools Act, which established the Schools and CommunityEndeavor Schools Program and the Community Schools Youth Services andSupervision Program.  This act authorizes the Departments ofEducation and Health and Human Services to provide grants to improvethe overall development of at-risk children in communities withsignificant poverty and violent crime.  Allowable activities includedeveloping after-school programs that provide homework assistance andeducational, social, and athletic activities.  The fiscal year 1995appropriation for the Schools and Community Endeavor Schools Programwas $11 million, while The Community Schools Youth Services andSupervision Program received $25.6 million. --------------------\3 Formerly the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act, in 1994 itsauthorization was expanded to include violence-prevention as a keyprogram element. \4 The Department of Education is scheduled for disbursement in June1995.  However, in March 1995, all funds were proposed for rescissionby the House Committee on Appropriations.       SCHOOL-BASED      VIOLENCE-PREVENTION PROGRAMS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1Schools use a wide variety of educational and noneducationalapproaches and programs to address violence.  Many school-basedviolence-prevention programs operate under the premise that violenceis a learned behavior.  In general, these programs focus on primaryprevention; that is, they seek to prevent violence before it occurs. Although school-based violence-prevention programs and strategiesvary, most fall within the three broad categories listed below. Educational and curricula-based:  These programs seek to teachstudents the skills to manage their behavior and resolve conflictnonviolently.  Programs in this category focus on conflictresolution, gang aversion, social skills training, mentoring, andlaw-related education. Environmental modification:  These programs focus on either thesocial or physical environment.  Programs aimed at improvingstudents' social environment include home visitation and after-schoolrecreational and academic activities.  Programs that seek to modifystudents' physical environment include installing metal detectors andgates limiting access to building entrances and exits. School organization and management:  These programs focus onestablishing school discipline policies and procedures that pertainto student behavior, creating alternative schools, and developingcooperative relationships with police and other government agencies. Legal efforts to regulate the use of and access to weapons in schoolsalso fall into this category. A survey of its members by the National School Boards Association(NSBA) showed the wide variety of violence-prevention programsoperating in schools.\5 According to the 1993 report, Violence in theSchools:  How America's School Boards Are Safeguarding Our Children,the responding school districts implemented more than 750 differentviolence-prevention programs.  For reporting districts, overallresponses ranged from establishing alternative schools or programsfor disruptive students (66 percent) to implementingconflict-resolution and peer-mediation training (61 percent) todeveloping safe havens (alternative after-school programs) forstudents (10 percent).  (See app.  I for a complete listing of schooldistrict responses.)In a 1993 report, The Prevention of Youth Violence:  A Framework forCommunity Action, the CDC highlighted several community programsdesigned to prevent youth violence, including those with activitiesclosely linked to schools.  For example, according to programdescriptions: In Atlanta, Georgia, the Go to High School, Go to College project haspaired 100 successful older men with adolescent African-Americanmales at four Atlanta high schools and one middle school.  Eachmentor meets weekly with a student who is struggling academically,has discipline problems, or is at risk of dropping out of school. The mentors are provided with a 40-page curriculum of instructionsand ideas.  Mentors strive to increase the students' self-esteem andimprove their grades.  A local fraternity chapter providesscholarships to students in the program who qualify and want toattend college. In New Haven, Connecticut, the public school system in collaborationwith the Yale School of Psychology provides training in social skillsin all the district's middle schools.  The curriculum emphasizesself-control, stress- management, problem-solving, decision-making,and communication skills.  Once students have learned a generalproblem-solving framework, they apply their critical-thinking skillsto specific issues, such as substance use. In Oakland, California, Teens on Target, a peer education andmentoring group, was formed after two junior high students were shotin school by other students.  Teens on Target grew out of a taskforce, made up of a coalition of elected officials, parents, andschool and community agency representatives, who felt that studentswould do a better job of dealing with the youth violence problem thanadults.  Selected high school students are trained in an intensivesummer program to be violence-prevention advocates, particularly inthe areas of guns, drugs, and family violence.  These students becomepeer educators to other high school students and mentors to youngerstudents in the middle and elementary schools. Another innovative program--the Beacon Initiative--operates in NewYork City, where about 36 schools now stay open 7 days a week fromearly morning until late evening--providing "one stop shopping"services such as counseling, tutoring, recreational activities,vocational training, and a safe place for kids to "hang out."--------------------\5 The NSBA surveyed more than 2,000 national affiliate schooldistricts, of which 729 school districts responded.  The results arenot generalizable.    FOUR PROMISING PROGRAMS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3      PROGRAMS SEEK TO STOP      VIOLENCE BEFORE IT STARTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1Creating an orderly and disciplined school environment, free ofviolence, is essential for learning to take place.  Consequently,many schools and communities across the nation are working togetherto develop solutions to prevent violence.  Although school violenceis a challenging issue, some school-based prevention programs appearto be promising approaches for curbing violence.  Table 1 summariesthe key features of the four programs that we visited.

Each is summarized below. Anaheim, California's SMART program has been applauded by federalofficials as a key effort in addressing school management and orderissues.  According to program officials, SMART has been disseminatedacross the country as a model school management program that allowsadministrators to determine at the push of a button the number andlocation of policy violations, offenses, and crimes committed in eachschool. The SMART program operates districtwide, using a computerized datacollection system to identify and address school and law violations. SMART teams analyze data from the system to identify and developsolutions to discipline problems.  A key SMART program element is itsfocus on school problems, not problem schools.  (See app.  II formore details on this program.)Dayton, Ohio's PACT program has received wide recognition as a modelprogram and valuable resource for addressing violence amongAfrican-American youth by several national organizations and leadersin the field of violence-prevention.  Program officials describe PACTas a culturally sensitive training program developed specifically formiddle-school-age African-American youth to reduce theirdisproportionate risk of becoming victims or perpetrators ofviolence.  The program especially addresses the problem of violencethat involves loss of control between family, friends, oracquaintances and represents the greatest threat to adolescents. PACT builds on research that suggests that prevention programs aremost successful for economically disadvantaged and minority youthwhen developed with sensitivity to racial, ethnic, and culturalissues.  The program's training materials are based on the rationalethat adolescents who lack skill in such areas as communication,negotiation, and problem-solving have a limited range of alternativeswith which to solve interpersonal problems.  Consequently, PACTprovides structured training in specific behavioral aspects of socialskills that enhance the capacity of students to form and maintainviolence-free relationships.  (See app.  III for more details on thisprogram.)New York, New York's RCCP program is widely regarded as one of themost promising violence-prevention programs among public healthexperts.  RCCP is a school-based program in conflict resolution andintergroup relations that provides a model for preventing violenceand creating caring schools that are conducive for learning. According to the program officials, RCCP teaches students that theyhave many choices besides passivity or aggression for dealing withconflict, gives them the skills to make those choices real in theirown lives, increases their understanding and appreciation of theirown and others' cultures, and shows them that they play a powerfulrole in creating a peaceful world. The program's primary strategy for reaching young people isprofessional development of the adults in their lives--principals,teachers, and parents.  RCCP works intensively with teachers,introducing them to the concepts and skills of conflict resolutionand diversity.  Through ongoing staff development, teachers aresupported as they teach these concepts and skills in an ongoing wayto their students.  (See app.  IV for more details on this program.)Paramount, California's ATGM program has been widely replicated andofficials have responded to almost 1,000 requests for informationabout the program.  Cited as an exemplary gang membership preventionprogram in several journals, the program has been visited byindividuals from Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa, according toprogram officials.  The ATGM program seeks to reduce the number ofgang members and their destructive actions within the community byteaching students the harmful consequences of a gang lifestyle.  (SeeAppendix V for more detailed information.)ATGM's approach is based on the belief that interest in gangs beginsat a young age and that a successful antigang program must reachstudents early.  Consequently, the program targets students (most ofwhom are Latino) in the 2nd, 5th, and 7th grades.  The program usesthree approaches to achieve its objectives:  (1) an elementary schoolantigang curriculum, (2) an intermediate school follow-up program,and (3) neighborhood meetings with parents and residents.  (See app. V for more details on this program.)      STUDENTS AND TEACHERS      BELIEVE PROGRAMS MAKE A      DIFFERENCE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2Nearly all discussion group participants at the four programs'schools that we visited said their violence-prevention programs wereuseful, helped de-escalate conflict, and taught important copingskills that students need to make positive choices.  Most discussiongroup participants agreed that students often lack the skills neededto make productive and positive decisions.  For example, severalstudents who participated in conflict-resolution and anger-managementprograms said that before their training, they had not consideredresolving disagreements and conflicts without fighting.  One studenttold us:      "I didn't know any other way to resolve my problems besides     fighting.  Now instead of fighting, I work it out and talk about     it.  I've got some options."In addition, discussion group participants generally agreed thatprograms empowered students and helped them avoid violence byteaching them to (1) identify and solve problems throughrole-playing, group discussions, mediation, and other learningstrategies, such as videos; and (2) make positive decisions,recognize that they have choices, and understand the consequences oftheir actions (for example that fighting, joining gangs, or engagingin other nonproductive behavior may result in suspension from school,personal injury, or death). Students and teachers we talked with expressed concern thatdisruptive behavior and violence prevent meaningful learning.  Theytold us that disruptive students interrupt the learning process bydistracting other students and the teacher.  According to oneteacher:      "Sometimes, teachers can't teach because they've got to stop and     deal with hostile situations.  .  .  we're teaching students     skills they should learn at home."In addition, participants expressed concern that moneys intended forinstructional materials, staff development, and other educationalneeds were spent on security efforts. Although students and teachers perceived their programs assuccessful, they unequivocally stated that no one program or approachcould curb school violence.  They generally agreed that curbingschool violence requires a combinations of approaches.\6 In additionto the key characteristics discussed later, students and teacherssuggested strengthening efforts to curb violence byincreasing the availability of violence-prevention programs,providing after-school activities (especially sports),reducing class sizes,addressing physical child abuse and neglect,providing services for at-risk families,establishing a uniform dress code,penalizing students who watch fights,reducing easy access to guns, andimproving economic conditions. --------------------\6 These comments are consistent with violence and drug educationresearch literature that suggest that comprehensive approaches thatinvolve parents and the community as well as classroom instructionand counseling programs are more likely to achieve desired changes.       PRELIMINARY EVALUATIONS SHOW      SIGNS OF SUCCESS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3The authors of the preliminary evaluations that we reviewed concludedthat the four programs showed initial signs of success becausestudent participants' attitudes and behaviors had changed.  Reportedparticipant changes included:  (1) new attitudes toward violence andgang membership; (2) less disruptive behavior, including fewerfights; and (3) less contact with the criminal justice system.  Basedon pre- and post-tests of knowledge and attitudes, behavioralobservations, self-reporting, and in some cases tracking studentbehavior, the evaluations reported the following signs of success: Anaheim, California's SMART--The number of police activity reportsfiled dropped from 189 during the spring semester of 1993 to 93during the fall semester of 1993, according to SMART's incidentprofiling system.  In addition, student offenses dropped or stayedthe same in all but nine categories--despite increases in crimewithin the community. Dayton, Ohio's PACT--For the 1992 school year, first semester PACTparticipants had a 50-percent reduction in incidents of physicalaggression, while nonparticipants (the control group) had a25-percent increase.  Similarly second semester PACT participants hada 53-percent reduction, while nonparticipants had a 56-percentincrease. New York City's RCCP--A 1988-89 school year evaluation of RCCPteachers revealed that (1) 66 percent observed less studentname-calling and fewer verbal put-downs, (2) 89 percent agreed thatthe mediation program had helped students take more responsibilityfor solving their own problems, and (3) 71 percent reported thatstudents demonstrated less physical violence. Paramount, California's ATGM--After participating in the program, 90percent of the students responded negatively to the idea of joining agang.  Based on a follow-up survey, most students maintained thatresponse a year later.  Further, a 1993 cross-check of the names ofmore than 3,500 past participants with the names of approximately1,600 known gang members found only a 4-percent match. Collectively, the evaluations showed high levels of enthusiasm andsupport for the programs.  Although these results are promising, thelimited nature of the evaluations prevent concluding thatimprovements in student behavior resulted from program participation. Determining whether these programs reduce violence among studentsover the long term requires more carefully designed evaluations thatfocus on the programs' actual impact on behavior.  Such evaluationdesign matters are discussed further below.       PRELIMINARY EVALUATIONS NEED      STRONGER DESIGNS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.4A general consensus exists that while preliminary evaluations ofviolence-prevention programs are a useful starting point, most lackthe methodological rigor needed to determine their effectiveness.  Toimprove the usefulness of future evaluations, greater emphasis shouldbe placed on designing stronger impact or effectiveness studies.\7Design issues requiring particular attention include:  samplingtechniques, longitudinal assessment, random assignment, andcollection of impact (fewer fights) and outcome measures (reducedinjury). To determine whether violence-prevention programs really causeobserved behavioral change, evaluators should compare the outcomesachieved by students in randomly assigned treatment and controlgroups.\8 For example, concerning the Paramount, California, ATGMprogram cross-checking mentioned earlier, how many (or how few)students would have joined gangs in the absence of the program is notclear.  Because the evaluation design did not use random assignment,linking changes in student behavior to program participation isdifficult.  Finally, longitudinal follow-up on students for 4 to 5years after participation (or until they leave school) would show towhat extent initially observed effects persist over time. The program officials that we talked with acknowledged the need forstronger evaluation designs that focus on program effectiveness. However, they said that the high cost of program evaluation, coupledwith a lack of skilled research and evaluation staff, generallyprecluded developing stronger designs.  They said that implementingprograms (which many perceive as doing something about the problem ofviolence) has more prestige than evaluating programs.  Consequently,although funders want data on participant outcomes, they focus onprogram implementation rather than evaluation. According to program officials, doing impact evaluations withstronger designs depends on obtaining grants or private fundsspecifically for that purpose.  For example, PACT has been able todevelop comparison groups and has longitudinal outcomes based onfunding received from private sources for its evaluation efforts. However, at the time that we completed our work, only one of theother four programs we visited had received such funding.  InSeptember 1993, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Controlat CDC awarded the New York RCCP program a 3-year, $729,000 grant toconduct a detailed impact evaluation.  The three-pronged evaluationwill include (1) a longitudinal process and impact study, (2) anin-depth observational and qualitative study, and (3) development ofa management information system. --------------------\7 Impact evaluations focus on program effectiveness.  Impactevaluations are methodologically rigorous studies that use scientificresearch methods to estimate to what extent participant outcomes (forexample, reductions in the prevalence of violence) occur because ofprogram participation. \8 True experimental design requires random assignment to treatmentand comparison group.  Although this is an analytically strongmethodology, it can be costly and require administrative control overthe program.  In some circumstances, quasi-experimental designs maybe adequate when a true experimental design is not feasible.    PROMISING PROGRAMS INCORPORATE   SEVEN KEY CHARACTERISTICS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Conclusive evidence concerning the effectiveness of specific programsis not yet available.  Nevertheless, some indications of promisingprogram characteristics exist, especially in school settings.  Basedon our literature review, discussions with school safety experts, andvisits to violence-prevention programs, we identified sevencharacteristics associated with promising school-basedviolence-prevention programs (see fig.  1).    Figure 1:  Promising Programs   Incorporate Seven Key   Characteristics   (See figure in printed   edition.)Comprehensive approach:  Recognizes violence as a complex problemthat requires a multifaceted response.  Consequently, these programsaddress more than one problem area and involve a variety of servicesthat link schools to the community. Early start and long-term commitment:  Focuses on (1) reaching youngchildren to shape attitudes, knowledge, and behavior while they arestill open to positive influences, and (2) sustaining theintervention over multiple years (for example, from kindergartenthrough 12th grade). Strong leadership and disciplinary policies:  Show strong leadershipat the school level.  Principals and school administrators need tosustain stable funding, staff, and program components and mostimportant, they must collaborate with others to reach program goals. In addition, student disciplinary policies and procedures are clearand consistently applied. Staff development:  Provides training for key school administrators,teachers, and staff that equips them to handle disruptive studentsand mediate conflict as well as understand and incorporate preventionstrategies into their school activities. Parental involvement:  Seeks to increase parental involvement inschool efforts to reduce violence by providing training onviolence-prevention skills, making home visits, and using parents asvolunteers. Interagency partnerships and community linkages:  Seeks communitysupport in making school antiviolence policies and programs work bydeveloping collaborative agreements in which school personnel, localbusinesses, law enforcement officers, social service agencies, andprivate groups work together to address the multiple causes ofviolence. Culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate:  Considers (1)racial ethnic students' cultural values and norms by using bilingualmaterials and culturally appropriate program activities, role models,and leaders; and (2) participants' age and level of development indesigning program materials and activities. Although researchers advocate the use of these key characteristics,few violence-prevention programs incorporate all sevencharacteristics.    FEDERAL EVALUATION EFFORTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Our analysis of program descriptions contained in the Federal AgencyJuvenile Delinquency Development Statements for the 3-year period1990 to 1992, showed that 11 agencies funded 115 research programs orevaluations (ranging from $108 to $133 million annually) thataddressed youth violence.  However, only one grant provided fundingto evaluate a school-based violence-prevention program. More recently, some federal officials have acknowledged the need tofocus available resources on identifying violence-prevention programsand strategies that work.  For example, three research-basedagencies--CDC, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), and theNational Institute for Mental Health (NIMH)--have taken the lead infunding impact evaluations to study the effectiveness of specificschool-based interventions.  These three agencies awarded about 26grants totaling approximately $27 million for this purpose duringfiscal years 1993 and 1994 (see app.  VI for a list of thesestudies). The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 presentsan opportunity for the federal government to strengthen efforts todetermine the effectiveness of various violence-prevention programsand approaches.  The act authorizes up to $1 million for a nationalimpact evaluation.  The act also authorizes up to $25 million indiscretionary funding for national programs--evaluation is one ofmany allowable activities.       GREATER COLLABORATION NEEDED      AMONG FEDERAL AGENCIES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Increased collaboration among federal agencies could significantlyleverage federal funds and enhance efforts to identify anddisseminate information on promising violence-prevention programs. At least three federal departments--Education, Health and HumanServices, and Justice--support school-based violence-preventionresearch and programming.  However, these individual departments havenot mounted a comprehensive strategy for addressing school violence. Further, although these departments occasionally work together, aformal mechanism to facilitate collaboration and coordination onschool violence issues has not yet been developed.  Agency officialscite budget constraints as a major factor necessitating greatercollaboration. According to federal officials, effective collaboration requires (1)sharing resources (both staff and funding) and information (such asresearch and programmatic plans and priorities) and (2) developingclear roles and responsibilities for each federal department toensure a comprehensive approach that avoids overlapping andduplicative efforts.  Consequently, the mechanism for coordinationand collaboration should facilitate planning and program integration,not merely information sharing.  Although the Federal CoordinatingCouncil on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is responsiblefor coordinating the efforts of federal agencies concerning juveniledelinquency and delinquency prevention; the group only recentlyconvened--after a 2-year hiatus.\9Further, federal officials told us that in the past the actual levelof participation on the Coordinating Council was insufficient toeffectively facilitate the type of coordination and collaborationneeded.  However, efforts are now underway to revitalize theCoordinating Council since a new Administrator for the Office ofJuvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has been selected. Some federal collaborative efforts concerning violence-preventionprogramming have started.  For instance, the National School SafetyCenter (NSSC) and the SMART program represent successful interagencycollaborations.\10 In both instances, the Departments of Justice andEducation shared funding and staff to implement these programs.  Inaddition, for the past 2 years, these agencies and several othershave collaborated in sponsoring a national violence-preventionconference.  Expected benefits from increased collaboration amongfederal agencies include development ofa comprehensive long-term federal violence-prevention researchagenda,stronger evaluation designs that result in firmer conclusions aboutprogram effectiveness,a database with information summarizing the cumulative results ofprogram evaluations across agencies,a process for identifying successful programs, anda central on-line database for disseminating information onsuccessful programs. --------------------\9 The Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention was established through Section 206 of the JuvenileJustice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act.  The Chairman of theCoordinating Council is the Attorney General of the United States;the Vice Chairman is the Administrator for the Office of JuvenileJustice Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). \10 NSSC represents a partnership between the Departments of Justiceand Education and Pepperdine University.  The NSSC, which serves as aclearinghouse, focuses national attention on school safety issues andsolutions.    CONCLUSIONS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6Many schools throughout our nation are struggling with rising levelsof youth violence in and around schools.  Schools have adopted abroad range of solutions to curb violence.  The four programs wevisited--in California, Ohio, and New York--represent examples ofsome of the promising approaches schools have implemented to addressviolence. Research suggests that the most promising school-basedviolence-prevention programs will involve at least seven keycharacteristics.  Among these characteristics are a comprehensiveapproach, starting early, and involving parents.  Although fewprevention programs have been evaluated, some federal agencies arefunding evaluations to examine several violence-prevention programapproaches.  The results, which should be available in about 3 to 5years, will help determine which programs work best at curbingviolence.

AUHSD has eight high schools, eightjunior high schools, and a variety of alternative education sites. Students with limited or no English skills account for 35 percent ofthe student population.  In the 1993-94 school year, over 34 percentof the students were eligible for free or reduced price lunches. Like many school districts nationwide, AUHSD began experiencingproblems with drug abuse, crime, and gangs in the late 1970s.  Thenumber of identified gangs and gang members increased significantlyfrom 1985 to 1994.  In 1985, AUHSD communities had eight gangs withan estimated 179 members.  Today, local police departments haveidentified over 50 gangs with about 2,100 members.  AUHSD hasinitiated several strategies to combat crime in and around theirschools.  AUHSD has a zero tolerance policy for gangs, weapons, anddrugs on campuses.  Also, AUHSD has an antigang dress code andclosed-campus policy.  AUHSD schools have nonuniformed communityvolunteers to help with security, but do not use metal detectors. The Anaheim Police Department has assigned two officers to workfull-time on gang prevention activities in the district.  AUHSDofficials are also experimenting with other methods of schoolsecurity.  For example, they have placed mobile homes on severalschool campuses.  Retired persons live in the homes rent-free inexchange for helping to deter after-hours school vandalism.    PROGRAM OVERVIEW-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2In the late 1970s, AUHSD officials sought ways to combat the risinglevels of crime in their communities.  They participated in trainingto identify, categorize, and log incidents on campus and designappropriate interventions.  These training efforts turned into theSMART program.  In 1983, the U.S.  Department of Justice, NationalInstitute of Justice (NIJ), and the U.S.  Department of Educationjointly funded SMART as a pilot in AUHSD and two other sites. SMART's goal is to improve school safety and discipline by combininginformation technology with concepts in school team-building andinteragency coordination. Since 1983, AUHSD administrators and staff have developed andintegrated the SMART program districtwide.  SMART consists of fiveprogram components that operate together and provide a unifiedapproach to school safety and discipline: Commitment.  The primary SMART requirement is the commitment of thesuperintendent and principals to improve school safety anddiscipline. Safety and security audit.  Program officials conduct an audit ofdistrict policies and practices affecting drugs, crime, discipline,and student/faculty safety to help clarify responsibilities forschool officials in dealing with different types of crime anddiscipline problems. Incident Profiling System.  The Incident Profiling System (IPS) is acomputerized procedure by which each school records disciplinaryinfractions and criminal acts.  IPS generates reports describingpatterns of disruptions and crimes.  It tracks the types ofincidents, locations, times, and persons involved. SMART teams.  SMART teams include students, parents, teachers,support staff, law enforcement/security, and administrators.  SMARTteams meet monthly to analyze current IPS data, set priorities,devise actions to reduce problems, and monitor results.  Each teamprepares a SMART plan to reduce priority problems. Interagency coordination.  AUHSD officials meet with representativesfrom juvenile justice, social service, and law enforcement agenciesto coordinate their responses to youth who commit crimes or havebehavior problems. The core of the SMART program is the statistical information gatheredthrough IPS.  This computerized system enables AUHSD officials tocollect and analyze a wide range of information about studentdiscipline.  Over the years, AUHSD officials have developed their owncomputer program to record and track disruptive events andindividuals.  School officials are responsible for completing amachine-scannable form on any disruptive event or individual theyencounter.  IPS data include rule violations such as a failure toserve detention and law violations such as robbery, sex offenses,drug or weapons possession, assaults, and property crimes. AUHSD principals and SMART teams compile and analyze IPS data at theschool level to dispel rumor, to identify and characterize disciplineproblems, and to assess the consequence of actions taken.  Principalscan identify the areas of the school and the period of the day whenthe most violence or disruption occurs and the individual studentswho are causing a disproportionate amount of disruption.  Once theprincipal has this information, he or she convenes a SMART team. This team produces and monitors a school SMART plan concentrating onone topic at a time.  For example, a team may concentrate on lockerthefts.  A district SMART teams follows a similar process whenanalyzing districtwide information. AUHSD principals, counselors, and staff have developed an integratedservice model to handle students or systemic problems identified bySMART data.  This model provides a mechanism for schools to work withthe community, governmental agencies, and local businesses to meetthe needs of these at-risk students.  Services provided through thisintegrated approach include peer tutoring, alcohol- anddrug-prevention programs, crisis intervention, andconflict-resolution training.    PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND   EVALUATION EFFORTS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3AUHSD officials have conducted extensive internal evaluations of theSMART program that compare trends in IPS data.  In general, districtstatistics show that incidents on campuses have increased graduallywhile levels of crime in the surrounding communities have increasedat a much faster rate.  AUHSD officials cited recent outcomeinformation generated from IPS:  (1) 55 percent of the 37 maincategories of incidents have declined since 1993,\11 (2) policeactivity on campus is down 51 percent from the spring semester 1993to 1994, and (3) the reported total costs of incidents have dropped66 percent from the fall semester 1991 to 1993. In 1992, NIJ and the Department of Education contracted with theCenter for Research and Evaluation in Social Policy\12for an external evaluation of the SMART program.  The report focusedon SMART's usefulness--based on interviews, SMART data, and internaldocuments.  The evaluators found strong support and encouragement forthe SMART program among school board members, the superintendent, anddistrict and school staff.  Further, they found that AUHSD officialsdeveloped a depth of understanding and experience well beyond thecore elements of SMART.  They also found evidence that schools usingthe SMART program had reduced problems with graffiti, fighting,failure to attend detention, and defiance of authority.  The reportconcluded that AUHSD officials have institutionalized SMART into itsdaily operations and are taking positive actions as a result of theSMART program.  The report also concluded that SMART and relatedsystems have increased the level of confidence of parents, students,and teachers in school safety. --------------------\11 Incident categories that have declined include assaults, battery,robbery, possession of destructive devices, property crimes, forgery,tardiness, weapons, failure to serve detention, throwing objects,threats/intimidation, profanity, tobacco, and off-campus incidents. \12 Draft report No.  P-557, Graduate School of Education, Universityof Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.    MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4AUHSD officials believe that the following key factors contribute tothe SMART program's success: using a systematic problem-solving approach to resolve school crimeand discipline problems;focusing on local control;using existing resources with minimal additional funding;developing positive working relationships among educators, parents,students, local leaders, and community agencies; andfocusing on school problems, not problem schools.    IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5The main barrier that AUHSD officials encountered was in designingthe computer data files, reports, and forms to support SMART.  AUHSDofficials have spent considerable time and effort in developing theirown computer system to fit their needs.  AUHSD officials stated thatthey have experimented with three generations of computer programssince SMART's inception.  School officials currently use amachine-scannable form to record incidents.  They also developed aSMART data dictionary that lists various identifying characteristicsof individuals and events and types of violations committed.  IPSgenerates numerous computer reports to identify problems and makecomparisons.  This system has also been programmed to provide schoolsafety information required by California. AUHSD representatives have briefed other districts interested intheir SMART computer program.  They said that their system could beeasily replicated in other school districts.  However, disseminationefforts are contingent on future funding.    FUNDING SOURCES-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6Since 1983, AUHSD has had various levels of funding from NIJ and theDepartment of Education.  Over the years, AUHSD used these federalfunds for a variety of activities, such as program dissemination andsite coordinator stipends, training, and conferences.  AUHSD hasfunded most of SMART operating expenses out of its general fundssince SMART's inception.  Major ongoing expenses for 18 sites during1993-94 totaled about $37,000.  This estimate includes sitecoordinator stipends ($16,000), materials/supplies ($4,000), and apart-time program specialist ($17,000).  In addition, NIJ and theDepartment of Education awarded AUHSD a grant of $40,000 in 1993-94to enhance program interventions with conflict-resolution training,training packets, and training for new administrators. DAYTON, OHIO:  POSITIVEADOLESCENTS CHOICES TRAININGPROGRAM ROTH MIDDLE SCHOOL========================================================= Appendix III   DISTRICT PROFILE------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:1The Dayton public school system serves approximately 27,000 students. The district offers 5 high schools, 7 middle schools, 35 elementaryschools, and several centers with specialized programs of study. About 65 percent of the district's students are African-American. Most of the student population is educationally and economicallydisadvantaged; all schools within the district qualify for Title Ifunding.\13 In addition, about 70 percent of the students participatein the free or reduced-price lunch program. Violence is a growing concern within the district.  During the 1990school year, 152 students were referred to the principal fordisciplinary action because they carried weapons in school.  To helpmaintain safe school environments, walk-thru metal detectors wereinstalled in all middle and high schools in November 1992.  Duringthe first 2 years of metal detector use, districtwide expulsions andsuspension rates for weapons-related incidents declined.  Forexample, expulsions dropped from 200 in school year 1991-92 to 120 inschool year 1992-93.  Similarly, suspensions dropped from 3,483 inschool year 1991-92 to 3,311 in school year 1992-93. --------------------\13 The Title I program (formerly Chapter I), authorized under theElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, serveseducationally deprived children--children whose educationalattainment is below the level that is appropriate for their age--inrelatively high-poverty areas.    PROGRAM OVERVIEW------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2PACT is a violence-prevention program directed specifically at middleschool African-American youth.  Staff from the School of ProfessionalPsychology at Wright State University implement the PACT program incooperation with Dayton Public Schools.  The program began operationin 1989.  Since the beginning of the program, more than 130 youthshave been trained. PACT uses the rationale that adolescents who lack skills in suchareas as communication, negotiation, and problem-solving have alimited range of alternatives with which to solve interpersonalproblems.  In addition, the program builds on research that suggeststhat violence-prevention interventions with economicallydisadvantaged and minority youth are most successful when developedwith sensitivity to racial, ethnic, and cultural issues.  Therefore,the program uses African-American role models to create a learningenvironment directly relevant to the lives of African-Americanadolescents.  Teachers refer participants based on perceived skilldeficiencies in peer relations, behavior problems (particularlyaggression), or history of victimization by violence.  PACT traininguses small groups, composed of 10 to 12 students (12 to 15 yearsold).  Training is provided twice a week at Roth Middle School duringregular school hours.  Groups generally receive about 38 trainingsessions, each lasting about 50 minutes (the duration of a classroomperiod).  Two doctoral-level clinical psychology students facilitateeach training session. The principal PACT program components includetraining in three social skills (giving negative feedback, receivingnegative feedback, and negotiation),training in anger management skills (techniques to control or expressanger constructively), andeducation or information about violence (awareness-building lessonson the nature and extent of violence). Three videotaped vignettes feature African-American role modelsdemonstrating how some of the target skills are used:  The "Givin'It" video introduces skills on how to express angry feelings in acalm, nonthreatening manner.  The "Takin' It" video introduces skillson how to receive negative feedback without acting irrationally orbecoming overly upset.  The "Workin' It Out" video introduces skillson how to solve problems or work out a compromise to a conflictwithout resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. Principal techniques used during training sessions include modeling,coaching, role-playing, feedback, and homework (practicing the skillsoutside of class).  In addition, program facilitators use anincentive system that rewards active participation and appropriatebehavior (such as being on time and following directions) duringtraining sessions.  For example, students receive successdollars--paper money that can be exchanged for various gift items,such as cassette tapes, candy or food, T-shirts, jewelry, or games.    PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND   EVALUATION EFFORTS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3PACT evaluations seek to measure both process and behavioral effectsof the program.  In addition, since 1989, staff conductedlongitudinal followup through juvenile court on all PACT-trainedstudents.  An evaluation of the 1989-90 project year showed thatyouth who participated in the program demonstrated improvement in alltarget skill areas (for example, giving and accepting negativefeedback, problem-solving, and resisting peer pressure).  A 1992-93outcome study demonstrated that the PACT participants had lessinvolvement in fighting and fewer referrals to juvenile court incomparison with a control group that did not receive training.  Forexample, PACT-trained studentsdemonstrated a 50-percent reduction in physical aggression at school;showed behavior improvement during the course of training, which wasmaintained beyond participation in the program;showed a greater reduction in levels of physical aggression thansimilar nontrained students who did not receive the training; andhad more than 50 percent fewer overall and violence-related juvenilecourt charges and a lower per-person rate of offending than studentsin a nontrained control group. Other signs of success include (1) principal and teacher observationsconcerning improvements in the behavior of individual studentsattributed to PACT and (2) student testimonials that PACT trainingmade a difference in how they acted.    MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4PACT officials believe that the following key factors contribute tothe program's success: designing the program as a leadership club and providing a studentreward system,using culturally sensitive videotapes that feature African-Americanrole models, andusing doctoral-level clinical psychology students as trainers.    IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:5The PACT program overcame two major implementation barriers.  First,PACT initially targeted a small group of chronically truantadolescents at an alternative school-based dropout preventionprogram.  Although these participants showed skill and behaviorimprovements, the setting proved to be problematic.  For example, theparticipants were often absent from school.  Consequently, absencefrom PACT training was a major problem.  To address this issue, in1990 the program relocated to the Roth Middle School where ittargeted a younger population.  Second, the program initiallyoperated as a pull-out model, with meeting times scheduled for thesame time as academic subjects.  Consequently, students missed someregularly scheduled classes.  Since the program targeted high-riskstudents who most likely were also experiencing academic problems,this was of particular concern.  To overcome this barrier, PACTviolence-prevention training was made part of the regular curriculumunder the health education track.    FUNDING SOURCES------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:6State, federal, and private sources provide funding for the PACTprogram.  Funding to develop, test, evaluate, and disseminate programinformation has come from a variety of sources, including the OhioCommission on Minority Health; the Ohio Governor's Office of CriminalJustice Services; the Mathile Foundation; and the Bureau of JusticeAssistance, Department of Justice.  In addition, support for theproduction of the PACT curriculum resource guide came from theDepartment of Health and Human Services' Bureau of Maternal and ChildHealth. At the school level, instituting the PACT program using doctoral-level students as trainers costs approximately $55,200 per year orabout $287 per student.  If parent training is provided, the costincreases by $23,400 to approximately $78,600 or about $409 perstudent.  These estimates assume that the program serves 192students.  Costs for program evaluation vary depending on thecomplexity of the research design.  Current PACT evaluations costabout $21,000 for a part-time evaluation consultant. NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: RESOLVING CONFLICT CREATIVELYPROGRAM NEW YORK CITY PUBLICSCHOOLS========================================================== Appendix IV   DISTRICT PROFILE-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:1New York City's public school system is the largest in the country,with 1,052 schools and nearly 1 million students.\14The ethnically diverse student population citywide consisted of 37percent African American, 36 percent Hispanic, 18 percent white, and9 percent Asian/Pacific Islander for the 1992-93 school year. Fourteen percent of the students were limited English proficient and69 percent were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Officials are grappling with the increasing levels of urban crime andviolence that are invading their schools.  For the 1991-92 schoolyear, the New York Board of Education reported 4,955 seriousincidents in its schools, including homicide, robbery, sex offenses,and controlled substance and weapons possession.  To increase thelevel of school security, the board has responded by installing metaldetectors and X-ray machines and using student photo identificationcards in high schools.  The board has also funded conflict-resolutionand mediation programs and increased the number of school safetyofficers in all schools.  The board employs about 3,000 securityofficers.  If considered a police department, it would rank as theninth largest police department in the country, between the Baltimoreand Dade County Police Departments.  The budget for the Division ofSchool Safety, which includes security officers, 123 civilians and afleet of 90 vehicles, totaled nearly $73 million in 1993.  Also thatyear, 95 percent of the schools had school safety officers and 41high schools--or more than one-fourth of all high schools--had aweapons-detection program. --------------------\14 The Board of Education of the City of New York has oversight overall the schools and direct responsibility for the high schools.  Theboard selects superintendents to administer elementary andintermediate/junior high schools in 32 separate community schooldistricts.    PROGRAM OVERVIEW-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:2RCCP is a school-based program in conflict-resolution andintercultural understanding, jointly sponsored by the New York CityBoard of Education and Educators for Social Responsibility (ESR). ESR is a nonprofit organization dedicated to conflict- resolution andmulticultural education.  RCCP began in 1985 as a collaborationbetween ESR and the board to provide a model for an instructionalprogram in school change and violence-prevention. RCCP's objectives include modeling nonviolent alternatives fordealing with conflict and teaching negotiation, as well as otherconflict-resolution skills.  RCCP focuses on changing the schoolclimate and requires a strong commitment at the highest levels withinthe school system.  School districts then approach individualprincipals and teachers about joining the program.  Participation atevery level is voluntary; school districts, principals, individualteachers, and parents take part because they choose to do so.  RCCPis in place in 180 elementary, intermediate/junior high and highschools in New York City, with 3,000 teachers and 70,000 studentsparticipating.\15 According to RCCP officials, most of the programsserve at-risk students located in lower-income neighborhoods inBrooklyn, South Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens. The K-12 curriculum focuses on violence-prevention, conflictresolution, and countering bias.  RCCP curricula include thefollowing:  active listening, assertiveness (as opposed toaggressiveness or passivity), expressing feelings,perspective-taking, cooperation, negotiation, and interrupting bias. Teaching strategies include role-playing, interviewing, groupdiscussion, and brainstorming.  These teaching strategies requireteachers to adopt a new style of classroom management.  This methodinvolves a sharing of power with students so that they can learn todeal with their own disputes.  To create this change, RCCP has anintensive staff development component.  RCCP staff visit classroomsand conduct one-on-one consultations, demonstration lessons, andafter-school meetings with teachers and administrators.  In addition,RCCP's parent component teaches parents how to lead workshops forother parents on intergroup relations, family communication, andconflict resolution.  RCCP has an administrator's component also. --------------------\15 Currently, RCCP is being disseminated in over 300 schoolsnationwide under the auspices of the RCCP National Center.    PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND   EVALUATION EFFORTS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:3RCCP contracted with Metis Associates, Inc., a private consultinggroup, to do an external evaluation for the 1988-1989 school year inthree community school districts.  The evaluation assessed thevarious program components and measured the program's impact onparticipating students, staff, and administrators.  To determineRCCP's program impact, Metis Associates, Inc., primarily usedquestionnaires to 200 participating teachers,\16 as well as variousschool personnel and administrators; and administered achievementtests to a sample of 176 participating students and a control groupof 219 nonparticipating students.  To determine the effectiveness ofthe mediation program, Metis Associates, Inc., surveyed approximately150 teachers, 11 school staff, and 143 student mediators in the fiveschools using the program. Seventy-one percent of teachers responded that the program led toless physical violence in the classroom and 67 percent observed lessname-calling and fewer verbal put-downs.  The test results of 4th,5th, and 6th grade participants showed that they learned key conceptsof conflict resolution and could apply them in hypotheticalsituations.  Over 98 percent of respondents in the five schools saidthat the mediation component gave children an important tool fordealing with conflicts. The Metis report concluded that RCCP was exemplary and thatparticipants' assessments were extremely positive.  The report citedteacher's surveys that revealed a positive change in children'sattitudes and behaviors as a result of their participation in RCCP. In 1993, CDC awarded RCCP a 3-year grant to conduct an extensiveevaluation.  This evaluation will look at the impact of the program,the readiness of teachers, and the importance of each programcomponent. --------------------\16 Of the 200 teachers participating, about 130 or 65 percentreturned completed surveys.  For about 75 percent of the respondents,1988-89 was their first year with RCCP.    MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:4RCCP officials believe the following key factors contribute to theprogram's success: an on-going long-term commitment with the school district,strong support of the principal and school administrators, andpartnerships with parents and the community.    IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:5RCCP officials stated that the major barrier they encountered wasstruggling to work within a culture that glamorizes violent responsesto conflict.  RCCP bases its program on the premise that humanaggression is a learned behavior and that conflict itself is a normalpart of life.  According to RCCP officials, what must change,therefore, is how students respond to conflict.  RCCP teachesstudents that violence is not an acceptable means of resolvingconflict, that they can learn new nonviolent skills, and that theyhave a choice to make when a conflict arises.    FUNDING SOURCES-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:6Sponsoring school districts and foundation grants fund RCCPoperations.  For the 1992-93 school year, the budget for the New YorkCity RCCP program was about $2 million.  The board funded staffsalaries and teacher stipends in the amount of $700,000.  ESR wasresponsible for $1.3 million, with $750,000 from contracts with theCity's participating school districts and $550,000 raised fromprivate sources.  As mentioned earlier, CDC has funded a 3-yearevaluation of the RCCP program, totaling approximately $729,000($243,000 annually starting in 1993). PARAMOUNT, CALIFORNIA: ALTERNATIVES TO GANG MEMBERSHIPPROGRAM, PARAMOUNT UNIFIED SCHOOLDISTRICT=========================================================== Appendix V   DISTRICT PROFILE--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1The Paramount Unified School District encompasses 13 schools that hadan enrollment of 13,879 in the 1993-94 school year.  About 73 percentof the student population is Latino and 14 percent isAfrican-American.  In the 1993-94 school year, 46 percent of thestudents had limited English proficiency and about 60 percentreceived free or reduced-price lunches. Most of the 30 expulsions in school year 1993-94 were for weaponspossession or assault and battery.  Although the district does notcompile the reasons for suspension, school officials estimate thatmost of the 4,254 suspended days that year involved possession ofdrugs, fighting, or defiance of authority.  Currently, the districtcontracts for one armed, uniformed sheriff's deputy at the singlehigh school.  As of March 1994, because of racial tensions that haderupted on campus, the school board was considering the purchase ofhand-held metal detectors for the high school.    PROGRAM OVERVIEW--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2ATGM seeks to reduce gang membership by teaching students the harmfulconsequences of the gang lifestyle, how to not participate in it, andhow to choose positive alternatives.  The City Council, together withthe school district and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,recognized that recreation programs and law enforcement alone werenot enough to contain the growing gang problem in their community. The City of Paramount and the Paramount Unified School Districtdeveloped a partnership in 1982 and started ATGM.  The program basesits approach on the belief that interest in gangs begins at a youngage and, therefore, the focus is on reaching children early. The ATGM program includes three parts:  an elementary schoolcurriculum, an intermediate school follow-up program, andneighborhood meetings.  The elementary program includes a 2nd gradecurriculum, taught in 10 weekly 40-minute lessons and a 5th gradecurriculum, taught in 15 weekly 55-minute lessons.  The 7th gradefollow-up program consists of eight biweekly lessons.  These lessonsexpand on the topics introduced in the elementary school curriculum,such as peer pressure and drug abuse.  The program uses many guestspeakers and focuses on self-esteem, the consequences of a criminallifestyle, and higher education and career opportunities.  The ATGMprogram includes all students in the 2nd, 5th, and 7th grades. Program officials consider the neighborhood meetings a major emphasisof the ATGM program.  These efforts encourage parents to attendmeetings--held at schools, churches, parks, community centers andprivate residences--to educate them about gangs.  These meetings,which are bilingual (English/Spanish), also provide parents withinformation, encouragement, and help in preventing their childrenfrom joining gangs.  ATGM staff members hold an average of 50neighborhood meetings each year.  An important part of these meetingsis the individual outreach and follow-up meetings with students andtheir families.  ATGM staff members frequently meet one-on-one withat-risk students who have been referred to them by teachers.    PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND   EVALUATION EFFORTS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3City officials have conducted several evaluations of the ATGM programover the years, which mainly used pre- and post-test questionnairesof participants.  These studies showed that the ATGM program made adifference in keeping children out of gangs.  For example, while some5th grade students may have had neither positive nor negativefeelings toward gang membership before participating, after theirparticipation these same students tend to have a negative attitudetoward gangs.  According to ATGM staff members, ATGM made adifference in keeping students out of gangs.  During a 4-year period,officials gave several questionnaires to the original 1982-83 groupof 5th grade participants.  For example, in June 1984, officialstested the original 5th grade group when they were in intermediateschool.  Of the 170 6th graders who previously participated in theATGM program, 90 percent responded positively when asked if theprogram helped them to stay out of gangs. During the 1986-87 school year, ATGM officials tested a group of 9thgraders who were ATGM participants in the 5th grade.  Again, morethan 90 percent of these students said that they were staying out ofgangs.  In addition, in February 1993, program officials conducted adifferent type of evaluation.  Working with the Los Angeles CountySheriff's Department, city officials matched 3,612 names of ATGMparticipants with a listing of identified gang members.  This matchidentified 152 students, or 4 percent, as gang members, and 3,460participants, or 96 percent, who were not.    MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:4According to program officials, the key factors contributing to theprogram's success includepresenting information on the consequences of being in a gang in afactual, no-nonsense manner that allows students to come to their ownconclusions about whether joining a gang is a good choice;reaching out to children and their families through home visitationand parent meetings in the community;exposing children to the program early in their lives--in the 2nd,5th, and 7th grades;incorporating the program sessions as part of the regular schoolcurriculum and conducting lessons in both Spanish and English;using bilingual staff who are familiar with the community and aresensitive to Latino culture; andexposing children to positive role models and alternatives to thegang lifestyle.    IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:5When ATGM began about 13 years ago, the major barrier was the lack ofresearch, training, and materials about antigang programs, especiallyfor the Latino community.  Over the years, ATGM staff have developedtheir own curriculum, through trial and error, and borrowed fromother prevention programs.  Program officials cite the lack ofbilingual audiovisual materials for both children and parents as acontinuing problem. Program and school officials cited the District's high transiencyrate of 33 percent\17 as a major problem.  Children who recentlymoved to Paramount have not been exposed to the ATGM program.  A 1992survey of Paramount high school students revealed that over one-half(56 percent) did not attend elementary school in the district. Program officials speculated that many of transient students areunable to develop strong ties to the school and are more likely to beinvolved in gangs.  They believed that if area schools had similarantigang programs, the problem would lessen. --------------------\17 Average rate of children in the district who begin the schoolyear and leave before the school year ends.    FUNDING SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:6Since its inception, Paramount has funded the ATGM program entirelywith its general fund.  For the 1992-93 school year, the programbudget was $150,000, which funded three neighborhood counselors andsupplies.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY========================================================= Appendix VIITo accomplish our objectives and further our understanding of keyissues, we interviewed acknowledged experts and federal agencyofficials involved in violence-prevention programming and research. We also collaboratively sponsored a school safety symposium withHarvard University's School of Public Health, which brought togetherfederal officials, program directors, and violence-preventionresearchers to discuss efforts to curb school violence. Based on this information, we compiled a listing of more than 250violence-prevention programs.  From this listing, and afterconsidering the recommendations of violence-prevention experts, wejudgmentally selected four programs for site visits--two inCalifornia and one each in Ohio and New York. Anaheim, California:  SMART,Dayton, Ohio:  PACT,New York, New York:  RCCP, andParamount, California:  ATGM. We selected these programs because they operated primarily inschools, were located in different regions of the country, werelocated in areas with nationally recognized violence problems, andhad completed evaluations showing initial signs of success in curbingschool violence. We then visited seven schools associated with these four programs. At each school, we gathered program information, including keycharacteristics, success factors, implementation barriers, evaluationoutcomes, and funding sources.  In addition, we observed studentsparticipating in the programs and interviewed program officials. To obtain student and teacher views on efforts to curb schoolviolence, we conducted 16 discussion groups--7 with teachers and 9with students--at the seven schools.  The size of these groupsvaried.  Generally, the teacher groups consisted of 4 to 9participants, while the student groups ranged from 8 to 15participants.  In total, 103 students and 35 teachers participated. Our discussion group results are descriptive, showing the range ofopinions expressed by participants. To identify the key characteristics associated with promisingviolence-prevention programs we conducted a literature review.  Inaddition, we held discussions with school safety andviolence-prevention experts and determined the key factors forsuccess at the programs we visited. Finally, to identify federally sponsored evaluations ofviolence-prevention programs, we interviewed federal officials at theDepartments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice andreviewed the 1994 Juvenile Delinquency Development Statements:  AReport on Federal Programs.\18We conducted our review between January 1994 and February 1995 inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. --------------------\18 This report lists federal programs that support the goals of theJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.  These programsgenerally concern juvenile delinquency, prevention, treatment,diversion, education, training, and research, including alcohol anddrug programs and programs to improve the juvenile justice system.

HollingsRanking Minority MemberSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related AgenciesCommittee on AppropriationsUnited States SenateDear Senator Hollings: The Federal Defender Services program provides legal counsel foreligible federal criminal defendants who are unable to pay for theseservices themselves.  Between fiscal years 1990 and 1993, theprogram's costs more than doubled from about $122 million to almost$252 million.\1 During this same period, the number of DefenderServices representations closed rose 23 percent.  In federal districtcourts the number of criminal cases filed rose less than 1 percent,and the number of defendants grew about 3 percent.  At the same time,the costs to operate Death Penalty Resource Centers (DPRCs)--whoserepresentations in federal courts are funded by grants from theDefender Services program--almost tripled from about $6 million to$18 million, and the number of DPRC representations more than doubledfrom 491 to 1,014.\2 These centers were created in part to provide asource of expertise and help to reduce or contain the costs of deathpenalty representations.  You asked us to examine a number of aspectsof the Defender Services program, including the causes of theprogram's increased workload\3 and costs (as measured by programbudget obligations) and whether the DPRCs have reduced the federalcosts of representing indigent defendants in death penalty cases. As we informed your office early in our evaluation, theAdministrative Office of the U.S.  Courts (AOUSC) did not haveadequate data for us to evaluate the direct impact on programworkload and costs of factors that AOUSC had suggested as possiblecauses of increases.  Moreover, the lack of comparable data for bothbefore and after the establishment of the DPRCs, including data onthe impact of changes in the complexity of death penalty litigation,precluded meaningful assessment of whether the centers have reducedor contained the costs of representing indigent defendants in deathpenalty cases.  Therefore, as agreed, our objectives were to provideinformation on (1) the reasons that Defender Services workload hasgrown faster than district court criminal cases; (2) the dataavailable to assess the causes of increased Defender Servicesworkload and costs; (3) the comparative costs of representationsprovided by federal defender organizations and by private attorneysdirectly assigned by federal judges; (4) the additional costs ofpaying higher standard hourly rates to private, court-appointedattorneys in all or parts of 16 districts; (5) the comparative costsof federally funded private attorney and DPRC death penaltyrepresentations; and (6) the potential causes of increased DPRCworkload and costs. --------------------\1 All dollar figures in this report are expressed in currentdollars, unadjusted for inflation.  See app.  I. \2 The Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services hasrecently changed the name of the DPRCs to Post-Conviction DefenderOrganizations.  Throughout this report, we refer to them by theirformer designation, DPRCs. \3 Throughout this report, we measure program workload in terms ofrepresentations closed (see page 6 for more details).    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The Criminal Justice Act of 1964\4 required the federal judiciary toprovide for the legal representation of eligible federal criminaldefendants who were financially unable to afford their ownattorneys.\5 In response, the federal judiciary created the FederalDefender Services program.  In August 1993, AOUSC reported that about85 percent of all criminal cases prosecuted in federal courtsrequired court- appointed legal counsel.  The Defender ServicesCommittee of the Judicial Conference of the United States\6 providesoverall policy direction and guidance of the program, and theDefender Services Division of AOUSC provides administrative andprogram support. Legal services for eligible defendants in the nation's 94 federaldistrict courts and 12 circuit courts of appeals are provided througha mixed system, which at the end of fiscal year 1994 included 45Federal Public Defender Organizations (FPDs) serving 54 districts; 10Community Defender Organizations (CDOs) serving 11 districts; andprivate "panel" attorneys chosen from a list, or panel, maintained bythe district courts.  Together, FPDs and CDOs are generally referredto as Federal Defender Organizations (FDOs).  As shown in table 1,the number of FPDs and CDOs has gradually increased since 1990.  FPDattorneys are federal employees; CDO attorneys are not.  CDOs areprivate organizations funded by federal defender services grants. FPD and CDO attorneys are salaried; panel attorneys receive an hourlyrate for their services that varies by district.  Higher panelattorney hourly rates are generally paid for death penalty cases inall districts.  Panel attorneys generally provided all court-appointed representations in the 29 districts that had neither a FPDor CDO, and by statute panel attorneys must receive a "substantial"number of representation appointments in districts with suchorganizations.

Source:  AOUSC. To date, death penalty representations have generally been handled bypanel attorneys (including some pro bono representations)\7 or theDPRCs.  Occasionally, FDOs have also been appointed in such cases.\8At the end of fiscal year 1994 there were 20 DPRCs serving 50 federaljudicial districts.  The DPRCs are specialized CDOs that providelegal services--through direct representation and/or consultation andsupport services to panel attorneys--for persons appealing statedeath penalty convictions and/or sentences.  The DPRCs are alsoauthorized to represent defendants in federal capital prosecutionsand in appeals of federal death penalty convictions.  Under the grantagreement between each center and the Judicial Conference, use ofeach DPRC's federal funds is to be limited to federal death penaltyhabeas corpus\9 cases and the defense of those charged with capitalcrimes in federal district courts.  A DPRC's nonfederal funds must beused to support representations in state court proceedings. --------------------\4 Public Law 88-455 (1964), codified at 18 U.S.C.  3006A. \5 In addition to financial requirements, eligibility for court-appointed counsel is also dependent upon the offense with which thedefendant is charged.  For example, defendants charged with certainmisdemeanors are not provided court-appointed attorneys unless theU.S.  Magistrate or the court determines that the interests ofjustice require it. \6 The Judicial Conference is a group of federal judges, chaired bythe Chief Justice of the United States, who serve as the centralpolicymaking body for the federal court system. \7 In pro bono cases, attorneys represent defendants without cost asa public service. \8 In late 1994, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council approved a pilotplan to establish a death penalty unit in the FPD for the CentralDistrict of California to handle death penalty habeas corpus cases. The Council has sought Judicial Conference approval for this pilotproject. \9 Federal habeas corpus proceedings are civil proceedings in whichconvicted persons raise a challenge in federal court to theirconviction and/or sentence on the grounds that they are in custody inviolation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2Defender Services representations cannot be compared directly tocriminal case filings in district courts because Defender Services'workload also includes representations, such as appeals (reported inappellate court statistics) and habeas corpus proceedings (reportedin district court civil case statistics), that are not included indistrict court criminal caseload statistics.  Moreover, DefenderServices represents individual defendants, not cases, and duringfiscal years 1990 through 1993 there was an average of 1.4 defendantsper criminal case filed. AOUSC has maintained that overall program workload has grown andcosts have increased because (1) criminal cases, especially drugcases, now involve more defendants; (2) more defendants apply for andreceive court-appointed attorneys; (3) more defendants are beingtried in federal courts; and (4) the cases are more complex,principally because of changes in federal sentencing guidelines andmandatory minimum sentencing statutes,\10 resulting in more work forattorneys on each case. While each of these factors may have had some effect, we were notable to determine to what extent they individually or collectivelyaccounted for the doubling of the overall program costs or thetripling of DPRC costs from fiscal years 1990 through 1993.  This isbecause AOUSC collected little consistent, national empirical datathat could be used to make such determinations. The data available on the costs of representations by federaldefender organizations and panel attorneys were not preciselycomparable.  For example, FPD and CDO data included the costs oftraining provided to panel attorneys.  Also, FPD and CDO cost datawere not available by type of case (such as appeals) or majorcriminal offense category (such as drugs), but such data wereavailable for panel attorneys.  Nevertheless, prior studies by theJudicial Conference and AOUSC and our analysis of available datasuggested that, overall, FPD and CDO attorney representations costless than panel attorney representations, although the cost advantagehas gradually declined. However, the average cost per representation closed can vary amongdistricts, among FPDs and CDOs, and from year to year depending uponchanges in the proportion of expensive cases in the total workload. In fiscal year 1993, for example, each panel attorney drug or fraudrepresentation (at an average cost of more than $3,000) had as muchimpact on program costs as three immigration representations. The additional costs of paying higher standard hourly rates to panelattorneys in the 16 districts authorized to pay such rates has been arelatively small part of total panel attorney costs.  In 78 of the 94districts, panel attorneys are paid a standard hourly rate of $40 foreach out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court hour.\11 In 1986,Congress authorized higher rates of up to $75 per hour for bothin-court and out-of-court hours in specific circuits or districts, ifthe Judicial Conference determined it was justified.  As of March1995, the Judicial Conference had approved higher standard rates for89 districts.  However, the Judicial Conference, at congressionaldirection, has limited actual payment of the higher rates--$60, $70,or $75 for both in-court and out-of-court hours--to all or parts ofonly 16 districts.  We estimated (on the basis of available data)that the additional cost of paying these higher standard hourly ratesfrom fiscal years 1991 through 1993 was at least $33.5 million, about10.2 percent of total panel attorney obligations during the period. Our estimate excluded most appeals representations because the AOUSCdatabase did not designate the district of origin for at least 85percent of all appeals representations. Death penalty representations have been expensive relative to othertypes of Defender Services representations.  In 1993, the averageDPRC cost per representation\12 was about $17,200 and the averagepanel attorney cost per representation closed was about $37,000.\13The 246 panel attorney death penalty representations closed in fiscalyear 1993 were 0.6 percent of all panel attorney representationsclosed, but they accounted for 8.7 percent of the $104.3 million in1993 panel attorney payments approved by the courts.  Because ofmissing data, we could not compare costs in districts with andwithout DPRCs to determine if panel attorney death penaltyrepresentations were less expensive in districts with DPRCs, orwhether the cost per representation had grown less in districts withDPRCs. According to Defender Services officials, DPRC costs have increasedbecause more DPRCs have been created, more death penalty cases are inthe courts, and the cases are becoming more complex.  The number ofDPRCs increased from 14 in fiscal year 1989 to 20 in 1994.  Thenumber of DPRC death penalty cases also increased from 313 to 1,086,but data on case complexity were limited. AOUSC has embarked on a number of initiatives to address the datadeficiencies identified in this report and to improve the informationprovided to Congress for appropriations and oversight. --------------------\10 By statute, a minimum prison sentence must be imposed for certainoffenses when the statutorily specified criteria have been met. \11 This basic statutory rate has not increased since 1984. \12 DPRC costs per representation include the cost of all casesduring the year, including cases pending at the end of the year. \13 According to AOUSC, death penalty representations are more likelythan other types of representations to extend over 2 fiscal years ormore.  Thus, the total cost of death penalty representations may bemore than we report, since our cost is based on the total of allvouchers approved for payment in a single fiscal year.    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3To meet our objectives, we reviewed prior studies by the JudicialConference, AOUSC, and consultants.  We met with federal judges andAOUSC officials, members of AOUSC's Defender Services Advisory Group,defender services attorneys, and other officials in six judgmentallyselected judicial districts.  To try to identify potential causes ofworkload and cost increases and to compare FDO and panel attorneycosts per representation, we reviewed previous analyses and availableAOUSC data on FDO and panel attorney workload and costs. For FDOs, AOUSC provided data for fiscal years 1990 through the first6 months of 1994 on type of representation; type of disposition;representations opened, closed, and pending; and in-court hours perrepresentation closed.  For the same period, we analyzed the panelattorney voucher automated database, which included data by type ofrepresentation and criminal offense on (1) total in-court andout-of-court compensation requested and approved, and (2) thein-court and out-of-court hourly rates paid for representations inwhich the panel attorney had requested payment.  To providecomparable workload data for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys, we usedrepresentations closed because this was the only workload measureavailable for panel attorneys. Although we did not verify the accuracy of the data we received, wedid some edit checks and a distributional analysis of the data, whichraised questions about the accuracy of some of the data in the panelattorney database, including the hourly rates recorded in thedatabase.  We have qualified our conclusions to take this possibilityof error into account. We also used data from AOUSC's master criminal file database andother sources to determine total district court criminal workload andto try to assess the impact of such variables as the number of trialson Defender Services workload.  Our analysis of data on criminaltrials and cases with multiple defendants used data on total districtcourt workload because the database did not reliably identify thatsubset of cases in which defendants had court-appointed attorneys. This limitation is noted in our analysis and conclusions.  Certaininformation, including data on cases involving mandatory minimumsentences and federal prosecutions of state-developed cases, waseither unavailable or too incomplete for analysis.  Also, becausedata reported by FDOs and panel attorneys differed, workload and costcomparisons between the two were limited. To determine the additional costs of paying panel attorneys thehigher standard hourly rates, we used AOUSC's database to calculatethe difference in compensation at the higher and lower standardhourly rates.  We calculated the in-court and out-of-courtcompensation approved for those representations in the 16 districtscompensated at the higher standard hourly rates.  We then estimatedthe in-court and out-of-court compensation that would have beenrequested at the lower standard hourly rates of $40 out-of-court and$60 in-court.  We subtracted the lower rate estimate from the actualamounts approved for payment at the higher standard rates.  Thedifference was the estimated additional costs of paying the higherstandard rates.  As explained in more detail in appendix I, thisproduced a conservative estimate of the additional costs of payingthe higher standard hourly rates in the 16 districts. We used DPRC quarterly reports for fiscal years 1990 through thefirst half of 1994 to examine trends in DPRC workload and costs. However, due to data limitations we could not fully assess whetherDPRCs had lowered the costs of death penalty representations. The Defender Services program has been reviewed by various sources,and where appropriate we have incorporated the results of thesestudies into our work.  To determine what actions the Judiciary hasunderway to improve Defender Services program data and analyses andto control costs, we obtained copies of AOUSC and Judicial Conferencereports, directives, and other documents addressing these issues, andwe talked to AOUSC officials. We did our work primarily in Washington, D.C.; New York; and Detroit,between April 1993 and February 1995 in accordance with generallyaccepted government auditing standards.  Our objectives, scope, andmethodology are discussed in greater detail in appendix I.  AOUSCprovided written comments on a draft of this report, which arediscussed on pages 28-29 and printed in full in appendix III.    DEFENDER SERVICES   REPRESENTATIONS ARE NOT   SYNONYMOUS WITH DISTRICT COURT   CRIMINAL FILINGS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Data on Defender Services representations are not fully comparable todistrict court criminal filings or terminations (case closings).  Infiscal year 1993, 46,786 criminal cases involving 65,653 defendantswere filed in federal district courts.\14 In the same year, districtcourts closed (disposed) 44,800 cases involving 64,048 defendants. Since Defender Services represents defendants, not cases, thedistrict court defendant data are more appropriate than case data incomparing district court and Defender Services workloads. Defender Services attorneys closed 78,016 representations in fiscalyear 1993, which was 13,968 more than the number of defendantsreported as disposed in district courts.  Of this additional DefenderServices workload, at least 9,478 representations (about 68 percent)were not reported in district court criminal workload statistics. The Defender Services 1993 workload, for example, included 6,126appeals, reported in appellate court statistics; 1,028 habeas corpusproceedings, reported in district court civil statistics; and 2,324bail proceedings, which Defender Services reported as a separateworkload category, but district courts did not. Criminal representations appeared to be the category of DefenderServices representations most comparable to district court criminalworkload.  In fiscal year 1993, Defender Services closed 54,907criminal representations, or 9,141 less than the 64,048 criminaldefendants disposed in federal district courts in 1993.  The 9,141additional defendants reported in district court statistics may havepaid for their own attorneys rather than having court-appointedattorneys.  However, we found no consistent data on the number ofdefendants in federal courts who received court-appointed attorneys. --------------------\14 Totals include traffic cases and defendants as well as transfersbetween districts.  Traffic cases in federal courts arise fromtraffic violations on federal property.    TOTAL DEFENDER SERVICES   REPRESENTATIONS CLOSED, TOTAL   BUDGET OBLIGATIONS, AND COSTS   PER REPRESENTATION CLOSED HAVE   GROWN------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Defender Services appropriations, obligations, representationsclosed, and costs per representation closed have generally grown inrecent years.  As shown in table 2, from fiscal years 1990 through1994, total budget obligations grew about 118 percent from $122.5million to $266.7 million.\15 According to AOUSC, the growth inrepresentations closed and obligations was less in fiscal year 1994than in recent years, but it was not clear at the time whether thiswas the beginning of a long-term trend or a short-term phenomenon. The Judiciary initially requested $387 million for fiscal year 1994,which included $14 million to extend the standard higher panelattorney rates beyond the 16 districts in which they were being paid. Congress rejected this expansion and appropriated $280 million forfiscal year 1994.  Defender Services requested $290.3 million forfiscal year 1995, an increase of 3.7 percent.  Congress appropriated$250 million for fiscal year 1995.\16 The Judiciary has requested$295.8 million for fiscal year 1996--an increase of 18 percent overthe 1995 appropriation and 1.9 percent more than the 1995 budgetrequest.

OVERALL CHANGE IN NUMBER OF      REPRESENTATIONS CLOSED AND      COSTS FOR PANEL ATTORNEYS      AND DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS      VARIED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1As shown in figure 1, from fiscal years 1990 to 1993 growth in thenumber of representations closed, total obligations, and the averagecost per representation closed\17 for panel attorneys, FPDs, and CDOsvaried.  To provide comparable data for defender organizations andpanel attorneys, our workload figures are based on representationsclosed, because data for ongoing representations were not availablefor panel attorneys (see app.  I).  While panel attorney workloadgrew more than that of FPDs or CDOs, panel attorney costs perrepresentation closed grew less than FPDs or CDOs.  Compensationapproved for panel attorney fees grew about 88 percent, while totalpanel attorney budget obligations--a figure an AOUSC official told usincluded payments for investigators and experts in addition toattorney fees--grew about 96 percent during the period.    Figure 1:  Percent Change in   Total Representations Closed,   Budget Obligations, and Average   Cost per Representation Closed   for FPDs, CDOs, and Panel   Attorneys, Fiscal Years   1990-1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Growth in panel attorney budget obligations excluding deathpenalty representations was based on total panel attorney obligationsless attorney fees in death penalty representations.  We did not havedata on nonattorney fee costs, such as transcripts and investigators,in death penalty representations. Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. --------------------\17 Cost per representation closed for FPDs and CDOs was determinedby dividing total budget obligations for these organizations in eachfiscal year by the total number of representations closed.  Cost perrepresentation closed for panel attorneys was determined by dividingthe total amount of attorney compensation approved for payment ineach fiscal year by the number of representations closed.    REPRESENTATIONS CLOSED FOR   FPDS, CDOS, AND PANEL ATTORNEYS   INCREASED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6Defender Services representations closed annually increased by about23 percent from 63,504 to 78,016 between fiscal years 1990 and 1993. Of this total, panel attorney representations closed increased about33 percent from 28,575 to 38,005, or about twice as fast as FDOs'workload, which increased from 34,929 to 40,011, about 15 percent. Within this FDO total, FPD representations closed grew 28 percent andCDO representations closed declined 12 percent.  Most of the CDOdecline was due to a drop in immigration representations closed atthe CDO in the Southern District of California.  Excluding thisdistrict's workload, CDO representations closed declined about 5.5percent.  Although still a very small percentage of total panelattorney workload (less than 1 percent), panel attorney death penaltyrepresentations closed grew from 9 to 246.  (More detail is found inthe tables in app.  II.)As shown in figure 2, from fiscal years 1990 through 1993 criminalrepresentations closed were by far the largest proportion of totalrepresentations closed for both FDOs and panel attorneys, followed by"other" and appeals.  The number of FDO and panel attorney criminalrepresentations was about even in fiscal year 1990, but FDO criminalrepresentations increased 8 percent during the period while panelattorney criminal representations increased almost 23 percent. Consequently, by 1993 panel attorney criminal representations closedexceeded those of FDOs by 3,567.  The growth in panel attorneyappeals representations closed (118 percent) was also greater thanthat for FDOs (54 percent).  From fiscal years 1991 through 1993,panel attorneys closed at least 75 percent more appealsrepresentations each year than did FDOs.  On the other hand, thenumber of FDO "other" representations closed was more than twice thatof panel attorneys each year for 1990 through 1993, reflecting themuch higher number of bail and probation/parole revocationproceedings handled by FPDs and CDOs.    Figure 2:  Representations   Closed by Federal Defender   Organizations (FDOs) and Panel   Attorneys, Fiscal Years   1990-1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note 1:  Panel attorney data exclude death penalty representations. Numbers for this figure are shown in appendix II, table II.1. Note 2:  "Other" includes habeas corpus and bail proceedings, motionsto reduce sentence, and probation and parole revocation proceedings. Source:  AOUSC. We disaggregated criminal representations closed into five majoroffense categories--weapons, immigration, drugs, fraud, and other--toexamine changes in representations closed by type of offense and typeof Defender Services attorneys.  As shown in figure 3, within eachmajor offense category, FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys had differentgrowth rates.  For some offenses there were fewer representationsclosed in 1993 than in 1990.  However, we could not determine thereasons for the variations shown in figure 3.    Figure 3:  Percent Change in   Criminal Representations Closed   by Type of Defender Services   Attorney and Major Offense   Category, Fiscal Years   1990-1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  FPD fraud representations closed increased by less thanone-half of 1 percent. Source:  AOUSC.    DETERMINING THE CAUSES OF   DEFENDER SERVICES COST GROWTH   IS DIFFICULT------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7Changes in Defender Services costs are basically the result of twofactors--changes in the number of representations combined withchanges in the average cost of each representation.  If the number ofrepresentations increases, program costs will also increase even ifthe average cost per representation remains unchanged.  Conversely,costs will rise if the cost per representation increases, even thoughthe number of representations remains unchanged.       ESTIMATED IMPACT OF      INCREASED REPRESENTATIONS      CLOSED ON PROGRAM COSTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1To determine the impact of increased workload from fiscal years 1990through 1993--as measured by representations closed--on fiscal year1993 FPD, CDO, and panel attorney costs,\18 we estimated what fiscalyear 1993 costs would have been if the average cost perrepresentation closed in 1993 were the same as the 1990 average cost(unadjusted for inflation).\19 As shown in figure 4, about 26 percentof the increase in FPD costs and 38 percent of the increase in panelattorney costs between fiscal years 1990 and 1993 could be attributedto the increase in representations closed in 1993.  However, CDOrepresentations closed declined from 11,706 in 1990 to 10,299 in1993; consequently, none of the increase in CDO costs could beattributed to increased representations closed.\20   Figure 4:  Estimated Percent of   the Total Increase in FPD, CDO,   and Panel Attorney Costs   Between Fiscal Years 1990 and   1993 Resulting From Increased   Representations Closed or From   Other Factors   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Workload was measured by representations closed. Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. However, as the panel attorney data in figures 5 and 6 indicate,these overall estimates can mask considerable variation by type ofrepresentation.\21 For some types of panel attorney representationsclosed--appeals, other, death penalty--from about 69 to 92 percent ofthe increase in costs could be attributed to increased numbers ofrepresentations closed (fig.  5).  Within criminal representations,increased representations closed accounted for more than half of theincrease in the costs of weapons, drugs, and fraud representationsclosed, but they accounted for only about 13 percent of the increasein the costs of immigration representations closed (see fig.  6). Other criminal representations closed declined 7 percent betweenfiscal years 1990 and 1993.  Thus, all of the increase in costs forthese representations must have been the result of factors that haveincreased the average cost per representation closed.  As discussedlater in this report, Defender Services officials and AOUSC havesuggested a number of factors, such as the sentencing guidelines anda higher number of defendants charged with mandatory minimumoffenses, that could have contributed to higher average costs perrepresentation closed.    Figure 5:  Estimated Percent of   the Total Increase in Panel   Attorney Costs Between Fiscal   Years 1990 and 1993 Resulting   From Increased Representations   Closed or from Other Factors   (by Type of Representation)   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Workload was measured by representations closed. Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data.    Figure 6:  Estimated Percent of   the Total Increase in Costs of   Panel Attorney Criminal   Representations Closed Between   Fiscal Years 1990 and 1993   Resulting From Increased   Representations Closed or From   Other Factors (by Major Offense   Category)   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Workload was measured by representations closed. Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. --------------------\18 Costs for FPDs and CDOs are based on total obligations eachfiscal year divided by the number of representations closed.  Becausewe could not separately identify those costs associated with FPD andCDO representations closed, our average cost per representationclosed included the cost of all representations during the fiscalyear--new, closed, and pending at the end of the fiscal year--as wellas the costs of training provided for panel attorneys.  Panelattorney cost data reflect only the costs of attorney fees for thoserepresentations for which panel attorneys have requested payment. Panel attorney costs exclude such costs as transcripts,psychiatrists, or investigators--costs that are included in FPD andCDO budgets, and, thus, FPD and CDO cost per representation.  (Seeapp I.)\19 For reasons described more fully in appendix I, our 1993estimates are based on 1990 costs per representation, unadjusted forinflation.  The result may somewhat underestimate the impact ofincreased representations closed on program costs, especially forFPDs and CDOs. \20 The percentage of increased costs attributed to factors otherthan increased representations closed is the difference between 100percent and the percent of increased costs attributed to increasedrepresentations closed.  For panel attorneys, for example, we assumedabout 62 percent (100 percent minus 38 percent) of total increasedcosts were the result of factors other than increased representationsclosed. \21 Data limitations precluded a similar analysis for FPDs and CDOs.       COST PER REPRESENTATION      CLOSED HAS GROWN FOR ALL      TYPES OF DEFENDER SERVICES      ATTORNEYS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.2For each fiscal year 1990 through 1993, panel attorney costs perrepresentation closed were the highest and CDO costs the lowest.\22(See fig.  7.) Costs per representation closed for all three types ofDefender Services attorneys increased each year.  Although CDOs stillhad the lowest cost per representation in 1993), the 134-percentgrowth in CDO costs per representation had narrowed the gap betweenCDOs and the other two types of attorneys.  In 1990, the FPD cost perrepresentation closed was about $300 lower than that of panelattorneys.  By 1993, the cost advantage had narrowed to about $100per representation closed.  However, if the average panel attorneycost per representation is calculated excluding death penaltyrepresentations, FPD average cost per representation closed in fiscalyear 1993 was about $130 more than the panel attorney average. Including death penalty representations in calculating the overallpanel attorney average cost per representation added about $10 perrepresentation closed in fiscal year 1990 and about $223 in fiscalyear 1993.    Figure 7:  Average Cost per   Representation Closed for FPDs,   CDOs, and Panel Attorneys,   Fiscal Years 1990 Through 1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Actual costs for this figure are shown in appendix II, tableII.6. Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. One possible reason for the generally higher panel attorney cost perrepresentation closed may be the higher average number of panelattorney in-court hours per representation closed (see fig.  8).  Wecould not determine why panel attorneys apparently expended morein-court hours per representation closed than did FPDs and CDOs. However, these additional in-court hours can affect program costs. In 78 of the 94 districts the hourly rate for in-court hours is $20more than the rate for out-of-court hours.    Figure 8:  Average Number of   In-Court Hours per   Representation Closed for FPDs,   CDOs, and Panel Attorneys,   Fiscal Years 1990-1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Panel attorney data exclude death penalty representations. Source:  AOUSC. --------------------\22 Based on aggregate data for all CDOs.  CDO costs perrepresentation closed are higher when the workload and costs of theSan Diego CDO are excluded from the analysis.  All CDO cost andrepresentation data in this section include San Diego.       LIMITED DATA WERE AVAILABLE      TO VERIFY THE POTENTIAL      CAUSES OF INCREASED COSTS      PER REPRESENTATION CLOSED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3Overall, between fiscal years 1990 and 1993, we estimated thatfactors other than increased representations closed accounted forabout 74 percent of FPD cost growth, 62 percent of panel attorneygrowth, and 100 percent of CDO cost growth.  Defender Servicesofficials and Judicial Conference and AOUSC studies offered a numberof reasons why the cost per representation closed had steadilyincreased for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys.  These reasonsincluded implementation of the federal sentencing guidelines, whichrequire additional attorney time; changing prosecutorial prioritiesthat increased the number of complex drug and multiple defendantcases prosecuted in federal court, which were more likely to resultin trials for one or more defendants; and greater numbers of offensescarrying mandatory minimum sentences, which were more likely toresult in trials. These arguments were supported by some anecdotal evidence and suchaggregate empirical data as total district court criminal caseloadstatistics showing a rising number of criminal trials and multipledefendant cases.  However, it was difficult to document that thereasons cited were in fact the major contributing factors to risingworkload and/or costs.  This was largely due to the absence ofconsistent, reliable data on such potential causes of rising programcosts as the number of Defender Services cases involving multipledefendants or defendants charged with mandatory minimum offenses; thepercentage of such cases that go to trial; or the number of casesinvestigated and developed by state agencies and handed off tofederal prosecutors because federal law and the sentencing guidelinesprovided longer sentences.  A more detailed analysis of the datasources available to measure the impact of these factors is includedin appendix I. As discussed in the following sections, there is some evidence thatcertain of these factors may have affected program costs.          IMPACT OF SENTENCING         GUIDELINES-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3.1Recent Defender Services budget submissions have noted that thefederal sentencing guidelines, which became effective November 1,1987,\23 "have profoundly altered the nature of the sentencingprocess and dramatically increased federal and panel attorneyworkloads." Contributing to the impact on both attorney workload andprogram costs has been the need to consider the accuracy of all factsin the judicial proceedings that could affect the potential sentenceunder the guidelines; the many guidelines amendments (434 betweenNovember 1987 and November 1991, for example); the increasingcomplexity of the guidelines; more defendants choosing to go to trialunder the guidelines; and the increased number of sentencing appeals. Our August 1992 sentencing guidelines report\24 concluded thatalthough empirical data and reliable work measurements did not exist,available statistics and our interviews suggested that the guidelineshad apparently increased criminal justice workload.  Though DefenderServices estimated that the sentencing guidelines implementation hadincreased the time required to provide representation by about 25 to50 percent in most cases, AOUSC officials could not provide data tosubstantiate this observation. In addition, subsequent to the sentencing guidelines implementation,there has been a rise in criminal appeals.  The authorizinglegislation for the sentencing guidelines, the Sentencing Reform Actof 1984, provided for appeals of sentences imposed by U.S.  DistrictCourts.  For example, the act provided that a defendant or thefederal government may appeal a sentence on the basis that thesentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of theguidelines.  Generally, appeals of sentences were not common prior tothe Sentencing Reform Act's appellate review provisions.  There were2,534 such sentencing appeals in fiscal year 1992, or almost 23percent of all criminal appeals.  Defender Services appealsrepresentations closed more than doubled from about 3,300 in 1987 toover 6,700 in 1993, but we could not determine how much of thisincrease was attributable to appeals of sentence only. The increase in the number of appeals and cost per appealsrepresentation closed has affected program costs.  From fiscal years1990 through 1993, the cost per panel attorney appeals representationclosed rose 24 percent from $2,567 to $3,187,\25 while the number ofsuch appeals rose 118 percent from 1,825 to 3,977.  During theperiod, the cost per panel attorney appeals representation closed wasat least 20 percent more than criminal representations closed andmore than twice as much as "other" representations closed. --------------------\23 The guidelines apply to all federal criminal offenses committedon or after November 1, 1987.  However, the guidelines were notimplemented nationally until after January 1989, when a U.S.  SupremeCourt decision upheld their constitutionality.  Mistretta v.  UnitedStates, 488 U.S.  361 (1989). \24 Sentencing Guidelines:  Central Questions Remain Unanswered(GAO/GGD 92-93, Aug.  14, 1992). \25 Data to calculate the cost of FPD or CDO appeals representationsclosed were not available.          NUMBER AND LENGTH OF         TRIALS CAN AFFECT COSTS-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3.2The number and length of criminal trials can also affect programcosts.  The fiscal year 1994 Defender Services congressional budgetsubmission noted that the number of trials had increased,particularly for defendants in multiple defendant cases or thosecharged with offenses requiring a mandatory minimum prison term uponconviction.  Although specific data on trials involving defendantsrepresented by Defender Service attorneys were not available, we didreview general AOUSC statistical data on overall trial trends.\26The number of criminal jury trials increased more than total criminaltrials (9.5 percent versus 2.9 percent) between statistical years1990 and 1993.  Jury trials with 4 or more defendants increased about15 percent (from 425 to 488) during the same period, though theytended to be a small and stable percentage (between 8.4 and 8.8percent) of total jury trials.  Longer criminal jury trials, thoserequiring 6 to 10 or 11 to 20 days, increased 22.9 and 17.3 percent,respectively, between 1990 and 1993.\27 But such trials have remainedfairly constant as a percent of criminal jury trials.  The number oftrials lasting 20 days or more has fluctuated by both district andcriminal offense. The in-court hours recorded by FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys can beone rough measure of trial time for Defender Services attorneys. While average in-court time from fiscal years 1990 through 1993 hasgenerally increased for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys, no clearpattern emerged.  For example, while average number of in-court hoursfor FPDs and CDOs in drug offense representations closed generallyincreased, it generally declined for panel attorneys.  In averagehours per representation closed, the largest increase for panelattorneys was for fraud offenses (from an average of 7 to 11 hours);the largest for FPDs was fraud offenses (3.2 to 4.6); and the largestfor CDOs was for "other" offenses (2.1 to 4.3).  Panel attorneysconsistently reported more in-court hours for all types ofrepresentations than did FPDs or CDOs, but we could not determine whythis was so. Fiscal year 1993 data from the CDO for the Southern District ofCalifornia in San Diego provided some indication that representationsfor defendants who had been charged with an offense carrying amandatory minimum prison term were more likely to be disposed of bytrial than other criminal representations.  However, the CDO'sattorneys spent about the same amount of in-court and out-of-courttime on trials that did and did not involve defendants charged withmandatory minimum offenses.  The San Diego data indicated thatattorneys spent more time negotiating guilty pleas in multipledefendant drug cases that involved mandatory minimums than inmultiple defendant drug cases that did not. --------------------\26 AOUSC provided trial data by statistical year (July 1 to June30).  AOUSC's trial database defines a trial as any contestedproceeding before a judge at which evidence is introduced. \27 Trials lasting 6 to 10 days rose from 607 to 746.  Trials lasting11 to 20 days rose from 214 to 251.          PROSECUTORIAL ACTIVITIES         AND OTHER FACTORS-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3.3The Judiciary also has stated that workload and costs of DefenderService attorneys in federal criminal cases have increased as aresult of Justice Department prosecutorial initiatives, such as theorganized crime and drug enforcement task forces.  Although specificdata were not available, the Judiciary pointed out that theseinvestigations often lead to cases that can be rather complex andexpensive to prosecute and defend. Operation Weed and Seed is a multiple agency approach to combattingviolent crime, drugs, and gangs in high-crime areas.  ProjectTriggerlock targets dangerous, repeat offenders for prosecution infederal court as opposed to state court to take advantage of federalmandatory minimum penalties for firearms offenses.  According to theJudiciary, both initiatives have increased the complexity of casesand the subsequent costs of Defender Services attorneys.  However,the courts do not maintain detailed data on the number of criminalcases resulting from these initiatives.  Our analysis showed thatfrom fiscal years 1990 through 1993, the number of weaponsrepresentations closed\28 by Defender Services attorneys increased by75 percent to 3,279.  Data were not available to determine how manyof these resulted from Operation Triggerlock investigations and/orcarried mandatory minimum sentences. Various sources have also cited the growing number of multipledefendant cases as a major contributor to increased program costs. Multiple defendant cases can be more complex and time-consuming thanother cases, particularly when they involve sophisticated drugtrafficking organizations.  Conflict of interest concerns have ledFPDs and CDOs generally to represent only one defendant in multipledefendant cases.  The remaining defendants are generally representedby panel attorneys, whom our analysis and that of AOUSC showed were,overall, more costly per representation closed than FPD and CDOlawyers. Statistics were not available on the number of representations byDefender Services attorneys in multiple defendant cases.  However,AOUSC does maintain national data on multiple defendant cases.  Thesedata showed that the number of multiple defendant cases increased byabout 9 percent between statistical years 1990 and 1993 to about8,100.  However, as a percent of all criminal cases, multipledefendant cases remained fairly constant (between about 19 and 20percent).  The total number of multiple defendant drug cases alsoincreased; cases involving two to five defendants accounted for mostof the increase.  In 1992 almost 4,000 cases, or 36 percent of alldrug cases, involved multiple defendants.  However, there were noreliable data available showing multiple defendant drug cases by typeof counsel. The number of Defender Services representations closed for drugoffenses increased by 39 percent from 15,271 to 21,270 between fiscalyears 1990 and 1993.  Drug representations closed were 43 percent ofall panel attorney criminal representations closed during the periodand, excluding death penalty representations closed, generally werethe most costly, rising about 18 percent to an average of $3,152 infiscal year 1993.\29 Similar cost data were not available for FDOs. --------------------\28 This is a representation in which the defendant is charged with afederal firearms violation, such as the use or possession of afirearm during commission of a felony. \29 By 1993 the average cost of fraud representations was $3,394,more than that for drug representations.  However, fraudrepresentations were less than 10 percent of all panel attorneycriminal representations in 1993 and, thus, had a much smaller impacton program costs than drug representations.    THE COSTS OF PAYING HIGHER   HOURLY RATES IN 16 DISTRICTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8The current standard panel attorney rates of $40 for eachout-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court hour were set in 1984. On the basis of its assessment of such factors as attorneycompensation and expenses, the Judicial Conference has approvedhigher rates in 89 districts (as of March 1995).  However, atcongressional direction, the Judicial Conference has limited theactual payment of higher standard rates--a single rate of $60, $70,or $75 per hour for both in-court and out-of-court hours--to all orparts of the 16 districts for which the higher standard rates wereapproved in January 1990. Had the Judiciary paid the full amount panel attorneys requested inthese 16 districts during fiscal years 1991 through 1993, theadditional costs of paying the higher rates would have been about$40.4 million, about 12 percent of total panel attorney obligationsduring the period.  However, with some regularity judges approvedless than the total compensation requested.  Based on the amountsjudges approved for payment, a more accurate measure, the additionalcosts were about $33.5 million, or about 10.2 percent of total panelattorney obligations during the period. Because they exclude virtually all appeals representations, theseestimates probably underestimate the additional costs.  Appeals wereexcluded because virtually all appeals representations in thedatabase--at least 98 percent in each year for 1990 through 1993 and85 percent in the first 6 months of 1994--were identified only by theappeals circuit and, thus, could not be associated with a specificdistrict (see app.  I).  Because the jurisdictions of 11 of the 12circuit courts of appeals cover several states and a number ofdistricts, we could not use the circuit identifier for our analysisin 11 of the 12 circuits.    DATA LIMITATIONS PRECLUDED FULL   ASSESSMENT OF INCREASE IN DPRC   WORKLOAD AND COSTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9DPRCs were created in part to help reduce or contain the cost ofdeath penalty representations.  Budget requests and appropriationsfor the centers have increased sharply since the establishment of thefirst one in 1988.  From fiscal years 1989 to 1994 the number ofcenters increased from 14 to 20, and the amounts appropriated for thecenters more than tripled, from $5,890,000 to $19,800,000.\30 Duringthe period, the overall cost per case increased from $9,521 to$17,247, up about 81 percent (in current dollars).

Source:  Judiciary's fiscal year 1996 Congressional BudgetJustifications for Defender Services (DPRC data) and other AOUSC data(panel attorneys). AOUSC offered three major reasons for the increases in total costsand costs per representation:  more operational centers, increasedcaseload, and increased complexity of death penalty litigation. While the number of death penalty cases in federal courts hasincreased, the lack of a reliable death penalty identifier in thedatabase precluded an accurate measure of the increase.  Almost alldeath penalty cases in federal courts arise from state death penaltyconvictions.  Between the end of calendar years 1989 and 1993, thetotal number of persons sentenced to death, including those convictedand sentenced in state courts, rose from 2,186 to 2,785.  As of March1995, only 6 persons had been convicted and sentenced to death infederal courts. AOUSC asserted that the services provided by the centers actuallylower federal death penalty litigation costs by  encouraging competent private attorneys to immediately accept death     penalty cases;  providing consultation, investigative, and other services to     private attorneys; and  using expert, salaried center attorneys to directly represent     defendants/prisoners. Due to data limitations, we could not fully assess the validity ofthese assertions.  Comparable empirical data on case complexity andreliable baseline data concerning death penalty litigation costsprior to implementation of the resource centers were not available,and much of the available cost information was anecdotal.  Ouranalysis of aggregate data from quarterly reports was limited because(1) comparable reports were available only for fiscal years 1991,1992, and 1993; (2) the 1992 and 1993 reports included centers notoperational in 1991; and (3) complete data were not available fromall operational centers.  These data limitations in turn precluded afull assessment of the costs of death penalty litigation. The absence of a reliable district identifier in panel attorney deathpenalty representations precluded a cost comparison of suchrepresentations in districts with and without DPRCs to determine ifthe costs were less in districts with DPRCs. --------------------\30 The fiscal year 1994 appropriation was $265,000 less than the1993 appropriation of $20,065,000.  The fiscal year 1994 request was$30,559,000.    EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PROGRAM DATA   AND OPERATIONS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10In its fiscal year 1995 congressional budget submission, theJudiciary acknowledged that it did not have sufficient data oranalyses to explain the causes of increased panel attorney costs andannounced steps to improve Defender Services program operations,enhance data collection and analysis, and reduce costs.  According toAOUSC officials, many of these initiatives were undertaken inresponse to congressional concerns and/or our inquiries.  Severalwere recommended by the Economy Subcommittee of the JudicialConference's Budget Committee or the Defender Services Committee. Among the initiatives are (1) the creation of a nine-person programanalysis office within the Defender Services Division of AOUSC; (2)efforts to develop Defender Services case weights and FDO workmeasurement formulas and improve available analytical data byrequiring additional financial and statistical data, including FDOreporting of out-of-court time; (3) implementation of new "deathpenalty" panel attorney vouchers to aid improved cost analysis; (4)continuation of a study to assess the impact of the federalsentencing guidelines on program costs; and (5) improved audits ofFPDs, CDOs, and DPRCs.  The Judiciary also announced steps to controlFDO costs, such as limitations on space alterations, salaryincreases, and travel. The Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender Services hasestablished a Death Penalty Representation subcommittee (generallyknown as the Cox Committee, after its Chair, Judge Emmett R.  Cox) toreevaluate the DPRC concept and report on proposals for containingdeath penalty litigation costs.  The subcommittee is reviewingavailable data, soliciting the views of various sources, and planningto complete its work during the summer of 1995. AOUSC's Office of Audit continues to play a role in evaluatingvarious aspects of the program.  The Office, either directly orthrough its contractor accounting firm, conducts periodic financialaudits of court operations, which include reviews of FPD activitiesand panel attorney payments.  The Office's audit staff has identifiedsome FPD office deficiencies regarding payroll, time and attendance,and disbursements, as well as problems in some DPRCs' reporting ontime spent on federal representations.  At its January 1995 meeting,the Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender Services directedAOUSC to contract centrally for audits of CDOs and DPRCs. AOUSC's comments on a draft of this report mentioned some additionalinitiatives (see app.  III).    AGENCY COMMENTS----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11AOUSC's written comments incorporated the views of the Chair of theJudicial Conference's Committee on Defender Services.  AOUSC saidthat the findings and issues identified in our report would assistthe Judiciary in its ongoing efforts to increase the type, quality,and consistency of data being collected on the activities of FDOs,DPRCs, and panel attorneys.  AOUSC identified a number of specificefforts, planned and underway, to improve data collection andanalysis and contain Defender Services costs.  A number of theseefforts were initiated in response to our work.  On the basis of ourreview of the information provided by AOUSC, we agree that successfulcompletion of AOUSC's efforts--both those mentioned in its letter andthose discussed in our report-- would help to rectify the issuesidentified in our report.  The full text of AOUSC's comments are inappendix III. --------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11.1We are sending copies of this report to the Subcommittees onCommerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies ofthe House and Senate Appropriations Committees; the Chairmen andRanking Minority Members of the House and Senate Committees on theJudiciary; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the HouseJudiciary Subcommittee on the Judiciary and Intellectual Property;the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate JudiciarySubcommittee on the Courts and Administrative Practice; the Directorof the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts; the Chairman of theJudicial Conference of the United States' Committee on DefenderServices; and other interested parties.  We will also make copiesavailable to others upon request. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV.  If youhave any questions about the contents of this report, please call meon (202) 512-8777. Sincerely yours,Norman J.  RabkinDirector, Administration of Justice IssuesOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix IThe former Chairman, and now Ranking Minority Member, of theSubcommittee on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, theJudiciary, and Related Agencies, Senate Committee on Appropriations,requested that we examine a number of issues regarding the FederalDefender Services program and the causes of the rapid growth in bothprogram workload and costs.  Specifically, we were asked to assess,for fiscal years 1990 to 1993 and the first half of 1994:   the causes of the growth in overall Defender Services workload and     costs, including the reasons that Defender Services workload has     grown faster than district court criminal cases;  the comparative costs of representations closed provided by FDOs     and panel attorneys and, if the FDO costs were lower, what     actions the federal judiciary was taking to increase the use of     FDOs;  the additional costs of paying standard higher hourly rates to     panel attorneys in all or parts of 16 districts; and  the causes of the increased workload and costs of the DPRCs,     including whether the DPRCs had helped to reduce or contain the     costs of panel attorney death penalty representations. However, because of the data limitations described below, and asagreed with the requestor, we changed our objectives to provideinformation on (1) reasons that Defender Services workload has grownfaster than district court criminal cases; (2) data available toassess the causes of increased Defender Services workload and costs;(3) comparative costs of representations closed by federal defenderorganizations and by private attorneys directly assigned by federaljudges; (4) additional costs of paying higher standard hourly ratesto private, court-appointed attorneys in all or parts of 16districts; (5) the comparative costs of panel attorney and DPRC deathpenalty representations; and (6) the potential causes of increasedDPRC workload and costs. To meet these objectives, we reviewed prior studies of the FederalDefender Services program, including those of the Committee to Reviewthe Criminal Justice Act (commonly referred to as the PradoCommittee), the Judicial Conference of the United States, theDefender Services Division, and the Financial Analysis Office of theAdministrative Office of the U.S.  Courts (AOUSC).  We also revieweda number of private studies of death penalty litigation, includingstudies of DPRCs by the Spangenberg Group, a consulting firm. We met with federal court officials, including the Chairman of theExecutive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States,the Chair of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services,the Defender Services Advisory Committee, and the Chief Judge of theSecond Circuit court of appeals.  We also met with judges, federaland community defenders, and other officials in the Eastern andSouthern Districts of New York, Eastern District of Michigan,District of New Jersey, District of Delaware, and Southern Districtof California.  These districts were judgmentally selected.  Delawarewas chosen because it was served by the FPD for New Jersey.  Thedistricts of Southern and Eastern New York, Eastern Michigan, and NewJersey had large criminal caseloads and were near our regional officestaff.  We chose the Southern District of California because DefenderServices officials told us this district had developed a method oftracking attorney hours that captured many of the elements, such asrepresentations for defendants charged with offenses carrying amandatory minimum sentence, not captured by the national data systemsused in our analysis.  We also met with AOUSC officials in the Officeof Audit, Defender Services Division, Office of Finance and Budget,and Statistics Division to discuss a number of issues, includingstudies they had or were conducting on Defender Services workload andcosts. DATA AVAILABLE ON DEFENDERSERVICES WORKLOAD AND COSTSWe identified the workload and cost data available from AOUSC.  FPDand CDO workload data are reported semiannually by each office onform JS-50.  We obtained these semiannual workload reports for fiscalyears 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and the first half of fiscal year 1994and produced a dataset to analyze FPD and CDO workload by case type,disposition (where available), and type of representation--criminal,appeals, and all other representations (such as bail andprobation/parole revocation hearings and habeas corpus proceedings). We obtained a copy of the automated database created from thevouchers submitted by panel attorneys for fiscal years 1990 through1993, plus the first 6 months of fiscal year 1994.  This databasecontained data on the amount of in-court and out-of- courtcompensation requested by panel attorneys and approved by the court,the approval date, the payment date, and the attorney's authorizedhourly in-court and out-of-court billing rates.  We did not verifythe accuracy of the data entered on the forms or the database AOUSCprovided.  However, edit checks on the internal reliability of datain selected data fields in the database, such as attorney hourlyrates, revealed some questions about the accuracy of the data inthese fields.  These problems are discussed in later sections of thisappendix. AOUSC's master criminal file provided a wide variety of data onoverall criminal workload in the federal district courts.  We usedthis database, the annual statistical reports of the courts, and aStatistics Division analysis to identify trends in total districtcourt criminal workload, such as the number of multiple defendantcriminal cases filed in district courts, the number of trials withfour or more defendants, and trial lengths in days. However, the master criminal file did not reliably differentiatebetween Defender Services cases and other cases, precluding acomparison of overall workload trends and Defender Services workloadtrends.  In addition, data on some of the workload and cost variableswe were asked to examine were unavailable or too incomplete to beanalyzed.  These included data on:   the number of defendants who required court-appointed counsel     because their assets had been seized or frozen (not available);  the total number of cases in which defendants were charged with     offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences (not available     nationally, although we found that the CDO for the Southern     District of California maintained such data, beginning in fiscal     year 1993);  the number of panel attorney appointments resulting from multiple     defendant cases in which more than one defendant required a     court-appointed attorney (not available nationally);\1  the additional hours Defender Services attorneys expend on     representations because of the implementation of the federal     sentencing guidelines (not available);  federal prosecutions of cases developed by state investigative     agencies, such as weapons or drug cases prosecuted in federal     courts to take advantage of higher mandatory minimum sentences     imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines (not available     from AOUSC).\2  the link between the increased number of assistant U.S.  Attorneys     and the number of criminal cases filed in U.S.  district courts     (only basic trends can be described from available data, such as     the percent increase in resources for criminal prosecutions and     criminal cases initiated in federal courts). Defender Services officials said that each of these factors hadcontributed to increased attorney hours and costs per representationclosed.  Early in our work we informed Subcommittee staff that thesedata limitations precluded an assessment of the direct impact ofindividual factors on Defender Services workload and costs. Therefore, as agreed with the requestor, we changed our objectives. Table I.1 summarizes the limitations of available Defender Servicesworkload and cost data for criminal representations closed.

Attorney requests for payment for other expenses, such asexpert witnesses and investigators, were reported on the CJA-21 form,which we did not review. \d The CDO for the Southern District of California in San Diego hasdeveloped its own automated system for tracking attorney hours andassignments that includes many data elements not recorded on theforms we reviewed.  The San Diego system was not designed to trackcosts per representation. \e The master criminal file included a field for type of legalcounsel, including whether the defendant had a court-appointedattorney.  However, according to AOUSC, the data in this field werenot reliable.  Our own validity test confirmed this assessment.  Thedata in this field could be entered twice--when the case was filedand when the case was closed. \f A representation appeared in the database only when an attorneysubmitted a request for partial or complete payment.  This requestmay not have appeared in the file for the fiscal year in which theattorney was appointed.  If the attorney submitted two vouchers forthe same representation in two different fiscal years, the secondvoucher was counted as a separate representation.  Thus, it waspossible to double-count representations and defendants in suchcases.  For example, in fiscal years 1991 and 1992 we found that1,591 (about 2 percent) of the panel attorney representations weredouble-counted. \g For panel attorneys, determining the number of unique defendantsdisposed requires matching individual vouchers with a number of dataelements as discussed later in this appendix.  The number ofdefendants disposed by each type of counsel cannot necessarily beadded together to obtain the total number of separate defendants whomFDOs and panel attorneys have represented.  It is possible for asingle defendant to be represented by more than one type of attorney. For example, the defendant could be represented by a FPD or CDOattorney at the bail hearing, but by a panel attorney for theremainder of the case.  In such instances, Defender Services datawould report two representations--one for FDOs in the JS-50 reports(under "other" representations for the bail hearing), and one in theCJA-20 database (under criminal representations) for the panelattorney representation. \h Not available.  The master criminal file and appeals databaseswere designed to track overall workload, not cost per case orattorney or judge hours per case. \i Out-of-court hours were to be reported beginning in fiscal year1995. \j Types of dispositions included guilty pleas, dismissals,acquittals, and trials, including both nonjury and jury trials.  Themaster criminal file defines nonjury trials as any contestedproceeding before a judge at which evidence is introduced. \k The master criminal file contained data on the type of dispositionby case and defendant, but not on the length of the trial, if therewas a trial.  The trial database contained data on the length ofcriminal trials but not by type of offense, such as drugs or weapons. \l The master criminal file included the most serious charge atindictment and the most serious charge of conviction as determined bythe maximum penalty that could be imposed.  If the mandatory minimumoffense were not the most serious charge in either case, it would notbe shown in the database. \m In its December 1992 study of Defender Services costs, AOUSCcalculated the cost per representation closed for FPDs and CDOs bydividing their total obligations by the total number ofrepresentations closed.  In the fiscal year 1995 budget submission,cost per representation closed was calculated as total obligationsdivided by total new appointments.  The cost data for panel attorneysin both the December 1992 study and the fiscal year 1995 budgetsubmission reflected representations for which at least partialpayment had been made.  Our analysis used representations closed forboth types of counsel.  For panel attorneys, we used the samedefinition of case closed as AOUSC. \n Some FDOs serve more than one district.  There is a place on theform to identify the district of jurisdiction.  We did not use thesedata or check their reliability. \o In the database the district of origin was not available for about98 percent of appeals representations closed for fiscal years 1990through 1993 and for about 85 percent of representations closed inthe first 6 months of fiscal year 1994.  The district of origin wasmissing for about 10 percent or less for all other types ofrepresentations. \p Types of representations included criminal, appeals, and other(which includes bail hearings, probation and parole revocations, andcivil actions, such as habeas corpus proceedings and prisonerpetitions). \q Data included total number of appeals, but not whether the appealwas an appeal of conviction, sentence, or both.  Under the federalsentencing guidelines, a defendant may appeal the sentence withoutappealing the conviction.  The government may also appeal thesentence. The types of data reported for panel attorneys and for FDOs differedin many respects, significantly limiting the comparisons that couldbe made between the work of panel attorneys and defenderorganizations.  As shown in table I.1, the criminal caseload dataavailable from the principal judiciary databases were varied and notalways comparable.  While the number of multiple defendant casescould be obtained from the master criminal file, for example, wecould not determine how many defendants in these cases requiredcourt-appointed counsel.  The national workload data available forFDOs and CDOs included the number of new representations, number ofrepresentations closed, and number of representations pending at theend of the fiscal year.  However, the data available on panelattorneys included only the number of representationsclosed--representations for which panel attorneys had requestedpayment.  If the representation were closed, but the panel attorneydid not request payment during the same fiscal year, therepresentation would not appear in the database until the attorneyhad submitted a voucher for payment. COMPARISON OF DEFENDER SERVICESREPRESENTATIONS WITH DISTRICTCOURT CRIMINAL WORKLOADTo determine why the rate of Defender Services representations closedhas exceeded the increase in criminal filings in recent years, wetried to identify those Defender Services representations that weremost analogous to criminal filings in district courts.  DefenderServices representations were reported in three broadcategories--criminal, appeals, and other.  After consulting withDefender Services and AOUSC's Statistics Division, we determined thatthe category "criminal representations" was most analogous tocriminal filings as reported by the district courts and recorded inthe master criminal file. Appeals are reported in AOUSC statistical reports as workload of thecourts of appeals.  Thus, such representations would not be reportedin district court workload statistics.  The category "otherrepresentations" included proceedings, such as prisoner petitions andhabeas corpus petitions, that are civil actions and reported indistrict court civil workload statistics. Defendants disposed rather than commenced in district courts was themost appropriate comparison between Defender Services criminalrepresentations and district court criminal workload statistics. This was because panel attorney data were not available on newappointments but were available only for representations closed(those for which payment had been requested).  When this comparisonwas made, we found that Defender Services criminal representationsdid not exceed the number of criminal defendants disposed in districtcourts. COMPARING FDO AND PANEL ATTORNEYWORKLOAD AND COSTSAs summarized in table I.1, comparable workload and cost data forFDOs and panel attorneys were limited.  FPDs and CDOs reportedaggregate data on case disposition (such as trial or guilty plea);panel attorneys did not.  Panel attorneys reported both in-court andout-of-court hours; FPDs and CDOs reported only in- court hours. Because panel attorneys submitted vouchers for each type ofrepresentation they were assigned--criminal representations, appeals,other--it was possible to calculate the average cost perrepresentation for different types of panel attorney representations. However, FPD and CDO cost data were not available by type ofrepresentation.  Consequently, we could not determine FPD and CDOcosts by type of representation using existing data.  Therefore, weused aggregate FPD and CDO costs per representation when comparingpanel attorney and FDO costs per representation. An AOUSC study found that CDOs had a lower average cost perrepresentation closed than FPDs or panel attorneys.  DefenderServices officials suggested that a large number of relativelyinexpensive immigration representations, particularly in the CDO forthe Southern District of California in San Diego, may have largelyaccounted for the lower average CDO costs.  The CDO for the SouthernDistrict of California accounted for more than half of all DefenderServices immigration representations.  Because of its impact on totalCDO workload and costs, we examined CDO workload and costs with andwithout San Diego included in the analyses. The San Diego CDO has developed its own system for tracking attorneyassignments and hours that captured a variety of data not availablefrom the AOUSC forms, such as representations involving offensescarrying a mandatory minimum prison term, dispositions by type ofoffense, in-court and out-of-court hours by type of offense, andmultiple defendant cases.  The San Diego system was not designed tocapture costs per representation closed but was principally designedto track attorney hours and aid in attorney assignments.  The fiscalyear 1993 San Diego data on attorney hours provided a case study ofthe impact of multiple defendant cases and representations involvingmandatory minimum offenses on attorney hours.  The San Diego dataalso illustrated how such attorney hour data could aid the DefenderServices Division in analyzing its workload. --------------------\1 In such cases, only one defendant was generally to be assigned tothe local FPD or CDO; all remaining defendants requiringcourt-appointed counsel were to be assigned to panel attorneys.  Therationale for limiting FPD and CDO appointments to a single defendantin multiple defendant cases is to avoid conflicts of interest thatmay arise from representing more than one defendant in the same case. \2 The U.S.  Attorney database indicated that the U.S.  Attorneysinitiated a total of 35,000 criminal cases in federal district courtsin fiscal year 1992, including 1,158 cases referred by stateinvestigative agencies and 344 cases referred by District of Columbiaauthorities.  About two-thirds of the cases referred by state or D.C. authorities were narcotics cases.       HOW WE COUNTED FPD, CDO, AND      PANEL ATTORNEY      REPRESENTATIONS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.1To compare the workload and per representation costs for FPDs, CDOs,and panel attorneys, we developed a working definition ofrepresentation, and calculated costs and in-court hours perrepresentation.  As explained below, we used representations closedas our basic measure of Defender Services workload.  Because FPDs andCDOs did not report out-of-court hours per representation closed forthe years we reviewed, we could only compare in-court hours perrepresentation closed for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys. Prior to its fiscal year 1996 submission, the Judiciary'scongressional budget submissions counted workload differently forFDOs and panel attorneys.  FPDs and CDOs have been reported as casesopened, the basic equivalent of new court appointments.  For panelattorneys, the submissions have used "cases against which payment ismade in a given fiscal year." In its fiscal year 1996 submission, theJudiciary used "representations closed" for reporting FPD and CDOworkload, adopting the method we used to count workload. Our analysis used FPD and CDO representations closed as reported onthe AOUSC forms, because data for panel attorneys were available onlyfor (1) closed representations; or (2) representations for whichpanel attorneys had requested partial payment, though the case maynot yet have been completed.\3 We defined a panel attorneyrepresentation as the representation of a defendant charged with orconvicted of a specific offense by a private, court-appointedattorney.  Representations for convicted defendants included appealsof conviction and/or sentence or habeas corpus proceedings in whichthe defendant may be challenging a state conviction in federalcourt.\4We took several steps to avoid double-counting panel attorneyrepresentations closed.  When a panel attorney was appointed, thecourt assigned a unique voucher number that the panel attorney was touse when submitting request(s) for payment.  Panel attorneys maysubmit more than one voucher for each representation using thevoucher number they were assigned upon appointment.  We consideredall claims for payment under a single voucher number to be part of asingle representation.  If payments under the same voucher numberwere approved and paid in two successive fiscal years, AOUSC countedthe request for payment in the new fiscal year as a separaterepresentation.  We found 691 voucher numbers that appeared in fiscalyears 1990 and 1991, 900 numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1991and 1992, and 1,202 numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1992 and1993.\5 Thus, AOUSC would have counted as separate representations691 voucher numbers in 1991, 900 in 1992, and 1,202 in 1993. We followed the AOUSC convention because we were tracking paymentsper representation closed in each fiscal year.  Thus, like AOUSC, ourcounts of representations closed in each fiscal year were notprecisely accurate.  First, we overestimated representations actuallyclosed in fiscal year 1990 by as much as 691 (2.4 percent of the28,575 representations we attributed to 1990); in fiscal 1991 by asmany as 900 (2.5 percent of 36,027 representations); and in fiscalyear 1992 by as many as 1,202 representations (3.3 percent of 36,479representations). Second, this method of counting did not accurately reflect panelattorney costs per representation closed.  If each voucher numberappearing in two fiscal years represented a single representation,then the true cost for each representation closed would be the totalof all the payments made under each voucher number for both fiscalyears.  This approach affected hours per representation closed forthe same reason.  The total attorney hours appearing in both fiscalyears would be the true hours per representation closed. Some defendants were represented by more than one panel attorney inthe same case, but we counted such situations as a singlerepresentation.  To determine a single panel attorney representation,we matched offense, court district, docket number, and defendantname.  Multiple records and multiple voucher numbers that matchedexactly on these data elements were considered part of a singlerepresentation.  If they did not match on all data elements, wecounted them as separate representations. --------------------\3 While panel attorneys are generally expected to submit a singlevoucher after the representation is closed, they may and do submitinterim vouchers for payment. \4 Habeas corpus proceedings are civil, not criminal, proceedings. \5 We did not determine how many numbers, if any, appeared in morethan two successive fiscal years.       HOW WE CALCULATED COSTS PER      REPRESENTATION CLOSED------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.2We calculated FPD and CDO costs per representation closed by dividingthe total budget obligations for all FPDs or CDOs by the total numberof FPD (or CDO) representations closed in that fiscal year, asreported on the AOUSC forms.  Thus, if total FPD obligations were$100,000 and total representations closed were 1,000, the cost perFPD representation closed would be $100 ($100,000/1,000).  Thiscalculation was not very precise, but available data did not permit amore detailed estimate of costs per representation closed.  Thismethodology may have overstated the FPD and CDO costs perrepresentation closed because an undeterminable portion of theirbudgets was used for representations opened, but not closed, duringthe fiscal year.  In addition, FDO attorneys provide training forpanel attorneys, the costs of which are included in FDO budgets. The calculation of panel attorney costs per representation closed wassomewhat more complicated.  The AOUSC used "payment date"--the dateon which the check was written--to calculate per representationcosts.  In fiscal years 1991 and 1992, payments to panel attorneyswere deferred due to shortage of funds, with large numbers ofpayments made in the first month of the new fiscal year.  Thus,payment date was not necessarily the best measure of when therepresentation was closed.  Therefore, we used "certification date,"the date on which the court approved payment, because this date waslikely to be closer to the date on which the work was completed andpayment requested than the payment date. We calculated costs per representation closed using a two-stepprocess.  First, to determine costs for closed representations havinga single panel attorney, we aggregated all payments for each vouchernumber.  That is, if there were five payments approved for vouchernumber 12345, we combined all five payments to obtain a single costfor that voucher number.  Second, we aggregated all payments for eachvoucher number associated with the same representation.  For example,if voucher numbers 54321 and 67890 were associated with the samerepresentation, we combined them into a single total for thatrepresentation. As noted, our panel attorney costs per representation closed may besomewhat understated since in the database we used the costs for asmany as 691 representations that were split between fiscal years 1990and 1991, 900 between 1991 and 1992, and 1,202 between 1992 and 1993. Moreover, our costs per representation closed included attorney timeonly.  The costs of experts, investigators, and other services,reported on another form, were not included in our costs because ofthe difficulty of matching these payments, recorded in a separatedatabase, with the representations recorded in the AOUSC database forattorney hours.  However, such costs were included in the costs forFPDs and CDOs, since these costs were included in the total budgetobligations we used to calculate FPD and CDO costs.  Thus, the FPDand CDO cost per representation closed used in our analysis includedall costs incurred by these organizations, while our panel attorneycost per representation closed included only attorney time. Consequently, any FPD or CDO cost advantage we found in our analysiswas probably somewhat understated.       HOW WE CALCULATED HOURS PER      REPRESENTATION CLOSED------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.3We used the in-court hours reported on the JS-50 forms forrepresentations closed to calculate FPD and CDO in-court hours perrepresentation closed.  FPDs and CDOs did not report out-of- courthours.  Panel attorney vouchers included separate sections forin-court and out-of-court compensation requested and approved.  Inall but 16 districts panel attorneys were reimbursed at the standardrate of $60 per hour for in-court time and $40 per hour forout-of-court time.  Thus, in these districts in-court hours arereimbursed at a rate 50 percent higher than out-of-court hours.  Thecourt may reduce the amount requested for either in-courtcompensation, out-of-court compensation, or both.  However, where thecourt made a reduction in the amount approved for payment, thedatabase did not usually indicate the number of attorney hours bywhich the request had been reduced.  Rather, the database showedseparately the amount requested and the amount approved for payment. Because attorney hours were not entered into the automated database,AOUSC calculated the actual number of in-court hours expended perpanel attorney representations by dividing the total amount ofcompensation requested (for example, $2,400) for in-court time by theauthorized hourly rate ($60 in most districts).  The same calculationwas made for out-of-court hours.  The database supports no otherreasonable method of calculation.  Consequently, we used the samemethod to calculate attorney hours per representation closed. If the the authorized hourly rate is recorded erroneously on theCJA-20, this would affect the calculation of attorney hours.  Wefound a wide variety of hourly rates reported in the database forboth death penalty and nondeath penalty representations.  Someappeared to be keying errors.  For example, in more than 1,300nondeath penalty panel attorney representations in fiscal year 1993the out-of-court hourly rate was recorded as $752, perhaps reflectinga data entry error.  The correct rate was probably $75--the higherstandard hourly rate in those districts authorized to pay the higherrates.  However, because of the method used to calculate panelattorney hours, this error would reduce by a factor of 10 the actualout-of-court hours reported as expended in such cases.  Due toresource limitations, we did not validate the hourly rates entered inthe database.  Consequently, we could not determine the magnitude ofthe error that may be attributable to such erroneous hourly rates,and the data used in our analyses were based on the rates as reportedin the database. FPDs and CDOs were not assigned death penalty cases during the periodof our review.  Therefore, when comparing FPD, CDO, and panelattorney average costs per representation closed, we used the averagepanel attorney cost per representation closed, excluding deathpenalty representations.  We separately calculated the costs forpanel attorney death penalty representations closed for the analysison death penalty representations.       HOW WE ESTIMATED THE IMPACT      OF INCREASED REPRESENTATIONS      CLOSED ON PROGRAM COSTS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.4To estimate the impact of increased workload (as measured byrepresentations closed) on program costs, we estimated what fiscalyear 1993 costs would have been if the average cost perrepresentation closed had remained unchanged throughout the period atthe fiscal year 1990 average cost per representation closed(unadjusted for inflation).  For example, in fiscal year 1990, totalpanel attorney criminal representation costs were $47,212,797, withan average cost of $1,985 each.  At $1,985 each, the 29,237 panelattorney criminal representations closed in fiscal year 1993 wouldhave cost $58,035,445, or $10,822,648 more than the total 1990 costs. However, total 1993 panel attorney costs for criminal representationswere actually $30,009,222 more than the 1990 total.  Thus, weestimated that the increased workload accounted for about 36 percentof increased panel attorney costs for criminal representationsbetween fiscal years 1990 and 1993.\6We did not adjust the 1990 cost per representation closed forinflation because we wanted a comparable estimate for panel attorneysand FDOs.  While FDO attorneys received cost-of-living adjustmentsduring the period (though not always at the same time in the fiscalyear), the basic panel attorney hourly rates in 78 of 94 districtsremained unchanged at $40 (out-of-court) and $60 (in-court).  We hadalready separately estimated the impact of paying higher standardhourly rates to panel attorneys in the 16 districts in which higherrates were paid in fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993.  Although ouruse of 1990 average costs unadjusted for inflation may haveunderestimated the impact of increased workload on program costs,particularly for FDOs, it was the most straightforward method ofdeveloping reasonable, comparable estimates for panel attorneys andFDOs. HOW WE CALCULATED THE ADDITIONALCOST OF PAYING HIGHER HOURLY RATESIN 16 DISTRICTSIn 78 districts, panel attorneys are paid a standard hourly rate of$40 for each out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court hour.  Inall or parts of 16 districts, panel attorneys are paid a single,standard higher hourly rate of $60, $70, or $75 for both in-court andout-of-court hours.  The applicable rate varies by district.  TheAOUSC database included the hourly rate and the separate amounts ofcompensation requested for in-court and out-of-court hours, but thedatabase did not include the number of in-court or out-of-court hourson which the request was based.  We excluded from our analysisrepresentations compensated at rates other than the standard higherrates, as applicable, of $60, $70, or $75 per hour in these 16districts.  Representations compensated at other hourly rates would,by definition, have been exceptions to the standard higher hourlyrates prevailing in these districts.  In some of these districts, thehigher rate applies only to specific location(s) within the district. To the extent that the higher standard rates were approved inspecific cases outside these locations, they would be included in ouranalysis because we could identify representations only by district,not by specific locations within a district. We calculated the number of in-court hours and out-of-court hours bydividing the total requested amount by the approved hourly rate.  Weused these hours to recalculate the requested compensation at therate of $40 for each out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-courthour.  This provided a comparison between requested compensation atthe higher standard rate in these districts and the amount that wouldhave been requested using the lower standard hourly rates of $40out-of-court and $60 in-court. However, the courts reduced some requests for compensation at thehigher rates.  Consequently, a comparison based solely on requestedcompensation would overstate the amount actually paid in thehigher-rate districts.  To determine how much had actually beenapproved and paid in each of the 16 higher-rate districts, we usedthe AOUSC database to identify the amount by which the requests forcompensation had been reduced in each district. We then compared the amounts actually approved and paid at the higherrates with the amounts that would have been requested at the lowerrates.  We did not also reduce the calculation using the lower ratesbecause the database provided no basis on which to make such anadjustment.  The database did not explain the basis for thereductions in requested compensation, nor were there any data on thenumber of hours disallowed--only final dollar amounts approved andpaid.  Our method of calculation produced a conservative estimate ofthe additional costs of paying the higher rates in the 16 districts. Our estimates and cost comparisons were also conservative because weexcluded from the analysis any voucher without a district identifier. For every type of representation--criminal, appeals, other--somerepresentations did not include district identifiers, but only theappeals circuit in which the district was located.  Each circuit,except the District of Columbia circuit, covers a number of statesand districts.  The higher-cost districts are in the second, third,seventh, ninth, and tenth circuits, but not all districts in each ofthese circuits were authorized to pay the higher panel attorneyhourly rates. At least 98 percent of all appeals in the database for fiscal years1990 through 1993, and 85 percent in the first half of 1994, wereidentified only by the circuit in which the appeal was filed. Consequently, our estimate of paying the higher rates excluded thecosts of most appeals originating in the districts authorized to paythe higher rates. DEATH PENALTY RESOURCE CENTERSTo assess the costs of representations by DPRCs we relied primarilyon DPRC budget and workload data included in the DPRCs' quarterlyreports and data on panel attorney costs per death penaltyrepresentation closed from the AOUSC database.  Because there were nobaseline cost data prior to the DPRCs' creation, we could notdetermine whether the services the DPRCs provided had helped toreduce the costs of death penalty litigation.  Because ofconsiderable variations in the type of work each DPRC does, includingthe mix of direct representations and assistance provided to privatecounsel, we could not determine whether the increased costs of theDPRCs were justified by the workload. About 37 percent of panel attorney death penalty representationsclosed in fiscal year 1991, 23 percent in fiscal year 1992, and 17percent in fiscal year 1993 were not identified by district.  Thisprecluded a comparison of the costs of panel attorney death penaltyrepresentations closed in districts with and without DPRCs. To develop descriptive information on DPRCs, we reviewed the fiscalyear 1991, 1992, and 1993 quarterly reports submitted by the DPRCs ontheir workload.  California did not submit quarterly reports untilfiscal year 1994 because it submitted monthly vouchers instead;fiscal year 1991 quarterly reports for the Georgia DPRC were alsounavailable. We also reviewed studies by the Spangenberg Group, a consulting firm,on death penalty litigation and costs, and incorporated some of theirdata in our analysis, as appropriate. --------------------\6 This is derived by dividing $10,822,648 (the cost of the increasedworkload at the 1990 average cost per representation closed) by$30,009,222 (the actual increased costs). SELECTED DATA ON DEFENDER SERVICESWORKLOAD AND COSTS========================================================== Appendix IIThis appendix provides selected tables on Defender Services workloadand costs for fiscal years 1990 through 1993.  Where available, datafor the first 6 months of fiscal year 1994 are included.  The tablesin this appendix supplement the tables and figures in the letter. Only overall costs per representation closed were available for FPDsand CDOs.

The U.S. presence wasestablished to support U.S. military and political interests in CentralAmerica, which were threatened by Communist expansion in the region.The cost to maintain the U.S. presence there is projected to be about$38 million in fiscal year 1994.  With the end of the Cold War andpolitical changes in the region, GAO examined the need for a continuingU.S. military presence in Honduras.

BatemanChairmanThe Honorable Norman SisiskyRanking Minority MemberSubcommitte on Military ReadinessCommittee on National SecurityThe Honorable John R.  KasichMember, Committee on National SecurityHouse of RepresentativesSince 1983, the United States has maintained a semipermanent militarypresence at Honduras' Soto Cano Air Force Base.\1 The U.S.  presencewas established there to support U.S.  military and politicalinterests in Central America, which were threatened by communistexpansion in the region.  With the end of the Cold War and politicalchanges that have occurred in the region, we examined the continuingneed for a semipermanent U.S.  military presence in Honduras. Specifically, we assessed whether this U.S.  military presence iscritical to current U.S.  activities and objectives in the region. The cost to maintain the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano isprojected to be about $38 million in fiscal year 1994.  In light ofbudget constraints and current efforts to increase thecost-effectiveness of the Department of Defense's (DOD) worldwideoperations, we believe this report will be of interest to theSubcommittee. --------------------\1 A combination of conditions have contributed to describing theU.S.  military presence in Honduras as semipermanent.  These includethe early congressional concerns that facilities not bepermanent-type construction, the short-term assignments at Soto Cano,and the use of semipermanent facilities for more than 10 years.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano provides useful andconvenient support to some U.S.  government activities but is notcritical to these activities or current U.S.  policy objectives inthe region--which are now oriented toward economic growth anddemocratic reform.  U.S.  military and embassy officials in theregion agree that the military's contribution to the new objectivesis incidental and not reason enough to maintain the presence. Moreover, the United States has underway a range of official programsto achieve economic and democracy objectives in Latin America, whichare being carried out by several civilian agencies. With the end of the Cold War and political changes that have occurredin the region, the major missions of U.S.  personnel at Soto Cano areto support military training exercises, humanitarian and civicassistance exercises, and U.S.  counterdrug activities.  However, theU.S.  military presence at Soto Cano is not essential to trainingexercises.  Similar training is routinely conducted in other CentralAmerican countries without this type of semipermanent arrangement. The U.S.  Army has recently acknowledged that training can beconducted in the region without a semipermanent logistics supportbase. Soto Cano is located in the center of the drug transit area, and U.S. military personnel there assist the U.S.  Customs Service, the U.S. Navy, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in counterdrugoperations.  However, this support is minimal.  Officials from thethree agencies characterized the support they received as convenient,but not critical, and said they could continue their operations inthe region without support from the U.S.  military at Soto Cano. The pending withdrawal of U.  S.  forces from Howard Air Force Basein Panama was also ascribed as a reason for the continuing U.S. presence at Soto Cano.  Some U.S.  government officials believe thatthe U.S.  presence at Soto Cano provides the U.S.  military withneeded flexibility as it draws down assets in Panama and in the eventof a future crisis in the region.  However, the current arrangementwith the Honduran government does not guarantee that the UnitedStates could have full access for future U.S.  missions.  Asignificant expansion of U.S.  assets at Soto Cano and access forfuture military missions would likely be encumbered by a number offactors, including the absence of a base rights agreement, limitedcapacity, and political issues.  DOD and State Department officialsacknowledged it was unlikely the United States would become involvedin a major military conflict in Latin America. The original reasons for the establishment of U.S.  presence at SotoCano no longer exist.  The elimination of this arrangement would haveminimal impact on current U.S.  missions and objectives in the regionand would potentially result in budgetary savings.  However, we didnot attempt to establish firm estimates of cost savings that wouldresult from discontinuing the U.S.  presence because there were toomany unknowns, including how current activities at Soto Cano would bedispersed to other DOD installations or whether they would beeliminated.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2In August 1983, DOD established a joint task force called Joint TaskForce-Bravo (JTF-B) of about 1,100 Army and Air Force personnel atSoto Cano (formerly, Palmerola Air Base), the Honduran militaryinstallation that houses the Honduran Air Force Academy.  Thepresence was established to support various U.S.  political andmilitary objectives that demonstrated U.S.  commitment to its alliesagainst the increasing communist threat in the region.  JTF-B and theother U.S.  military units at Soto Cano were assigned missions tocoordinate and support U.S.  counterinsurgency and intelligenceoperations, and military training exercises in the region.  Whendirected, JTF-B provides support for disaster relief, search andrescue, and contingency-type missions in Central America.  JTF-B wasestablished as a subordinate unit of the U.S.  Southern Command(USSOUTHCOM), headquartered in Panama. The United States funded construction projects and infrastructureupgrades at Soto Cano, such as a F-16 capable runway, semipermanentbarracks, offices and recreational facilities, 22 miles of roads, andupgrades of the water, sewer, and electrical systems.  The annualcost for the United States to maintain the U.S.  military presence atSoto Cano has grown steadily from about $24 million annually in themid-1980s to a projected $38 million for 1994.  (See table 1 for abreakdown of the costs.) Since 1991, the average annual cost of newconstruction and upgrades has been about $2.5 million.  U.S. operations at Soto Cano are funded from the Army's and the AirForce's Operations and Maintenance accounts. In addition to JTF-B, other U.S.  military units are stationed atSoto Cano to support JTF-B's missions, such as an aviation battalionand a military police platoon.  About two-thirds of the U.S. military personnel assigned to Soto Cano are on temporary duty,usually from 4 to 6 months.  The remainder serve a 1-year tour. In April 1994, authorized U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano wasreduced to 780 (see app.  I).  At the time of our fieldwork, DODofficials told us that the level of personnel was scheduled toincrease to about 900 in October 1994 due to the relocation ofhelicopter personnel and three helicopters stationed in Panama.  DODofficials informed us that this move was being made to keep aircraftassets in the theater due to the drawdown of U.S.  forces in Panama. However, during discussions on a draft of this report, DOD officialstold us that the level is now scheduled to decrease to about 500personnel in October 1995 due to the deactivation of a helicopterbattalion, which will reduce the number of helicopters from 31 to 11. In addition, all U.S.  aviation operations and support at Soto Canowill be consolidated with JTF-B facilities, and the current main airfacility, Camp Pickett, will be closed. According to DOD documents, the U.S.  military presence at Soto Canocontributes about $14 million annually to the Honduran economy in theform of contracts and services to support the U.S.  militarypresence.  This includes the U.S.  military personnel estimatedspending on the Honduran local economy.    MILITARY PRESENCE AT SOTO CANO   NOT ESSENTIAL TO NEW STRATEGIC   INTERESTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3With the resolution of military conflicts and greater politicalstability in Central America, the focus of U.S.  interest in theregion has shifted from political/military objectives to economicgrowth and democracy building.  The U.S.  government officials we metwith said that the continuing U.S.  military presence contributed toU.S.  democracy objectives, but that the contribution was incidentalto their presence to perform other missions. Since 1990, Central America has experienced new political stabilityas the conflicts in El Salvador and Nicaragua have been resolved, andthe overall threat of communist expansion has diminished.  As aresult, U.S.-directed counterinsurgency and intelligence activitieshave ended.  The changed political condition from the time that JTF-Bwas established is reflected in the April 1994 congressionaltestimony of the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-AmericanAffairs.  The Assistant Secretary stated "the United States is nolonger compelled to base foreign policy strategy on defending theUnited States and its neighbors from external aggression.  Instead,foreign policy can now be focused on encouraging democracy andpromoting economic growth."When questioned about the continuing need for a military presence inlight of new U.S.  goals and the relative stability in the region,military officials at Soto Cano and the Southern Command said thatthe military presence at Soto Cano contributes to U.S.  efforts topromote democracy.  According to these officials, the militarypersonnel at Soto Cano serve as an example of a military force thatis subordinate to civilian control, a main tenet of democracy. However, the officials stated that the influence exerted by the U.S. military at Soto Cano was incidental and difficult to quantify. According to State Department officials, the principal U.S.  programsto promote democratic initiatives and military professionalism areadministered by other U.S.  agencies such as the State Department,the Agency for International Development, the Department of Justice,and the Defense Security Assistance Agency.  Further, the continuingU.S.  military presence at Soto Cano appears inconsistent with thecurrent goal of the U.S.  Embassy in Honduras--which is to reduce theoverall size and scope of U.S.  activities in Honduras in recognitionof declining U.S.  funding and increased political stability in theregion.  Moreover, the United States is also encouraging thegovernment of Honduras to implement military reforms, which includereducing its armed forces.    U.S.  MILITARY PRESENCE IS NOT   NEEDED TO SUPPORT MILITARY   TRAINING ACTIVITIES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Since the end of the Cold War, the primary missions of JTF-B are tosupport joint, combined and interagency operations, and providelogistical support for military training exercises, and to maintainand operate an all-weather, C-5 capable airfield.  While the U.S. military presence at Soto Cano is useful and convenient, it is notessential to support military training activities in the region. U.S.  military personnel are routinely deployed throughout LatinAmerica for training missions without a dedicated, semipermanent U.S. logistics and support base like Soto Cano.  According to DOD records,in 1993 over 60,000 U.S.  active and reserve military personnel weredeployed from the United States and other locations to conduct avariety of training and civic assistance activities throughout LatinAmerica.  About 5,500 of the 60,000 participated in trainingactivities conducted in Honduras.  In discussions on a draft of thisreport, DOD officials provided us with figures for fiscal year 1994training.  These figures show that JTF-B provided support to 10,665personnel, which is 89 percent of the total deployed in CentralAmerica.  However, the types and levels of support provided by JTF-Bto the various training exercises were not available.  According toDOD officials, the number of personnel trained in Central America isapproximately 17 percent of all personnel deployed from the UnitedStates and other locations to Latin America. Training activities conducted in Latin America included engineeringexercises to drill wells, build roads, schools, and medical clinics;medical exercises to provide basic medical, dental, and veterinarycare; and combined exercises with host nation forces, such ascomputer-simulated war exercises and counterterrorist training. JTF-B and the other U.S.  military units stationed at Soto Canoprovide support to these types of training exercises conducted inHonduras.  For example, in support of an engineering exerciseconducted in Honduras in 1993, U.S.  military personnel at Soto Canoperformed liaison functions with Honduran military and localgovernment officials,assisted U.S.  reserve units in awarding contracts to procureservices and supplies on the local economy, andtransported and accompanied advance teams to identify suitablelocations for base camps and inspected training sites during theexercise. The U.S.  military at Soto Cano also often provides limited support(such as supplies and communication support) to training exercises inBelize, Guatemala, and El Salvador.  For example, military personnelat Soto Cano provided and transported tents to a National Guardtraining site in Guatemala when the Guard's shipment of tents wasdelayed. Currently, assets from Soto Cano are being used to support deminingtraining under the operational control of the U.S.  Military Group(USMILGP) in Honduras for Brazilian, Costa Rican, and Hondurantroops.  JTF-B also recently provided assistance to the USMILGP in ElSalvador in the coordination of air operations for the FuertesCaminos exercise. Officials from the U.S.  Army Reserve and National Guard said thatthe support they receive from U.S.  military forces at Soto Canomakes training more convenient but that the training can beaccomplished without a U.S.  military presence.  Since 1992, the ArmyNational Guard and Army Reserve have increased their trainingdeployments to other Central American countries, especially ElSalvador and Guatemala.  In these countries, intergovernmentalcoordination for logistical support is provided by U.S.  militarypersonnel attached to the Embassy; personnel deployed in advance ofthe training; post-exercise evaluation teams; and in some cases, thehost nation military, according to U.S.  Army Reserve and NationalGuard officials. In a March 1994 memorandum on the review of the requirement forJTF-B, to the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA), the Army staffconcluded that training activities in the region could continuewithout support from U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano. According to the memorandum training exercises in the region can besupported from bases located in the United States without the supportof an "expensive, semi-permanent, logistics base." The memorandumstates that the costs to support training exercises in Hondurasexceed the benefits and the resources could be better used elsewhereto meet other Army operational requirements.  Further, the Army Chiefof Staff indicated to the Commander in Chief (CINC), USSOUTHCOM, andthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a message, thatreducing or eliminating the Army's support requirement for JTF-Bwould represent an important savings to the Army.  Furthermore, wereported in November 1993 and testified in April 1994 that some DODhumanitarian and civic action projects were not designed tocontribute to foreign policy objectives, did not appear to enhanceU.S.  military training, and either lacked the support of the countryor were not used.\2According to DOD officials, the CINC, USSOUTHCOM, considered theCSA's concerns about the need for JTF-B.  The CINC's position is thatJTF-B could be reduced, but that access to Soto Cano, with its C-5capable airfield and a U.S.  presence, is needed to accomplishUSSOUTHCOM's mission, which includes conducting various military andhumanitarian operations, training, and providing support forexercises in the Central American region. --------------------\2 Department of Defense:  Changes Needed to the Humanitarian andCivic Assistance Program (GAO/NSIAD-94-57, Nov.  2, 1993) andDepartment of Defense:  Weaknesses in Humanitarian and CivicAssistance Programs (GAO/T-NSIAD-94-158, Apr.  19, 1994).    U.S.  MILITARY SUPPORT AT SOTO   CANO TO COUNTERDRUG ACTIVITIES   IS MINIMAL------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano provide support to the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S.  Navy, and the DEA counterdrug programs inthe region.  However, the level of support is minimal and involvesonly a small portion of the U.S.  military personnel and equipment atSoto Cano.  U.S.  Customs, U.S.  Navy, and DEA officialscharacterized the support they receive from the U.S.  military atSoto Cano as useful and convenient, but not critical to theircounterdrug programs.       MINIMAL SUPPORT TO CUSTOMS      COUNTERDRUG ACTIVITIES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Honduras is an ideal location for U.S.  Customs to intercept andtrack suspect drug-trafficking aircraft.  The U.S.  Customs Servicehas two airplanes and eight personnel stationed at Soto Cano tointercept and track planes suspected of carrying drugs in the CentralAmerican region and over the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Customs provideshousing for its personnel at the base and its mechanics maintaintheir counterdrug planes, but receives utilities and other supportservices through the U.S.  military and can use U.S.  militaryfacilities, such as the dining hall. In addition, Customs purchases airplane fuel from U.S.  militarysupplies and receives ground and air operations support, such as airtraffic control and weather reports from U.S.  military at Soto Cano. The U.S.  military presence at the base provides Customs with asecure environment and operational capability 24 hours a day, 7 daysa week.  According to the U.S.  Air Force commander at the base,about 130 personnel are involved in airfield operations.  However,Customs counterdrug flights accounted for only a small percentage ofthe total flights handled by these personnel.  For example, Customs'aircraft accounted for about 8 percent of total U.S.  fixed-wingflights from Soto Cano between July 1993 and May 1994--an average of16 times per month.  During the 9-month period, April to December1993, Interagency Counterdrug Assessment data shows that Customs'aircraft based at Soto Cano participated in intercepting/tracking 32trafficking aircraft, which resulted in 13 cocaine seizures. Customs officials said their counterdrug operations could continue atSoto Cano without assistance from the U.S.  military if support wereobtained from the Honduran military and/or contractors. Additionally, Customs officials told us that if they did not haveaccess to Soto Cano, they could use aircraft based in Panama, Mexico,or other locations to monitor areas now covered by the aircraft atSoto Cano.  However, the officials also said that this option woulddecrease the effectiveness of operations because Customs' aircraftwould always be in a "catch-up" mode rather than an intercept mode. We note that Customs carries out similar activities in Mexico andother locations without a U.S.  military presence.  Notwithstandingthe current Customs' arrangement with USSOUTHCOM\3 for use of theSoto Cano Base facilities, arrangements to provide for Customs use ofcivilian airport facilities for antidrug activities--without a U.S. military presence--may be possible as has been done in Mexicoaccording to Customs officials.  This would require the governmentsof the United States and Honduras to negotiate and establishappropriate arrangements. --------------------\3 The arrangement is based upon a memorandum of understandingbetween the U.S.  Customs Service and USSOUTHCOM, dated September 14,1990.  The purpose of this memorandum is to facilitate and implementcooperation and coordination for the detection and monitoring ofmaritime and aerial transit of illegal drugs through the USSOUTHCOM'sarea of responsibility into the United States.       NAVY USES SOTO CANO      INFREQUENTLY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2The Navy uses Soto Cano in its counterdrug operations, which involvedetecting and monitoring suspected drug planes.  U.S.  militaryflight records at Soto Cano showed that Navy counterdrug planeslanded at Soto Cano on average 11 times a month from July 1993through May 1994.  Two Navy P-3 counterdrug planes based in Panamasometimes use Soto Cano for refueling or as a temporary base fortheir operations.  The aircraft refuel at Soto Cano and receiveground and air operations support similar to the support provided toCustoms.  Navy personnel are sometimes housed at Soto Cano during 2-to 3-day stopovers. Navy officials said that due to intercept geometry limitations, inorder for the Navy P-3 aircraft to provide a constant air interceptcapability, they must be staged at a Central American site.  Theoptimum location for staging is north of Costa Rica but south ofMexico.  Currently, Soto Cano is the only air base with U.S. aviation support that fits that description.  These officials furtheradded that due to excessive transit distance from other P-3 bases, aCentral American base is required to conduct maritime patrols in thesouthwestern Caribbean and eastern Pacific.  When Howard Air ForceBase closes, Soto Cano will be the only base in Central America thathas U.S.  aviation support.  According to DOD officials, if the U.S. presence at Soto Cano is discontinued, P-3s could potentiallycontinue to stage out of there or other bases in the region if theappropriate operating agreement can be made with the host nation. However, in considering options associated with the possibleelimination of the U.S.  presence at Soto Cano, the effectiveness ofthe Navy's P-3 interdiction efforts should be considered.  Our priorwork has raised serious questions about the cost-effectiveness ofDOD's surveillance efforts in the drug war.\4--------------------\4 Drug Control:  Heavy Investment in Military Surveillance Is NotPaying Off (GAO/NSIAD-93-220,Sept.  1, 1993).       DEA RECEIVES LIMITED SUPPORT      FROM U.S.  MILITARY AT SOTO      CANO---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3A part of DEA's mission is to assist local law enforcement agencieswith counterdrug investigations, intelligence, and other activities. The 4th Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, at Soto Cano occasionallyprovides helicopter transport to DEA agents and Honduran lawenforcement officers for counterdrug operations.\5 These missionshave involved transporting agents to investigate drug seizures(post-seizure investigation), reconnaissance, drug eradication, andtraining for Honduran law enforcement officers. At the time of our fieldwork, the helicopter battalion had 33helicopters: 15 Blackhawk, 10 Huey, and 8 Chinook helicopters.  From October 1992through March 1994, the battalion provided transportation support toDEA about once a month, typically transporting two DEA and threeHonduran agents.  This accounts for only a small portion of thehelicopter battalion's total flying hours.  For example, duringfiscal year 1993, DEA air transport totaled 91.3 flying hours, oronly 1.2 percent of the helicopter battalion's total flying hours. The remaining 98.8 percent of the helicopter flying hours went for avariety of missions such as pilot proficiency training, humanitarianand civic action exercises, and general support for U.S.  militarygroups and embassies in the region. DEA officials characterized the helicopter battalion's flight supportas convenient.  They said that DEA operations in Honduras could beconducted with one Chinook and two Blackhawk helicopters.  However,DEA officials noted they have other options to meet their needs forair transportation.  These include chartering planes, which they havedone in the past, or using U.S.  helicopters based in Guatemala. --------------------\5 DEA is authorized to request DOD assistance for its counterdrugoperations by section 1004 of the fiscal year 1991 National DefenseAuthorization Act, as amended (P.L.  101-510).    SOTO CANO NOT A VIABLE OPTION   TO HOWARD AIR BASE------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6U.S.  military and diplomatic officials told us that another reasonto maintain a U.S.  presence at Soto Cano is the pending U.S. withdrawal from Panama by the end of 1999, that will result in theloss of Howard Air Force Base.  These officials stated that it isimportant to retain access to an airfield in the region that isoperated by U.S.  military personnel.  Without a U.S.  militarypresence at Soto Cano or Panama, officials said the United Stateswould no longer control or have immediate access to an airfield inLatin America for contingency purposes.  They stated, however, thatthis is not reason enough to justify continuing the U.S.  presence. They also acknowledged that it was unlikely that the United Stateswould become involved in a major military conflict in Latin America. Maintaining a U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano does not guaranteecontinued access to the base because the United States has no baserights or status of forces agreements with the government ofHonduras.  According to some Honduran officials we met with, theHonduran constitution prohibits the permanent basing of foreigntroops in Honduras, which would limit U.S.  options with respect tofuture missions at Soto Cano.  The 1954 Military Assistance Treatybetween the United States and Honduras was the basis for militarycooperation and assistance during the Cold War.  Subsequent annexesand protocols to the 1954 agreement provided for the establishment ofU.S.  military presence at Soto Cano.  U.S.  and Honduran officialscharacterize the agreement allowing a U.S.  military presence at SotoCano as a "handshake" agreement, which either side could decide tobreak at any time. In fact, the current U.S.  presence has become a source of politicalcontroversy.  Some Honduran government officials question the needfor the U.S.  military at Soto Cano and the adequacy of thearrangement for this presence.  The Honduran President, the Chief ofthe Armed Forces, and leaders of the Honduran Congress have calledfor an examination of the terms and conditions of the U.S.  presencebecause the reasons for its establishment no longer exist. Finally, continuation of the U.S.  military presence at Soto Canowill require recurring renovation and upgrade construction of somefacilities and environmental issues will need to be addressed.\6 Forexample, the waste water treatment system is not adequate for thecurrent U.S.  presence. --------------------\6 JTF-B envisions providing proactive environmental leadership andbegan using environmental compliance assessment system inspections inApril 1993 to establish a baseline program.  They have begun toidentify and prioritize requirements and funding sources.  Additionalfull-time staffing is required for this program.    COST TO MAINTAIN U.S.  PRESENCE   AT SOTO CANO BASE------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7We did not attempt to establish firm estimates of cost savings thatwould result from discontinuing the U.S.  presence at Soto Canobecause there were too many unknowns.  For example, we did not knowhow current activities at Soto Cano would be dispersed to other DODinstallations and whether they would continue at the same level. Similarly, we did not have a firm basis for estimating the costs thatCustoms would incur with a different support arrangement for itsmission.  However, since about 83 percent of training exercises inthe region take place without assistance from U.S.  forces at SotoCano, there are other DOD units and bases that provide similarsupport and they could take on the support role currently performedby JTF-B.  Thus, we infer that DOD resources (i.e., human, financial,supplies and equipment, and contracts and fees) associated with baseoperations and maintenance could be eliminated and costs would eitherdecline and/or shift to other agencies.

RECOMMENDATION------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8The reason that the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano wasestablished no longer exists and this presence is not critical tocurrent missions.  In light of budget constraints and current effortsto increase the cost-effectiveness of DOD's worldwide operations, wequestion whether the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano isjustified.  Therefore, we recommend thatthe Secretary of Defense reduce U.S.  military personnel at Soto Canoto the level necessary to support counterdrug activities, pending thedevelopment of other arrangements to support those counterdrugactivities;the Commissioner of the U.S.  Customs Service, the Administrator ofDEA, the Secretaries of State and Defense, in conjunction with theDirector of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, develop aplan to conduct their operations without U.S.  military units at SotoCano; andthe Secretary of Defense withdraw the remaining U.S.  militarypersonnel at Soto Cano once the interagency plan is developed andimplemented.    AGENCY COMMENTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9In its comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated that they havealready begun reducing U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano to thelevels necessary for USSOUTHCOM to carry out JTF-B's restructuredmission, which was formally approved on November 18, 1994, after thecompletion of our audit work.  DOD plans to reduce the number ofhelicopters from 33 to 11 and personnel from the April 1994 level of780 to 499 by October 1995.  DOD said that if JTF-B were eliminated,it would cost units deploying to the region about $8.2 million peryear to provide the command and control and logistics support formost exercises in the Central American countries at the fiscal year1993-94 level.  No details were provided as to how the $8.2-millionestimate was established or its relevance to the total cost of theU.S.  presence at Soto Cano.  DOD stated that continued U.S. military operations at Soto Cano are important to ensure effectiveforward presence and to execute peacetime operations in the CentralAmerican region.  They responded that any further restructuring ofDOD activities at Soto Cano should await decisions that are pendingon the relocation of USSOUTHCOM headquarters.  DOD's response andcomments are inappendix II. The Department of State generally agreed with the information in thedraft report but expressed concern about its timing and the politicalsignal that might be perceived by the Latin American region if JTF-Bwere to be terminated.  The U.S.  Customs Service, DEA, and theOffice of National Drug Control Policy generally agreed with theinformation contained in the draft report.  Informal commentsreceived from the agencies during discussions on a draft of thisreport have been included where appropriate.    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10We interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense,the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department, theU.S.  Customs Service, DEA, and the Army National Guard ReadinessBureau, all in the Washington, D.C., area.  We also met with the ArmyReserve Command Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and the U.S. Atlantic Command in Norfolk, Virginia.  We obtained additionalinformation related to the costs of maintaining the presence at thebase from Air Force Air Combat Command Headquarters in Langley,Virginia, and the Army Forces Command Headquarters in Atlanta,Georgia. In Panama, we met with officials from the USSOUTHCOM, including U.S. Army South, and the U.S.  Customs Service and DEA.  In Honduras, wevisited the U.S.  military installation at Soto Cano and interviewedthe Commander, JTF-B; the Commander, 4th Battalion, 228th AviationRegiment; and other military personnel assigned to the base.  We alsomet with the U.S.  Ambassador to Honduras and other embassyofficials, including the Commander of the USMILGP, the DefenseAttache, and the DEA Country Attache.  Additionally, we interviewedformer and present Honduran government and military officialsregarding the U.S.  military presence in Honduras.  We did not assessthe effectiveness of the programs that are supported by JTF-B and theother U.S.  military units at the base. We conducted our review between October 1993 and June 1994 inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. --------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10.1We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense,State, and Treasury; the Attorney General; the Commissioner of U.S. Customs; the Administrator of DEA; the Directors of the Office ofNational Drug Control Policy and the Office of Management and Budget;and interested congressional committees.

InouyeChairman, Subcommittee on DefenseCommittee on AppropriationsUnited States SenateThe Honorable Ronald V.  DellumsChairman, Committee on Armed ServicesHouse of RepresentativesThe Honorable John P.  MurthaChairman, Subcommittee on DefenseCommittee on AppropriationsHouse of RepresentativesIn February 1993, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffrecommended that (1) the continental air defense mission be performedby dual tasking existing active and reserve general-purpose fighterand training squadrons in the Air Force, the Navy, and the MarineCorps and (2) the number of Air National Guard units dedicated tothis mission be sharply reduced or eliminated.  As part of ourlegislative responsibility, we assessed the viability of theChairman's recommendations and the Secretary of Defense's and the AirForce's responses to those recommendations.  We are reporting to youbecause of your committees' jurisdiction over these issues.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The continental air defense mission evolved during the Cold War todetect and intercept Soviet bombers attacking North America via theNorth Pole.  The continental air defense force that carries out thatmission is within the North American Aerospace Defense Command(NORAD), which is a joint U.S.  and Canadian command.  The U.S. portion of that force is currently comprised of 180 Air NationalGuard F-15A/B and F-16A/B aircraft located in 10 units and 14 alertsites in the United States.  In addition to the 10 dedicated units, 2F-15 dual-tasked general- purpose units stand alert for NORAD--anactive unit at Elmendorf, Alaska, and an Air National Guard unit atNew Orleans, Louisiana--part of which is on 24-hour alert.  Becauseit does not have a wartime mission outside North America, thecontinental air defense force is not counted as part of the AirForce's 26-1/2 fighter wing equivalent base force or the 20 fighterwing equivalent force recently proposed by the Secretary of Defenseas a result of the Bottom-Up Review.\1 The Air Force currentlybudgets about $370 million annually to operate and support thecontinental air defense force. As required by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of DefenseReorganization Act of 1986, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffrecommended in early 1993 those role and mission changes necessary toachieve maximum effectiveness of the military services.  The Chairmandetermined that the United States no longer needed a large, dedicatedair defense force because of the near disappearance of the Sovietthreat.  Consequently, the Chairman concluded that the dedicatedforce could be significantly reduced or eliminated and that existingactive and reserve general-purpose combat and training forces couldbe tasked to perform the continental air defense mission.\2 TheChairman expected that his recommendations would result insignificant savings in personnel and operating costs.  The analysisleading to the Chairman's conclusion and recommendations focused onthe forces the United States dedicates to the air defense mission. Likewise, this report discusses the roles and missions of the U.S. forces and does not include any analysis of Canadian forces. The Secretary of Defense viewed the Chairman's recommendations as atop priority.  The Secretary considered the Chairman'srecommendations and subsequently directed the Air Force to reduce theforce but retain the mission primarily as an Air Force reserveresponsibility.  In response, the Air Force devised a plan to retainthe mission within the Air National Guard as a dedicated force andreduce that force from 180 aircraft to slightly more than 2 fighterwing equivalents, thus accomplishing only a portion of what wasenvisioned by the Chairman.  The plan, while not formally endorsed bythe Secretary of Defense, is reflected in the Department's fiscalyear 1995 budget submission. --------------------\1 These levels were established as the number of fighter wingsneeded to support two simultaneous regional conflicts.  Each fighterwing has 72 combat aircraft. \2 Roles, Missions, and Functions of the Armed Forces of the UnitedStates, February 1993.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2A dedicated continental air defense force is no longer needed.  Sincethe threat of a Soviet-style air attack against the United States haslargely disappeared, the air defense force has been focusing itsactivities on air sovereignty missions.  Active and reservegeneral-purpose and training forces could perform these missionsbecause they have comparable or more capable aircraft, are located ator near most existing continental air defense bases and alert sites,and have pilots capable of performing air sovereignty missions orbeing trained to perform such missions. The Chairman's recommendations recognize the need to reassign airsovereignty missions and eliminate or sharply reduce the force nowdedicated to performing those missions to other forces.  TheSecretary's guidance and the Air Force's plan accomplish only aportion of what was envisioned by the Chairman, as summarized intable 1.                            Table 1                             Summary of the Chairman's               Recommendations, the Secretary's              Guidance, and the Air Force's PlanChairman, Joint Chiefs    Secretary ofof Staff                  Defense             Air Force------------------------  ------------------  --------------Eliminate/sharply         Reduce dedicated    Reduce thereduce dedicated          forces              number offorces                                        dedicated                                              aircraft to                                              about two                                              fighter wing                                              equivalentsDual task other active    Retain forces       Retain forcesand reserve general-      largely             in the Airpurpose                   as a reserve        National Guardand training forces       function------------------------------------------------------------Full implementation of the Chairman's recommendations would make moreoperating and support funds available to sustain general-purposeforces during this period of declining budget resources.  TheSecretary's guidance and the Air Force's plan, however, would allowthe Air National Guard to retain an excessive force structure andincur the associated operating and support costs.    A DEDICATED CONTINENTAL AIR   DEFENSE FORCE IS NO LONGER   NEEDED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3The former Soviet Union no longer poses a significant threat of abomber attack on the continental United States.  Further, internalproblems within Russia and other former Soviet Union countries haveextended the time it would take them to return to previous levels ofmilitary readiness and capabilities.  As a result, dedicated forcesthe United States once maintained exclusively to counter a Sovietattack now concentrate on air sovereignty missions, such as anti-drugsmuggling efforts.  The air sovereignty missions could be reassignedto other existing reserve or active general-purpose combat ortraining units because they (1) have comparable or better aircraft,(2) are located at or near most existing air defense units or alertsites, and (3) have pilots that possess similar skills to those usedby air defense and air sovereignty pilots.       ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN FOCUSED      ON AIR SOVEREIGNTY MISSIONS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1According to the Chairman, the air defense force was structured tointercept the former Soviet Union's long-range bomber force if itattacked over the North Pole.  Since that threat has largelydisappeared, the United States no longer needs a dedicatedcontinental air defense force, and the force has refocused itsactivity on the air sovereignty mission, concentrating onintercepting drug smugglers.  However, anti-drug smuggling activitiesat some units and alert sites have been minimal and at others almostnonexistent.  Overall, during the past 4 years, NORAD's alertfighters took off to intercept aircraft (referred to as scrambled)1,518 times, or an average of 15 times per site per year.  Of theseincidents, the number of suspected drug smuggling aircraft averagedone per site, or less than 7 percent of all of the alert sites' totalactivity.\3 The remaining activity generally involved visuallyinspecting unidentified aircraft and assisting aircraft in distress. Appendix I contains additional information on the scramble activityat each air defense unit and alert site and on the continental airdefense and air sovereignty missions. In September 1993, we reported on the justification for the amount offlying hours and steaming days the Department of Defense (DOD) usesin carrying out its drug detection and monitoring role.\4 The reportstated that DOD's efforts were part of a multiagency effort andconcluded that the government's investment does not appear to bepaying off because estimated cocaine flow has not appreciablydeclined and most drug smugglers are not interdicted. --------------------\3 These figures relate to all air defense units active during the4-year period.  Over that time, some sites were closed or operationswere transferred to other locations. \4 Drug Control:  Heavy Investment in Military Surveillance Is NotPaying Off (GAO/NSIAD-93-220,Sept.  1, 1993).       OTHER RESERVE AND ACTIVE      UNITS HAVE COMPARABLE OR      BETTER AIRCRAFT---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2General-purpose combat and training forces' aircraft, such as theF-15C, F-16C, F-14A/A+, and F/A-18A/B/C, are capable of performingthe air defense and air sovereignty missions.  These aircraft aregenerally newer and equipped with more advanced avionics than thededicated air defense force's F-16As and F-15As, which are the oldestF-16 and F-15 models in the Air Force's inventory.  For example, themore modern F-16Cs and F-15Cs have advanced radars that providegreater range and sharper resolution than those on the F-16A orF-15A.  Moreover, the F-15C has undergone a multistage improvementprogram to enhance other avionics, such as the electroniccountermeasure system and the central computer system, which resultedin greater data storage capabilities and enhanced processing speed. In addition, over 500 fighter aircraft have been designated fortraining purposes.       LOCATION OF RESERVE AND      ACTIVE UNITS WOULD ALLOW      THEM TO CARRY OUT MISSIONS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3Current air defense and alert sites are located along U.S.  bordersto provide geographic coverage.  General-purpose and training unitsin the active and reserve forces, which are located at about 50 basesthroughout the United States, could support NORAD's coveragerequirements.  In addition, several air defense force alert sites arecollocated with or close to general-purpose and training units. Therefore, dual-tasked existing general-purpose and training forceswould also be able to fulfill the air defense and air sovereigntymissions.  Figure 1 and appendix II identify the locations of airdefense units, alert sites, and general-purpose and training units.    Figure 1:  Locations of Air   Defense Units, Alert Sites, and   Active and Reserve F-14, F-15,   F-16, and F/A-18 Units   (See figure in printed   edition.)Some general-purpose and training forces might have to deploy toother locations to perform their missions.  NORAD currently deployssome air defense force aircraft to other sites to perform theirduties instead of dual-tasking collocated or nearby general-purposeunits.  For example:   The Air Force deploys F-16s from the 158th Fighter Interceptor     Group at Burlington, Vermont, to Langley Air Force Base,     Virginia.  Langley is the home of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing,     an active unit of 72 F-15Cs--the most technologically advanced     fighter in the Air Force--and its pilots are trained in the     air-to-air mission, which closely resembles the air defense     pilots' training.   The 148th Fighter Interceptor Group, Duluth, Minnesota, deploys to     Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, home of the 325th Fighter Wing.      This wing trains F-15 pilots and has 72 F-15C aircraft.   The Air Force deploys air defense force F-16As from the 120th     Fighter Interceptor Group, Great Falls, Montana, to     Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona.  Davis-Monthan is     the home of the 162nd Tactical Fighter Group, which has 46 F-16     aircraft and pilots trained in the air-to-air mission.       SKILLS FOR AIR DEFENSE AND      ACTIVE AND RESERVE PILOTS      ARE COMPARABLE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.4The skills required by pilots in the air defense force are, inseveral ways, comparable or similar enough to those required bypilots in general-purpose squadrons.  For example, bothgeneral-purpose and air defense pilots are required to be proficientin skills such as day or night target intercepts, defense of an area,aerial gunnery, and quick takeoffs or intercepts.  However, someskills are unique to either general-purpose or air defense pilots. For example, skills needed for composite force training and jointmaritime operations are needed by general-purpose units but are notnecessary for all air defense force pilots.  Likewise, skills such asslow shadow day or night visual identification are needed by airdefense and air sovereignty pilots so that they can identify andtrack unknown aircraft, but these skills are not needed bygeneral-purpose pilots.  However, despite the missions' unique pilotrequirements, enough training similarities would allow dual-taskedgeneral-purpose squadrons to accomplish the air defense and airsovereignty missions.    THE CHAIRMAN'S RECOMMENDATIONS   COULD SAVE COSTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's recommendations couldresult in significant cost savings.  If existing general-purpose andtraining forces were tasked to accomplish the air defense and airsovereignty missions, force structure and associated costs could bereduced.  The amount of savings would depend on whether the dedicatedair defense units were disbanded or assigned another mission.  If allthe air defense units were disbanded, the Air Force could save asmuch as $370 million in annual operation, maintenance, and personnelcosts. To accomplish the added responsibility, existing active and reserveunits may need additional resources, such as aircraft for alertduties.  The cost associated with these aircraft could be offset if acorresponding dedicated air defense unit were disbanded.  Forexample, the dual-tasked F-15 general-purpose unit at the Naval AirStation, New Orleans, Louisiana, has 24 combat aircraft instead ofthe usual 18 aircraft assigned to F-15 units that are not dualtasked.  These aircraft cost about $46 million annually, or about $6million more than those in units with 18 aircraft.  However, if dualtasking a 24-combat aircraft Air National Guard unit would eliminatea dedicated air defense F-15 unit costing over $42 million, then over$36 million would be saved.    THE AIR FORCE'S PLAN WOULD NOT   ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT COST   SAVINGS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Since the Secretary of Defense's guidance and the Air Force's planwould retain the air defense mission as a largely dedicated AirNational Guard responsibility and only reduce the dedicated forcestructure, significant cost savings would not be achieved.  The AirForce estimates that its plan to slightly reduce the dedicated forceby retiring some aircraft at each of the 10 Air National Guard unitswould save about $36.5 million annually in operations and supportcosts.  Thus, the Air Force would still incur significant personnel,operating, and support costs, since the Air Force would continue tooperate and maintain all 10 dedicated NORAD air defense units.  Theplan, while not formally endorsed by the Secretary of Defense, isreflected in DOD's fiscal year 1995 budget submission.    RECOMMENDATION------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6We recommend that the Secretary of Defense not approve the AirForce's plan unless it is modified (1) to eliminate or sharply reducethe dedicated air defense force and (2) to reassign the air defensemission to active and reserve general-purpose and training units.    AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR   EVALUATION------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7DOD provided comments on a draft of this report, which appear inappendix III.  Although it mostly concurred with the facts discussedin the draft report, DOD took issue with some of the analysis andconclusions drawn from those facts and did not concur with therecommendation.  In commenting on the draft report, DOD noted that(1) the Chairman's recommendation was based on an Air Forceconsisting of 26-1/2 fighter wings, (2) air sovereignty and acapacity to regenerate a continental air defense force remain acritical function of the Air Force, and (3) it has taken steps toappropriately size the available force. According to DOD, the Bottom-Up Review required the Air Force tomaintain forces at a sufficient level to respond to two nearlysimultaneous major regional conflicts and that 20 fighter wings wouldbe necessary to meet that requirement.  DOD further stated that forcerequirements for the air sovereignty mission were not included in thelevel required to meet major regional conflicts.  That is, theanalysis supporting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Rolesand Missions report was based on the Air Force maintaining 26-1/2fighter wings.  Force structure reductions would result in a decreaseto 20 fighter wings.  Thus, under the most demanding circumstances inwhich the Air Force would have to deploy all 20 fighter wings, noforces would be available to fulfill the air sovereignty mission. DOD agreed that eliminating all dedicated air defense units wouldresult in significant net savings but also noted that someincremental costs would be incurred in dual tasking other units.  DODalso commented that a dedicated force capable of performing airsovereignty missions could help deter illegal airborne activity. However, our September 1993 report on drug control efforts noted thatthe continental air defense force might be ineffective in detecting,monitoring, and apprehending drug smugglers because directdrug-smuggling flights into the United States essentially ended yearsago and jet fighter aircraft cannot effectively track slow,low-flying, drug-smuggling planes. The analysis in the Chairman's Roles and Missions report was clearlybased on the threat of a Soviet-style bomber attack on North America. The decline in that threat led to the Chairman's recommendation thata dedicated continental air defense force was no longer needed. However, the Air Force has proposed to maintain essentially the sameframework historically used to defend against a Soviet-style bomberattack. We are not recommending that all capability to protect U.S.  airspacebe eliminated.  We agree with the Chairman's recommendations toassign the mission to existing Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corpsgeneral-purpose and training squadrons and eliminate or sharplyreduce the dedicated forces currently associated with continental airdefense. We recognize that the Bottom-Up Review recommended that the Air Forcemaintain 20 fighter wings for responding to two nearly simultaneousmajor regional conflicts.  However, during peacetime, while mostgeneral-purpose forces are not deployed, the air sovereignty mission could beaccomplished using general-purpose and training forces.  If the mostdemanding circumstances were to arise and all 20 fighter wings wereneeded overseas, over 500 nondeployable training forces could beused, as is now planned, to protect U.S.  airspace.  This is morethan three times the number of aircraft dedicated for that purposeduring peacetime.  DOD provided no evidence that implementing therecommendation concerning dual tasking general-purpose and trainingforces would, under the most demanding circumstances, force theNational Command Authority to choose between deploying insufficientforces or leaving U.S.  airspace unprotected.    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8We initiated this review as part of our legislative responsibilityand as a result of findings from our ongoing review of the AirForce's fighter support aircraft.  We analyzed the air defensemission in regard to current military and nonmilitary threats, theavailability and compatibility of other forces to be dual tasked toperform the mission, and the reductions in defense budgets and forcestructure. We visited the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Headquarters, Air National GuardBureau Headquarters, and Defense Intelligence Agency, all inWashington, D.C.  Additionally, we visited the North AmericanAerospace Defense Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs,Colorado; the Air Combat Command Headquarters, Langley Air ForceBase, Virginia; the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic, Norfolk,Virginia; the Naval Air Reserves Headquarters, Naval SupportActivity, New Orleans, Louisiana; the 1st Air Force Headquarters,NORAD's Southeast Sector Operations Control Center, and Air DefenseForces' F-15 training facilities, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida;the Air Defense Forces' F-16 training facilities, Kingsley Field,Klamath Falls, Oregon; and the 159th Fighter Group, Naval AirStation, New Orleans, Louisiana. We also visited the following continental air defense units and alertsites collocated within the units:  the 102nd Fighter InterceptorWing, Otis, Massachusetts; 144th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fresno,California;119th Fighter Interceptor Group, Fargo, North Dakota; 125th FighterInterceptor Group, Jacksonville, Florida; 142nd Fighter InterceptorGroup, Portland, Oregon; 148th Fighter Interceptor Group, Duluth,Minnesota;147th Fighter Interceptor Group, Ellington, Texas; 158th FighterInterceptor Group, Burlington, Vermont; 177th Fighter InterceptorGroup, Atlantic City, New Jersey; and 120th Fighter InterceptorGroup, Great Falls, Montana. While NORAD is a joint U.S.-Canadian command, we limited our reviewto U.S.  air defense forces only. We conducted our review from June 1992 to July 1993 in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.1We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defenseand the Air Force, the Director of the Office of Management andBudget, and other appropriate congressional committees.

Richard DavisDirector, National Security AnalysisTHE CONTINENTAL AIR DEFENSEMISSION'S TRANSITION TO THEPOST-COLD WAR ENVIRONMENT=========================================================== Appendix IThe protection of continental skies is the responsibility of theNorth American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which is comprisedof U.S.  and Canadian air forces.  NORAD's mission of continentalprotection involves controlling sovereign airspace, assessing andwarning of enemy air or missile attack, and intercepting or engagingsuch threats.  This mission is supported by an extensive network ofground-, air-, and space-based radars, sensors, and satellites, aswell as up-to-date threat intelligence.  NORAD maintains a core forceof air defense fighter squadrons to provide protection in the eventof an attack.  A number of these interceptors are on 24-hour alert atlocations along the U.S.  border to identify and intercept unknownaircraft or objects.  In addition, two alert sites are located inAlaska.  The aircraft at these sites are provided by the 3rd FighterWing, a dual-tasked active air force F-15 unit stationed at ElmendorfAir Force Base, Alaska. The continental air defense mission, with its dedicated force,evolved as a direct result of the growth of the Soviet long-rangebomber fleet in the post-World War II environment and the detonationof a Soviet atomic bomb in 1949.  NORAD was established in 1957 byCanada and the United States to intercept any Soviet long-rangebombers attacking over the North Pole.  Canada and the United Statesalso built three radar networks across the continent to give 2 to 3hours warning of bomber attacks.  The operation of these extensivenetworks required daily coordination on tactical matters andconsiderable merging of plans, so an integrated command wasestablished at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado,to centralize operational control of air defense.  By 1960, NORADmaintained approximately 1,200 interceptors dedicated to counteringSoviet bombers. During the 1960s, the character of the military threat changed as theSoviets focused on intercontinental and sea-launched ballisticmissiles and developed an anti-satellite capability.  In response,the United States built a space-based surveillance andmissile-warning system to detect and track airborne threatsworldwide.  NORAD was given responsibility for this system, therebyadding to its mission the tactical assessment and warning of apossible air, missile, or space attack on North America. The effectiveness of NORAD's air defense system was first questionedin the early 1960s, when the Soviets shifted reliance from mannedbombers to ballistic missiles.  The Secretary of Defense at that timebelieved that current air defenses would limit damage only marginallyin a nuclear attack by long-range ballistic and submarine-launchedmissiles.  In his opinion, the existing interceptor force wasexcessive in relation to the diminished bomber threat.  On the basisof this change in threat and on budget considerations, the Departmentof Defense (DOD) reduced the number of NORAD interceptors toapproximately 300 aircraft by the mid-1970s. With the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of theWarsaw Pact in 1991, the military threat upon which NORAD had basedits core structure had again changed significantly.  Likewise, theCuban threat was declining, and other military threats did notapproach that of the Soviets during the Cold War. NORAD recognized this drastic reduction in the military threat anddetermined that sufficient warning time existed to reconstituteforces needed to meet a re-emerging threat of the magnitude of theformer Soviet Union.  Consequently, NORAD revised the justificationfor its core forces, emphasizing peacetime air sovereignty. According to a recent NORAD strategy review,"The dramatically changed threat and .  .  .  development ofpost-Cold War defense policies suggest real possibilities forshifting NORAD's focus from deterring massive nuclear attack todefending both nations [Canada and the United States] by maintainingair sovereignty .  .  .  .  The size of the core force would equateto that required to perform the peacetime Air Sovereignty mission."NORAD defines air sovereignty as providing surveillance and controlof the territorial airspace, which includes:   intercepting and destroying uncontrollable air objects;  tracking hijacked aircraft;  assisting aircraft in distress;  escorting Communist civil aircraft; and  intercepting suspect aircraft, including counterdrug operations and     peacetime military intercepts. Of these tasks, NORAD considers intercepting drug smugglers the mostserious.  Under 10 U.S.C.  124, DOD is designated the single leadagency for detecting and monitoring air and maritime shipments ofillegal drugs to the United States.\1DOD gave NORAD the responsibility for intercepting suspected airbornedrug smugglers.  However, only 7 percent of NORAD fighter interceptsfrom 1989-92 were drug related (see table I.1). NORAD plans to reduce the number of alert sites in the continentalUnited States to 14 and provide 28 aircraft for the day-to-daypeacetime air sovereignty mission.  Each alert site will have twofighters, and their crews will be on 24-hour duty and ready toscramble within 5 minutes.

Despite the fact that halfof them qualify for benefits on the basis of their addiction alone, mostaddicts are not required to be in treatment.  Finding qualifiedrepresentative payees to manage addicts' benefits has been along-standing problem for the Social Security Administration.  Mostpayees are either friends or relatives.  In the absence of tightcontrols, addicts are free to buy drugs and alcohol to maintain theiraddictions.  GAO believes that organizational payees would be in abetter position to provide the strict controls needed over benefitpayments to addicts.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  T-HEHS-94-101     TITLE:  Social Security: Disability Benefits for Drug Addicts and              Alcoholics Are Out of Control      DATE:  02/10/94   SUBJECT:  Disability benefits             Social security benefits             Program management             Alcohol abuse             Drug treatment             Handicapped persons             Drug abuse             Questionable payments             Eligibility criteria             Internal controlsIDENTIFIER:  Social Security Disability Insurance Program             Supplemental Security Income Program             SSI Drug Addiction and Alcoholism Program             Medicaid Program             California             Texas             Florida             Michigan             Washington             ------------------------------------------------------------------------We regret that electronic text of GAO Testimony is not available at this time.

Roth, Jr.ChairmanCommittee on FinanceUnited States SenateThe Honorable Nancy Landon KassebaumChairmanCommittee on Labor and Human ResourcesUnited States SenateThe Honorable Bill ArcherChairmanCommittee on Ways and MeansHouse of RepresentativesThe Honorable Bill GoodlingChairmanCommittee on Economic and Educational OpportunitiesHouse of RepresentativesIn 1993, more than 1 million American children suffered some abuse orneglect.\1 One in six of these children were removed from home fortheir protection and temporarily placed in foster care.  Both thechildren remaining home and those placed in foster care were eligiblefor services to help them deal with their family situation, obtainmedical treatment, or meet other critical needs.  By the end of 1993,an estimated 450,000 children were in foster care, more than in anyother year since the mid-1970s. States provide the majority of funds for foster care and childwelfare services.  Even so, the federal share of expenditures reached$4.1 billion in 1995.  These federal funds come primarily from twosources, one an open-ended entitlement and the other limited toannual appropriations.  Under title IV-E of the Social Security Act,open-ended funds are available to states for the maintenance (food,shelter, and incidentals) of all foster children meeting certainincome and other criteria.  Title IV-B of the act provides separatefunds to states for child welfare services for abused and neglectedchildren who remain in their homes or are placed in foster care. These services include helping families to resolve their problems andreferring families for specialized help, such as substance abusetreatment. The Congress is currently considering sweeping changes to programsdesigned to support children and families.  Among these changes is aproposal to replace many child welfare programs, including fostercare, with a block grant.  To assist the Congress in itsdeliberations, this report presents an overview of the foster caresystem and related child welfare services.  Specifically, we addressthe following questions:   What are recent trends in the characteristics of the foster care     population?   Have resources for foster care and child welfare services kept pace     with changing needs?   How are states responding to current foster care and other service     needs? To develop this information, we drew upon our past reports on fostercare and related child welfare issues (see list of Related GAOProducts in app.  V) and reviewed reports by government and otherorganizations as well as position papers and written testimony fromwitnesses at congressional hearings.  In addition, we interviewednational experts and researchers in the child welfare area, childwelfare advocates, representatives of public interest groups,government officials in selected states and localities, and federalofficials (see app.  I).  Our work was performed between March andJuly 1995. --------------------\1 The most recent year for which data are available is 1993.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Between 1983 and 1993, sharp increases in the number of fosterchildren combined with unprecedented service needs led to a crisis infoster care.  Reports of child abuse and neglect nearly doubled, andfoster care caseloads grew by two-thirds.  Demands for child welfareservices grew not only because the number of foster childrenincreased but also because families and children were more troubledand had more complex needs than in the past.  In Los Angeles County,New York City, and Philadelphia County, for example, 29 percent ofpreschool-age foster children in 1986 were at risk of health problemsdue to prenatal drug exposure; this rose to 62 percent in 1991. Meanwhile, resources for child welfare services failed to keep pacewith the needs of troubled children and their families.  While fostercare funding has increased dramatically at all levels of government,federal funding for child welfare services has lagged.  States andlocalities have found it difficult to meet the demand, although theyhave more than tripled expenditures in some cases.  Federal fostercare funds generally cannot be transferred to support child welfareservices, and available state funds are increasingly being spent onchild abuse and neglect investigations.  The effect has been tofurther constrain resources for preventive and rehabilitative childwelfare services that offer some promise of containing growth infoster care caseloads. Faced with increasing demands and limited resources, states haveadopted various measures to meet the needs of troubled children andtheir families while maintaining children's safety.  Many states nowoffer family preservation services or place children with relativesto maintain family ties and save money.  States are also increasinglyconsidering the use of specialized foster homes for children withunique problems, including emotionally disturbed and medicallyfragile children, to provide more family-like care at lower coststhan institutions, where such children are typically placed.  Ifstates can save foster care costs, they may be able to transfer statefunds to support child welfare services.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2Foster care is an integral part of a child welfare system designed toensure the safety and well-being of children whose families are notproviding adequate care for them.  Foster care provides primarilyfood and housing to meet the physical needs of children who areremoved from their homes.  Child welfare services are designed toaddress the complex family problems associated with children's abuse,neglect, exploitation, or delinquency.  In providing child welfareservices, caseworkers may also refer children and their families tomental health agencies, medical facilities, or elsewhere forspecialized treatment and services. Child welfare services are critical in helping prevent the need forfoster care as well as in achieving appropriate and stable permanentliving arrangements for children placed in foster care.  Most statesand counties provide some child welfare services directly andpurchase others from private agencies.  Available services varyconsiderably from one area to another in number, type, intensity, andduration, although calls and visits with caseworkers are consideredessential in most areas. Children generally enter foster care for their own protection becausetheir parents will not or cannot take care of them.\2 When problemssuch as abuse or neglect are identified, the child welfare system mayintervene with services designed to improve the situation and avoidremoving children from their homes.  If such services cannot ensurechildren's safety and well-being in their homes, the child welfaresystem petitions the court to place children in foster care, eitherin the homes of relatives or nonfamily foster parents, group homes,or institutions. Foster care provided by relatives, who are often grandmothers, isknown as kinship care.  States may choose whether to licenserelatives as foster parents and provide foster care payments.  On theother hand, states require nonfamily foster parents to be licensedand pay them an average of $8 to $15 a day per child for food,housing, and incidental expenses.  States also license group homesand institutions to provide care by paid staff.  These homes receivean average of $100 a day per child for food, housing, and overheadexpenses.\3 Foster care is a temporary solution until children can bereturned safely to their parents, adopted, or placed in some otherpermanent living arrangement; however, some children remain in fostercare until their eligibility for foster care assistance expires,generally at age 18. Under federal law, states must provide foster care if theyparticipate in Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), thelargest federal welfare program providing cash assistance to poorfamilies.  States receive federal matching funds for about half ofall foster children because these children would have qualified forAFDC had they remained in their homes.  For the other half, statesand localities are the sole source of government support.  Inaddition, states and localities supply the majority of governmentfunds for child welfare services.  Many states directly administerfoster care and child welfare, but nearly one-third delegate thisauthority to their counties, including several states with thelargest caseloads--California, Pennsylvania, and New York. Two titles under the Social Security Act provide federal fundingtargeted specifically to foster care and related child welfareservices.\4 (See app.  II.) Title IV-E provides an open-endedindividual entitlement for foster care maintenance payments to covera portion of the food, housing, and incidental expenses of childrenfrom AFDC-eligible families.  Title IV-E also provides payments toadoptive parents of eligible minority foster children or others withspecial needs, such as health problems, that may make adoptive homesmore difficult to find.  Title IV-B provides limited or "capped"funding for child welfare services to foster children as well aschildren remaining in their homes. In 1995, total IV-E funding was $3.6 billion and total IV-B fundingwas $453 million, representing about 97 percent of all federalfunding targeted to child welfare and protection, including fostercare.  Another nine programs provided an additional $136 million infederal funds to states for activities designed to protect the safetyand well-being of children. Under the Child Protection Block Grant passed by the House in 1995,foster care and the other child welfare programs would be replaced bya single block grant to states with capped funding.  (See apps.  IIIand IV.) In addition, proposals for an AFDC block grant would capfederal funding and repeal AFDC eligibility rules that currentlyenable states to claim IV-E foster care funds.  Further, the AFDCblock could affect the amount of federal funds states would receivefor IV-E foster care if it makes certain categories of childrenineligible for AFDC and all children ineligible for AFDC after 5years of assistance. --------------------\2 Other children enter care because they represent a danger tothemselves, their families, or their communities. \3 Cost estimates are for 1990 as reported in Overview of EntitlementPrograms:  1994 Green Book, Committee on Ways and Means, U.S.  Houseof Representatives (Washington, D.C.:  1994). \4 Title XX provides funds under the social services block grant thatmay be used for many purposes, including child welfare.  See FosterCare:  Services to Prevent Out-of-Home Placements Are Limited byFunding Barriers (GAO/HRD-93-76, June 29, 1993).    RECENT TRENDS HAVE LED TO A   FOSTER CARE CRISIS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3Current trends in the number and needs of foster children have led toa crisis in the child welfare system.  The number of reports of abuseand neglect and the number of children removed from home and placedin foster care for their protection have grown alarmingly.  Also,compared with the foster children of 10 years ago, today's fosterchildren have characteristics associated with longer stays in fostercare and greater service needs.  Although stays in foster care formost children are less than 1 year, permanent placements followingfoster care are delayed or unstable for a significant minority ofchildren.       REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND      NEGLECT HAVE INCREASED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1An estimated 2.3 million children were reported possible victims ofabuse or neglect in 1993.\5 Although the number of reports has nearlydoubled since 1983, the rate of increase has shown signs of levelingoff since 1990.  The increased reporting has been due, in part, toheightened public awareness and state laws mandating reports fromprofessionals who see children on a daily basis.\6Meanwhile, the incidence of poverty and substance abuse, factorsassociated with abuse and neglect, were also at relatively highlevels during this period. Upon investigation, child welfare workers confirmed abuse or neglectof 1 million children in 1993.\7 Although child abuse and neglect aremore likely to be reported today than 10 years ago, whether childrenare as likely to be removed from their homes is not clear.  Expertsbelieve that as a result of increased demands, strained resources,and efforts to strengthen families, child welfare agencies arecurrently reevaluating conditions in the family and neighborhood thatformerly might have been grounds for the child's removal.  Most ofthe 1 million abused or neglected children remained in their homes. However, about 15 percent were considered in imminent danger andplaced in foster care.  Most children who enter foster care do sobecause of abuse; neglect; inadequate care due to parental absence;or conditions, such as illness or financial difficulty, as shown infigure 1.    Figure 1:  Reasons Children   Entered Foster Care, 1990   (See figure in printed   edition.)Notes:  "Protective service" includes children who entered carebecause of abuse or neglect reported to child protective services."Parent condition or absence" includes children who entered carebecause of absence, illness, death, handicap, financial hardship, orother condition of the parent(s)."Status offense/delinquent" includes children who entered carebecause of (1) status offenses, such as running away or truancy, or(2) delinquent behavior."Other" includes children who entered care for such reasons asparent-child relationship problems, child's handicap, a plan foradoption, deinstitutionalization, and unwed motherhood.

About half of the children were under 8years of age, a quarter under 4.  Neglect was more common amongyounger children; physical abuse, among boys under 12 or girls over12; and sexual abuse, among girls.  (See footnote 5.)      FOSTER CARE CASELOADS HAVE      REACHED RECORD LEVELS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2By 1993, an estimated 450,000 U.S.  children--more than at any othertime in two decades--were in foster care.  This represents atwo-thirds increase in the foster care caseload since 1983, as shownin figure 2.  The growth in foster care caseloads occurred becausemore children entered than left care in each year between 1983 and1993.  This trend was especially noticeable between 1987 and 1990,when the number of children entering care increased the most.  Sincepeaking in 1990, the number of children entering care has leveledoff.    Figure 2:  Foster Care   Caseloads, 1983-1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  APWA VCIS. Meanwhile, the number of foster children who were eligible forfederal matching funds, by virtue of their family's eligibility forAFDC, grew by a larger percentage than the number of foster childrenin general.  In 1993, about half of all children in foster care wereeligible for federal matching funds under title IV-E.  California andNew York, the two states with the largest foster care caseloads,accounted for one-third of all foster children and much of theincrease in title IV-E eligible children.       MORE MINORITY AND YOUNG      CHILDREN ARE IN CARE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3Although trends in the characteristics of foster children vary bystate, since 1983, foster children increasingly have come fromminority groups and have been younger.  The 1990 foster carepopulation consisted of 40 percent African Americans and 11 percentHispanics compared with 39 percent whites.\8 Not only are moreminorities entering, but, once placed in foster care, AfricanAmerican and Hispanic children remain longer and leave at slowerrates than whites.\9 African American children, in particular, aredisproportionately represented in foster care, as shown in figure 3,and, if the trend continues, caseloads may increasingly consist ofminority children removed from their homes for prolonged stays infoster care.    Figure 3:  Proportion of White   and African American Children   in General Population and   Foster Care, 1990   (See figure in printed   edition.)Sources:  For the general population, U.S.  Census Bureau,Statistical Abstracts; for the foster care population, APWA VCIS datafrom 31 states. Also by 1990, the average median age of children in foster care haddropped from 12.6 to 8.6 years of age,\10 as the percentage ofpreschoolers increased by 50 percent and the percentage of teensdeclined (see fig.  4).  The increase in infants entering the systemis particularly striking.  Although the majority of foster childrenentered the system between the ages of 1 and 12, the percentage ofchildren entering care who were under 1 year increased by two-thirdsfrom 1983 to 1990, leading to a foster care "baby boom." Further,infants are staying in foster care longer than any other age group,and as their time in care increases, their chance of being adopteddecreases.\11   Figure 4:  Foster Children by   Age, 1983-1990   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  APWA VCIS.  Number of states responding in each year is 30(fiscal year 1983), 33 (fiscal year 1984), 32 (fiscal year 1985), 33(fiscal year 1986), 26 (fiscal year 1987), 26 (fiscal year 1988), 27(fiscal year 1989), 23 (fiscal year 1990).  Nine states gave data inall 8 years. --------------------\8 1990 is the most recent year for which nationwide data oncharacteristics are available from the American Public WelfareAssociation's (APWA) Voluntary Cooperative Information System (VCIS),the major source of nationwide information on foster care. \9 Toshio Tatara, A Comparison of Child Substitute Care Exit RatesAmong Three Different Racial/Ethnic Groups in 12 States, FY 84 to FY90, APWA, Research Note #10 (Washington, D.C.:  June 1994). \10 APWA VCIS. \11 R.M.

Harden, Foster CareDynamics 1983-1993:  An Update from the Multistate Foster Care DataArchive, The Chapin Hall Center for Children, University of Chicago(Chicago:  1995).       FOSTER CHILDREN HAVE GREATER      SERVICE NEEDS THAN IN THE      PAST---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.4Children are also entering care from families more troubled than inthe past and with greater emotional, behavioral, and medical needs. Such families today more often face economic hardship, substanceabuse, homelessness, mental or physical illness, or the imprisonmentof a family member.  In Los Angeles County, New York City, andPhiladelphia County in 1991, over half of the preschool-age fosterchildren were estimated to have serious health-related problems,including developmental delays, low birth weight, heart problems, andhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  An estimated 62percent of the preschool-age foster children were at risk of serioushealth problems due to prenatal drug exposure, more than double the29 percent at risk of such problems in 1986.\12Children with these complex needs require a variety ofcommunity-based services and a level of care not required in thepast.  A California study found that foster children were 10 timesmore likely to use mental health services than other children onMedicaid and that they were hospitalized for mental conditions almosttwice as long.\13For this reason, while foster children constituted only 4 percent ofCalifornia children on Medicaid they accounted for 40 percent of allMedicaid mental health expenditures. --------------------\12 See Foster Care:  Parental Drug Abuse Has Alarming Impact onYoung Children (GAO/HEHS-94-89, Apr.  4, 1994). \13 N.  Halfon, G.  Berlowitz, L.  Klee, "Children in Foster Care inCalifornia:  An Examination of Medicaid-Reimbursed Health ServicesUtilization," Vol.  89 Pediatrics (1992), pp.  1230-37.       PERMANENT LIVING      ARRANGEMENTS FOLLOWING      FOSTER CARE MAY BE DELAYED      OR UNSTABLE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.5Children who leave foster care are increasingly returned home whencaseworkers consider it safe.  About 67 percent of children leavingcare in 1990 returned to their families (see fig.  5), up from 56percent in 1983.  Meanwhile, the percentage of children adopteddeclined from 12 to 8 percent.    Figure 5:  Disposition of   Children Leaving Foster Care,   1990   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  "Other" includes such reasons as placement with a legalguardian, marriage, running away, incarceration, death, or dischargeto another public agency. Source:  APWA VCIS data from 24 states. Although foster care is a relatively short-term experience for manychildren, some children remain in care for extended periods.  Of thechildren leaving care in 1990, for example, 50 percent had been infoster care for 8 months or less.  However, of those remaining incare, over 25 percent had been in foster placements for at least 3years.  (See fig.  6.) Foster children for whom adoption isultimately planned spend an average of 4 to 6 years in foster care,according to a 1991 report on adoptions in 20 states.\14   Figure 6:  Length of Stay in   Foster Care at the End of 1990   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  APWA VCIS data from 22 states. The shorter the initial stay in foster care, the more likely itappears that children who are reunited with their parents willreenter care.\15 In Los Angeles County and New York City, forexample, 32 percent of children whose initial stay in foster care wasless than 1 year later returned to care, compared with 16 percent ofchildren whose initial stay was 1 year or longer. Youths who leave foster care at age 18 because they are no longereligible may experience unstable and troubled lives.  A studyconducted 2.5 to 4 years after youths left foster care found that 46percent had not completed high school, 38 percent had not held a jobfor more than 1 year, 25 percent had been homeless for at least onenight, and 60 percent of young women had given birth to a child.\16Forty percent had been on public assistance, incarcerated, or a costto the community in some other way. --------------------\14 See J.K.

RESOURCES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE   WITH SERVICE NEEDS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4The child welfare system has been under great pressure to meetincreased demands.  States and localities provide the majority offunding for foster care and child welfare services.  From 1983 to1993, rising caseloads have increased federal, state, and localexpenditures for foster care dramatically, leaving proportionatelyless for child welfare services.  Federal foster care funds cannot beused to pay for most child welfare services, and available statefunds are increasingly required for investigations of abuse andneglect reports.  As a result, states have found it difficult toensure that child welfare services are sufficiently funded to meetneeds.  Other resource constraints have included problems recruitingand retaining caseworkers, shortages of available foster parents, anddifficulties obtaining needed services from systems outside thecontrol of child welfare.       FOSTER CARE EXPENDITURES      HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY      AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1With increasing foster care caseloads, expenditures for the basicneeds of foster children and program administration have risendramatically at all levels of government.  Federal expenditures grewfaster than state expenditures in three of the largest states from1983 to 1993.  Nevertheless, as of 1990, states and localitiescontinued to fund about 65 percent of all foster care. Federal costs of foster care maintenance increased by over 350percent (see table 1) from 1983 to 1993 in California and New York,which approaches the nationwide increase of nearly 400 percent forthis period.  (See fig.  7.)   Figure 7:  Expenditures for   Title IV-E Foster Care   Maintenance and Title IV-B   Child Welfare Services,   1983-1993   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  Overview of Entitlement Programs; 1994 Green Book, Committeeon Ways and Means, U.S.  House of Representatives. The rapid rise in federal foster care expenditures has been linked toseveral simultaneous developments:  States have increased efforts todetermine children's eligibility for federal funds; more childrenhave become eligible under AFDC rules for IV-E assistance; andpayments to providers have increased in most states.  Further,federal administrative costs\17 have increased over the same periodas states have increasingly emphasized the case management andplacement activities required by federal law (see app.  IV) andsought full reimbursement for these activities.  By 1993, nearly $1.1billion in IV-E reimbursement went to states for foster careadministrative activities, almost as much as the $1.3 billion thatwent for foster care maintenance in that year.\18At the state level, foster care expenditures also rose between 1983and 1993.  For example, California and New York increasedexpenditures for foster care maintenance payments by about 200percent, while Michigan's expenditures doubled, as shown in table1.\19                                Table 1                                  Changes in Foster Care Caseloads and                 Related Expenditures in Three States,                               1983-1993                                                Califo  Michig     New                                                  rnia      an    York----------------------------------------------  ------  ------  ------Foster care caseload growth                       119%     50%    108%Foster care maintenance expenditures----------------------------------------------------------------------State and local                                    258     112     183Federal IV-E                                       381     146     356Child welfare services expenditures----------------------------------------------------------------------State and local                                  309\a     213     239Federal IV-B                                       131      80   -14\b----------------------------------------------------------------------\a Percent change from 1985 to 1992.  Data for other years are notavailable. \b The allocation formula under IV-B reduced New York's grant from$18 million to $15.5 million. Because of fiscal difficulties states experienced in the early1990s,\20 they looked to localities and the federal government toassume greater shares of foster care costs.  California, Michigan,and New York, for example, are among the states that increased theportion of foster care maintenance payments supported by local funds. Faced with a $14 billion budget deficit in 1992, California increasedcounties' portion of foster care maintenance payments by 1,100percent. --------------------\17 Expenditures for administrative activities include costs requiredto recruit and license foster homes, determine children's title IV-Eeligibility, and manage cases (see app.  II). \18 Overview of Entitlement Programs:  1994 Green Book. \19 State and local expenditure data are not routinely reported.  Weobtained this information directly from the three states shown. These states include the two with the nation's largestcaseloads--California and New York. \20 This is according to fiscal surveys of states conducted by theNational Association of State Budget Officers and the NationalGovernors' Association.       AVAILABLE FUNDING AND      COMPETING DEMANDS CONSTRAIN      CHILD WELFARE SERVICES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2Available funding and competing demands from other activities haveconstrained resources available for child welfare services.  Despiteincreasing appropriations, the federal government spent about $.12 onchild welfare services in 1993 for every $1 it spent on foster care,as compared with about $.40 in 1983.  While states and localitieshave continued to provide the majority of funds for child welfareservices, they have found it increasingly difficult to maintainsufficient funding levels to ensure that needs are met. At the national level, title IV-B appropriations increased 88 percentfrom 1983 through 1993, lagging behind increases in federal fostercare maintenance costs, as shown in figure 7.\21 Increases in federalexpenditures for child welfare services also lagged behind state andlocal expenditure growth during this period. State and local expenditures for services rose dramatically from theearly 1980s to the early 1990s and represented over half of allfunding as of 1990.  In California, Michigan, and New York, state andlocal expenditures for child welfare services increased by over 200percent (see table 1).  Meanwhile, federal IV-B funding forCalifornia and Michigan increased at half these rates and in New Yorkactually decreased by 14 percent. Although federal law requires the provision of direct child welfareservices to children and families, these services generally cannot besupported with federal funds designated for foster care.\22 Availablestate funds, meanwhile, have been stretched to the limit to coverincreasing demands from other activities.  Most notably, risingreports of abuse and neglect have led states to devote more resourcesto investigating reports, leaving less for providing services. Because of constrained resources and competing demands, states havenot been able to ensure that child welfare services are sufficient tomeet needs.  For example, an APWA survey of agencies in every statefound that services were limited and generally involved managing,rather than treating, families and their abused or neglectedchildren.  Since 1987, children's advocates have successfully filedclass action lawsuits on behalf of children against eight states,obtaining court orders to improve child welfare services, and similarcases are pending in other states.\23--------------------\21 The Congress authorized a new IV-B program for familypreservation and support services designed to prevent the need forfoster care and appropriated $60 million for start-up activities in1994. \22 AFDC funds for emergency assistance to families have been usedfor services, particularly since 1993.  See Review of Rising Costs inthe Emergency Assistance Program, Department of Health and HumanServices, Office of the Inspector General (Washington, D.C.:  1995). \23 The eight states are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, District ofColumbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, and Utah.       SHORTAGES OF CASEWORKERS AND      FOSTER PARENTS FURTHER      STRAIN SERVICE DELIVERY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3Next to funding, states report that staffing is the most seriousissue facing their child welfare systems.  In response to an APWAsurvey, 90 percent of states reported difficulty recruiting andretaining caseworkers.  Caseworkers are at the heart of the fostercare system, visiting children and families in their homes andarranging services to help prevent the need to remove children fromtheir homes, or, in case of their removal, to find permanent livingarrangements for foster children.  Caseworkers also coordinatecontacts among families and children with health, mental health, andother service systems. State officials attributed difficulties in recruiting and retainingcaseworkers to several factors, including hiring freezes, low pay,and poor working conditions.  These factors, in turn, led to staffshortages, high caseloads, and high burnout and turnover rates amongcaseworkers.  In some jurisdictions, caseloads have reached 100 casesper caseworker, well above the 25 per caseworker recommended by theNational Association of Social Workers.  In New York City, annualturnover rates for caseworkers have been as high as 75 percent, sothat each year most foster children, who have suffered from unstablefamilies, get a new caseworker. Foster parents are the other essential component of an effectiveservice delivery system, but the supply of foster parents has laggedbehind the growth in the foster care caseload.  While the number ofchildren in foster care has increased, the number of foster homes hasdecreased.\24Child welfare experts attribute this growing shortage of foster homesto several factors, including the poor public image of foster care,low reimbursement rates, inadequate support services, greaterdifficulties caring for today's more troubled foster children, andincreased employment opportunities for women.  In some states, theshortage of foster homes is so great that children are placed intemporary shelters or shuttled from one place to another until aproper home can be found, according to the National Foster ParentAssociation. --------------------\24 See Foster Parents:  Recruiting and Preservice Training PracticesNeed Evaluation (GAO/HRD-89-86, Aug.  3, 1989).       FRAGMENTED SERVICE DELIVERY      SYSTEM EXACERBATES PROBLEM---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.4Difficulties providing families and children with services also arisebecause many needs must be met by services, such as medical care anddrug treatment, that are outside the control of the child welfaresystem.  Rarely does a single state or local agency have control overthe full array of services required to address the needs ofincreasingly troubled children and families who have many problems. Rather, a complex set of service delivery systems must be tapped;these are usually linked to separate categorical funding sources anddifferent eligibility criteria. Because caseworkers may be overworked and families may often lack thesophistication and resources necessary to arrange services on theirown behalf, some children and families may experience delays or gapsin service.  For example, when we visited metropolitan areas in threestates, we found that many foster children under age 3 lacked routinehealth examinations and immunizations.\25The goals of the child welfare system and those of various programsmay also be inconsistent.  For example, caseworkers report that moreparents of abused and neglected children are addicted to drugs thanin the past.  Although one of the primary goals of the current childwelfare system is to keep families together, residential drugtreatment programs are rarely able to accommodate the children ofparents undergoing treatment.  For parents to receive treatment,therefore, some children must be placed in some kind of foster care. --------------------\25 See Foster Care:  Health Needs of Many Young Children Are OftenUnknown and Unmet (GAO/HEHS-95-114, May 26, 1995).    STATES STRUGGLE TO MEET   CASELOAD AND RESOURCE   CHALLENGES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5In response to the escalating pressure on the foster care system,states have adopted various measures to meet changing foster careneeds.  Many states provide family preservation services to avoid theneed for foster care or facilitate the return of foster children totheir families.  When children must be removed from their homes, manystates give preference to placing them in kinship care with relativesto maintain family ties, and, in some cases, save on costs.  Inaddition, some states are considering the use of specialized fosterparents for children with health or other unique needs because theseparents provide more family-like care than institutions, and at thesame time, save costs.  To find permanent homes for foster childrenwho cannot return to their families, states have also participated ina federal adoptions assistance program, although significant barriersto adoption still exist.       STATES SEEK TO PRESERVE      FAMILIES AND MINIMIZE THE      NEED FOR FOSTER CARE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1States have acted to strengthen families to lessen the likelihood ofcontinued abuse and neglect and minimize the need for foster care. To prevent the need for foster care, states and localities areexperimenting with providing family preservation services.  Familieswith children at risk of abuse or neglect receive a combination ofservices over several weeks or months arranged by caseworkers whogenerally make frequent home visits and concentrate on helping a fewfamilies.  Services can include training in parenting andhousekeeping, transportation, and mental health and familycounseling. Studies show that family preservation services can preclude the needfor foster care at least up to 1 year, although little is known aboutlong-term results.\26 Because costs for family preservation servicesare a fraction of foster care costs, these findings offer somepromise of cost savings.  In 1993, 48 states offered some familypreservation services.  Despite promising early results, resourcesare still sufficiently limited so that most states cannot offerfamily preservation services to all clients in need of services.\27However, such services should expand as a result of recent federalfunding earmarked for this purpose. --------------------\26 See Foster Care:  Services to Prevent Out-of-Home Placements AreLimited by Funding Barriers. \27 See Child Welfare:  Opportunities to Further Enhance FamilyPreservation and Support Activities (GAO/HEHS-95-112, June 15, 1995).       STATES INCREASE USE OF      KINSHIP CARE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2When foster care is necessary, states have increasingly placedchildren with relatives in what is called kinship care.  Theproportion of foster children placed with relatives grew from 18percent to 31 percent between 1986 and 1990 in 25 states, includingCalifornia and New York.\28The proportions were even higher in some metropolitan areas, such asNew York City, where about half of foster children were in kinshipcare in the early 1990s.  African American children are especiallylikely to be placed in kinship care.  About 29 states give preferenceto kinship care when appropriate. States have increased their use of kinship care for a variety ofreasons:  to maintain children's ties to their families; encouragelong-term placements; meet federal standards of care (see app.  IV);offset shortages of traditional foster homes; and, in some cases,save on costs by offering lower payments.  Kinship care is lesscostly than traditional foster homes in those states where relativesare ineligible for state foster care payments.  Although relativesmight be eligible for assistance from AFDC, AFDC levels aresignificantly lower than state foster care maintenance payments. Kinship care, however, poses several challenges.  First, children'saccess to needed services may be more limited because kinship fosterparents are more likely to live in impoverished communities and lackexperience accessing needed services than other foster parents. Second, children may be more vulnerable to repeated neglect or abusebecause they are more at risk of unsupervised visits with parents orother relatives from whose care they were removed.  Third, childwelfare agencies do not always monitor or supervise kinship careplacements as much as traditional foster care placements.  Finally,children in kinship care tend to stay in foster care longer thanother foster children because, for various reasons, child welfareagencies are less likely to arrange alternative placements, such asguardianship or adoption.  In those states where relatives receiveAFDC rather than foster care payments, AFDC costs may offset savingsthat might have resulted from lower reimbursement rates when childrenremain in kinship care for prolonged periods. --------------------\28 Using Relatives for Foster Care, HHS, Office of the InspectorGeneral (Washington, D.C.:  July 1992).       SPECIALIZED FAMILY FOSTER      CARE ADDRESSES NEEDS IN LESS      INSTITUTIONAL SETTING---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3Increasingly, states are using specialized foster parents rather thaninstitutional care to provide more nurturing and family-like care atreduced costs for children and adolescents with special needs.  Thesechildren include those who are severely emotionally disturbed,medically complex or fragile, HIV positive, or delinquent. Specialized care typically involves therapy or treatment provided inthe foster home. To meet the unique needs of foster children they serve, specializedfoster parents are generally carefully selected and trained.  Inaddition, they are paid at higher rates, provided more agency supportand supervision, and given access to more comprehensive referralservices than traditional foster parents.  Although generally moreexpensive than traditional foster family care, specialized care isless expensive and considered more nurturing than institutional carein group homes, residential facilities, or psychiatric institutions.       STATES PARTICIPATE IN      ADOPTION INITIATIVE FOR      HARD-TO-PLACE FOSTER      CHILDREN---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.4States also participate in the federal adoptions assistance program,which is designed to obtain stable, permanent homes for certainfoster children.  This program encourages the adoption of federallyeligible foster children who cannot return to their biologicalfamilies and have special needs that make them difficult to place. Title IV-E provides an open-ended individual entitlement that helpscover one-time adoption expenses and offers monthly payments toadoptive families of children who might otherwise languish in fostercare because of their age; minority status; disabilities; emotional,behavioral, or learning problems; or other special needs.  Studieshave indicated that such assistance increases the likelihood ofadoption of older and minority children and is cost effective. Regarding costs, a Westat study found that adoption assistance savedthe government $1.6 billion from 1983 to 1987 over what costs wouldhave been if children had remained in foster care.\29The success of the adoption assistance program in reducing fostercare caseloads and costs, however, appears to be limited by barriersto timely adoptions.\30 Many states view federal standards (see app. IV) as requiring a sequential approach to the permanent placement offoster children and therefore plan for family reunification beforeconsidering adoptions.\31 Further, once adoption is planned, delaysoften occur in terminating parental rights, a required step beforeadoptions can be arranged.  This occurs, in part, because the courtslack a clear consensus on the proper balance among the needs ofbiological parents, adoptive parents, and the child.  Attempts toensure racial or ethnic matches between children and adoptive parentsare also believed to add delays.\32--------------------\29 A.J.  Sedlak and D.D.  Broadhurst, Study of Adoption AssistanceImpacts and Outcomes:  Final Report, Vol.  I, Westat, Inc. (Rockville, Md.:  1993). \30 See also Barriers to Freeing Children for Adoption, HHS, Officeof the Inspector General (Washington, D.C.:  1991). \31 Washington state is experimenting with concurrent reunificationand adoption efforts to decrease the time needed to place childrenfor adoption. \32 The Howard M.  Metzenbaum Multi-Ethnic Placement Act of 1994(P.L.  103-382) bars these practices.  Although the block grantproposal repeals this act, it substitutes similar languageprohibiting racial or ethnic barriers to adoption.    THE CONGRESS CONSIDERING   CHANGES TO CHILD WELFARE   PROGRAMS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6The Congress is currently debating proposals to replace foster careand other child welfare programs with a block grant.  The ChildProtection Block Grant (CPBG)--title II of H.R.  4--passed by theHouse of Representatives on March 24, 1995, would consolidate fostercare and at least 18 related child welfare programs into a singleblock grant to states.  (See app.  III.) CPBG would eliminaterestrictions on states' use of various funding sources under thecurrent programs, place annual limits on funding, and allocate fundsto states on the basis of past rather than current expenditures. Federal eligibility criteria and oversight largely would beeliminated, and standards and planning and reporting requirementswould be streamlined to allow states more flexibility in designingand administering their programs.\33Federal, state, and local officials and child welfare experts weconsulted (see app.  I) noted possible benefits of CPBG.  First,officials agreed that capping the block grant would control federalfoster care expenditures and might result in savings at that level. Second, officials generally agreed that CPBG would provide increasedprogram flexibility so that states could respond more quickly andcreatively to changing caseload needs.  For example, states would beable to use funds, formerly restricted to foster care, for preventiveand rehabilitative services--a move that some states believe holdspromise for controlling caseload growth.  Further, increasedflexibility resulting from simplified planning, reporting, andeligibility criteria would streamline administration and could cutcosts.  As a result, states could more easily shift resources toareas of greater need. On the other hand, many experts expressed concern that the blockgrant would shift much of the financing burden to the states, whichmight be unable to support increased caseloads without reducingservices.\34 They were also concerned that, due to reduced federalfunding and oversight, the quality of foster care could be adverselyaffected. Our work on block grants suggests that three lessons can be drawnfrom the experience with the 1981 block grants\35 that would havevalue to the Congress as it considers creating new ones.  First, aclear need exists to focus on accountability for results to providethe Congress with information on program performance.  Second,funding allocations to states should be studied carefully and reflectneed, ability to pay, and variations in the cost of providingservices.  Finally, because the programs in the current proposal aremuch larger and essentially different from those programs included inthe 1981 block grants, states are likely to face greater challengesthan they did in the early 1980s. In addition to Members of the Congress, we are providing copies ofthis report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, statechild welfare directors, and other interested parties.

RossDirector, Income Security Issues--------------------\33 See Karen Spar's Welfare Reform:  Implications of H.R.  4 forChild Welfare Services (CRS 95-566 EPW), Congressional ResearchService (Washington, D.C.:  May 1995). \34 Advocates expect foster care caseloads to grow to accommodatechildren ineligible for AFDC under the proposed welfare block grant. Growing caseloads, in turn, would shift funds from services topayments to foster care providers. \35 Under the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, the administrationof federal domestic assistance programs was substantially changed byconsolidating more than 50 categorical grant programs into nine blockgrants and shifting primary administrative responsibility for theseprograms to the states.

However, federal child abuse prevention funding appearsrelatively low compared with federal expenditures for assistance toabuse victims.  Prevention programs have difficulty meeting theirfunding needs because grants are short term and come from multiplesources, which increases programs' administrative costs.       CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT:       PROGRESS OF THE NATIONAL      CENTER SINCE MAY 1991      (GAO/T-HRD-92-14, MAR.  6,      1992)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.2Since May 1991, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect hasmade some progress in monitoring grant programs, managing theclearinghouse and resource centers on child abuse data, and obtainingmore staff and expertise.  Despite these encouraging signs,administrative effectiveness may not improve because of the Center'sgrowing workload.  The Center continues to fall short in providingtimely on-site monitoring, assessing its technical assistance, andsubmitting required reports to the Congress.  The Center's limitedresources continue to hinder its goal of providing leadership inpreventing and treating child abuse and neglect.       CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT:       NCCAN'S IMPLEMENTATION OF      CAPTA OF 1988      (GAO/T-HRD-91-29, MAY 9,      1991)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.3Although the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect addressed therequirements of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988to varying degrees, staff and resource shortages hindered its grantadministration.  Further, the Center's implementation of the act doesnot satisfy all of the requirements.       CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION:       STATUS OF THE CHALLENGE      GRANT PROGRAM      (GAO/HRD-91-95, MAY 9, 1991)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.4By fiscal year 1989, 42 states had established child abuse preventiontrust funds with a median trust fund revenue of about $240,000. Although more than $94 million in state funds were available forchild abuse prevention activities, only $40 million were consideredfor federal matching funds.  The total amount of federal funds spenton child abuse prevention was unknown.    FOSTER CARE--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2      CHILD WELFARE:       OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER      ENHANCE FAMILY PRESERVATION      AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES      (GAO/HEHS-95-112, JUNE 15,      1995)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.1A crisis in the child welfare system has constrained states' abilityto meet the service needs of our nation's most vulnerable childrenand their families.  The family preservation and support provisionsof the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 were enacted to helpstates provide services designed to preserve families, especiallythose at risk of abusing and neglecting their children, and preventunnecessary foster care placements.  While activities implementingthe law during its first 18 months appear to be on target,opportunities exist for HHS to further enhance state efforts todevelop a viable plan and monitor results.       FOSTER CARE:  HEALTH NEEDS      OF MANY YOUNG CHILDREN      UNKNOWN AND UNMET      (GAO/HEHS-95-114, MAY 26,      1995)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.2Important health-related needs, including routine medicalexaminations and various specialized services, remained unmet fornearly one-third of the young foster children in Los Angeles County,New York City, and Philadelphia County.  Additionally, most youngfoster children in the locations reviewed were at high risk for thehuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of parental drugabuse.  Yet, foster care agencies have been slow to respond to onecritical health need--HIV risk assessment--which is the first step inidentifying infected children so that they can receive appropriateand timely health care.  Few children in the locations reviewed weretested for the virus.  Furthermore, young children in kinship carewere less likely than those placed in traditional foster care toreceive needed health-related services.       FOSTER CARE:  PARENTAL DRUG      ABUSE HAS ALARMING IMPACT ON      YOUNG CHILDREN      (GAO/HEHS-94-89, APR.  4,      1994)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.3Compared with the 1986 population, the 1991 population of youngfoster children in Los Angeles County, New York City, andPhiladelphia County were more likely to have drug-abusing parents andto be at risk for health problems related to prenatal drug exposure. Seventy-eight percent of the foster children in 1991 had at least onedrug- or alcohol-abusing parent, compared with 52 percent in 1986. Further, 62 percent of the foster children had a higher risk forfuture health-related problems because of prenatal drug exposurecompared with 29 percent in 1986.       RESIDENTIAL CARE:  SOME      HIGH-RISK YOUTH BENEFIT, BUT      MORE STUDY NEEDED      (GAO/HEHS-94-56, JAN.  28,      1994)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.4Residential care appears to be a viable treatment option for somehigh-risk youths.  Residential care programs report benefits inschool attendance and in avoiding drug abuse and criminal activity. However, these programs seldom conduct controlled or comparisonstudies to determine how outcomes are linked to their treatmentefforts, and few programs have conducted studies to show whathappened to participants more than 12 months after they left theprograms.       FOSTER CARE:  FEDERAL POLICY      ON TITLE IV-E SHARE OF      TRAINING (GAO/HRD-94-7, NOV.       3, 1993)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.5Federal funds for foster care and foster care training are madeavailable to the states under title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Under current procedures, states allocate foster care training costsbetween the IV-E foster care program and other programs so that eachprogram is charged its proportionate share of training costs on thebasis of benefits received.  Some state officials oppose the currentHHS cost-sharing policy because it limits IV-E reimbursement and theamount of foster care training they can provide.       FOSTER CARE:  SERVICES TO      PREVENT OUT-OF-HOME      PLACEMENTS ARE LIMITED BY      FUNDING BARRIERS      (GAO/HRD-93-76, JUNE 29,      1993)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.6The existing federal system for financing child welfare programsoffers little incentive for states to provide services designed tokeep families together and avert the need for foster care; instead,states find it easier to house a growing population in federallysubsidized foster care.  Various funding barriers limit states'ability to provide welfare services.  Federal funding for foster careis open ended, but funding for direct child welfare services islimited.  Further, state fiscal crises have limited funding forpreventing foster care placements and family reunification services.       FOSTER CARE:  STATE AGENCIES      OTHER THAN CHILD WELFARE CAN      ACCESS TITLE IV-E FUNDS      (GAO/HRD-93-6, FEB.  9,      1993)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.7HHS has issued several policy statements clarifying eligibilityrequirements for reimbursement for foster care placements.  TheDepartment has reimbursed states for placements made by juvenilejustice agencies since 1984.  Of the states that responded to a 1991survey, 21 claimed reimbursement for placements by juvenile justiceagencies, and 13 claimed reimbursement for placements by mentalhealth agencies.       FOSTER CARE:  CHILDREN'S      EXPERIENCES LINKED TO      VARIOUS FACTORS; BETTER DATA      NEEDED (GAO/HRD-91-64, SEPT.       11, 1991)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.8We analyze data on length of stay in foster care and reentry forchildren who entered or left foster care in six states and twolocalities.  Of children reunited with their families in 1986, up to27 percent subsequently reentered foster care.  The median length ofstay for children entering or leaving care in 1986 in the states andlocalities reviewed varied from 8 to 19 months.  Children whoseinitial stay in foster care was under a year, however, were morelikely to reenter foster care than those whose initial stays werelonger.  Moreover, children placed in institutions in the statesreviewed generally stayed in foster care longer than those placed infoster family homes.       CHILD WELFARE:  MONITORING      OUT-OF-STATE PLACEMENTS      (GAO/HRD-91-107BR, SEPT.  3,      1991)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.9Our review of 42 children from 15 states showed that placementagencies complied with federal law regarding the frequency of casereviews.  Despite budgetary constraints, most placement agenciesvisit the children to assess the children's well-being and progressin the treatment program.       RESPITE CARE:  AN OVERVIEW      OF FEDERAL, SELECTED STATE,      AND PRIVATE PROGRAMS      (GAO/HRD-90-125, SEPT.  6,      1990)------------------------------------------------------ Appendix V:2.10Respite care provides temporary child care relief to family membersand other caretakers of disabled children to prevent child abuse andneglect and support family unity.  Respite care services are fundedthrough state and local agencies, national organizations, and federaldepartments.  Funding patterns differ among states.  The demand forrespite care services exceeds the available supply.       FOSTER PARENTS:  RECRUITING      AND PRESERVICE TRAINING      PRACTICES NEED EVALUATION      (GAO/HRD-89-86, AUG.  3,      1989)------------------------------------------------------ Appendix V:2.11The most effective recruiting strategies realistically portrayedfoster care difficulties, emphasized foster care's temporary nature,and defined the positive role of foster parents.  Effectivepreservice training focused on enabling foster parents to makeinformed decisions about foster children's needs, enabling socialservice agencies to assess foster parents' suitability for caring forfoster children, and facilitated teamwork between social serviceagencies and foster parents.  States have performed limited formalevaluations of their recruiting and preservice training practices,and few have comprehensively evaluated the effectiveness of variousdemonstration activities.    OTHER--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3      ADOPTION:  ASSISTANCE      PROVIDED BY SELECTED      EMPLOYERS TO ADOPTING      PARENTS (GAO/HRD-90-47FS,      DEC.  19, 1989)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.1Fifty-six of 77 employers in our review financially assistedemployees adopting children and commonly imposed a dollar limit onthe amount of assistance.  All 77 employers allowed adopting parentsto use some form of unpaid or paid leave, but few employers providedadoption or parental leave benefits.       CHILD WELFARE:  HHS BEGINS      TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP TO      IMPLEMENT NATIONAL AND STATE      SYSTEMS (GAO/AIMD-94-37,      JUNE 8, 1994)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.2HHS' initiatives to address information system implementationproblems include issuing final regulations and functional systemrequirements, working with the states to develop a draft system modelfor other states to follow in developing their systems, and hiring acontractor to help states develop their systems.       FAMILIES ON WELFARE:  SHARP      RISE IN NEVER-MARRIED WOMEN      REFLECTS SOCIETAL TREND      (GAO/HEHS-94-92, MAY 31,      1994)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.3From 1976 to 1992, the proportion of single women receiving Aid toFamilies With Dependent Children (AFDC) who had never been marriedmore than doubled, increasing from about 21 percent to about 52percent.  This change paralleled a broader societal trend among allsingle mothers.  Single women receiving AFDC in 1992 were bettereducated, had fewer children, and worked as much as theircounterparts in 1976, but were twice as likely to have incomes belowthe poverty level.       FAMILIES ON WELFARE:       TEENAGE MOTHERS LEAST LIKELY      TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT      (GAO/HEHS-94-115, MAY 31,      1994)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.4Women who gave birth as teenagers make up nearly half of the AFDCcaseload--a sizeable group.  Women who had their first child whenthey were teenagers may have the most difficulty earning their wayoff welfare and becoming self-sufficient.       INTEGRATING HUMAN SERVICES:       LINKING AT-RISK FAMILIES      WITH SERVICES MORE      SUCCESSFUL THAN SYSTEM      REFORM EFFORTS      (GAO/HRD-92-108, SEPT.  24,      1992)------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.5Broad-based and ambitious system-oriented efforts have faced manyobstacles and met with limited success.  For example, programs andinitiatives we visited were unable to create new organizationalstructures or develop multiagency service plans and budgets.  Incontrast, service-oriented efforts were able to link at-risk familiesto human services and provide a combination of health and othersupportive services.

Despite that increase, the Congress lacked adequate information todetermine whether the set-aside effectively reduced treatmentbarriers and addressed treatment needs since HHS did not clearlyspecify reporting requirements to states.  The women's set-aside didnot ensure that states provided appropriate treatment services towomen since the set-aside encouraged, but did not require, states tofund specifically designed treatment.

The inappropriate use of prescription drugs maycause unnecessary adverse drug reactions that may lead to subtledeterioration of function or precipitate medical crises resulting inhospitalization or death.  They also contribute to higher medicalcosts borne in part by either Medicare or Medicaid.  The Food andDrug Administration (FDA) estimates that the annual cost ofhospitalizations due to inappropriate prescription drug use is $20billion. Concerned that the inappropriate use of prescription drugs harms thehealth and quality of life of the elderly, you asked us to  determine if the inappropriate use of prescription drugs among the     elderly is widely viewed as a serious health problem;  identify the ways prescription drugs are inappropriately used and     why these situations occur;  identify how physicians, pharmacists, and patients receive     information on prescription drugs and how their knowledge of     prescription drugs and drug therapies could be improved; and  provide information on how emerging trends in health care delivery     affect drug prescribing for the elderly. To address these issues, we conducted a literature review andobtained documents from leading researchers in the fields ofgerontology and elderly clinical pharmacology.  We interviewed theseindividuals as well as representatives of FDA, the Health CareFinancing Administration (HCFA), state Medicaid programs, industrytrade associations, senior citizen and consumer advocacy groups, andmedical associations who are knowledgeable in the use of prescriptiondrugs for the elderly.  We analyzed data on prescription drug usefrom HCFA's 1992 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.\2 We conductedour study from October 1994 to May 1995 in accordance with generallyaccepted government auditing standards.  (See app.  I for details onour scope and methodology.)--------------------\1 Sharon M.  Wilcox, David U.  Himmelstein, and Steffie Woolhandler,"Inappropriate Drug Prescribing for the Community-Dwelling Elderly,"Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol.  272, No.  4 (July27, 1994), pp.  292-96. \2 For a complete explanation of the Medicare Current BeneficiarySurvey, see appendix II.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a potential healthproblem that is particularly acute for the elderly.  Not only do theelderly use more prescription drugs than any other age group, theyare more likely to be taking several drugs at once, increasing theprobability of adverse drug reactions.  Furthermore, the elderly donot eliminate drugs from their systems as efficiently as youngerpatients because of decreased liver and kidney function. Our analysis of 1992 data from the Medicare Current BeneficiarySurvey found that about 17.5 percent of almost 30 millionnoninstitutionalized Medicare recipients 65 or older used at leastone drug identified as generally unsuitable for elderly patientssince safer alternative drugs exist.  While still significant, thisis an improvement over the almost 25 percent reported for 1987 data. Inappropriate prescription drug use can result from the behavior notonly of the physician but also of the pharmacist and patient.  Suchbehavior includes physicians using outdated prescribing practices,particularly for elderly patients; pharmacists not performing drugutilization reviews; and patients not informing their physician andpharmacist about all the drugs they are taking.  Any of these factorscan increase the likelihood that an elderly person will use a drugthat may impair his or her health. Although the experts we interviewed agreed that the inappropriate useof prescription drugs remains a significant health problem, theyidentified several recent efforts that are helping to address thisproblem.  Federal and state initiatives have encouraged thedevelopment and dissemination of detailed information on the effectof prescription drugs on the elderly.  At the same time, the medicalcommunity has begun to emphasize the need to increase physicians'knowledge of geriatrics and elderly clinical pharmacology.  Thedevelopment of drug utilization review systems now permitsprescriptions to be screened before they are filled to identifypotential problems, such as adverse drug interactions orinappropriate dosage levels.  Finally, patients increasingly havebeen seeking information about their drug therapies from severalsources, including consumer advocacy groups, state agencies, andpharmaceutical companies. Changes in the health care delivery system also have the potential toreduce the inappropriate use of prescription drugs.  Managed careplans, whose enrollment has grown from 10 million in 1980 to almost90 million in 1992, are now actively enrolling senior citizens. Through utilization controls such as a "gatekeeper," managed careplans have the potential to improve the coordination of drugtherapies for newly enrolled elderly patients.  Furthermore, agrowing number of employers and health plans now use pharmacy benefitmanagement firms to administer their prescription drug benefitprograms.  From 1989 to 1993, the number of individuals covered bypharmacy benefit management firms increased from fewer than 60million to 100 million.  Through increased oversight and review,these firms have the potential to further reduce inappropriateprescription drug use.    INAPPROPRIATE USE OF   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS A MAJOR   HEALTH PROBLEM FOR THE ELDERLY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a problem that isparticularly acute for the elderly.  The elderly use moreprescription drugs than any other age group and are more likely to betaking multiple prescription drugs, which increases the probabilityof adverse drug reactions.  Furthermore, the elderly are moresusceptible to adverse drug reactions because of the aging process. As a result, many experts believe that some drugs are generallyinappropriate for the elderly because equally effective and saferalternative drugs exist.  Additionally, other drugs thoughappropriate should be used at reduced dosage levels to accommodateelderly physiology.       INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTION      DRUG USE IS WIDESPREAD AMONG      THE ELDERLY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1Based on 1987 data from the National Medical Expenditure Survey, aresearch study published in July 1994 concluded that almost 25percent of the noninstitutionalized elderly 65 or older usedprescription drugs at least once during the year that are generallyconsidered unsuitable for their age group.\3 The study used a list of20 drugs, based on criteria published in 1991, that generally shouldnot be used by elderly patients.\4A second study published in October 1994 reinforced the findings ofthe earlier study.\5 In this study, the researchers interviewed asample of community residents, 75 or older living in Santa Monica,California, during 1989 and 1990 about their use of prescriptiondrugs, over-the-counter medications, and home remedies within the 4weeks prior to the interview.  The researchers used primarily thesame criteria as the July 1994 study, but only looked at drug usageover a 1-month period rather than the entire year.  This studyconcluded that 14 percent of those interviewed used at least one ofthe drugs generally identified as not suitable for elderly patients. Several experts we interviewed expressed reservations about theappropriateness of using 1991 criteria to evaluate prescription druguse in years before the criteria were developed.  However, theseexperts did not disagree with the criteria themselves.  To determineif there was much change in prescribing patterns after 1991, weanalyzed data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey conductedby HCFA's Office of the Actuary to see what percentage ofnoninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries in 1992 used any of the20 drugs.\6 Our analysis showed that an estimated 17.5 percent of thealmost 30 million senior citizens in the survey used at least one ofthese drugs in 1992.\7 Although this represented an improvement overthe 1987 data, more than one out of six elderly patients were stillusing prescription drugs generally considered unsuitable for theirage group. Many health care practitioners questioned whether the use of thesedrugs should always be characterized as inappropriate.  Theymaintained that, under certain circumstances, their use would beperfectly acceptable.  For example, if a patient was already using aparticular drug and doing well, there would be little medicaljustification for switching to another drug.  Still, none of thesepractitioners said that this rationale would account for the highpercentage of elderly patients using drugs deemed inappropriate.  Allthe experts we interviewed agreed that the inappropriate use ofprescription drugs continues to be a significant health problem. Several experts also pointed out that these research studies onlylooked at one type of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. In their opinion, when other examples are considered such aspotentially dangerous drug interactions or incorrect dosages, thepercentage of senior citizens affected by the inappropriate use ofprescription drugs would be even greater than the estimates providedin those studies. --------------------\3 Wilcox, Himmelstein, and Woolhandler, pp.  292-96. \4 Mark Beers, Joseph G.

THE ELDERLY ARE PARTICULARLY      VULNERABLE TO INAPPROPRIATE      PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2The elderly are more likely than other segments of the population tobe affected by the inappropriate use of prescription drugs.  As agroup, the elderly are more likely to suffer from more than onedisease or chronic condition concurrently, which means that they maytake several different drugs at one time.  As the number ofprescriptions increases, so does the potential for adverse drugreactions caused by drug interactions or drug-diseasecontraindications.  The physiological changes of aging are a majorreason drugs have the potential to cause problems in the elderly. Elderly patients often lack the ability to eliminate drugs from theirsystems as efficiently as younger patients do because of decreasedliver and kidney function.  In addition, they are more sensitive tothe effects of drugs.  Thus, they are not able to accommodate thenormal adult dosage. The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a major cause ofadverse drug reactions that, if severe enough, can result inhospitalization or death.  Since the elderly are more vulnerable tothe effects of the inappropriate prescription drug use, they are atgreater risk from adverse drug reactions than other segments of thepopulation.  Studies indicate that about 3 percent of all hospitaladmissions are caused by adverse drug reactions.\8However, the percentage is much higher for the elderly.  One studyestimated the percentage of hospitalizations of elderly patients dueto adverse drug reactions to be 17 percent, almost 6 times greaterthan for the general population.\9 Applying an average unit cost tothe proportion of hospital admissions that are drug-related, FDAestimates that hospitalizations due to inappropriate prescriptiondrug use cost about $20 billion annually. Less severe adverse drug reactions may go unnoticed or be discountedby both health practitioners and the elderly as the normal effects ofthe aging process.  However, these side effects, such as drowsiness,loss of coordination, and confusion, can result in falls or caraccidents.  A study estimated that 32,000 senior citizens annuallysuffer hip fractures as a result of falls caused by adverse drugreactions.\10 Another study concluded that about 16,000 car accidentsresulting in injuries each year can be attributed to adverse drugreactions experienced by elderly drivers.\11 Even if no seriousbodily injury occurs, adverse drug reactions decrease the generalquality of life for patients because of drug-induced mentalimpairment, loss of coordination, or addiction. --------------------\8 Keith Beard, "Adverse Reactions as a Cause of Hospital Admissionin the Aged," Drugs & Aging, Vol.  2, No.  4 (July/Aug.  1992), pp. 356-67. \9 Nananda Col, James E.

MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE   INAPPROPRIATE USE OF   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3The factors leading to the inappropriate use of prescription drugsare multifaceted and interconnected, according to experts weinterviewed.  These factors reflect the behavior of the physician,pharmacist, and patient, either collectively or individually.  Fromthe time a drug is prescribed to the point where the drug is taken,many possible events, often interconnected with each other, can leadto an adverse drug reaction or other serious results. The inappropriate use of prescription drugs can take severaldifferent forms, ranging from potentially life- threatening drug-druginteractions to therapeutic duplication (using two or more similardrugs to treat the same problem), which yields little benefit atincreased cost.  Other examples of the inappropriate use ofprescription drugs include  drug-age contraindication,  drug-allergy contraindication,  drug-disease contraindication,  incorrect drug dosage,  incorrect duration of drug therapy, and  less effective drug therapy.\12A physician, a pharmacist, or a patient may take or omit actions thatcan produce an adverse drug reaction.  For example, a drug-druginteraction could be due to a physician not recognizing that aprescribed drug interacts badly with another prescribed medication orover-the-counter drug used by the patient.  (See fig.  1.) Thepharmacist may contribute to the situation by not detecting thenegative interaction or by failing to determine which drugs theelderly patient is taking.  The elderly patient may not give thedoctor and pharmacist a complete list of all the medications,including over-the-counter drugs, that he or she is taking.  Thus,all three parties may contribute to a drug-drug interaction, withpotentially serious consequences to the patient.    Figure 1:  Possible Causes and   Outcomes of Adverse Drug   Reactions   (See figure in printed   edition.)Health care professionals noted that the overuse and underuse of drugtherapies may also contribute to the inappropriate use ofprescription drugs.\13 Drug overuse occurs when a medication isprescribed but either no medication was needed or an alternativetreatment approach existed.  For example, changes in diet andlifestyle may be more appropriate than drug therapy.  Morecontroversial is the selection of drug therapy over counseling totreat psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression.  Drugunderuse occurs when an appropriate medication either is notprescribed or is underprescribed.  For example, one study reportedthat patients with advanced cancer were at risk of receiving lessthan adequate pain medication.\14--------------------\12 Definitions of these terms are in the glossary. \13 Jerry H.

Hatfield, and others,"Pain and Its Treatment in Outpatients With Metastatic Cancer," NewEngland Journal of Medicine, Vol.  330, No.  9 (Mar.  3, 1994), pp. 592-96.    BETTER INFORMATION AND   COMMUNICATION CAN HELP PREVENT   INAPPROPRIATE DRUG USE------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4According to several experts we interviewed, lowering the elderly'srisk of adverse drug reactions requires that more detailedinformation on the impact of drug therapies on the elderly bedeveloped and disseminated to health practitioners.  Furthermore,many health practitioners agreed that physicians, pharmacists, andpatients should all participate in the drug therapy decision-makingprocess.  Increased communication between and among physicians,pharmacists, and patients is vital to ensuring that this process iseffective.       FDA HAS IMPROVED DRUG      GUIDELINES FOR THE ELDERLY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1One difficulty in prescribing drugs for the elderly has been the lackof specific information on dosage levels established for the elderlythrough clinical tests.  Recognizing the need for additionalinformation on the effects of drugs on the elderly, FDA issuedvoluntary guidelines in 1989 governing the testing of new drugsintended for elderly patients.  These guidelines call for theinclusion of elderly patients during the drug's testing process.  Theintent of these guidelines is to develop better information for bothphysicians and pharmacists on dosage standards for new drugs intendedfor elderly patients as well as to identify side effects that aremore pronounced in the elderly than in the general population.  FDA'sDirector of Drug Policy and Evaluation stated that he believed thatpharmaceutical manufacturers have complied with these guidelines. However, several experts said that clinical trials performed underthese guidelines are not representative of the elderly population asa whole.  For example, they believe that elderly patients over 75 areunderrepresented.\15--------------------\15 Jerry Avorn, "Grant Watch--Medication Use and the Elderly: Current Status and Opportunities," Health Affairs (Spring 1995), pp. 276-86.       BETTER PHYSICIAN EDUCATION      CAN IMPROVE POOR PRESCRIBING      PRACTICES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2The medical community has only recently started to emphasize thestudy of geriatrics and elderly clinical pharmacology.  For example,board certification in geriatrics was offered for the first time in1988.  Recognizing the aging of the population, most medical schoolsnow offer courses in geriatrics, though only 12 schools requirecourses devoted solely to geriatrics.  Experts we interviewed agreedthat medical schools could improve how they train doctors ingeriatrics.  Moreover, several experts stressed the need to improvethe quality of continuing education in geriatrics, because a largeportion of the education doctors receive in medical school becomesoutdated during their careers.  Since medical schools have onlyrecently introduced geriatric training in their curricula, manydoctors in practice today have had little formal training in thatarea.  Two experts also pointed out a similar need for an emphasis ongeriatrics in the training of pharmacists, both in pharmacy schooland through continuing education. While preclinical training in pharmacology is routinely provided inmedical school, several experts said that improvements are needed inthe teaching of clinical pharmacology, which trains doctors in theuse of drug therapies to treat disease.  Doctors obtain theirclinical pharmacology training during their residencies.  Physicians'clinical knowledge of the unique aspects of elderly pharmacologydepends on their exposure to elderly patients.  Several expertsbelieve that the real expertise in pharmacology rests with thepharmacists and that doctors need to use this expertise in decidingthe most appropriate drug therapy to prescribe.       DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW      PROGRAMS OFFER SAFEGUARDS      AGAINST INAPPROPRIATE USE OF      PRESCRIPTION DRUGS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3One strategy that is increasingly used to identify and minimize theinappropriate use of prescription drugs involves drug utilizationreviews.  Drug utilization reviews are intended to screen drugtherapies for potential problems, such as drug-drug interactions,drug-disease contraindications, incorrect dosages, or improperduration of treatment.  These reviews can be done eitherprospectively or retrospectively.  Prospective drug utilizationreviews are designed to detect potential problems before aprescription is filled by the pharmacist.  Retrospective drugutilization reviews occur after the prescription is filled and areintended to detect prescribing patterns that indicate inappropriateor unnecessary medical treatment as well as fraud or abuse.  TheOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires all states toconduct ongoing retrospective reviews of Medicaid prescription drugclaims and prospective reviews before each prescription is filled. Most states have expanded that requirement to mandate drugutilization review of all prescriptions.  While several expertsacknowledged the potential benefits of drug utilization reviewsystems, two experts cautioned that these benefits have not beenthoroughly documented to date. A prospective drug utilization review system allows point-of-salevendors such as pharmacies to check a prescription and a patient'shistory against a central database.  This database can alert apharmacist to possible drug-drug interactions or a drug-diseasecontraindication.  Our study of prospective Medicaid drug utilizationreview systems in five states during fiscal year 1993 found thatpharmacies' use of automated drug utilization review systems linkedto statewide Medicaid databases provided a more thorough prospectivereview than a manual or localized system.\16This type of automated review can reduce the risk of inappropriatedrug therapy and increase patient safety, though we recognized theneed for these benefits to be demonstrated conclusively andrecommended that HCFA take steps to do so.  We also recommended thatHCFA develop guidance for the development of these systems to ensurestandard implementation of effective drug utilization review systems. New York State's Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage programprovides prescription drug insurance coverage for low-income seniorcitizens not eligible for Medicaid.  This program uses aretrospective drug utilization review system for its therapeutic drugmonitoring program.  This review system monitors each client'sprescriptions, using data from prescription claims submitted forpayment by pharmacies, to detect potential problems such asoverutilization of a drug or a drug-drug interaction.  Once apotential problem is detected, a program official notifies theprescribing physician.  The alert is informational only and providesthe doctor with a history of the patient's prescription drug usage,the suspected problem, its effect and severity, and recommendationsfor resolving the problem.  No action is required, but the doctor isasked to respond.  In one analysis conducted by program staff, 38.4percent of the patients whose doctors received letters alerting themto a potential problem subsequently had their drug therapy changed. The Massachusetts Medicaid program also uses its retrospective drugutilization review system to detect questionable prescribingpractices affecting any of its recipients.  For example, if a patientis prescribed a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used torelieve the symptoms of arthritis, the system will monitor thatpatient for potential side effects of this type of medication, suchas stomach or intestinal bleeding.  If the patient later begins totake antiulcer medications, the system will issue an alert to theprescribing doctor that the usage of the first drug may be the causeof the ulcers.  This allows the doctor to evaluate the situation and,if warranted, alter the patient's drug therapy. A retrospective drug utilization review system can also monitorpatient compliance with a prescribed drug therapy.  For example, apatient may discontinue his or her blood pressure medication when thesymptoms disappear.  Despite the lack of symptoms, the causes remain,leaving the patient still at risk.  A retrospective drug utilizationreview can detect the patient's failure to refill a prescription andalert the patient's doctor to the situation for further action. --------------------\16 Prescription Drugs:  Automated Prospective Review Systems OfferPotential Benefits for Medicaid (GAO/AIMD-94-130, Aug.  5, 1994).       IMPROVED PATIENT COUNSELING      CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF      ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.4One way to lower the potential of adverse drug reactions is to ensurethat patients are counseled by either their doctor or pharmacist onthe usage and characteristics of a prescription drug.  Often, subtleside effects of drugs are ignored by patients and not reported backto the doctor or pharmacist.  Unless alerted that the patient isexperiencing side effects, a doctor would not be likely to changedrug therapies.  Counseling not only improves the informationreceived by the patient but also that obtained from the patient. This improved communication between doctor or pharmacist and thepatient may prompt a question that leads to the discovery of adrug-drug interaction or drug-allergy interaction. Although effective counseling by doctors and pharmacists can helpreduce the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction, two studies havefound that many patients do not receive this counseling.  A ConsumerReports study of 70,000 people published in 1995 found that about 26percent had not been counseled by a physician about their drugtherapies.\17 A 1989 study by the American Association of RetiredPersons (AARP) found that more than one out of three patientsreported that they were not counseled by their doctors on their drugtherapies.\18 Time pressures on both doctors and pharmacists may alsobe an obstacle to effective counseling. Recognizing the importance of counseling, the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that pharmacists counsel Medicaidpatients when they receive prescription drugs.  A majority of stateshave expanded this requirement to include all patients.  Officials ofthe American Pharmaceutical Association and the American Society ofConsultant Pharmacists, two professional associations that representpharmacists, stressed the importance of counseling but noted that thecurrent system of compensation for pharmacists is based on dispensingdrugs and lacks meaningful incentives for counseling.  For example, apharmacist may detect a potential problem with a prescription and,after consultation with the doctor and patient, cancel theprescription.  If another drug is not substituted and no drug isdispensed, the pharmacist receives no reimbursement for theprofessional services rendered. --------------------\17 "How Is Your Doctor Treating You?," Consumer Reports (Feb. 1995), pp.  81-88. \18 Mismedication and Its Impact on Older Americans, a statement ofthe American Association of Retired Persons presented by John Lione,M.D., before the U.S.  House of Representatives, Committee on Waysand Means, Subcommittee on Health (Sept.  20, 1994).       PATIENTS CAN PROTECT      THEMSELVES FROM ADVERSE DRUG      REACTIONS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.5Patients who seek information about their drug therapies can reducetheir likelihood of experiencing adverse drug reactions.  Besidesrequesting counseling from both the doctor and pharmacist, publicadvocacy groups urge individuals to develop their own knowledge ofdrugs.  To achieve this objective, AARP encourages the development ofpackage product inserts in large type that are easy for the elderlyto read and understand.  Public Citizen Health Research Group, apublic advocacy group, has also published a consumer guidebook forprescription drugs.  Moreover, pharmaceutical manufacturers havebegun to make information available directly to consumers.  Increasedunderstanding of their drugs, dosage requirements, and possible sideeffects makes patients more likely to avoid the inappropriate use ofdrugs. State and local agencies have developed several initiatives to alertconsumers to the dangers of inappropriately using prescription drugs. For example, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health sponsorsbrown bag seminars at senior citizen or community centers.  At theseseminars, elderly patients are encouraged to bring in all theirmedicines for review by pharmacists.  The goal is to inventory allthe medications a senior citizen has and eliminate those that are forconditions no longer being treated or which have expired.  Theremaining drugs are cataloged in what is called a "medicine passport"that can be shown to doctors and pharmacists as new or additionaldrugs are prescribed.  This record allows health practitioners toquickly review what other medications the person is taking and why.    MANAGED CARE HAS THE POTENTIAL   TO REDUCE THE INAPPROPRIATE USE   OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Recent changes in the health care delivery system have implicationsfor the use of prescription drugs.  The growing emphasis oncontrolling health care costs creates a strong incentive to reducethe inappropriate use of prescription drugs and the physical andfinancial costs associated with adverse drug reactions.  Likewise,the increasing importance of cost containment has helped spur theemergence of managed care as a major form of health care delivery. The number of people covered by managed care plans has increaseddramatically from 10 million in 1980 to almost 90 million in 1992. Moreover, many managed care plans have recently initiated majormarketing efforts to enroll elderly patients.  Similarly, the numberof people whose prescriptions are filled by pharmacy benefitmanagement companies has also increased.  While it is too early tounderstand the full impact these changes may have on reducinginappropriate drug use--in general, and among the elderly inparticular--several experts we interviewed stated that these changeshave the potential to improve the coordination of care and toincrease the ability to detect inappropriate use of drugs.  However,one expert cautioned that the achievement of these goals might beadversely affected by pressures to contain costs or increase profits.       IMPROVED COORDINATION OF      CARE IS A GOAL OF MANAGED      CARE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Many elderly patients are under the care of several specialists aswell as their primary care physician.  At times, these doctors mayprescribe several drugs to treat various ailments.  Unless thesevarious drug therapies are coordinated, adverse drug reactions pose aserious risk.  Experts in gerontology and elderly clinicalpharmacology that we spoke to stated that the most effective way todeal with the inappropriate use of prescription drugs was to improvethe coordination of care.  Ideally, this role should fall to thepatient's primary physician. Proponents of managed care have stressed improved coordination ofcare as a major goal.  Though there are several variations of managedcare such as health maintenance organizations (HMO) or preferredprovider organizations, a basic characteristic of managed care iscontrol over utilization.  Often, this is done through a gatekeeper. A gatekeeper is usually the patient's designated primary doctor whooversees the individual's care, referring the patient to specialistsas needed.  This allows one doctor to coordinate various treatments,including drug regimens.  Several experts agreed that suchcoordination could help lower the risk of adverse drug reactionsposed by inappropriate drug therapy or a patient receiving multipleprescriptions from different doctors.  However, they cautioned thatthe improved coordination of care is dependent on the quality ofpatient care, which varies widely among managed care plans. Managed care plans also have the potential to use formularies toreduce the inappropriate use of prescription drugs.  A formularylists the preferred drugs used to treat certain diseases orconditions.  Typically, the formulary is developed by a committee ofdoctors and pharmacists associated with the managed care plan, whoseek to identify the most effective drug therapies at the lowest costto the plan.  For example, if two drug therapies are deemed equallyeffective, then the plan will recommend the less costly of the two asthe preferred treatment.  However, several experts expressed theconcern that cost concerns rather than effectiveness may be theprimary driving force in selecting which drugs to place on a managedcare plan's formulary. A managed care plan can change its formulary to reflect new drugtherapies.  This has an impact on the prescribing behavior of aplan's doctors who may have to seek an exception if they wish toprescribe a drug not designated by the plan's formulary.  However,two experts said that few managed care plans have used theirformularies to improve prescribing practices for elderly patientsthough the experts acknowledged this potential exists. Another potential advantage of managed care is the data collected onpatients.  This gives managed care plans the information needed tomonitor both the drug therapies patients receive and the prescribingpatterns of physicians.  One HMO we visited provided its doctors withperiodic analyses of their drug-prescribing habits as compared withstandards developed by the HMO.  This comparison allows the HMO toidentify doctors who may need additional training or counseling inprescribing drugs for their patients, particularly the elderly.       INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE      OBTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS FROM      PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT      FIRMS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2Over the past few years, the number of people who receive theirprescription drugs through pharmacy benefit management firms hasincreased dramatically from fewer than 60 million in 1989 to 100million in 1993.  Pharmacy benefit management firms manageprescription drug benefits on behalf of health plan sponsors,including self-insured employers, insurance companies, and managedcare plans. The initial attraction of pharmacy benefit management firms is theirability to reduce administrative costs and obtain discounts onprescriptions drugs through volume buying.  However, these firms canalso provide formulary management and drug utilization reviewservices with the potential to reduce inappropriate drug use.  Forexample, the drug utilization review done by one pharmacy benefitmanagement firm, PCS Health Systems, generated almost 25 millionalerts in 1994.  Of these alerts, 25 percent dealt with drug-agecontraindications and excessive daily dosages, two types ofinappropriate drug use prevalent among the elderly.  Likewise, bymonitoring patient prescription drug use, pharmacy benefit managementfirms can detect a patient's failure to refill a prescription for apersistent medical condition such as high blood pressure.  The firmcan then alert the patient's doctor to this situation for furtheraction if required. Pharmacy benefit management firms can also develop initiatives toaddress the inappropriate use of drugs among the elderly.  Forexample, Medco has instituted an educational program called "Partnersfor Healthy Aging." This program provides specialized information todoctors, pharmacists, and patients to alert them to potentialconcerns in the use of prescription drugs among the elderly. As the number of patients served by these firms has increased so hasthe information gathered on patients.  With the accumulation of dataon patient characteristics, medical conditions, and drug therapies,pharmacy benefit management firms are developing the necessarydatabase for engaging in outcomes research.  Such research allowscompanies to demonstrate the effectiveness of different courses oftreatment for a disease from both a therapeutic and cost perspective. This would permit doctors, patients, and payers to make bothfinancially and clinically informed health care decisions. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3A draft of this report was reviewed and commented on by five leadingexperts in the field of elderly clinical pharmacology.

Please call Mr.  Hansen at (202)512-7105 if you or your staff have any questions about this report. Sincerely yours,Jonathan RatnerAssociate DirectorHealth Financing IssuesSCOPE AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix ITo determine the significance of the inappropriate use ofprescription drugs among the elderly, we conducted a literaturereview and obtained documents and testimonial evidence from leadingresearchers in the fields of gerontology and elderly clinicalpharmacology.  Additionally, we interviewed other knowledgeableprofessionals concerning the issues related to the use ofprescription drugs by the elderly.  Included among theseprofessionals were representatives of FDA, HCFA, senior citizen andconsumer advocacy groups, the American Pharmaceutical Association,the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, theAmerican Medical Association, the American Society of ConsultantPharmacists, and the American Association of Medical Colleges. We interviewed state officials in Massachusetts, New York, andVermont to see how state and federal health programs deal with theinappropriate use of prescription drugs among the elderly. Massachusetts was selected because of the number of prominentresearchers in the areas of elderly clinical pharmacology locatedthere.  New York was selected because the state administers theElderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program, which providesprescription drug coverage to low-income senior citizens.  Vermont, arural state in contrast to Massachusetts and New York, was selectedbecause it was one of only eight states that had implemented astatewide automated prospective drug utilization review system forMedicaid prior to 1994.  In each state, we obtained information onthe operation of Medicaid drug utilization review systems as well asvarious state initiatives to help senior citizens avoid adverse drugreactions. To update the results from earlier research studies, we analyzed datafrom HCFA's 1992 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the mostrecently available data.  According to HCFA, this survey is designedto provide reliable baseline data to project Medicare costs and isrepresentative of the Medicare population as a whole. To determine what causes the inappropriate use of prescription drugs,we reviewed the literature and interviewed the leading expertspreviously cited.  We also obtained information on physiciangerontology education and questioned state officials about theimplementation of drug utilization review programs and their effecton the causes of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. To determine how physicians, pharmacists, and patients receiveinformation on drug therapies, we identified actions that drugmanufacturers and FDA have taken to provide better dosage informationfor elderly patients as well as changes in how drug manufacturersdisseminate information to physicians, pharmacists, and patients.  Wealso obtained information on efforts by state agencies, seniorcitizen advocacy groups, pharmacy groups, and medical organizationsto improve communication between and among physicians, pharmacists,and patients. To identify emerging trends in the health care delivery system andtheir potential effects on the inappropriate use of prescriptiondrugs, we obtained information on how managed care plans developformularies, train their staff on new drug therapies, and track bothpatient and physician use of prescription drugs.  To assess theeffect of the growth of pharmacy benefit management firms, weobtained information on how these plans coordinate and monitor drugtherapies. MEDICARE CURRENT BENEFICIARYSURVEY========================================================== Appendix IIThe Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey is a continuous, multipurposesurvey of a representative sample of the Medicare population.  It isadministered by HCFA's Office of the Actuary and began gathering datain 1991.  The survey generates data on issues of prime importance tothe management of the Medicare program and the development of healthcare policy.  Focusing on health care use and expenditures, thesurvey generates data to (1) allow HCFA to monitor the financialeffects of changes in the Medicare program; (2) develop reliable andcurrent information on the use and cost of services not covered byMedicare such as prescription drugs and long-term care; and (3)obtain information on the sources of payments for costs of coveredservices not assumed by Medicare.  Although its focus is on thefinancing of health care, the survey collects a variety ofinformation about the Medicare population, including demographiccharacteristics, health status, insurance coverage, financialresources, and family support. The survey is based on a sample of Medicare recipients drawn from theMedicare enrollment file.  The sample is representative of theMedicare population as a whole.  Since the survey is a longitudinalstudy, those selected for participation are interviewed three times ayear for several years to form a continuous profile of their healthcare.  Initial participants who completed the first round ofinterviews numbered 12,677.  Of these, 942 resided in aninstitutional setting and 11,735 were community-based.  The sample isadjusted annually for attrition and for newly eligible persons. The initial interview gathers baseline data on demographiccharacteristics, health status, insurance coverage, financialresources, and family support.  Subsequent interviews gather detailsof the participants' health care use since the last interviewemphasizing the type of health care used and the source for payingfor it.  This includes information on the prescription drugs aparticipant is using even though Medicare does not providereimbursement for their cost. Information collected is edited for consistency, documented, andorganized into files.  Later, these files are merged with HCFA claimspayment records.  Also, administrative data such as Medicaid buy-instatus and capitated plan membership are added to the file.  Allpersonal identifying information is removed. 20 DRUGS GENERALLY CONSIDEREDINAPPROPRIATE FOR THE ELDERLY========================================================= Appendix IIITable III.1 lists the 20 drugs deemed generally inappropriate forelderly patients by a panel of experts.  The reasons given by thispanel for judging a drug inappropriate are also provided as is thepurpose of these drugs.  The panel's results and methodology werepublished in 1991.\19 Though the goal of this panel was to identifydrugs inappropriate for the elderly living in a nursing home setting,a later examination of these drugs by another panel of experts alsojudged these drugs as generally inappropriate for elderly patientsliving in a community-based setting.\20 Several of the experts weinterviewed agreed that these drugs should normally not be used withelderly patients though they stressed that there would be somemedical situations where the use of these drugs would be appropriate. One expert noted the need for research studies based onpatient-related outcomes data to confirm the views of the expertpanelists.

USE OF DRUGS CONSIDERED GENERALLYINAPPROPRIATE FOR THE ELDERLY========================================================== Appendix IVAt our request, HCFA's Office of the Actuary used data from theMedicare Current Beneficiary Survey to determine the percentage ofcommunity-based elderly who used at least 1 of the 20 drugsidentified in appendix III as generally inappropriate for their agegroup.\21 The most current compiled data are for 1992.  The firststep was to identify survey participants who were 65 or older and whowere noninstitutionalized.  Of their survey population, 9,182participants met these criteria.  This group represented 29,862,854Medicare beneficiaries nationwide according to HCFA's Office of theActuary.  The next step was to determine which of these participantsused at least 1 of the 20 drugs sometime during 1992 and project thatuse to the national population.  The results indicated that anestimated 17.5 percent or 5,219,811 noninstitutionalized Medicarebeneficiaries 65 or older used at least 1 of those drugs during 1992. These results are displayed in table IV.1.  Specifically, the tablelists the percentages of noninstitutionalized elderly found to beusing each of the 20 drugs.  The middle column details the resultsbased on research using data from the 1987 National MedicalExpenditure Survey covering noninstitutionalized residents 65 orolder.\22 The right-hand column presents the results of the analysisdescribed above.  We did not include the research results based oninterviews conducted during 1989 and 1990 of a sample ofnoninstitutionalized elderly 75 or older residing in Santa Monica,California.\23 This was because the participants in this studyrepresented one community rather than a national sample and belongedto a different age group than the other two studies.  In addition,their use of the 20 drugs was measured during a period of 1 monthversus 1 year in the other 2 analyses.

Given the persistent severityof the drug problem and the large number of federal, state, and localagencies working on it, a continuing need exists for a central planningagency to lead and coordinate the nation's war on drugs.  GAO agreeswith the administration that ONDCP should be reauthorized.  However,ONDCP needs to develop better program evaluation measures for assessingprogress under the annual drug control strategies, such reductions inhard-core drug use.  In addition, ONDCP and the drug control agenciesneeds to cooperate more in developing and assessing drug control policy,particularly in the area of data collection.  Further, the law should bechanged to afford ONDCP greater flexibility over the conduct of drugcontrol budget reviews and certification.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  T-GGD-94-49     TITLE:  Drug Control: The Office of National Drug Control              Policy--Strategies Need Performance Measures      DATE:  11/15/93   SUBJECT:  National policies             Drug abuse             Narcotics             Drugs             Controlled substances             Intelligence gathering operations             Drug trafficking             Law enforcement             Interagency relations             AuthorizationIDENTIFIER:  National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey             NIDA National Household Survey on Drug Abuse             National Drug Control Strategy             ------------------------------------------------------------------------We regret that electronic text of GAO Testimony is not available at this time.

The 1991 population ismuch larger, more of these children entered foster care due to some formof neglect, these children have more health-related problems and are athigh risk for further problems due to prenatal drug exposure, and theyare more likely to be eligible for federal payments.  Both federal andstate expenditures have felt the impact of the rising number of youngfoster children and the decline in their overall health.  Further, twobroad service needs overlap foster and health care programs.  First,drug abuse treatment programs for biological mothers and pregnant womenare needed to reduce the risks associated with prenatal drug exposureand the likelihood that children will be removed from their families.Second, services to address the health and developmental needs ofdrug-exposed children are needed to treat their problems. Although fewalternatives to foster care are now available to these families, meetingthese needs should increase the chances for family reunification.However, drug abuse, to the extent that it persists, will remain ahidden contributor to the costs of various federal programs.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  HEHS-94-89     TITLE:  Foster Care: Parental Drug Abuse Has Alarming Impact on              Young Children      DATE:  04/04/94   SUBJECT:  Foster children             Public assistance programs             Drug abuse             Drug treatment             Health care services             Alcohol or drug abuse problems             Health care costs             Women             Federal/state relations             ParentsIDENTIFIER:  California             New York             Pennsylvania             Los Angeles County (CA)             New York (NY)             Philadelphia (PA)             Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program             AFDC             Medicaid Program             *************************************************************************** This file contains an ASCII representation of the text of a GAO        ** report.

FordChairman, Subcommittee on Human ResourcesCommittee on Ways and MeansHouse of RepresentativesDear Mr.  Chairman: As the nation's policymakers consider national health care andwelfare reforms, the information contained in this report should bevaluable in helping frame policies that can significantly impact oneof our most vulnerable population groups--young foster children--andtheir families.  The average number of children in foster carenationwide increased 53 percent in 5 years, from 280,000 in 1986 to429,000 in 1991.  The three states we reviewed care for over 50percent of the foster care population.  In those states, the numberof children in foster care increased about 66 percent during thatperiod and the number of young foster children--those 36 months ofage and younger--more than doubled.  Additionally, more young fosterchildren had health-related problems, including prenatal exposure todrugs, in 1991 than in 1986. This report responds to the first of three issues in your request;that we compare and contrast the population sizes and distinctivecharacteristics of young foster children in 1986 and 1991.  Asagreed, we plan to report later on the two remaining issues:  (1) howand to what extent the service needs of young foster children areidentified and met, and (2) the areas where federal assistance tostates could best serve the needs of young foster children andincrease their chances of becoming self-sufficient or, at a minimum,less dependent on government assistance later in life. We reviewed foster care programs in California, New York, andPennsylvania, the states with the largest average foster carepopulations in 1991.  We analyzed statewide foster care databases forCalifornia and New York and reviewed random samples of case files for1986\1 and 1991 from those of 32,123 young foster children in threelocations:  Los Angeles County, New York City, and PhiladelphiaCounty.\2 These locations cared for a substantial portion of eachstate's young foster children in 1991:  44 percent in California, 81percent in New York, and 29 percent in Pennsylvania. --------------------\1 For one location in the 1986 sample, program officials could notlocate about 40 percent of the requested case files.  Appendix Idescribes the steps we took to ensure that comparisons between 1986and 1991 case file review results were appropriate. \2 Pennsylvania does not have a statewide foster care database; toreview this state's foster care program we relied on summaries thatthe state compiles from aggregate data submitted by its counties.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The 1991 population of young foster children is significantlydifferent from the 1986 population in the locations reviewed in avariety of ways:  the 1991 population size is much larger, more ofthese children entered foster care due to some form of neglect, theirbiological parents are more likely to abuse drugs, these childrenhave more health-related problems and are at high risk for furtherproblems due to prenatal drug exposure,\3 and they are more likely tobe eligible for federal maintenance payments. The number of young foster children increased at almost twice therate of the general foster care population.  Neglect and caretakerabsence prompted an estimated 68 percent of removals, up from 47percent in 1986.  We estimate that families where at least one parentwas a drug abuser increased from 52 percent to 78 percent.  Anincreasing percentage of children had serious health-related problemsin 1991 and most of them were prenatally exposed to drugs. Specifically, an estimated 58 percent of young foster children hadserious health-related problems in 1991 compared with 43 percent in1986.  Those at high risk for problems due to prenatal drug exposureincreased from 29 percent to 62 percent over this period.  Cocainewas the most prevalent drug children were prenatally exposed to inboth years; documented prenatal cocaine exposure increased from 17percent to 55 percent between 1986 and 1991.  A larger percentage ofyoung foster children qualified for federal maintenance payments in1991 than previously.  At the same time, the growing number of youngfoster children increased overall maintenance expenditures,compounding their financial impact on government.  Federal and stategovernments in these three states alone spent over $2 billion in 1992to maintain foster children of all ages. These changes have implications for federal foster care and healthcare programs.  Both federal and state expenditures have felt theimpact of the growth in the number of young foster children and thedecline in their overall level of health.  Further, two broad serviceneeds overlap foster and health care programs.  First, drug abusetreatment programs for biological mothers and pregnant women areneeded to reduce the risks associated with prenatal drug exposure andthe likelihood that children will be removed from their families. Second, services to address the health and developmental needs ofdrug-exposed children are needed to treat their problems.  While fewalternatives to foster care currently exist for many of thesefamilies, meeting both of these service needs should increase thepossibility that such families can be reunified and leave the fostercare system.  However, drug abuse, to the extent it continues tooccur, will remain a hidden contributor to the costs of variousfederal programs. --------------------\3 We included alcohol abuse in our definition of drug abuse. However, the documented incidence of alcohol use was low, about 6percent in 1991 and 3 percent in 1986.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2While the federal, state, and county governments and foster parentsshare responsibility for providing care and services to fosterchildren, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) isresponsible for the management and oversight of federal programsbenefiting foster children.  The programs are authorized primarily bythe Social Security Act.  The act, in part, authorizes expendituresto (1) maintain foster children who are eligible under the Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, (2) assist states inproviding child welfare services, and (3) provide medical care. Primarily, HHS establishes federal regulations and monitors states'compliance with them for children placed in federally funded fostercare and other programs under the act and administers federal fundingfor them. Federal expenditures for the administration and maintenance ofAFDC-eligible foster children are authorized under title IV-E of theSocial Security Act.  Those expenditures increased from about $637million in 1986 to over $2.2 billion nationwide in 1992.  The federalportion of foster care maintenance costs varies by state and islinked to a state's Medicaid matching rate.  The federal portionranges from 50 percent to 83 percent of the maintenance cost forAFDC-eligible foster children; states or counties are responsible forthe full cost of maintaining foster children who are not eligible forAFDC benefits.  Thus, payments to foster parents for the care of anAFDC-eligible foster child are comprised of federal, state, and insome cases county monies. In addition to maintenance funds under title IV-E, federal fundsauthorized in other titles of the Social Security Act may be used toprovide medical and other needed services to foster children.  Statesmay participate in programs such as title IV-B, federal matchinggrants for various child welfare services; title XIX, Medicaid, formedical services for foster children; and, title XX, block grants fora wide array of social services for children.  Data were unavailableto estimate the additional federal, state, and county expendituresfor these other services for foster children.  However, we previouslyreported that median costs associated with newborn medical care forinfants known to be prenatally drug-exposed were approximately $1,100to $4,100 higher (in 1989 dollars) than for other infants.  Further,an HHS study provides an example of Medicaid costs in California from1986 to 1988 for children from birth to 24 months of age.  HHSreported a 2-year average Medicaid expenditure of $1,551 for childrenwho were not identified as being prenatally exposed to drugs comparedto $2,285 for those who were known to be exposed.\4 Further, medicalexpenses for drug-exposed foster children from birth to 12 months ofage were 62 percent greater than the medical expenses fordrug-exposed children who were not in foster care. --------------------\4 An Exploratory Analysis of the Medicaid Expenditures of SubstanceExposed Children Under 2 Years of Age in California, Office of theAssistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and Health CareFinancing Administration, HHS (1993) (study prepared by SysteMetrics,a division of MEDSTAT Systems, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.).  The averagewas calculated for all children receiving Medicaid benefits inCalifornia, not just foster children.  It also excluded costs for thefederally mandated Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, andTreatment (EPSDT) services and delivery services at birth.  However,we believe that this is a reasonable minimum estimate of averagecosts for foster children as well.    MORE YOUNG CHILDREN IN FOSTER   CARE------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3The foster care populations in the states reviewed increaseddramatically between 1986 and 1991, with the number of young fosterchildren increasing at a faster rate.  The total foster carepopulation in these states increased 66 percent while the number ofyoung foster children increased 110 percent.  During the same years,the total number of young children in these states increased 19percent, indicating that a greater percentage of all young childrenin these states entered foster care in 1991 than entered previously. (See fig.  1 and tables II.1-II.4 in app.  II.)   Figure 1:  Increase in Foster   Care and Child Populations in   Three States Between 1986 and   1991   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  Part of New York's increase in foster children is due to theprovisions of the New York Supreme Court case, Eugene F., whichrequired all foster children placed with relatives to be included infoster care caseloads and eligible for services.Pennsylvania's count of "Young Foster Children" consists of allfoster children under age 5, as its aggregate data did not break outchildren under age 3.California and New York foster children counts represent all childrenin foster care at any time during the review year; Pennsylvania datafor foster children represent year-end counts, as comparable datawere not available.

NEGLECTFUL OR ABSENT PARENTS   TRIGGERED MOST REMOVALS FROM   HOME------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Neglect and caretaker absence or incapacity were the primary reasonswhy young children were removed from their families in bothCalifornia and New York, the states where data were available. Together, these reasons accounted for approximately 47 percent and 68percent of the removals in 1986 and 1991, respectively.  No otherreasons for removals, such as physical abuse, accounted for a largeportion of the entries of young children into foster care in eitheryear.  For example, all types of abuse accounted for 11 percent ofthe removals of young children in 1986 and 7 percent in 1991.  (Seefig.  2 and table II.6 in app.  II.)   Figure 2:  Reasons for Removal   of Young Children From Home in   California and New York   (See figure in printed   edition.)Note:  There were other reasons for removals that did not account forsignificant portions of total removals.  In addition, some cases onlyshow broad service program categories, such as "court orderedplacement;" others are listed as unknown or error. \a Includes removals due to neglect, caretaker absence or incapacity,relinquishment, and voluntary placements. \b Consists of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. \c Consists of New York data only.  This state uses up to two reasonsfor removal, thus, abuse and/or neglect can be cited.  Further, thedefinitions of some reasons for removal, such as Health/Safety, referto abuse and/or neglect. Source:  State electronic databases.       DRUG ABUSE FURTHER IMPACTS      TROUBLED FAMILIES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1To better describe the parents' situation around the time theirchildren were removed from home, we reviewed random samples of casefiles for certain difficulties that families face in the threelocations reviewed.  Of these situations, estimated increases in thenumber of parents who abused drugs or had other children in fostercare are significant between 1986 and 1991.  Fully 78 percent of theyoung foster children reviewed had at least one parent who wasabusing drugs or alcohol in 1991 compared with 52 percent in 1986. Families with other children in foster care increased from 68 percentto 79 percent.  Further, families with no other children decreasedfrom an estimated 18 percent to 11 percent during this time. Families in 1991 had additional serious problems in common with theircounterparts in 1986 in the three locations.  For example, thepercentage of young foster children who came from families with atleast one parent absent was high in both years, estimated at about 70percent.  In addition, over 27 percent of the young foster childrenin these years came from families where both parents were absent fromthe home around the time of the child's removal, according to ourestimates.  (See fig.  3 and table II.7 in app.  II.)   Figure 3:  Family Situation in   Three Counties   (See figure in printed   edition.)\a Differences are not statistically significant at the 95-percentconfidence level. Source:  Case file review. The urgent need for attention to the problems that these familiesface is underscored by the facts that in 1991, about one-third ofthese families were comprised of drug-abusing single mothers and mosthad more than one child in foster care.  Without treatment programsdesigned for pregnant women and mothers, women are likely to continueusing drugs, leaving few alternatives to foster care for thesefamilies.  Yet, as we previously reported, access to treatmentprograms for pregnant women is lacking.\5--------------------\5 ADMS Block Grant:  Women's Set-Aside Does Not Assure DrugTreatment for Pregnant Women (GAO/HRD-91-80, May 6, 1991).    MORE CHILDREN ARE ILL OR AT   HIGH RISK------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Young children in foster care have or are at high risk for a widerange of health problems.  In the locations reviewed, young fosterchildren with serious physical health problems increasedsignificantly, to an estimated 58 percent; similarly, 62 percent ofthem were at high risk for serious health problems due to prenataldrug exposure in 1991.  The comparable estimates for 1986 were 43percent and 29 percent, respectively.\6 (See fig.  4 and table II.8in app.  II.)   Figure 4:  Health Conditions of   Young Foster Children in Three   Counties   (See figure in printed   edition.)\a Consists of prenatal drug exposure (including alcohol exposure)and drug withdrawal or symptoms. \b Consists of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), low birth weight,cardiac defects or heart problems, HIV positive or AIDS,developmentally delayed, and other serious problems. \c Consists of psychologically disturbed and behavioral problems. \d Consists of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. \e Differences are not statistically significant at the 95-percentconfidence level. \f Consists of children who did not have any of the above conditions. However, these children may have had minor illnesses. Source:  Case file review. Medical research suggests that the chronic illnesses these childrenhave or are at risk for, such as developmental delays, may have beencaused or compounded by prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol. Supportive services and treatment beyond those needed by the averagechild will be required for many of them. In addition, the number of drug-exposed children may beunderestimated.  We relied on mothers' self-reporting of drug use aswell as the more objective toxicology tests.  Yet, not all childrenor mothers are tested at birth for drugs and, when tested, onlyrecent drug use can be confirmed.  In 1991 only 59 percent of youngfoster children were known to have received a toxicology test atbirth to determine prenatal drug exposure in the days beforedelivery.  We previously reported that hospitals differ in theirefforts to identify drug-exposed infants.\7 Further, while hospitalsserving primarily Medicaid patients are more likely to performtoxicology tests than those serving primarily non-Medicaid patients,drug use during pregnancy is as likely to occur among privatelyinsured women as among those relying on public assistance for theirhealth care. --------------------\6 We considered a child to be prenatally drug-exposed if any of thefollowing conditions were documented in the child's foster carerecords:  mother self-reported drug use during pregnancy, toxicologytest results for mother or infant were positive for drug use, orinfant was diagnosed as having drug-withdrawal symptoms. \7 Drug-Exposed Infants:  A Generation at Risk (GAO/HRD-90-138, June28, 1990).       COCAINE USE ESCALATED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Cocaine was the most prevalent drug that young foster children wereknown to be prenatally exposed to in both years.  The percentage ofyoung foster children estimated to have been prenatally exposed tococaine increased significantly, from 17 percent in 1986 to 55percent in 1991.  Because toxicology tests cannot identify the formof cocaine used, we often could not determine whether crack oranother form of cocaine had been used; however, in some cases mothersself-reported crack use.  Of the children who were prenatallydrug-exposed in 1991, 24 percent of their mothers used more than onekind of drug during pregnancy.  (See fig.  5 and table II.9 in app. II.)   Figure 5:  Prenatal Drug   Exposure in Three Counties   (See figure in printed   edition.)\a Includes crack and other cocaine derivatives. \b Includes heroin and methadone. \c Differences are not statistically significant at the 95-percentconfidence level. \d Includes methamphetamines. Source:  Case file review. The increased use of cocaine by the mothers of young foster childrenadds additional urgency to the need for drug treatment programs ifthe impact of drug abuse on foster care is to be alleviated.  Studieshave found that prenatal cocaine exposure can be addictive and canresult in withdrawal symptoms, direct injuries, and disabling effectson developing fetuses.  When the crack derivative of cocaine is used,the user can become addicted much more quickly and the effects of theexposure on the fetus are more severe.  We previously reported thatresearchers attribute crack's popularity among women to its low costand the users' perception that smoking a drug is more acceptable andless intrusive than injecting one.\8 Further, we reported that astudy of prostitutes found that cocaine and crack users are as likelyas intravenous drug users to test positive for the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.  Other research hasfound that mothers who abuse cocaine are likely to have three to fivechildren.  Thus, cocaine-abusing women may have a greater impact onboth the foster and health care systems than users of other drugs. --------------------\8 Drug Abuse:  The Crack Cocaine Epidemic--Health Consequences andTreatment (GAO/HRD-91-55FS, Jan.  30, 1991).    FOSTER CARE COSTS INCREASED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6A greater portion of foster care maintenance expenditures for youngchildren shifted to the federal government between 1986 and 1991,compounding the impact of the increase in overall foster caremaintenance costs.  Much of the 110-percent growth in the populationof young foster children between 1986 and 1991 occurred among thosewho were AFDC-eligible for federal matching funds, thereby placingeven greater financial responsibility on the federal level.  (Seefig.  6 and table II.10 in app.  II.)   Figure 6:  Sources of Foster   Care Maintenance Funding in   California and New York   (See figure in printed   edition.)Source:  State electronic databases. For the three states reviewed--California, New York, andPennsylvania--total foster care maintenance expenditures, includingboth state and federal portions, increased from about $848 million in1986 to over $2 billion in 1992.\9 In 1992, foster parents of youngchildren received a minimum monthly payment of $345 in California,$353 in New York, and $330 in Pennsylvania.  However, foster parentscan receive much higher payments to care for children with specialneeds.  For example, in New York City, foster parents caring for verysick children can be paid as much as $1,281 per month for each childin their care.  Further, if foster children require specialized carein a group setting, maintenance payments could be even higher; forexample, the maximum monthly payment is $4,762 in Los Angeles County. --------------------\9 No national data exist on total costs for foster care. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :6.1We conducted our work between November 1992 and November 1993 inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Our scope and methodology are discussed further in appendix I.  Asagreed with your office, we did not obtain written comments on thisreport, but discussed its contents with state and county programofficials in California, New York, and Pennsylvania and officialsfrom HHS.  We incorporated their comments where appropriate. In addition, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, weplan no further distribution of this report until 21 days after itsissue date.  At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, the Attorney General, the Director of theOffice of National Drug Control Policy, program officials in thestates reviewed, and other interested parties.  We will also makecopies available to others upon request.  For additional information,please call me on (202) 512-7215.  Major contributors to this reportare listed in appendix III. Sincerely yours,Jane L.  RossAssociate DirectorIncome Security IssuesSCOPE AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix ITo accomplish the objectives of our review, we obtained and analyzeddata on state foster care programs and the children in them from thethree states with the largest average monthly foster care populationsin 1991--California, New York, and Pennsylvania.  Over 50 percent ofthe nations's foster children are under the jurisdiction of the threestates we reviewed. We used a variety of approaches to meet our objectives.  We analyzedelectronic state and county foster care databases; conducted a casefile review based on generalizable random samples; interviewedDepartment of Health and Human Services, state, and county fostercare officials; conducted a telephone survey of child welfareadvocacy groups and other child welfare experts; conducted groupinterviews with foster parents and case workers; reviewed foster careand related literature; reviewed applicable portions of the SocialSecurity Act and other legislation; and reviewed foster care agencyregulations and other documents.    STATEWIDE DATA--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1To determine the foster care population size, reasons for removal,and funding eligibility of young foster children, we analyzedelectronic foster care databases for states where they wereavailable, California and New York.  State officials provided us withautomated records for all children who were in foster care at anytime during calendar years 1986 and 1991. We could not obtain comparable electronic records for Pennsylvania asthat state has not established an automated case record system. Instead we relied on aggregate data available in management reportsfor 1986 and 1991 to determine the size of the state foster carepopulation.  Thus, we relied on end-of-year data, which undercountsthe total foster care population for that state. To determine the population size for all children in the threestates, we used 1986 and 1991 Bureau of the Census midyear estimates.    COUNTY CASE FILE DATA--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2To determine additional characteristics of young foster children, wereviewed statistically representative samples of foster care casefiles for the county with the largest foster care population in 1991for each of the states reviewed.  To identify those locations, weagain used the state foster care databases for California and NewYork; for Pennsylvania, we relied on information provided by stateofficials.  The counties identified are Los Angeles County, New YorkCity, and Philadelphia County, respectively.\1 To complete oursampling, Philadelphia County officials provided us with anelectronic database of foster children in that county in 1986 and1991.  Table I.1 shows the number of children in that county whoseelectronic records were initially supplied to us by county officialsand the final number of children whose records remained after weexpunged records that did not meet our criteria because they were forchildren who were in emergency homeless shelters, not foster care.

In addition, we stratified the fostercare records of the 32,123 young foster children in our population bylocation and by year.  Our initial samples contained 932 children. The population and initial sample sizes are shown in table I.2.

When used in analyses, sample strata were weighted. We requested all foster care case files for each child in thesamples.  A few case files were dropped from the samples because thechild did not meet the criteria of being in foster care during thereview year or was not of the appropriate age.  In addition, othercase files were dropped because county officials could not locatethem.  In particular, for one county, many of the 1986 case files werequested could not be found.  By comparing demographic data foravailable and unavailable case files in that county, we determinedthat the two groups had similar characteristics.  Further, state andcounty program officials told us that they are unaware of differencesbetween the available and unavailable case files and believe thatthey represent the same population.  We concluded that the droppedcase files were likely to be analogous to those we reviewed.  Thus,we used them for comparisons with 1991. Our final sample size was 759 young foster children.  We used anadjusted population size, inversely proportional to our dropout rate,to project to the county level; however, the data cannot be projectedto these states as a whole or to the national population of fosterchildren.  Initial and final sample sizes, along with the percentagesof the initial samples used, are shown in table I.3.

We examined the foster care case files beginning at a child's firstentry into foster care until the end of the review year or until thechild was discharged from foster care, whichever occurred earlier. We used an automated data collection instrument to record informationfrom the case files.  The recorded information was reviewed foraccuracy by the individual preparing it before finalizing eachelectronic record.  We also reviewed the case file data forconsistent coding among individuals; minor adjustments were made tothe coding as a result of that review. We analyzed the case file data using univariate analysis, adescriptive statistical method.  We also used a t-test to determinestatistically significant differences between the 1986 and 1991 data. In addition, when combining the strata, we weighted them to adjustfor disproportionate sampling.  Finally, we found that results fromthe three locations were similar; thus, the locations could becombined for analysis. For data derived from the case file review, the percentage estimatesreported in the letter and the numerical estimates reported inappendix II are point estimates.  The precision of these estimatesvaries with the quantitative relationship of a number of attributesin a population.  We are 95-percent confident that the pointestimates fall within the confidence intervals reported in appendixII.  Conversely, there is a 5-percent chance that the confidenceintervals do not contain the actual population. We performed limited tests of the completeness of the case files. However, we did not independently verify the accuracy of theelectronic databases provided to us by state and county officials. --------------------\1 New York City is comprised of five boroughs and is treated in thestate database as a county.

HatchChairmanThe Honorable Joseph R.  Biden, Jr.Ranking Minority MemberCommittee on the JudiciaryUnited States SenateThe Honorable William F.  GoodlingChairmanThe Honorable William L.  ClayRanking Minority MemberCommittee on Economic and Educational OpportunityHouse of RepresentativesThe 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice andDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) mandated that westudy issues related to juveniles sent to criminal court versusjuvenile court.  We agreed with your Committees to obtain data on (1)the frequency with which juveniles have been sent to criminal court,(2) the juvenile conviction rates and sentences in criminal court,(3) the dispositions of juvenile cases in juvenile court, and (4) theconditions of confinement for juveniles incarcerated in adultcorrectional facilities.  In addition, we agreed to provide a summaryof state laws that specify the circumstances under which juvenilescan be sent to criminal court. According to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice andDelinquency Prevention (OJJDP), juveniles are committing increasingnumbers of serious crimes such as murder and aggravated assaults. The number of juvenile court cases involving these offenses increasedby 68 percent from 1988 to 1992.  Each state has at least one ofthree methods--judicial waiver, prosecutor direct filing, statutoryexclusion (state laws requiring the transfer of juveniles for certaincrimes)--available for transferring juveniles to criminal court.  Inrecent years, many states have changed their laws to expand thecriteria under which juveniles may be sent to criminal court. Due to the increasing numbers of juveniles sent to criminal court andlegislative changes, juvenile justice advocates, experts, andofficials have raised concerns about the number of juveniles beingtried in criminal court.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Data limitations precluded us from determining the number ofjuveniles sent to criminal court nationwide.  However, we were ableto obtain some nationwide data on the number of judicial waivers.  Inaddition, we obtained some state data on the number of prosecutordirect filing cases.  Data on the number of statutory exclusion caseswere not available. Our analysis of nationwide estimates from the National Center forJuvenile Justice (NCJJ)\1 showed that juvenile court judgestransferred to criminal court less than 2 percent of juveniledelinquency cases that were filed in juvenile court from 1988 through1992.  Over that period, cases transferred by judges increased from1.2 to 1.6 percent of formal delinquency cases.\2Additionally, the state data we obtained from five states and theDistrict of Columbia and the county data we obtained for a fewcounties in five other states showed that the number of juvenilecases filed directly in criminal court in the states that permittedprosecutor direct filing ranged from less than 1 percent to 13percent.  For example, based on data obtained, prosecutor directfiling cases represented about 13 percent of juvenile cases inArkansas and less than 1 percent in Utah. Because data were not available on the number of cases excluded bystatute from juvenile court, we reviewed state statutes to identifythe possible impact of the statutes on the juveniles.  Our review ofstate laws that exclude certain juveniles from juvenile courtjurisdiction showed that the laws primarily focused on seriousviolent offenses and/or juveniles with prior court records. Since 1978, 44 states and the District of Columbia have passed newlaws that affect which juveniles may be sent to criminal court andthe process for their transfer to criminal court.  While some of thenew state laws are expected to have an impact on the frequency withwhich juveniles are sent to criminal court, the extent of the impactmay vary. In 24 states and the District of Columbia, the new laws havegenerally increased the population of juveniles potentially subjectto being sent to criminal court.  This was done by either decreasingthe age or increasing the types of offenses for which juveniles maybe sent to criminal court.  For example, in California the populationof juveniles that juvenile court judges can waive to criminal courtchanged from age 16 for any offense to age 14 for specified offensesand age 16 for other offenses.  Also, in New Jersey, offenses such asfirst degree robbery and some weapons offenses have been added to thelist of offenses that may be judicially waived. Three states passed laws that tended to decrease the population ofjuveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.  Theother 17 states that passed new laws did not increase the populationof juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.  Inthese states, the new laws changed the method in which certainjuveniles may be sent to criminal court.  For example, in Minnesotain 1978, a child age 14 or older charged with any offense could bejudicially waived to criminal court.  Currently, however, a child age16 or older charged with first degree murder is statutorily excludedfrom juvenile court rather than eligible for judicial waiver. Appendix IV summarizes the laws of each state and the District ofColumbia. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' 1989 and 1990 OffenderBased Transaction Statistics (OBTS) data from seven states,\3conviction rates of juveniles prosecuted in criminal court forserious violent, serious property, and drug offenses varied withinand among states.  However, juveniles in six of those states tendedto be convicted.  Of those juveniles convicted, property offensesmade up the largest proportion of juvenile convictions in five of theseven states.  Further, in four of seven states incarceration ratesranged from 62 to 100 percent for all three offenses.  Of those 703juveniles incarcerated in the seven states, serious violent offendersand serious property offenders accounted for the same proportion ofjuveniles incarcerated, 39 percent.  In contrast, some juvenilesconvicted of serious violent offenses received probation in five ofthe seven states.  The percentages varied from 3 percent inCalifornia to 50 percent in Vermont. We were requested to provide data on the disposition of juveniles injuvenile court.  According to OJJDP data, many juveniles were placedon probation in juvenile court.  In 1992, juveniles were placed onprobation in about 43 percent of approximately 744,000 formaldelinquency cases.  Of the remaining 57 percent of juvenile cases, 27percent were dismissed, 17 percent of the juveniles were placed in aresidential treatment program, and 12 percent of them received someother disposition such as restitution, fines, or community service. About 1 percent were transferred to criminal court. In the four states we visited, juveniles sentenced to adult prisonsgenerally were to be subject to the same policies and procedures asadults; however, in three of the four states we visited, youngerinmates (typically those under age 26) were housed in separateprisons.  At all the facilities, juveniles generally were to beprovided with the same health services; afforded the sameeducational, vocational, and work opportunities; and provided accessto the same recreational facilities as older inmates. --------------------\1 NCJJ, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the researchdivision of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. \2 See page 7 for a discussion of formal and informal delinquencycases. \3 Appendix I contains an explanation for our selection of the sevenstates.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2A juvenile is an individual at or below the maximum age of juvenilecourt jurisdiction.  Established by state statute, the maximum age ofjuvenile court jurisdiction is the oldest age at which an individualcan be processed in juvenile court.\4Individuals who are above the maximum age of juvenile courtjurisdiction are considered adults and therefore are under criminalcourt jurisdiction.  In 39 states and the District of Columbia themaximum age is 17.  In 11 states,\5 the maximum age is either 15 or16.  Except for Wyoming (where the maximum age dropped from age 18 to17), the maximum age had not changed in any state, when comparing thestate laws in 1978 with the laws in 1994. Although the organization of state juvenile justice systems varies,two options are generally provided for processing juveniledelinquency cases--formal and informal.  An authorized court official(e.g., juvenile prosecutor or juvenile probation officer) decideswhether to process the case formally through the court system orinformally by diverting the case from the juvenile court. For handling formal cases, a petition must be drafted and filed toprovide notice of the offenses that will be pursued and to requestthe court to adjudicate--judicially determine (judge) whether or notthe youth is a delinquent offender.\6 For informal cases there is noformal court petition or legal instrument requesting the court toadjudicate the youth as a delinquent.  Whether the case is handledformally or informally, juveniles receive dispositions.  Dispositionoptions may include dismissal of the case, probation, fines orrestitution, community service, and placement. A juvenile who is at or below the maximum age of juvenile courtjurisdiction may be sent to criminal court by one of the followingthree methods:   judicial waiver, which allows juvenile court judges to transfer     juveniles to criminal court.  Generally, prosecutors initiate     judicial waiver by filing a waiver petition asking the judge to     consider the case for waiver;  prosecutor direct filing, which allows prosecutors to decide     whether to file certain cases in juvenile or criminal court;  application of statutory exclusion laws, which specify crimes or     juveniles with certain prior records that are excluded from     juvenile court jurisdiction. For each method, the prosecutor plays an important role indetermining whether a juvenile will be sent to criminal court.  Forexample, the offense with which the prosecutor charges the accusedcan determine whether the juvenile falls under a state's criteria forcriminal court prosecution. Juveniles prosecuted in state criminal court are subject to the samestate court procedures and sentencing guidelines as other defendantsin criminal court. --------------------\4 Most states have given the juvenile court authority over juvenileswho are above the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction.  Thisis called the extended age of juvenile court jurisdiction.  It is theage at which the juvenile court can retain jurisdiction of a juvenileadjudicated as a delinquent.  For example, in Michigan where themaximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is age 16, a juvenile whois adjudicated in juvenile court as a delinquent and has adisposition that extends beyond the upper age of juvenile courtjurisdiction would still be under the jurisdiction of the juvenilecourt until age 21. \5 In Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina the maximum age ofjuvenile court jurisdiction is 15.  In Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana,Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas themaximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is 16. \6 In the remainder of this report, cases where the intake decisionis to proceed formally will be referred to as formal cases.    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3To determine the frequency with which juveniles were sent to criminalcourt, we developed estimates of the number of juvenile casestransferred to criminal court by juvenile court judges (judicialwaiver) using the NCJJ national data--National Juvenile Court DataArchive (NJCDA)--for calendar years 1988 through 1992.  As part ofour analysis of judicial waivers, we developed estimates of the age,sex, race, and offense profiles of juveniles transferred to criminalcourt by judges in Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri,Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Utah. Data limitations precluded us from developing estimates of the totalnumber of juvenile cases filed directly in criminal court byprosecutors (prosecutor direct filing) and those juveniles excludedfrom juvenile court because of the offense committed and/or priorcourt records (statutory exclusion) in those states permitting thesemethods.  We did, however, contact state court officials in theDistrict of Columbia and 10 states that we identified as havingdirect filing laws and analyzed data they provided.  We analyzed thestatutory exclusion laws in the District of Columbia and 37 statesthat we identified as having these laws to determine the types ofoffenses and/or prior court records that exclude juveniles fromjuvenile court.\7To analyze the sentences of juveniles tried in criminal court,\8we used criminal court data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\9We identified offenses, conviction rates, and incarceration rates inCalifornia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania,and Vermont. To gather prosecutors opinions on data related to the processing ofjuveniles in criminal courts, we sent a survey to a nationallyrepresentative sample of district prosecutor offices that dealt withjuveniles in juvenile court. To determine the conditions of confinement for juveniles incorrectional facilities, we visited seven prisons in Florida,Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio. To provide a summary of state laws governing which juveniles may besent to criminal court, we reviewed the statutes for all 50 statesand the District of Columbia. Appendix I presents more details about our objectives, scope, andmethodology, including a discussion of how we selected the states andprisons we visited.  Our results apply to states and prisons forwhich we collected data and cannot be projected to other locations. We did not verify data provided by the states.  We did our work fromMay 1993 through April 1995 in accordance with generally acceptedgovernment auditing standards.  Since no federal agency hasresponsibility for the issues addressed in this report, we did notobtain comments on a draft of this report.  However, we did discussour results with NCJJ and OJJDP officials and, where appropriate,incorporated their comments. --------------------\7 An analysis of state laws under which juveniles may be sent tocriminal court focused on the laws in effect during calendar year1978 (Youth in Adult Courts:  Between Two Worlds, Hamparian, 1982). We used this study as the baseline for our analysis of the changesthat were made in the state laws regarding the basis on whichjuveniles may be sent to criminal court.  Our analysis focused on thelaws passed through 1994, some of which were not in effect until1995. \8 We classified cases as juveniles on the basis of the defendants'age at the time of arrest because data were not available for thedefendants' age at the time of offense. \9 The Bureau's dataset did not contain all dispositions occurring ina given year, only those reported to the state and for which thestate had a previous arrest reported.    LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE   INDICATED RELATIVELY FEW   JUVENILES SENT TO CRIMINAL   COURT------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Limited nationwide and state data existed on the total number ofjuvenile cases sent to criminal court.  However, we obtainedinformation on the number of juvenile cases sent to criminal court byjudicial waiver and some information on the number sent by prosecutordirect filing.  Since data on statutory exclusions were notavailable, we analyzed state statutes to identify the possible impactof the statutes on juveniles. According to our analysis of NCJJ data, the rate at which juvenilecourt judges sent formal delinquency cases to criminal court hasremained less than 2 percent from 1988 to 1992.  Additionally, dataavailable from 5 states, the District of Columbia, and a few countiesin 5 other states on the number of prosecutor direct filing casesfiled in criminal court annually showed that it ranged from 4 casesin one state to about 7,200 cases in another state.  Our analysis ofstatutory exclusion laws indicated that the laws generallyestablished specific criteria that focused on juveniles (1) chargedwith serious violent offenses and/or (2) with previous court records. In addition, our analysis showed that legislation passed in the last16 years included two primary types of changes:  (1) in 24 states andthe District of Columbia legislative changes tended to increase thepopulation of juveniles who may be sent to criminal court and (2) in17 other states, recent legislation changed the method in whichcertain juveniles may be sent to criminal court (e.g., from thejudicial waiver to the prosecutor direct filing). The results of our national survey of state prosecutors suggestedthat in most prosecutorial offices, judicial waivers accounted for ahigher percentage of juveniles arriving in criminal court than directfilings or statutory exclusions.       TRANSFER AND SENTENCING OF      JUVENILES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1We identified (1) judicial waiver laws in 47 states and the Districtof Columbia, (2) prosecutor direct filing laws in 10 states and theDistrict of Columbia, and (3) one or more statutory exclusion laws in37 states and the District of Columbia. We also identified 21 states with provisions that allow criminalcourt judges to transfer cases from criminal court to juvenile courtunder circumstances specified in the law (reverse waiver).  Forexample, in Arkansas, when a prosecutor directly files a case incriminal court, the criminal court judge may remand the case tojuvenile court.  In addition, we identified 19 states that allowjuveniles prosecuted and convicted in criminal court to receivedispositions as a juvenile under specified circumstances.  Forexample, in California a juvenile convicted in criminal court mayreceive a disposition as a juvenile if the California Youth Authoritydetermines that the juvenile is amenable to treatment. See table 1 for a summary of the state statutes and appendix IV for adetailed summary of statutes in all 50 states and the District ofColumbia that govern which juveniles may be sent to criminal court.

JUDICIAL WAIVER RATE HAS      INCREASED FROM 1988 THROUGH      1992---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2The percent of formal delinquency cases judicially waived to criminalcourt (judicial waiver rate) increased by 33 percent from 1.2 percentin 1988 to 1.6 percent in 1992, which represented a growth from about7,000 to almost 12,000 cases a year, as shown in table 2.  Thisincrease occurred while the total number of formal delinquency casesincreased by about 31 percent; the number of waived cases increasedabout 68 percent.

Theperson category includes criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery,aggravated assault, simple assault, and other person offenses--suchas kidnapping and harassment.  The property category includesburglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, arson, vandalism, stolenproperty offenses, trespassing, and other property offenses--such asfraud, counterfeiting, and embezzlement.  The drug category includesunlawful sale, purchase, distribution, manufacture, cultivation,transport, possession or use of a controlled or prohibited substanceor drug.  The public order category includes weapons offenses,nonviolent sex offenses, and liquor law violations. \a The waiver rate is the ratio of the number of waived cases to thenumber of formal delinquency cases.  The percentage of alldelinquency cases which were handled formally varied across states. Source:  Developed by GAO from NJCDA data. Data showed that judicial waiver rates varied by offense type, asshown in table 3.  The judicial waiver rate for person offenses in1992 was 2.4 percent in contrast to the waiver rate for propertyoffenses, which was 1.3 percent.  Therefore, judges were more likelyto waive cases to criminal court involving juveniles charged withperson offenses than juveniles charged with property offenses in1992.  While the waiver rates for all the offenses increased from1988 through 1992, the waiver rates for drug offenses increased themost; however, the rate decreased between 1991 and 1992.\10                           Table 3                          Judicial Waiver Rate by OffenseOffense                 1988    1989    1990    1991    1992--------------------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------Person                  1.9%    2.0%    2.1%    2.4%    2.4%Property                 1.2     1.2     1.1     1.2     1.3Drugs                    1.5     2.8     2.7     4.4     3.1Public order             0.5     0.5     0.6     0.7     0.8------------------------------------------------------------Source:  Developed by GAO using NJCDA data. While the chances of juvenile cases being waived to criminal courtwere highest for juveniles charged with person and drug offenses,property offenders made up the largest proportion of waived cases, asshown in table 4.  This was due to the prevalence of propertyoffenses versus person or drug offenses.  For example, NCJJ datashowed that in 1992, referrals to juvenile court were about 401,000or 54 percent for property offenses, about 165,000 or 22 percent forperson offenses, and 46,000 or 6 percent for drug offenses.

Source:  Developed by GAO from NCJJ data. Also shown in table 4, the offense profile of judicially waived caseschanged from 1988 to 1992.  For example, person offenses increasedfrom 29 percent of the cases waived in 1988 to 34 percent in 1992. In addition, property offense cases decreased from 53 percent of thecases waived in 1988 to 45 percent in 1992. Similar to the offense profile, the demographic profile of juvenilecases waived to criminal court had changed slightly from 1988 to 1992(see table 5).  For example, the percentage of waived cases forjuveniles age 16 or older decreased from 93 percent in 1988 to 88percent in 1992.  Also, the racial makeup of juveniles whose caseswere waived changed since 1988 when about 54 percent were white, 43percent were black, and 2 percent were of other races.  In 1992,about 47 percent of juveniles whose cases were waived were white, 50percent were black, and 3 percent were of other races.

Source:  Developed by GAO from NCJJ's data archive. --------------------\10 We used juvenile court data collected annually by NCJJ todetermine the number of juvenile cases processed in criminal courtdue to judicial waiver.  Each year, NCJJ collects juvenile courtprocessing data from various states and jurisdictions and assignsweights to the data, which permits projecting the data to producenational estimates of cases disposed by all state juvenile justicesystems.       ANALYSIS OF WAIVER RATES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3To provide perspective on patterns of waiver rates across the sixstates, we examined data on the number of juveniles charged withviolent, property, and drug offenses.  We used these three offensesbecause the number of cases for each offense allowed comparisons. Our analysis focused on the potential effects on waiver rates forfive variables--age (for six states), sex (for six states), race (forsix states), nature of locality (metropolitan or nonmetropolitan, forfour states), and number of prior referrals (for five states).\11 Weexamined each of the variables separately because we could notcontrol for variables for which data were not available and becauseof the small number of cases waived in each offense type within thestate.  (Tables II.3, II.6, II.9, II.12, II.15, and II.18 contain thedata used in our analysis.)--------------------\11 The states differed because of the availability of data.  Utahdid not have a sufficient number of cases to be included in thisanalysis.  For the other six NCJJ states, all were included for age,sex, and race; Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolinahad data for metropolitan/nonmetropolitan locality; and Arizona,Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina had informationon prior referrals.          VARIABLES-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3.1Age - In the six states we examined, juveniles 16 years or older weremore likely to have their cases waived for all three offense types. Gender - Males were more likely than females to have their caseswaived within each offense type in the six states we analyzed.  Theextent of the difference again varied by state. Race - Blacks were more likely than whites to have their cases waivedfor all three offenses in four of the six states we examined. Locality - In the four NCJJ states with data on type of courtlocation, some small differences existed but were not consistentacross offense types within the same state. Prior Referrals - In the five states we examined, waiver ratesgenerally increased with the number of prior referrals for all fivestates and most offense types. Appendix II contains data on the percent of cases waived, thedemographic characteristics for juveniles in the seven states, and adetailed discussion of our analysis of waiver rates.       JUDICIAL WAIVER CRITERIA---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.4Whether a juvenile case is eligible for judicial waiver depends onthe state.  Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia havejudicial waiver laws, and each state establishes different criteriafor which cases may be waived.  The criteria often include specificage and offense restrictions as well as factors that the judge mustconsider related to the juvenile's case.  For example, juvenilejudges in Florida can waive a case to criminal court involving ajuvenile age 14 or older for any offense if there is a finding thatthe juvenile should be transferred after considering certain factors;whereas judges in Maryland can waive a case involving a juvenile age15 or older for any offense and a juvenile of any age charged with acrime punishable by death or life imprisonment if there is a findingthat the juvenile is unfit for juvenile rehabilitative measures.  Inaddition, the U.S.  Supreme Court in an appendix to Kent v.  UnitedStates, 383 U.S.  541 (1966),\12 outlined certain factors that thejuvenile court judge would consider when making waiver decisionsunder the specific statute.  The factors from the 1966 court caseincluded  seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the     protection of the community requires waiver;  whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent,     premeditated, or willful manner;  whether the offense was committed against persons or against     property, with greater weight being given to offenses against     persons, especially if personal injury resulted;  prosecutive merit of the complaint;  whether the juveniles' associates in the offenses were adults;  sophistication and maturity of the juvenile;  juveniles' record and previous history;  protection of the public; and  likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile by the use     of procedures, services, and facilities that are available to     the juvenile court. Many states have incorporated these factors into their juvenile codeseither verbatim or with minor modifications.  In interviews withjudges in seven states and in our nationwide survey of prosecutors,we asked which factors from a list (based on factors previouslylisted) they were most likely to consider when making waiverdecisions.  The factors chosen most often by judges and prosecutorswere the seriousness of the offense, the juveniles' previous recordand history, and whether the juvenile was amenable to rehabilitation. While we were unable to get an estimate of the total number of waiverpetitions filed by prosecutors, information collected in our surveyof prosecutors suggested that more than half of the requests forjudicial waivers filed in calendar year 1993 were granted.\13 We arenot certain of the reliability of these figures because theirresponses may have been on the basis of impressions rather than data. See appendix II for additional data on judicial waivers in the sevenstates. --------------------\12 The U.S.  Supreme Court in Kent also set forth a number ofprocedural safeguards to protect the interests of the child--theright to a hearing that meets the essentials of due process and fairtreatment, representation by counsel, access by the juvenile'sattorney to the juvenile's social record, and a statement of reasonsin support of the waiver order if the juvenile case is waived. \13 See appendix I for survey responses and confidence intervals.       LIMITED DATA INDICATED THE      USE OF PROSECUTOR DIRECT      FILING VARIES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.5State data and data for only some counties were available in theDistrict of Columbia and 10 states that allow prosecutor directfiling.

Source:  Developed by GAO using data provided by state and localcourt officials in jurisdiction listed. While the data provided by state and local court officials wereinconsistent and incomplete, (e.g., lack of statewide data and timeperiods were different) they indicated that the frequency of usingdirect filing varied throughout the states that have direct filinglaws.  Data provided by juvenile court officials on the number ofdelinquency cases filed in these jurisdictions compared with dataprovided by criminal court officials on the number of cases directlyfiled by prosecutors showed that direct filing cases represented alarger percentage of juvenile cases in some states than in others. For example, in Florida and Arkansas prosecutor direct filing casesrepresented about 10 percent of juveniles cases, and in Colorado andWayne County, Michigan they represented about 1 percent. Direct filing laws in 10 states and the District of Columbiagenerally focused on felony offenses for juveniles over an agespecified in each state's laws.  However, juveniles age 16 inNebraska and Vermont and age 17 in Wyoming can be direct filed incriminal court for any offense.  In jurisdictions with direct filinglaws, prosecutors had discretion to decide whether to file the casein juvenile or criminal court.  The extent to which prosecutorsexercise their discretion was exemplified by data provided bycriminal court officials in Arkansas and Wayne County, Michigan. These data showed that many of the cases eligible for direct filingremained in juvenile court.  For example, in Arkansas 2,756 caseswere eligible to be filed in criminal court in 1992.  However, duringthat period, prosecutors directly filed about 45 percent of the casesin criminal court.  In addition, in Wayne County 146 juvenile caseswere eligible to be filed in criminal court in 1992.  However, duringthat period less than half the cases, 61 (or 42 percent), were filedin criminal court.       FREQUENCY OF JUVENILE CASES      STATUTORILY EXCLUDED FROM      JUVENILE COURT UNKNOWN---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.6Data were not available on the number of cases excluded by law fromjuvenile court jurisdiction.\14 Without state data, we were unable todetermine the frequency of statutory exclusion cases sent to criminalcourt.  We were, however, able to analyze the laws to determine theconditions under which juveniles were excluded from juvenile court(see table 7 for our analysis).  According to our analysis, statutoryexclusion laws focused primarily on juveniles charged with seriousviolent offenses and/or juveniles with previous juvenile or criminalcourt records.  In addition, 15 states also excluded one or moreother serious offense (e.g., a child age 16 or older carrying ahandgun without a license in Indiana). In 17 of the 37 states with statutory exclusion laws, the lawsexcluded juveniles charged with serious violent offenses andjuveniles with prior court records (repeat offenders) from juvenilecourt.  For example, in Pennsylvania, any juvenile charged withmurder is excluded from juvenile court as well as any juvenile whohas been previously found guilty in a criminal proceeding.  In 13 ofthe 37 states, the focus of the statutory exclusion laws are toexclude juveniles charged with serious violent offenses from juvenilecourt.  For example, in New York, any juvenile age 13 or oldercharged with murder in the second degree is to be prosecuted incriminal court.  In addition, New York excludes juveniles age 14 orolder from juvenile court for a list of serious violent crimes thatinclude assault, rape, and manslaughter, each in the first degree. New York does not have any exclusion provisions on the basis of thejuvenile's prior record.  In 7 of the 37 states and in the Districtof Columbia, the focus of the statutory exclusion laws is to excludejuveniles with prior criminal court records from juvenile courtjurisdiction.  These laws apply to all juveniles with specified priorrecords (i.e., adult court convictions) regardless of their offenses. For example, in Virginia, any juvenile previously convicted as anadult is excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction regardless of theoffense.\15While statutory exclusion laws in most states focus on seriousviolent offenses and prior records, in 15 states one or more otherserious offenses such as burglary, weapons, and drug offenses areexcluded.  For example, in Maryland using, wearing, carrying, ortransporting a firearm during a drug trafficking offense wouldexclude a juvenile age 16 or older from juvenile court jurisdiction.

These states are Alabama, Alaska,Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, andVermont. Legend:  x indicates the conditions for which each state excludedjuveniles from juvenile court. Source:  GAO review of state statutes. --------------------\14 Using 1990 data, NCJJ estimates that in 11 states where themaximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is age 15 or 16,approximately 176,000 cases involving persons age 16 and 17 areautomatically charged in criminal court each year because they aredefined as adults by the state.  However, there is no estimate on thenumber of juveniles at or below the maximum age of juvenile courtjurisdiction that are charged in criminal court due to their offenseand/or prior record. \15 For those juveniles who were previously convicted and servedtheir sentences in facilities, the likelihood would be small thatthey would still be under the maximum age of jurisdiction if theywere subsequently charged with another crime.       CHANGES IN STATE LAWS MAY      AFFECT THE NUMBER OF      JUVENILES SENT TO CRIMINAL      COURT AND THE METHOD FOR      SENDING CERTAIN JUVENILES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.7Since 1978, 44 states and the District of Columbia have passed lawsthat have an effect on which juveniles may be sent to criminal court. These laws could affect the number of juveniles sent to criminalcourt; however, the impact may vary.  In 24 of these states and theDistrict of Columbia, the laws have tended to increase the populationof juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.  Inthree states, the population of juveniles subject to being sent tocriminal court decreased.  In 17 states, the laws changed the methodin which certain juveniles are sent to criminal court. In 24 states\16 and the District of Columbia the laws that identifyjuveniles who may be sent to criminal court increased the populationof juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court. For example, in 1978, California law allowed juvenile court judges towaive the case of any juvenile age 16 or older.  Since then, a lawwas passed that allows juvenile court judges to also waive casesinvolving juveniles 14 or older for a list of specific offenses. This change increased the number of juveniles that are subject tobeing sent to criminal court.  Also, in 1978, North Dakota lawallowed judges to waive the case of a juvenile age 16 years or oldercharged with a "crime or public offense." Since then, a new law waspassed that allows juvenile court judges to also waive casesinvolving juveniles 14 years or older charged with committing an actthat involves the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm.  NewMexico, South Dakota, and Wyoming changed their laws, which had theeffect of decreasing the population of juveniles potentially subjectto being sent to criminal court.  For example, in 1978, Wyoming lawallowed judges to waive the case of a child of any age for anyoffense to criminal court.  Currently, only cases involving childrenage 13 or older can be waived to criminal court. In the remaining 17 states,\17 the new laws changed the method inwhich certain juvenile cases may be sent to criminal court but didnot increase the size of the potential population of juveniles thatmay be sent to criminal court.  In general, these laws have changedthe process for sending juveniles to criminal court.  For example, in1988, Michigan passed a law that gives prosecutors the discretion todirectly file cases in criminal court involving juveniles who are age15 or older and are charged with a list of specific crimes.  Prior tothis law, these cases would be filed initially in juvenile court, andthe prosecutors would have to request a waiver hearing for thosecases they believed should be sent to criminal court.  During thewaiver hearing, the juvenile court judge would decide whether towaive the case to criminal court. Maryland also changed the process by excluding from juvenile courtjuveniles age 16 or older charged with certain specified violentcrimes and other serious crimes.  Previously, the juvenile courtjudge decided whether these cases should be sent to criminal court;however, state law now establishes the criteria by which certainjuvenile cases are sent to criminal court. --------------------\16 The states that have passed laws that increased the population ofjuveniles who may be sent to criminal court are Alabama, Arkansas,California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana,Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, NorthCarolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina,Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. \17 The states that have passed laws that changed the method in whichcertain juveniles may be sent to criminal court are Alaska, Colorado,Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah,and Washington.       PROSECUTOR SURVEY INDICATED      JUDICIAL WAIVER USED MOST---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.8We surveyed a sample of prosecutors' offices to obtain information onthe estimated percent of all indictments filed against juveniles incriminal court that were the result of judicial waiver, directfilings, and statutory exclusions.  The survey results suggested thatin most prosecutorial offices, judicial waivers accounted for ahigher percentage of juveniles arriving in criminal court than directfilings or statutory exclusions.\18 Further, we estimated that inabout 60 percent of the offices only judicial waivers were used. However, the results are difficult to interpret because of missingdata and potentially inconsistent completion by the respondents. --------------------\18 See appendix I for survey responses and confidence intervals.    JUVENILES PROSECUTED IN   CRIMINAL COURT FOR CERTAIN   OFFENSES TENDED TO BE CONVICTED   AND INCARCERATED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5Our analysis of 1989 and 1990 criminal court data for seven statesindicated that most juveniles prosecuted in criminal court in eachstate were convicted.  Further, most juveniles were convicted ofproperty offenses.  When juveniles were sentenced in criminal courtfor serious offenses, most were incarcerated.       MOST JUVENILES PROSECUTED      FOR SERIOUS OFFENSES IN      CRIMINAL COURT WERE      CONVICTED IN SIX OF SEVEN      STATES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Our analysis of conviction rates in seven states--California,Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania, andVermont--showed that states conviction rates for juveniles prosecutedin criminal court, during 1989 and 1990 combined, varied for seriousviolent, serious property, and drug offenses.\19 For example, asshown in table 8, the conviction rate for serious violent offenses inMissouri was 50 percent.  Conviction rates for serious propertyoffenses in Pennsylvania and Vermont were 63 percent and 97 percent,respectively.

Source:  Developed by GAO from OBTS data. To provide some perspective on how juveniles were treated as comparedwith others prosecuted in criminal court, we compared juvenileconviction rates with the conviction rates of "other youth"\20 age 16or 17 and young adults ages 18 to 24 (see tables III.1 and III.2 inapp.  III for conviction rates for other youth and young adults). The data for other youth and young adults includes a broader range ofcrimes within crime types (than juveniles' crimes) because all youthand young adults crimes are prosecuted in criminal court.  Somejuvenile crimes are tried in criminal court because of the severityof juveniles' offenses or prior records.  Our analysis of the twostates, Missouri and New York, which included the other youthpopulation,\21 showed that in Missouri, juvenile conviction rateswere higher than the rates of other youth (persons of age 17).  Forexample, the conviction rate for juveniles prosecuted for seriousproperty offenses in Missouri was 67 percent compared with 38 percentfor other youth.  In New York, conviction rates were lower forjuveniles than they were for other youth (persons age 16 and 17). For example, the conviction rate for juveniles prosecuted in New Yorkfor serious property offenses was 26 percent compared with 64 percentfor other youth. A comparison of conviction rates in the states we analyzed forjuveniles and young adults (persons age 18 through 24) showed thatgenerally, juveniles were, for some offenses, as likely as youngadults to be convicted in criminal court.  Finally, juvenileconviction rates for serious violent, serious property, and drugoffenses were generally similar to the rates for young adults in thestates we analyzed, except for New York.  For example, the convictionrate for serious property offenses in Minnesota was 97 percent forjuveniles compared with 89 percent for young adults.  Also, theconviction rate for drug offenses in Pennsylvania was 83 percent forjuveniles compared with 81 percent for young adults. Our analysis of juvenile conviction offenses showed, in five\22of seven states, that property offenses made up the largestproportion of juvenile convictions in criminal court, representingbetween 36 and 66 percent of convictions, as shown in table 9.  InCalifornia and New York, violent offenses accounted for the largestproportion of juvenile convictions.

Source:  Developed by GAO using OBTS data. Similar to juveniles, the largest percentage of other youth and youngadults convicted in criminal court were property offenders.  (Seetables III.3 and III.4 in app.  III for conviction offenses of otheryouth and young adults.) In California and New York, the largestproportion of young adults convicted were drug offenders.  Forexample, 37 percent of young adults in California and 33 percent inNew York were convicted of drug offenses. --------------------\19 Using OBTS data, we categorized offense types into seriousviolent, serious property, and drugs.  Serious violent offensesinclude murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravatedassault, and other violent offenses (e.g., sexual assault andkidnapping).  Serious property offenses include burglary, fraud,forgery, embezzlement, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Drugoffenses include drug possession and trafficking. \20 "Other youth" are individuals beyond the maximum age of juvenilecourt jurisdiction in their state and are below the age 18. \21 Unlike the other five states where the maximum age of juvenilecourt jurisdiction is 17, in Missouri, the maximum age is 16, and inNew York it is 15.  Therefore, in Missouri other youth areindividuals of age 17, and in New York, other youth are individualsof age 16 and 17.  In both states, these other youths are legallyconsidered as adults and are under the original jurisdiction of thecriminal court. \22 The five states where property offenses made up the largestproportion of juvenile convictions in criminal court were Minnesota,Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.       MOST JUVENILES SENTENCED IN      CRIMINAL COURT FOR SERIOUS      OFFENSES WERE INCARCERATED---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2In four\23 of seven states we analyzed, over half of the juvenilessentenced in criminal court for serious violent, serious property, ordrug offenses were incarcerated in each state.  Incarcerationrates\24 for these offenses varied among states, as shown in table10.  In Vermont, incarceration rates for these offenses were 33percent or less.  In addition, in Missouri the incarceration rate fordrug offenders was 43 percent.  Also, in Pennsylvania theincarceration rate for serious property offenders was 10 percent. Among the 7 states, a total of 703 juveniles was sentenced toincarceration in the 3 offense types during 1989 and 1990.

To determine whether juveniles were incarcerated at rates similar toothers in criminal court, we compared juvenile sentences with thoseof other youth and young adults.  (See tables III.5 and III.6 in app. III for incarceration rates for other youth and young adults.) In thetwo states with an "other youth population," Missouri and New York,juvenile incarceration rates for serious violent and serious propertyoffenses were higher than incarceration rates for these offenses forother youth.  For example, in Missouri, 80 percent of juvenilessentenced were incarcerated for serious violent offenses comparedwith 60 percent of other youth.  The juvenile incarceration rates fordrug offenses were lower than the rates for other youth in Missouriand about equal to the rates for other youth in New York. Finally, we found no consistent pattern when comparing juvenile andyoung adult incarceration rates (see table III.6 in app.  III).  Forsome offenses juvenile incarceration rates were higher than youngadult incarceration rates, while for other offenses juvenile rateswere lower.  For example, in New York, the incarceration rate fordrug offenses was lower for juveniles, 62 percent, compared with 80percent for young adults.  In contrast, in Nebraska, theincarceration rates for serious violent offenses were higher forjuveniles, 93 percent, compared with 78 percent for young adults. In the seven states, the proportion of juveniles incarcerated forserious property offenses was the same as the proportion incarceratedfor serious violent offenses but varied among the states.  Drugoffenders made up a smaller proportion of the total number ofjuveniles incarcerated (see table 11).  In contrast, drug offendersmade up the largest proportion of other youth and young adultsincarcerated.  (See tables III.7 and III.8 in app.  III for the totalnumber of other youth and young adults incarcerated.)

Additionally, juveniles convicted of serious property or drugoffenses in four states received probation at higher rates thanjuveniles convicted of serious violent offenses.  Overall, whilejuveniles convicted of serious violent, serious property, and drugoffenses generally did not receive fines as their sentences, in twostates, a significant percentage of these juveniles were sentenced topay fines.  In Pennsylvania, 84 percent of juveniles convicted ofserious property offenses were fined, and in Vermont, 33 percent ofjuveniles convicted of drug offenses were fined. According to the literature, criminal court judges consider theseverity of the offenses and the prior offense history of thejuvenile in making their sentencing decisions.  However, datalimitations precluded us from considering the prior offense historyin our analysis.    PROBATION WAS THE MOST COMMON   DISPOSITION BY JUVENILE COURT------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6Our analysis of NCJJ data showed that probation was the most widelyused disposition in the juvenile court.  In 1992, in about 43 percentof approximately 744,000 formal delinquency cases,\25juveniles were placed on probation.  In addition, probation was themost common disposition for all offense types.  A probationdisposition involves the court monitoring the juvenile's behavior,helping the juvenile find a job, arranging in-home or out-of-homecare, or promoting wholesome leisure time activities.  Of the 57percent of juveniles not placed on probation in 1992, about 27percent of their cases were dismissed, 12 percent received some otherdisposition, and 17 percent received placement (e.g., were placed ina residential treatment program), as shown in table 13.  Finally, thedistribution of formal dispositions was similar during the 5-yearperiod, 1988 through 1992.

THE FEW JUVENILES IN ADULT   PRISONS WE VISITED WERE SUBJECT   TO THE SAME POLICIES AND   PROCEDURES AS ADULTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7A 1991 survey\27 of inmates in state correctional facilities reportedthat less than 1 percent of state inmates were age 17 or younger. Few juveniles were incarcerated in the seven adult facilities wevisited.  Further, those juveniles were generally to be treated thesame as the adult prisoners. --------------------\27 This survey was conducted by the U.S.  Bureau of the Census forthe U.S.  Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics.       JUVENILES IN ADULT PRISONS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1We could not find national estimates for the number of inmates at orbelow the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction in each state. However, results of the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State CorrectionalFacilities indicated that less than 1 percent of the 712,000 stateprison inmates were age 17 or younger.\28 In addition, during visitsto seven prisons in four states, we found that juveniles representeda small number of the inmate population, at the time of our visit. For example, as shown in table 16, 31 of the 857 inmates at theWestern Youth Institution were age 17 or younger.  While these dataindicate that few juveniles were in the adult prison system at onetime, it does not include the number of inmates who committed theiroffenses as juveniles and were sentenced to incarceration but are nowbeyond the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction, as defined bythe state.

JUVENILES ARE TO BE TREATED      SAME AS ADULTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.2According to prison officials at all of the locations we visited,juveniles convicted in criminal court and sentenced to prison areconsidered adults.  Generally, they are subject to the same policesand procedures as other inmates regarding housing, health careservices, education, vocation and work programs, and recreationalactivities.  In addition, they are to be afforded the same mail,visitation, and telephone privileges.  However, some prison officialspointed out that juveniles and youthful offenders received differenttreatment at some facilities (e.g., they were provided with a menudesigned for their nutritional needs and they received moreeducational opportunities).  See appendix V for a summary of theconfinement conditions for juveniles in seven adult correctionalfacilities. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General; theAdministrator, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention;the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interestedparties.  Copies will also be made available to others upon request. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VI.  If youhave any questions about this report, please contact me on (202)512-8777. Laurie E.  EkstrandAssociate Director, Administration of Justice IssuesOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix IThe 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice andDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) mandated that westudy the processing of juveniles in criminal court.  Specifically,we agreed with your Committees to  provide the frequency to which juveniles have been sent to criminal     court by judicial waiver, prosecutor direct filing, and     statutory exclusion;  analyze juvenile conviction rates and sentences of juveniles     prosecuted in criminal court using the most current data;  analyze the dispositions of juveniles in juvenile court; and  analyze the conditions of confinement in adult correctional     facilities for juveniles convicted in criminal court. We also agreed to summarize state laws governing the circumstancesunder which juveniles can be sent to criminal court.  Further, wenoted the number of states that allowed criminal court judges totransfer juvenile cases back to criminal court and the number ofstates that allowed criminal court judges to impose juvenile courtsanctions. To address all objectives, we reviewed relevant literature.  Todetermine the frequency to which juveniles are processed in criminalcourt, we obtained national, state, and local court data.  Becausedata were not available on the frequency of statutory exclusion, weanalyzed the statutory exclusion laws of 37 states and the Districtof Columbia to determine the types of cases being excluded fromjuvenile court.  To determine sentences of juveniles convicted incriminal court, we analyzed conviction rates, conviction offenses,and incarceration rates and sentences for juveniles prosecuted incriminal court.  To determine the dispositions of juveniles injuvenile court, we analyzed the offenses and dispositions ofjuveniles in juvenile court.  To analyze conditions of confinementfor juveniles in adult correctional facilities, we conducted sitevisits at seven adult prisons in four states.  We classified cases asjuveniles on the basis of the defendants' age at the time of arrestbecause data were not available for the defendants' age at the timeof the offense.  As a result, we underestimated the number ofjuveniles in criminal court.  To provide a summary of the state laws,we reviewed the statutes for 50 states and the District of Columbia. Finally, we obtained additional perspectives on juvenile justiceissues by mailing a survey to a national sample of prosecutors'offices and interviewing 15 juvenile court judges in 7 states. The act required us to compare the sentences of juveniles tried incriminal court with those processed in juvenile court for similaroffenses.  On the basis of discussions with juvenile justiceofficials, this type of comparison should recognize the selectionprocess by which juveniles are sent to criminal court or remain injuvenile court.  The officials said that juveniles sent to criminalcourt are a select subset of all juveniles.  The fact that they areselected for criminal court indicates they are different fromjuveniles processed in juvenile court.  When sending juveniles tocriminal court, decisionmakers (e.g., judges) generally consider thatthese juveniles have (1) relatively more serious criminal behaviors,(2) more extensive criminal histories, (3) less amenability totreatment, or (4) a greater likelihood of being a threat to thecommunity than juveniles who are processed in juvenile court.  Also,juveniles processed in criminal court are subject to a differentsentencing process than those in juvenile court.  Both factors meanthat comparisons between the two groups of juveniles would be ofnonequivalent groups.  As a result, differences or similarities intheir sentences would be difficult to interpret.  However, subject tothese caveats, we provided data on the sentencing outcomes forjuveniles processed in these two courts.  We could not determine theextent to which sentencing outcomes were due to differences inindividual characteristics of juveniles in the respective courts orsentencing processes of the courts.    REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1To develop an understanding of the issues associated with processingjuveniles in criminal court, we reviewed relevant literatureidentified in bibliographies provided by the National Center forJuvenile Justice (NCJJ) and the Department of Justice's Office ofJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP).  From our reviewof the literature, we determined the three principal methods forsending juveniles to criminal court and identified the states'policies on housing juveniles in adult prisons.    NATIONAL DATA ON THE FREQUENCY   OF JUDICIAL WAIVER--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2We used juvenile court data collected annually by NCJJ to determinethe number of juvenile cases processed in criminal court due tojudicial waiver.  Each year, NCJJ collects juvenile court processingdata and assigns weights to the data, which permits projecting thedata to produce national estimates of cases disposed by all statejuvenile justice systems.\1 OJJDP publishes the weighted data in itsannual Juvenile Court Statistics. Using the National Juvenile Court Data Archive (NJCDA), we developedstatistics for a 5-year period from calendar year 1988 to 1992. Specifically, we developed national estimates of the number ofjuvenile cases waived to criminal court by juvenile court judges(judicial waiver).  In addition, we developed statistics on theoffense profiles and demographics of juveniles, whose cases werewaived to criminal court. --------------------\1 In 1991, for example, the following 23 states provided juvenilecourt case-level data to NCJJ:  Alabama, Arizona (Maricopa countyonly), Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland,Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, NewYork, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  In 1990 and 1991,California reported data from several of its larger counties,representing 40 percent of the state's population that is age 17 oryounger.  In addition, some jurisdictions in seven other statesreported court case-level data that were used in generating thenational estimates.  In all, data from 1,504 jurisdictions covering57 percent of the nation's youth at risk were used to produce the1991 national estimates.  NCJJ's estimates of the number andcharacteristics of delinquency cases and cases that were waived byjuvenile courts were on the bases of the assumption that thecharacteristics of cases in counties that did not report juvenilecourt statistics were similar to those counties of similar size thatdid report statistics to NCJJ.  The details of the estimationprocedures can be found in Juvenile Court Statistics.  The nationalestimates were not generated by a probability sample.  NCJJ hasconducted, however, tests of the validity of the national estimatesby comparing them with counts of referrals (as reported by theFederal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports) made by lawenforcement agencies to juvenile courts.    ANALYSES OF THE FREQUENCY OF   JUDICIAL WAIVER IN SELECTED   STATES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3NCJJ's NJCDA national data files did not contain sufficientinformation for analyzing judicial waivers directly.  However, someof the Center's state-specific files\2 have a wider range of dataelements (including prior offense histories) that facilitate suchanalyses.  For example, in addition to data showing the types ofoffenses and whether cases were waived, some variables that weanalyzed were the number of previous referrals and/or adjudicationsand the metropolitan status of the court.  Thus, in order to conductmore detailed analyses of judicial waiver, we judgmentally selectedthe following 7 states from a total of 25 states that provided courtdata to NCJJ:  Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania,South Carolina, and Utah.  In addition to geographical coverage,other factors we considered in selecting these seven states were that(1) collectively, these states' juvenile justice systems reflected adiverse range of processes for handling youthful offenders and (2)the states' data files contained a sufficient number of variablesrelevant to our analyses of judicial waiver. For each of the seven states selected, we obtained a copy of NCJJ'scomputerized data files for calendar years 1990 and 1991, the mostrecent years for which consistent data were available.\3 Then, usingthe 1990 and 1991 data files, we completed analyses that compared thewaiver rates in different states; the waiver rates for defendants ofdifferent genders, races, and ages; and the waiver rates of casesprocessed in juvenile courts with different metropolitan status. --------------------\2 We used data that were housed in and made available by the NJCDA,which is maintained by NCJJ and supported by a grant from OJJDP. These data were originally collected by the Maricopa County, AZ,Juvenile Court Center; the Alameda County, CA, Probation Department;the Los Angeles County, CA, Probation Department; the San FranciscoCounty, CA, Juvenile Probation Department; the San Joaquin County,CA, Probation Department; the County of Ventura, CA, CorrectionsServices Agency; the Florida Department of Health and RehabilitativeServices; the Missouri State Division of Children and Youth Services;the Pennsylvania Center for Juvenile Justice Training and Research;the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice; and the UtahJuvenile Court.  Neither the original data collectors nor NCJJ bearany responsibility for our analyses or interpretations of the data. \3 For trend purposes, additional data files (i.e., for years before1990) would have been desirable; however, the 1990-1991 data fileswere the only years that had a sufficient range of variables commonto all seven states to facilitate our planned analyses.    STATE AND LOCAL DATA AVAILABLE   ON THE FREQUENCY OF PROSECUTOR   DIRECT FILING CASES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4To obtain data on the frequency of juvenile cases directly filed incriminal court at the discretion of prosecutors, we contacted StateCourt Administrator Offices in the 10 states with direct filing laws. Statewide data on prosecutor direct filing cases were available in 5of the 10 states that have direct filing laws.  To obtain data forthe other states, we contacted some of the largest counties/parishesin those states to get some measure of the frequency of prosecutordirect filing.  We also contacted court officials in the District ofColumbia to determine the frequency of direct filing in the District.    ANALYSIS OF STATUTORY EXCLUSION   STATUTES IN 37 STATES AND THE   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5To gain some perspective on the type of juvenile cases processed incriminal court due to state statutes that exclude them from juvenilecourt, we analyzed the statutes in 37 states and the District ofColumbia.  We categorized the states according to whether theirstatutory exclusion laws focused on (1) juveniles charged withserious violent offenses or other serious offenses or (2) juvenileswith prior court records.    NATIONAL DATA ON THE NUMBER OF   JUVENILE CASES SENT TO CRIMINAL   COURT FOR ALL METHODS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6In an attempt to collect data on the number of juveniles sent tocriminal court by all possible methods, we developed a survey to becompleted by juvenile justice specialists in all 50 states and theDistrict of Columbia.  We received responses from 19 states and theDistrict of Columbia.  Nine of the responses indicated that the datawe requested were not available.  Due to the low response rate andunavailability of data, we were only able to use this survey as anindicator of the relative frequency in which juveniles are sent tocriminal court by the three methods.  In following up withnonrespondents by telephone calls, they said that the data werequested were not available.    STATE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF   SENTENCES OF JUVENILES   PROSECUTED IN CRIMINAL COURT--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7To identify the types of sentences juveniles receive when processedin criminal court, we used the Bureau of Justice Statistics's (BJS)Offender Based Transaction Statistics (OBTS) data sets.\4 OBTSfocuses on arrested, alleged offenders and contains information onoffender characteristics, patterns of arrest, prior criminalactivities, prosecution activities, court action, and sentences.  Atthe time of our review, OBTS contained data for the years 1975through 1990 for approximately 15 states.  We analyzed data fromCalifornia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania,and Vermont for 1989 and 1990 combined.  We chose these statesbecause they represented different maximum ages of juvenile courtjurisdictions, different laws governing which juveniles may be sentto criminal court, and different geographic regions.  We used thesedata to analyze conviction rates, offenses, and incarceration ratesof juveniles prosecuted in criminal court.  In addition, we comparedthese rates with those of "other youth" and young adults (persons age18 through 24) to gain a perspective on how juveniles are treatedrelative to others prosecuted in criminal court. --------------------\4 We attempted to use the BJS National Judicial Reporting Program(NJRP) data set.  NJRP is a data set that contains information on thesentences of convicted felons received in state courts in 1988 and1990.  The data set contains a probability sample of convicted felonssentenced in state courts.  Because of missing data that identifiedthe age of the convicted felons, we could not identify juveniles andtherefore could not use this data to analyze juvenile sentences incriminal court.    PROSECUTOR SURVEY--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8To gather prosecutors opinions on data related to the processsing ofjuveniles in criminal court, we obtained 226 completed questionnairesfrom a nationally representative, probability sample of districtprosecutor offices that deal with juveniles in juvenile courts.  Ourfinal sample was identified by first contacting a stratifiedprobability sample of county prosecutors in 290 of the 3,110 countiesin the United States.  To gather information about both large andsmall counties, the sample was stratified on the basis of the numberof felony convictions in 1985.  The 1985 felony convictions were usedfirst to draw this sample of 290 counties in 1986 for the NationalJudicial Reporting Program. We developed and pretested the questionnaire items with advice fromexperts at NCJJ and BJS as well as selected prosecutor offices.  Thesurvey was mailed in March 1994.  Two sets of follow-up telephonecalls and two additional mailings were conducted between May andJuly. We contacted all 290 selected counties to determine whether they hadjuvenile prosecutors and, if so, the counties over which they hadjurisdiction.  We determined that 270 of the 290 counties wereeligible members of our study population of prosecutor offices thatdealt with juvenile offenders in juvenile court.  After weighing onthe basis of the probabilities of selection, we estimated that thestudy population consisted of approximately 2,118 such juvenileprosecutors in the United States.  The number of juvenile prosecutors(2,118) is less than the number of counties (3,110) partly becausesome counties are consolidated under a single juvenile prosecutor andpartly because some jurisdictions do not have prosecutors that appearin juvenile court.  Of the 270 sampled prosecutors from the studypopulation, 226 responded, for a response rate of 84 percent. All figures presented in this report were estimated from the returnedquestionnaires to the population of the estimated 2,118 juvenileprosecutor offices.  All sample surveys are subject to samplingerror, which refers to the extent to which the results may differfrom what would have been obtained if the entire population had beensurveyed.  The size of sampling errors in any survey depends largelyon the number of respondents and the amount of variability in thedata from the returned surveys.  In this report, all estimates aremade at the 95-percent confidence level with a sampling error of lessthan 10 percent.  This means that, if we had drawn repeated samplesfrom the entire study population of prosecutor offices, 19 out of 20samples would have produced estimates within 10 percent of the trueproportion in the total population. In addition to the reported sampling errors, any survey may besubject to nonsampling errors as well.  For example, differences inhow a particular question is interpreted, in the sources ofinformation that are available to respondents, or in the types ofpeople who do not respond, can introduce unwanted variability intosurvey results. We included steps in the data collection and data analysis stages tominimize such nonsampling errors.  We selected the sample from acomplete list of all counties, and we pretested our questionnairewith experts and members of the target population.  Our extensivefollow-up efforts were designed to maximize the response rate, and weachieved a final response rate of 84 percent.  All data were keyedtwice and verified during data entry, and all computer analyses werereviewed by a second independent analyst.    NATIONAL DATA ON THE   DISPOSITIONS OF JUVENILE COURT   CASES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9To develop national statistics on the types of dispositions used injuvenile court, we used the NCJJ's NJCDA data files.  We developednational estimates to compare (1) the number of juvenile casesprocessed informally versus formally, (2) the dispositions of caseshandled formally versus informally, and (3) the types of dispositionsfor various crime types.    SITE VISITS TO REVIEW   CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT FOR   JUVENILES IN ADULT PRISONS-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:10To obtain descriptive information on the conditions of confinementfor juveniles in adult prisons, we visited seven prisons in Florida,Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio.  In judgmentally selecting statesto visit, we considered (1) the state's maximum age of juvenile courtjurisdiction in each state, (2) whether juveniles were housed withyounger inmates (e.g., inmates under 25) or inmates of all ages, and(3) the number of inmates under the age of 18. In each state, we visited the prisons that housed the majority ofinmates under age 18.  We visited a total of seven prisons--six thathoused males and one that housed females.  During our visits, weinterviewed prison officials, using a structured interview format. While we did not verify the information provided, we toured thefacilities to observe the housing units, health services facilities,education and vocation classrooms, and recreation facilities.    JUDGES SURVEY ADDRESSING   JUDICIAL WAIVER ISSUES-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:11We conducted structured interviews with 15 juvenile court judges in 7states to obtain information on methods for sending juveniles tocriminal court.  Judges were chosen randomly and interviewed on thebasis of their availability.  We attempted to contact two or threejudges in the juvenile court jurisdictions that we visited during oursite visits.

DETAILS OF ANALYSIS OF WAIVER   RATES-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8We did the following analysis using the data from tables II.3, II.6,II.9, II.12, II.15, and II.18.  However, our analysis was limited tothe variables for which data were available in the six states.\1Age - In the six states we examined, juveniles age 16 or older weremore likely to have their cases waived than juveniles under age 16years for all three offense types.  However, the likelihood thatolder juveniles would have their cases waived than younger juvenileswas much larger in some states than in others.  For example, inArizona older juveniles charged with property offenses were 39 timesmore likely to have their cases waived than were younger juvenilescharged with such offenses; while in Florida, older juveniles chargedwith property offenses were only 5 times more likely to have theircases waived than younger juveniles.  While waiver rates weresomewhat higher in four of the six states for violent offenses thanfor property or drug offenses, the rates varied among the stateswithin each age category.  For example, older juveniles charged withproperty offenses were 44 times more likely to have their caseswaived in Missouri than in California, while younger juvenilescharged with violent offenses were 58 times more likely to have theircases waived in Missouri than in California. Gender - Males were more likely than females to have their caseswaived within each offense type in the six states we analyzed.  Theextent of the likelihood again varied by state.  For example, inArizona males charged with violent offenses were 42 times more likelyto have their cases waived than females in Arizona, while such maleswere 17 times more likely to have their cases waived than females inCalifornia.  In some states, the likelihood was more apparent forthose charged with violent offenses than for those charged witheither property or drug offenses.  For males, juveniles charged withviolent offenses had higher waiver rates than for males charged withdrugs or property offenses in three of the six states.  In theremaining three states, males charged with drug offenses had higherwaiver rates.  Waiver rates for each offense type also differedacross states for males.  For example, males charged with propertyoffenses in Arizona or Missouri were 18 times more likely to havetheir cases waived than males in California. Race - In four states, blacks were more likely than whites to havetheir cases waived for violent, property, and drug offenses.  Forviolent offenses, the differential rates are fairly consistent acrossstates, with black juveniles having waiver rates from 1.8 times to3.1 times higher than whites.  The differences varied more widely fordrug offenses.  In California, black juveniles were half as likely aswhite juveniles to have their cases waived, while in Pennsylvaniablack juveniles were more than twice as likely to have their caseswaived than whites.  There were some large differences, however; forexample, for juveniles charged with drug offenses, Arizona's waiverrates for whites were twice those of California; while for blacks,Arizona's rates were 55 times those of California. Locality - In the four NCJJ states with data on metropolitan andnonmetropolitan courts, some small differences did exist but were notconsistent across offense types within the same state.  For example,in Missouri, waiver rates in metropolitan areas were higher forviolent and drug offenses but lower for property offenses than innonmetropolitan areas.  The waiver rate was highest for drug offensesin all four states in nonmetropolitan areas and in three of the fourstates in metropolitan areas.  In nonmetropolitan areas inPennsylvania, juveniles charged with violent offenses were lesslikely to have their cases waived than those charged with drugs orproperty offenses.  The likelihood of cases being waived in each typeof locality varied somewhat for the offense types among the fourstates, particularly for property offenses.  For example, juvenilescharged with property offenses in metropolitan areas in Pennsylvaniawere almost 4 times more likely to have their cases waived than werejuveniles in South Carolina, while those charged with propertyoffenses in nonmetropolitan areas of Pennsylvania were 9 times morelikely to have their cases waived than those in South Carolina. Prior Referrals - In the five states with data, waiver ratesgenerally increased with the number of prior referrals for all fivestates and most offense types.  We categorized referrals into threegroups:  (1) none, (2) one or two, and (3) three or more.  The largerincreases usually occurred between the second and third categories. For example, in Arizona, juveniles charged with violent offenses andwho had one or two prior referrals were 3 times more likely to havetheir cases waived than those with no referrals, while juvenilescharged with violent offenses with three or more referrals were 8times more likely to be referred than those with no referrals.  Thestates differed in the rates at which they waived cases for theseoffense types in each prior referral group.  The differences werestrongest for juveniles charged with property offenses.  For example,considering only those with three or more prior referrals, thegreatest difference for juveniles charged with violent offenses wasfound between Arizona and Florida, where Arizona's waiver rate forthese juveniles was 5 times greater than Florida's.  However, forjuveniles charged with property offenses, the greatest difference wasfound between Pennsylvania and South Carolina, where Pennsylvania'swaiver rate was almost 10 times greater than in South Carolina. --------------------\1 Data were not available for Utah.

Certainviolations committed by juveniles are treated as if they were done byadults in many states; namely, fish and game violations, trafficviolations committed by juveniles old enough to obtain driverslicenses, and contempt of court.  In addition, some states haveprovisions that allow the juvenile to request that his or her case bewaived to criminal court or that provide for waiver or prosecutorialdiscretion when the charges are violations of alcohol and tobaccopossession laws.  These types of provisions are not included in thetable. When a case is waived to criminal court because of the nature of thecharge, charges arising out of the same incident or which areotherwise joinable are usually also transferred.  When waiver is inthe juvenile court's discretion, common prerequisites are that theremust be a waiver hearing where it is found that there is probablecause that the child committed the act and that it is in the bestinterests of the child and community that there be waiver ofjurisdiction. The category of statutory exclusion in the table includes statestatutory provisions that require that the juvenile be transferred tocriminal court from juvenile court (identified as "mandatorytransfer" provisions). \a An information is a written accusation made by a publicprosecutor.  It is used in place of a grand jury indictment to bringa person to trial. \b Reverse waiver in New York--Juvenile Offenders (juveniles whocommit statutorily excluded offenses) originally appear before localcriminal court.  The criminal court may, at the request of theprosecutor or the juvenile, remove the action to family court. However, if the juvenile is charged with second degree murder, firstdegree rape, sodomy, or an armed felony, the criminal court may notremove the case to family court, unless the criminal court finds oneof the following three factors:  (1) mitigating circumstances, (2)that the juvenile's participation in the offense was minor, or (3)possible deficiencies in proof. In addition, the grand jury may request removal to family court if itfinds that the juvenile committed a crime, the crime is one for whichthe grand jury may not indict a juvenile (i.e., offenses other thanthose listed in the statutory exclusions), the grand jury does notindict, and there is legally sufficient evidence that the childcommitted a crime.  The court must approve the request unless it isimproper or insufficient on its face. After the juvenile is arraigned upon an indictment in Superior Court,the Superior Court may, upon motion of any party or its own motion,order removal to family court.  However, if the juvenile is chargedwith one of the above enumerated offenses the Superior Court mustobtain the prosecutor's consent and find one of the above listedfactors in order to remove to family court.

SUMMARY OF CONFINEMENT CONDITIONSFOR JUVENILES IN ADULTCORRECTIONAL FACILITIES=========================================================== Appendix VThe following data regarding the conditions of confinement ofjuveniles in seven adult correctional facilities that we visited wasprovided by facility officials without our verification.    HOUSING--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1In Ohio, juveniles were housed within the general prison populationirrespective of their age.\1 However, in Florida, Michigan, and NorthCarolina, younger inmates (typically those under age 26) were usuallyhoused in prisons designated for that age group.  At six of theprisons we visited, age was not considered when making housingassignments within the prison.\2Housing units in the prisons we visited varied in layout from single-or double-bunk cells to dormitory style structures.  Housing unitstypically had common-use bathroom facilities.  In addition, mosthousing units' common-use areas typically were equipped withtelevisions. --------------------\1 According to a deputy warden at Southeastern CorrectionalInstitution in Ohio, the prison formerly accepted many of Ohio'syoung offenders (age 21 and below).  However, due to problemsassociated with violence among young offenders, they will now be sentto other prisons, and older inmates are being integrated into theInstitution. \2 The Florida Correctional Institution is a women's prison thathoused inmates of all ages.    HEALTH SERVICES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2At all seven prisons, health care was available on site.  Generally,the health staff was composed of a physician, nurses, and a dentist. Upon entering the prison system, all inmates were to be subjected toa physical examination.  Inmates were to be allowed daily visits tothe health unit.  When an inmate requested to see a nurse, generallythe request was to be granted within 24 hours.  If an emergencyoccurred, the inmates' care was to be handled at the prison or at anoff-site hospital.  Additionally, the facilities usually were toprovide mental health counseling and offer some form of drugrehabilitation.  For example, in Florida, new inmates were to bescreened to determine if they needed substance abuse services. Substance abuse services available in Florida prisons includedtreatment ranging from a 40-hour educational program to a 6- to12-month intensive program.    EDUCATION, VOCATION, AND WORK   PROGRAMS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3Education, vocation, and work programs were available at all prisonswe visited.  During classification, inmates were generally to begiven an opportunity to indicate their preferences for participationin these programs.  Factors to be considered by prison officials whenassigning inmates to these programs included inmates' length ofsentence, educational level, and security classification. In six of the seven prisons, generally all inmates were toparticipate in an education, vocation, or work program.\3Education programs available at the prisons included classes dealingwith the Graduate Equivalency Diploma (GED) test and adult basiceducation.  Class sizes generally ranged from about 15 to 30 inmates. However, at the Handlon Michigan Training Unit, an adult basiceducation program had much smaller class sizes, which sometimes had ateacher to inmate ratio of 1 to 1 for inmates testing below the eightgrade reading and math level. All of the prisons offered a variety of vocational programs.  Theseprograms included auto mechanics, masonry, electronics, horticulture,and drafting.  The Florida Correctional Institution for women offeredvocational programs in data entry, sewing, and cosmetology.  Somefactors considered when assigning inmates to vocational and educationprograms included their custody classification and educational level. Also, because some programs took as long as 16 months to complete,inmates with sentences shorter than the length of the program werenot eligible to participate. Inmates not participating in education or vocational programs were tobe required to work.  Job assignments included cooks, dishwashers, orfood servers in the prison kitchen, lawn maintenance on the prisongrounds, or work at the prison store.  In Ohio, Michigan, and NorthCarolina inmates were paid a nominal salary to work or attend school. For example, in Ohio, inmates could earn up to $20 per month.  Inaddition, inmates at the Florida Correctional Institution,Southeastern Correctional Institution, and the Michigan Reformatorycould participate in prison industry programs that produced products,some of which were marketed outside of the prisons.  For example, atthe Michigan Reformatory, the Michigan State Industries employedabout 90 inmates in an on site furniture factory. --------------------\3 At the Michigan Reformatory, a maximum security prison, inmateswere not required but had the option to work or attend school.    RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:4All prisons provided a variety of recreational activities andequipment.  During leisure time inmates generally had access to alibrary, television, weight-lifting equipment, table tennis, and pooltables.  One prison provided cable programming on a large screentelevision, and another prison provided a built-in swimming pool(which inmates paid for) and a tennis court.  Several of the prisonshad intermural sports, including flag football, basketball, andsoftball.    DAILY SCHEDULE--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:5Inmates at the prisons we visited had similar daily schedules. Generally, they began the day between 6:00 a.m.  and 8:00 a.m. Typically the inmates were counted about four times daily.  Followingthe morning count, breakfast was served.  After breakfast, inmatesreported to their school or work assignments for about 3 hours. Lunch was usually served around 12:00 p.m.  After lunch, inmatesreturned to their school or work assignments for another 3 hours. Dinner was served around 5:00 p.m.  After dinner, inmates had time toparticipate in various recreational and religious programs or otheractivities from about 6:00 p.m.  until about 9:00 p.m.  Inmates werelocked in their housing units with lights out at about 11:00 p.m. MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS REPORT========================================================== Appendix VIGENERAL GOVERNMENT DIVISION,WASHINGTON, D.C.

HatchChairmanThe Honorable Joseph R.  Biden, Jr.Ranking Minority MemberCommittee on the JudiciaryUnited States SenateThe Honorable William F.  GoodlingChairmanThe Honorable William L.  ClayRanking Minority MemberCommittee on Economic and Educational OpportunityHouse of RepresentativesThe 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice andDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) mandated that westudy access to counsel in state and local juvenile delinquencyproceedings.  Some legal organizations and scholars had raisedconcern about the access to counsel afforded to juveniles in juvenilecourt proceedings.  For example, the American Bar Association; theConsortium of Children, Families and the Law; and individual lawprofessors testified in September 1992 to Congress that half of alljuveniles in the United States waive their constitutionallyguaranteed right to counsel without speaking to an attorney. To meet our legislative requirements, we agreed with your committeesto  review state laws for 15 states that we selected to determine     juveniles' right to counsel,  determine the frequency with which juveniles have counsel in     juvenile courts in three states,  determine the likely impact of counsel on juvenile justice     outcomes,  determine if juveniles who are in adult court have counsel, and  develop insights regarding the quality of counsel.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Statutes guaranteeing juveniles' right to counsel in delinquencyproceedings were present in the 15 states whose laws we examined. For juveniles who could not provide counsel on their own, the stateshad provisions to provide and compensate counsel for them.  Of the 15states, 11 had laws allowing the waiver of counsel under certaincircumstances but generally had rules to ensure that waivers weremade only when juveniles were aware of their right and voluntarilygave up that right.  According to officials in three other states,juveniles can waive counsel even though the state statutes do notspecifically address the waiver issue.  In the remaining state,juveniles could not waive counsel. We could find no national data regarding juveniles' representation bycounsel.  However, the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ)\1had such data for some jurisdictions, and we analyzed its data foravailable counties in California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska forportions of 1990 and 1991.  The results only relate to thejurisdictions for which we were able to obtain data and thereforecannot be generalized to other jurisdictions within these states. Throughout this report, our references to the states apply only tothe counties in the states for which we have data.   Overall representation rates varied widely, from about 97 and about     91 percent, respectively, in California and Pennsylvania to     about 65 percent in Nebraska, and within the states the rates     varied between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.\2  Representation rates by offense category (e.g., violent crimes,     property crimes, drug crimes, etc.) varied, with minimal     variation in California and Pennsylvania (about 83 to almost 100     percent) across all categories and a wider variation across     categories in Nebraska (about 54 to 91 percent); however, 76     percent of all unrepresented cases in Nebraska were for less     serious property offenses. Overall impact of representation on case outcomes varied according tothe state and the offense category.  Sometimes juveniles withrepresentation were more likely to have their cases adjudicated asdelinquent (i.e., judged to be a delinquent)\3 and sometimes thosewithout representation were more likely to be adjudicated asdelinquent.  In most cases, juveniles without representation wereless likely to receive out-of-home placements (e.g., trainingschool). According to our logistic regression\4 models for California,Nebraska, and Pennsylvania, unrepresented juveniles were generallyabout as likely to have their cases adjudicated than representedjuveniles, but characteristics other than representation (e.g.,detention prior to adjudication and prior offense history) were morestrongly associated with the likelihood of adjudication. According to our models for placement outcomes for the three states,juveniles' characteristics other than representation (e.g., detentionprior to adjudication or prior offense history) were more stronglyassociated with placement decisions. We could not locate any databases to determine if juveniles in adultcourt had counsel or to compare access to counsel for juveniles inadult and juvenile court.  However, on the basis of our review ofcriminal law, juveniles in adult court have the same right to counselas adults.  In addition, our survey of prosecutors indicated thatjuveniles in adult and juvenile court were given the same opportunityas adults to be represented.  (We could not determine the extent towhich juveniles waived their right to counsel in adult court.)Prosecutors and juvenile justice officials in the eight localjurisdictions we visited were generally favorable concerning thequality of counsel provided to juveniles.  They also reported thatpublic defenders were seen to be at least as capable as privateattorneys in representing juveniles, and several officials noted thatpublic defenders were more knowledgeable in the laws and rulesgoverning juvenile proceedings.  However, these officials noted thatwhile public defenders had the most experience in juvenile law andprocedures, they also had very high caseloads.  These officialsraised concerns over the limited resources and growing caseloads ofpublic defenders. --------------------\1 NCJJ, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the researchdivision of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. \2 NCJJ data from California contained only metropolitan counties. \3 A delinquent is a youth who has been charged with or had a caseadjudicated for criminal conduct. \4 Logistic regression analysis is a widely accepted statisticalmethodology used when the dependent variable is qualitative, such asif a juvenile is adjudicated as delinquent.  Regression analysisidentifies relationships between the dependent variable and two ormore key variables, such as the use of counsel and the juvenileoffender's current offense category and prior offense history andsupervisory status.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2Juvenile justice is primarily the responsibility of state and localauthorities because juvenile courts derive their authority from statelegislatures.  The juvenile courts of all 50 states are part of theirstates' judicial system but are generally county or city based andvary in structure, policy, and procedure.  Thus, juvenile courts'jurisdiction and procedures vary widely across and within states. Appendix I illustrates differences in profiles of the juvenilejustice processes in nine states.\5--------------------\5 Arizona, California, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska,Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Utah.       MAJOR ELEMENTS OF JUVENILE      COURT PROCEDURE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1When juveniles commit crimes, they are usually subject to thejurisdiction of the juvenile court as a delinquent offender. Referrals of delinquents come to juvenile court from many sources,including parents, police officers, victims, and schools.  Lawenforcement agencies provide the vast majority of referrals tojuvenile courts.  The Department of Justice's Office of JuvenileJustice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) reported in 1991 that lawenforcement agencies referred 85 percent of all delinquency cases tothe courts. Referrals generally come to the court's intake department to bescreened by intake staff.\6 The intake staff examine the referral todetermine what type of crime is alleged to have been committed andhow to proceed with the handling of the referral.  The intakedecision process has several potential outcomes.  Among other things,intake staff may decide to dismiss the case for insufficient legalevidence or to resolve the matter informally out of court.\7 Theseinformal dispositions may include diverting the juvenile to a socialagency for services,\8informal probation, or the payment of fines or some form ofrestitution. If intake staff decide that the referral should be handled formally,a petition is drafted and filed to provide notice of the issues thatwill be adjudicated.  The petition charges the juvenile with adelinquency offense violation and requests an adjudicatory or waiverhearing.  In some states, petitions may be dismissed before theactual adjudicatory hearing\9 is held for various reasons, such aswhen the case is not viewed by court officials as a particularlyserious offense.  For example, in Pennsylvania, less seriouspetitioned cases may be disposed of by consent decrees--informaladjustments\10 without an adjudicatory hearing. At an adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile may have his or her caseadjudicated, i.e., judged as delinquent and, if so, the case proceedsto a disposition hearing.\11 The judge is responsible for presidingover the hearing, including determining placement of the juvenileduring the pending proceedings, making any interim orders that arenecessary to the conduct of the case, and deciding the disposition ofthe case if there has been a finding of delinquency.  The range ofdisposition options available to the juvenile court judge generallyincludes (1) commitment to an institution; (2) placement in a grouphome or other residential facility; (3) probation; (4) referral to anoutside agency or mental health program; or (5) imposition of a fine,community service, or restitution order. A juvenile may be temporarily placed in a detention facility duringvarious stages of a case as it progresses through the juvenilejustice system.  Generally, juveniles alleged to be delinquent may beplaced in secure custody in a physically restrictive facility. Depending on the state's detention laws, the juvenile may be detainedto protect the community, the juvenile, or both.  In addition,detention may be used to ensure the juvenile's appearance at ahearing or while the juvenile is awaiting long-term placement inanother facility.  A judicial decision to detain or continuedetention may occur before or after adjudication or disposition. OJJDP estimated that in 1991 juveniles were held in detentionfacilities between the time of referral and case disposition in about20 percent of the 1.3 million delinquency cases.\12--------------------\6 We obtained the information in this section from various sources,such as documents and discussions with juvenile justice officials. \7 Besides insufficient legal evidence, a referral may be dismissedbecause (1) the offense is petty or seen as a low risk, (2) thereferral is a first offense, and the level of its seriousness doesnot merit formal consideration, (3) the juvenile and his/her familyhave reimbursed a victim for damages, (4) formal processing is seenas unnecessary, (5) or because family strengths are prominent and thejuvenile is perceived to be responsive to parental controls anddiscipline. \8 Diversion programs were designed to remove first-time offendersand relatively minor offenders from the formal adjudication process. To meet the treatment needs of those juveniles, most of whom have notfaced previous juvenile court adjudication, a variety ofcommunity-based programs and agencies have been created. \9 A hearing where a judge presides over a juvenile court proceedingto determine if the juvenile actually committed the alleged offense. \10 The juvenile and the court agree to suspend the case with thejuvenile remaining at home under probation conditions for up to 6months. \11 Juveniles can also be adjudicated as status offenders.  Juvenileswho have come in contact with the juvenile justice system bycommitting an offense (such as running away or truancy) that wouldnot be a crime if committed by an adult are status offenders.  Ourreview focused on delinquents and did not include status offenders. For more information on status offenders, see our report entitledNoncriminal Juveniles:  Detentions Have Been Reduced but BetterMonitoring Is Needed (GAO/GGD-91-65, Apr.  24, 1991). \12 At the time of our review, 1991 was the most recent dataavailable.       ROLE OF COUNSEL IN JUVENILE      COURT---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2Historically, juvenile delinquents subject to the jurisdiction ofjuvenile court were not afforded the same constitutional rightsguaranteed to adult criminal defendants.  However, in 1967 the U.S. Supreme Court held that juvenile offenders were entitled to theassistance of counsel in certain juvenile delinquency proceedings, Inre Gault, 387 U.S.  1 (1967).\13 In Gault, the Supreme Courtconcluded that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendmentrequires that in proceedings to determine delinquency (e.g.,adjudication hearings) that may result in commitment to aninstitution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed, thejuvenile and his or her parents must be notified of the juvenile'sright to be represented by counsel.  The Supreme Court also indicatedthat if the juvenile and his or her parents could not afford counsel,counsel must be appointed to represent the juvenile. With regard to the waiver of counsel, the Supreme Court indicated inGault that waiver must be an "intentional relinquishment orabandonment of a fully known right." The Supreme Court also statedthat the juvenile and his or her parents have a right expressly to beadvised that they may retain counsel.  If they are unable to affordcounsel, they are entitled, considering the seriousness of the chargeand the potential commitment, to be appointed counsel.  However, theycan choose to waive counsel. Currently, there are three major approaches to the provision ofdefense counsel in juvenile courts:   public defenders, which include private attorneys or law firms     under contract with or granted funds by a governmental entity to     defend juveniles; private agencies, such as legal aid societies     under similar contracts or grants; and government defender     agencies;  private attorneys appointed by the court to represent individual     juveniles and paid from public funds; and  privately paid attorneys. --------------------\13 In an earlier case, the U.S.  Supreme Court indicated that ajuvenile was entitled to the assistance of counsel in a proceeding todetermine whether the juvenile's case should be waived to thejurisdiction of the criminal court.  Kent v.  United States, 383 U.S. 541, 561-62 (1966).    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3To aid us in identifying the issues regarding access to counsel, wereviewed relevant literature in bibliographies provided by NCJJ andOJJDP.  We developed information on juveniles' rights and access tocounsel through a combination of methods, including (1) an analysisof statutes, state administrative procedures, and case law in 15states;\14 (2) an analysis of NCJJ statistical data on 3 states;\15(3) nationwide surveys of county prosecutors and public defenders;(4) telephone interviews with selected state and local judges inFlorida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,Texas, and Utah; and (5) visits to four states--Florida, Louisiana,Pennsylvania, and Utah--to meet with juvenile justice officials tounderstand the processes and frequency of when counsel was provided. We completed our statistical analysis of NCJJ data in two parts. First, using seven general crime categories (see table 1.), wedeveloped statistics on case processing outcomes for certain countiesin California, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania for calendar years 1990 and1991.\16 Specifically, we reported the percentages of juvenilespetitioned to court who received counsel.  Second, we computed andanalyzed the probabilities that juveniles with counsel and withoutcounsel were adjudicated or placed.  We analyzed these two decisionpoints because the Gault ruling focused on these key decisions inwhich juveniles were at risk of losing their liberty. Juvenile facilities are not all the same.  For example, facilitiesvary in degrees of security.  Data were not readily available todifferentiate between types of placement juveniles received or thesecurity of the facility.  Therefore, our analysis only recognizedthat the juveniles were either placed or not placed.  Also, the dataidentified represented and unrepresented juveniles who wereadjudicated as delinquents.  However, data were not readily availableto identify those who were represented but during the process hadtheir charges reduced (e.g., from aggravated to simple assault). Therefore, our analysis of the data may not recognize the impact ofbeing represented in terms of impact on reduction in charges.                            Table 1                             Crime Categories and TypesCrime categories    Crime types------------------  ----------------------------------------Violent crimes      Murder and nonnegiligent manslaughter;                    rape; robbery; aggravated assault; other                    violent crimes, which include negligent                    manslaughter, sexual assault,                    kidnapping, and others but excludes                    simple assault; and indeterminate                    violent offenses (i.e., the crime was a                    violent crime, but the type of violent                    crime was not known).Property crimes     Burglary, fraud, forgery, and                    embezzlement; larceny; motor vehicle                    theft; unspecified larceny; other                    property (e.g., trespassing and                    vandalism); indeterminate property                    (i.e., the crime was a property offense,                    but the type of property offense was not                    known).Simple assault      Generally an attack without a weapon                    resulting in minor injury.Drug crimes         Possession, trafficking, and other or                    unspecified drug crime.Weapons             Unlawful sale, manufacture,                    transportation, distribution, or                    possession.Public order or     Disorderly conduct, escape, obstructionnonviolent crimes   of justice, and other public order                    crimes (e.g., prostitution).Indeterminate       Crime type not known.------------------------------------------------------------Note:  Definitions of crime types included in the six broader crimecategories may vary across states.  Further, certain specific crimetypes are excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction in some states,e.g., murder in Pennsylvania. Source:  Derived from Uniform Crime Report crime classifications,NCJJ offense categories, and state definitions of crimes. Because case characteristics, in addition to representation, mayaffect case outcomes, we developed logistic regression models tocontrol for these characteristics.  We looked at the relationshipsbetween the type of counsel (i.e., public defender, court-appointedattorney, or private attorney) in juvenile delinquency proceedingsand key decision points--adjudicated and placed--in the juvenilejudicial process controlling for a number of relevant variables.  Weestimated the models separately for the 3 states for up to 10 crimetypes yielding 24 adjudication and 24 placement models. The variables we controlled for in our logistic regression modelsmeasured three types of case characteristics:  (1) demographicvariables, such as age, race, and gender; (2) offense-relatedvariables, such as current crime type, the severity of the currentcrime type, and offense history; and (3) juvenile court-statusvariables, such as detention prior to adjudication; source ofreferral; informal adjustments prior to adjudication; representationby counsel and the type of counsel representing the case, location ofthe courts, and length of time to dispose of a case.  See appendixIII for a discussion on how we classified crime types and thevariables used in the models. Also, to better understand the underlying processes, we developedprofiles of the juvenile justice systems in nine states.  Wecoordinated our work with OJJDP, NCJJ, the American Bar Association,the National Legal Aid Defenders' Association, and the Coalition forJuvenile Justice.  Appendix II provides a more detailed discussion ofour objectives, scope, and methodology, including the basis that weused to select states and identify officials.  The details of themodeling procedures as well as of the results are discussed inappendix III. The data we developed, including the results of our interviews withjuvenile justice officials, are not projectable to other locations. We did our work from March 1993 through November 1994 in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards.  Since nofederal agency has responsibility for the issues discussed in thisreport, we did not obtain comments on a draft of this report. However, we did discuss our results with NCJJ and OJJDP officialsand, where appropriate, incorporated their comments. --------------------\14 Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland,Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, SouthCarolina, Utah, and Texas. \15 The three states are California, Pennsylvania and Nebraska.  Thestatistical data for all three states were somewhat limited. California's data only included five counties, albeit five of thelargest counties in the state that represented 40 percent of thestate's juvenile population between ages 10 and 17.  Pennsylvania'sdata were for 1991 only and did not include Philadelphia county, themost heavily populated county in the state.  Philadelphia countyaccounted for about one-third of all petitioned cases inPennsylvania; however, Philadelphia petitions all cases to juvenilecourt.  In the other counties, petitioned cases are limited to themore serious ones.  Therefore, Philadelphia's data are not comparablewith the rest of the counties.  In Nebraska, one of the largestcounties' data did not consistently indicate whether juveniles hadrepresentation at the adjudication hearing.  However a state officialestimated that about 75 percent of juveniles in this county hadrepresentation when they appeared before a judge at an adjudicationhearing. \16 In considering the relative severity of crimes, we consideredclasses of crimes, such as violent or property, rather than specifictypes of crimes within a class or specific offense behaviors within atype of crime.  Therefore, we considered violent crimes as the mostserious class of crimes, followed by property crimes, drug crimes,simple assault, weapons, and public order.  Because we could notdetermine what classes of crimes fell into the indeterminatecategory, we did not consider it in the ranking of offense severity.    JUVENILES' RIGHT TO COUNSEL CAN   BE WAIVED IN MOST STATES WE   REVIEWED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4To determine juveniles' right to counsel, including the process thatjuveniles can use to waive their right to counsel and the provisionof counsel for indigent juveniles, we reviewed the statutes, caselaw, and state administrative rules of the court in 15 states.\17(See app.  IV for a table summarizing the state laws.) We found thateach of the 15 states had provisions that provide juveniles chargedwith delinquent offenses the right to counsel.  Further, most of thestates permitted juveniles, or their parents or guardians, to waivetheir right to counsel under certain circumstances. --------------------\17 Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland,Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, SouthCarolina, Texas, and Utah.       JUVENILES' ACCESS TO COUNSEL---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1Each of the states had provisions that provided juveniles access tocounsel.  However, the 15 states differed on details of how counselis to be provided.\18 See appendix IV for additional information onjuveniles' access to counsel. --------------------\18 These provisions go beyond the specific requirements of the Gaultdecision, which only dealt with a juvenile's right to counsel at anadjudication hearing.       JUVENILES' RIGHT TO WAIVE      COUNSEL---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2Eleven of the 15 state statutes that we reviewed specificallyoutlined circumstances and procedures under which juveniles or theirparents or guardians could waive the right to counsel.  In general,the waiver had to be knowing and voluntary, i.e., an "intentionalrelinquishment or abandonment of a fully known right." In the fourremaining state statutes, waiver was not specifically addressed.  Inthree of these four states, juveniles can waive counsel.  In theremaining state, juveniles cannot waive counsel. Eleven states had specific requirements for how the waiver of counselwas to occur.  For example, in Arizona, the waiver had to be inwriting or in the minutes of the courts and could be withdrawn atanytime.  In Florida, even if there is a waiver of counsel, the offerof counsel must be renewed at subsequent stages during theproceedings.  In Idaho, a juvenile may waive counsel if he or shedoes so "intelligently," and the court determines that the bestinterest of the juvenile does not require the appointment of counsel. In Louisiana, the juvenile may waive counsel only after consultingwith an attorney or other adult interested in the juvenile's welfare. In Missouri, a juvenile may waive counsel only with the approval ofthe court.  In Pennsylvania, only the juvenile's parent or guardiancan waive the right to counsel on behalf of the juvenile.  New Yorkand Texas only allow waiver under certain circumstances.  In NewYork, a juvenile can waive counsel only after a law guardian has beenappointed and the court holds a hearing.  In Texas, a juvenile cannotwaive counsel at certain proceedings, such as an adjudication hearingor a disposition hearing. In four states, the statues did not address waiver.  In Kansas, thestatute does not specifically address waiver, but a recent stateAttorney General opinion concluded that juveniles can waive theirright to counsel if it is a "knowing and intelligent waiver." In Utahand Nebraska, the state law was silent on waiver of counsel byjuveniles.  However, Utah and Nebraska officials told us thatjuveniles are allowed to waive counsel in these states.  In NewMexico, the state statute requires that juveniles be represented atall stages of the proceedings.  State officials told us thatjuveniles are not given the option of waiving counsel.    REPRESENTATION RATES VARIED IN   THREE STATES MORE WITH   GEOGRAPHY THAN WITH OFFENSE   SEVERITY OR OFFENSE HISTORY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5We analyzed cases petitioned to juvenile courts in certainCalifornia, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska counties.  Our analysis showedthat the percentage of cases in which juveniles had counsel (1)varied among the states, (2) varied with the location of the courtwithin states, and (3) varied somewhat across offense categories orwith offense history within the states.       REPRESENTATION RATES VARIED      AMONG STATES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1Table 2 shows, for the six major crime categories and theindeterminable crime category, the number of petitioned delinquencycases disposed of in 1990 and 1991 for California and Nebraska, andin 1991 for Pennsylvania.  Using the data from table 2, we computedthe percentage of petitioned cases in which juveniles had counsel. Table 3 shows that the percentage of petitioned cases represented bycounsel varied among states.  In California, about 97 percent of thejuveniles were represented.  In Pennsylvania, juveniles wererepresented in about 91 percent of the petitioned cases.  InNebraska, juveniles were represented in about 65 percent of thepetitioned cases.  In addition, table 3 shows that, for each majorcrime category, the percentage of petitioned cases represented waslowest in Nebraska.  For example, about 90 percent of juveniles inNebraska referred for violent offenses were represented, as comparedwith almost 100 percent in California and 94 percent in Pennsylvania.

According to an NCJJ official, the Pennsylvania data, which wereonly for 1991, excluded cases from Philadelphia because Philadelphiapetitions all cases, not just the more serious cases, to juvenilecourt.  According to a Nebraska official, data were not available onrepresentation rates in one of the state's larger counties.  We alsoomitted these cases from our analysis.  However, he added that anestimated 75 percent of the juveniles were represented atadjudication hearings in that county.  These limitations apply to allresults using California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska data.  Table 1and appendix III provides information on the specific types of crimesfalling into each offense category in each state.  The figures inthis table were computed after excluding cases in which the type ofcounsel was missing in the database.  In California, this amounted to5 percent of 64,275 cases; in Pennsylvania 5 percent of the 15,397cases; in Nebraska 18 percent of the 6,603 cases.

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. Our results were consistent with studies conducted by Barry C. Feld\19 and Dean J.  Champion,\20 which showed that the rates ofrepresentation varied among states.  Feld analyzed the representationrates in cases disposed of in juvenile court in 1984 for California,New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.  Hefound that between 85 percent and 95 percent of juveniles wererepresented in the large, urban states--Pennsylvania, California, andNew York.  By contrast, he found that between 37.5 percent and 52.7percent of juveniles were represented in the midwesternstates--Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota. Champion analyzed juveniles' representation rates in California,Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska between 1980 and1989.  He found wide variation in representation rates among thestates.  In California, the representation rates increased from 82percent to 91 percent between 1980 and 1989.  Over the same period,in Pennsylvania, the percentage represented increased from 55 percentto 85 percent.  Conversely, in Nebraska and North Dakota, therepresentation rates varied between 40 percent and 50 percent overthe 1980 to 1989 period. In another study which analyzed Missouri's juvenile justice system,the authors found that youths in urban localities were more likely tobe represented by counsel, regardless of their race.  Whencontrolling for factors such as prior criminal history anddemographic characteristics, representation by counsel remained asignificant factor in predicting both detention and petition in ruraljurisdictions, and a significant factor in detention, petition, andadjudication in urban jurisdictions.\21We did not evaluate these studies, including any limitations they mayhave. --------------------\19 Barry C.

Source:  Our analysis of NCJJ data. In Pennsylvania, about 13 percent of the 14,584 juvenile courtproceedings occurred in nonmetropolitan counties, but 26 percent ofthe cases involving juveniles without counsel occurred innonmetropolitan counties.  In metropolitan counties, 8 percent of alljuveniles were unrepresented, as compared with about 19 percent whowere unrepresented in nonmetropolitan counties.  Therefore, juvenileswere more than twice as likely to go without representation innonmetropolitan counties as in metropolitan counties in Pennsylvania(about 19 percent compared with 8 percent). In Nebraska, more than half of the 4,449 juvenile court proceedingswere disposed in nonmetropolitan counties.\24However, about 85 percent of all unrepresented juveniles lived innonmetropolitan counties.  In metropolitan counties about 12 percentof juveniles were unrepresented.  By contrast, in nonmetropolitancounties about 55 percent of juveniles were unrepresented. Therefore, juveniles in nonmetropolitan counties were more than 4times as likely to go unrepresented as those in metropolitancounties. In California, our data for the 60,710 juvenile cases came from 5metropolitan counties.  Nevertheless, two of the five countiesaccounted for all of the unrepresented juveniles.  In the other threecounties, no juveniles were unrepresented.  In the two countiescontaining the unrepresented juveniles, the percentage of juvenilesunrepresented was about 2 and 18. Our findings on the variability in representation rates acrossnonmetropolitan and metropolitan court settings within states areconsistent with Feld's study of representation in juvenile casesdisposed in 1986 in Minnesota.\25 He found 63 percent of petitionedjuvenile cases in metropolitan counties were represented by counsel,but only 25 percent of petitioned juvenile cases in nonmetropolitancounties had representation.  He attributed these differences to theprocedural formality and due process orientation of metropolitancourts as compared with the more traditional and informal processingin nonmetropolitan courts. --------------------\22 For this analysis, we classified counties located withinmetropolitan statistical areas as "metropolitan counties," and weclassified counties outside of metropolitan statistical areas as"nonmetropolitan counties." These distinctions correspond roughly to(1) more densely populated or more urban and (2) less denselypopulated or more rural locations. \23 NCJJ data from California contained only metropolitan counties. \24 These data exclude one metropolitan county that contained 56percent of all unrepresented cases in the state of Nebraska. \25 Barry C.

PROVISION OF COUNSEL TENDED      NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THE      TYPE OF CRIME AND PRIOR      OFFENSE HISTORY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3The juvenile court data from California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraskaindicated that neither the type of offense nor juveniles' offensehistory were strongly related to representation rates. In California and Pennsylvania, juveniles who committed certainnonviolent offenses, such as property offenses, were generally aslikely to receive representation as juveniles who committed othermore serious offenses, such as violent crimes or drug trafficking. However, in Nebraska, juveniles who committed less serious crimes(e.g., property and public order) were less likely to be representedthan those who committed more serious crimes (e.g., violentoffenses). As shown in table 3, in California, juveniles petitioned to the courtfor violent offenses were about as likely to be represented (99.7percent) as juveniles sent to the court for property offenses (98.8percent).\26 In Pennsylvania, juveniles with violent and drugoffenses were only slightly more likely to be represented thanjuveniles with public order offenses (94.0 and 96.4 percent to 86.2percent).  In Nebraska, the juveniles' representation rates variedacross offense categories.  Juveniles with weapons, violent, and drugoffenses were more likely (90.6, 90.2, and 80.4 percent) than thosewith property offenses (62.6 percent) to be represented.  InNebraska, juveniles with property offenses comprised about 71 percentof all cases and 76 percent of all unrepresented cases.  For violentoffenses in Nebraska, 90 percent of the juveniles were represented. Offense history was not uniformly related to the likelihood ofrepresentation between the states.\27 In Pennsylvania, across allcrime types, those with one or more prior juvenile court dispositionswere more likely to be represented than those with none.  The extentof the difference in representation rates varied across crime type. For example, 94 percent of violent offenders in Pennsylvania with noprior referrals were represented, and 98 percent of violent offenderswith one prior offense were represented.  For public order or othernonviolent offenders in Pennsylvania, the difference inrepresentation rates for those with no prior offenses and those withone prior offense was more dramatic.  Seventy-seven percent of thepublic order offenders with no prior offenses were representedcompared with 93 percent of those with one prior offense.  InNebraska, however, there were no consistent patterns across crimetypes, which may be due in part to the small number of cases withmultiple prior offenses.  For example, for property offenders inNebraska, representation was likely to be increased from 54 percent(for offenders with no prior offenses) to 86 percent (for offenderswith three prior offenses) before decreasing to 78 percent for thosewith five or more prior offenses. --------------------\26 The results in this paragraph are based on our analysis of thebroad offense categories given in table 1.  We did a more refinedanalysis of the more detailed offense types comprising these offensecategories.  For details on this analysis, see appendix III. \27 Offense history was measured differently across the statesbecause of the way they collected their data.  For example, inNebraska, offense history was measured by the number of priorreferrals to juvenile court.  In Pennsylvania, however, it wasmeasured by the number of prior juvenile court dispositions.  InCalifornia, there was no direct measure of offense history, butCalifornia did indicate whether a juvenile was under probationsupervision at the time of the commission of the current offense.

Source:  Our analysis of NCJJ data. In addition to these differences in the likelihood of beingadjudicated, overall relatively few adjudicated cases wereunrepresented in California and Pennsylvania.  Specifically, of the41,985 cases adjudicated as delinquent in California, only 946 (or2.3 percent) were unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, only 305 of the8,488 cases adjudicated as delinquent (or 3.6 percent) wereunrepresented.  Conversely, in Nebraska, 1,468 of the 3,861 casesadjudicated as delinquent (about 38 percent) were unrepresented. The differences in the likelihoods of adjudication betweenrepresented and unrepresented juveniles in California was associatedwith the location of courts in which cases were heard and inPennsylvania with the use of informal adjustments after cases werepetitioned to the court.  The higher likelihood of adjudication forunrepresented cases in Nebraska was associated with juvenile courtcases located in more rural counties. Our analysis of the placement decision showed that unrepresentedjuveniles in Pennsylvania and Nebraska generally were less likely toreceive out-of-home placements than represented juveniles for eachoffense category.  In California, the overall likelihood of placementfor unrepresented juveniles was higher than represented juveniles. Of the 21,899 juveniles placed in California, 644 (or 2.9 percent)were unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, 39 of the 2,213 juveniles thatwere placed (or 1.8 percent) were unrepresented.  In Nebraska, 59 ofthe 463 juveniles placed (or 12.7 percent) were unrepresented. --------------------\28 Our review did not include all possible outcomes of juvenilecourt proceedings, but focused only on the juvenile being adjudicatedas a delinquent and receiving out-of-home placement.       OVERALL LIKELIHOOD OF      ADJUDICATION FOR JUVENILES      WITHOUT COUNSEL VARIED AMONG      STATES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :6.1The overall likelihood of a case being adjudicated as delinquent whena juvenile was not represented varied among states.  As shown intable 6, these percentages ranged from 93 percent in Nebraska toabout 55 percent in California to about 31 percent in Pennsylvania. The differences in the likelihood of adjudication betweenunrepresented and represented juveniles also varied among states. For example, unrepresented juveniles were less than one-half aslikely as represented juveniles in Pennsylvania to be adjudicated. In California, unrepresented juveniles were about 80 percent aslikely to be adjudicated as were represented juveniles.  (See tables2 and 3 for the number of juveniles petitioned and the percentage ofjuveniles who were petitioned and represented in each state.)In California and Pennsylvania, comparatively small percentages ofall adjudications (less than 4 percent) involved juveniles that werenot represented.  In Nebraska, a relatively large percentage of alladjudicated cases involved juveniles who were not represented (about38 percent).  See table 5 for the number of juveniles who wereadjudicated and not represented.

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. These aggregate differences in the likelihood of adjudication betweenthe two groups of juveniles (unrepresented and represented) tended tobe associated with the location of courts or with the use of informaladjustments by the court to dispose of cases. In California, all of the unrepresented juveniles came from two ofthe five counties from which we obtained data.\29 In one of these twocounties, the overall likelihood of adjudication was lower than incounties where no juveniles were reported as unrepresented. In Pennsylvania, our analysis and discussion with a state officialindicated that the aggregate differences in the likelihood ofadjudication were due largely to the use of consent decrees todispose of unrepresented cases.  A disproportionate number of casesinvolving unrepresented juveniles in Pennsylvania were disposed of bya consent decree--an informal disposition in which the juvenile andthe court agree to suspend the case providing the juvenile remains athome under probationary conditions for up to 6 months.  According toa state official, counsel generally is not present or is waivedbecause juveniles have no risk of adjudication (or placement) if theycomply with conditions of the consent decree.  For Nebraska, ouranalysis showed that a disproportionate number of cases involvingunrepresented juveniles were processed in nonmetropolitan counties,and cases involving unrepresented juveniles processed innonmetropolitan counties also were more likely to be adjudicated asdelinquent than those processed in metropolitan counties.  Thus,unrepresented juveniles in Nebraska were generally more likely tohave their cases adjudicated as delinquent in nonmetropolitancounties. --------------------\29 All five California counties were located in metropolitan areas.       UNREPRESENTED JUVENILES      GENERALLY WERE LESS LIKELY      TO BE PLACED THAN      REPRESENTED JUVENILES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :6.2As shown in table 7, unrepresented and adjudicated juveniles faceddifferent likelihoods of receiving out-of-home placements in thethree states.  California had the highest rate of out-of- homeplacement for juveniles without counsel.  Pennsylvania and Nebraskahad lower rates of placement for these juveniles, althoughunrepresented juveniles in Nebraska were less likely to be placedthan those in Pennsylvania.

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. Among states, the difference in the likelihood of placement betweenrepresented and unrepresented juveniles varied.  In California, theoverall difference in placement between represented and unrepresentedjuveniles was about 16 percent.  Between offense categories, thedifferences ranged from about 1 to 26 percent--weapon offenses wereabout 26 percent, drug offenses were about 5 percent, andindeterminate offenses were about 1 percent.  In Pennsylvania andNebraska, the overall differences between these two groups were about14 percent in Pennsylvania and 13 percent in Nebraska, and in thesetwo states the differences also varied. In California juveniles' overall likelihood of placement, representedor unrepresented, was the highest of the three states at about 52percent.  However, the likelihood that a juvenile would beunrepresented and placed was about 3 percent.  In contrast, juvenilesin Nebraska had the lowest likelihood of placement--about 12 percent. However, the risk that a juvenile would be unrepresented and placedwas largest in Nebraska.  These differences were due to differencesin the representation rates.  In California, more than 97 percent ofjuveniles were represented, and the chances that a placed juvenilewas unrepresented was comparatively small (about 3 percent). However, in Nebraska, about 35 percent of all cases were notrepresented.  Thus, even though Nebraska placed a smaller fraction ofits juveniles than did California, the overall chances that a placedjuvenile did not have counsel was much higher (about 13 percent).    REGRESSION MODELS FOR THREE   STATES SHOWED THAT VARIABLES   OTHER THAN REPRESENTATION WERE   STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH   ADJUDICATION AND PLACEMENT   OUTCOMES------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7The differences in outcomes between groups of unrepresented andrepresented juveniles were due more to variables other than thepresence of counsel.  To control for the variables that wereassociated with the likelihood of adjudication or placement and whichmight have been distributed unequally between these two groups ofjuveniles, we estimated logistic regression models for adjudicationand placement.  (See app.  III for detailed discussion of ourapproach.)For both the adjudication and placement outcomes, we estimated modelsfor up to 10 specific crime types, e.g., rape, robbery, and larceny. We included in our regressions three classes of independentvariables:  (1) demographic variables, such as age, race, and gender;(2) offense and offender-behavior variables, such as current offense,offense history, supervisory status, and type of counsel; and (3)court processing variables, such as length of time to disposition,detention prior to adjudication, the location of the court, and thetype of representation.\30Overall we estimated 24 adjudication models, 10 for California, 9 forPennsylvania, and 5 for Nebraska.  We also estimated 24 placementmodels for the same sets of crime types in each state.  For theadjudication models, we found that unrepresented juveniles generallywere about as likely as represented juveniles to have their casesadjudicated as delinquents.  Also, although we found that the type ofcounsel had effects on the likelihood of juveniles having their casesadjudicated as delinquent, the effects were not consistent amongstates or crime types.  In addition, our models showed thatvariables, such as being securely detained prior to adjudication, thejuvenile's prior criminal history, and the location of the court,tended to have the largest impacts on the likelihood of adjudication. For the placement models, we found that the absence of counsel wasnot associated with the likelihood of placement for most crime types. However, there were exceptions to this general finding. Specifically, the absence of counsel reduced the likelihood thatjuveniles were placed for some crimes in Pennsylvania and Nebraskabut not in California.  The type of counsel also influenced placementoutcomes for juveniles.  Finally, variables measuring the severity ofthe juveniles' offenses and the offense history tended to have thelargest impacts on placement outcomes. --------------------\30 For details on the crime type classifications used for eachstate's models and on all of the variables analyzed, see appendixIII.       ADJUDICATIONS ASSOCIATED      WITH COURT SUPERVISION,      LOCATION OF COURT, AND      INFORMAL ADJUSTMENTS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1The results of our modeling of the adjudication decision for thethree states showed that for some crime types the absence of counselhad an independent effect on the likelihood of adjudication. The effects of the type of counsel--public defenders, court-appointed attorneys, and privately paid attorneys--on the likelihoodof adjudication varied among crime types and states.  For example, inCalifornia, juveniles represented by court- appointed attorneys weremore likely to be adjudicated than juveniles represented by the otherattorney types for property, weapons, drug, and minor violent (e.g.,simple assault) offenses.  Conversely, they were less likely to beadjudicated for serious violent crimes such as rape and aggravatedassault.  In Pennsylvania, juveniles who were represented byprivately paid attorneys were less likely to be adjudicated thanjuveniles represented by other attorney types for aggravated assaultand larceny.  In Nebraska, juveniles who were represented by privatecourt-appointed attorneys were less likely to be adjudicated thanjuveniles represented by other attorney types. The specific variables, other than the presence of counsel, that wereassociated with the likelihood of adjudication varied, but there weresome similarities.  For example, in California, whether a juvenilewas under court supervision\31 at the time of the offense, thelocation of the county in which the case was disposed, and whetherthe juvenile was detained prior to adjudication tended to have largerassociations with the likelihood of adjudication, rather than whethera juvenile was represented.  For example, juveniles who were detainedprior to adjudication were from 1.2 to 1.5 times more likely to beadjudicated than juveniles not detained. In Pennsylvania, petitioned juveniles who had adjudicatory hearingsin a court in a metropolitan county and were detained prior to theiradjudicatory hearing increased their likelihood of being adjudicatedas delinquent.  However, the use of informal adjustments (i.e.,consent decrees) to dispose of cases resulted in petitioned juvenilesnot being adjudicated because they did not have adjudicatoryhearings. The models showed that unrepresented juveniles were generally aslikely as represented juveniles to have their case adjudicated.  Forsome crimes and under some conditions, however, this was not alwaysthe situation.  For example, unrepresented juveniles with burglaryand weapons offenses in California and Pennsylvania and unrepresentedjuveniles with larceny offenses in Nebraska were less likely to havetheir cases adjudicated.  In addition, in Nebraska juveniles in ruralareas, generally were less likely to have their cases adjudicatedthan those in urban areas.  To find out possible reasons for theseresults, we reviewed relevant literature and talked with an officialin Pennsylvania as well as officials representing the American BarAssociation, juvenile justice systems, and public defenders to obtaintheir reactions to these findings.  The 1988 and 1991 studies byBarry C.  Feld showed that juveniles may be less likely to have theircases adjudicated in rural areas because judges in those areas mayhave greater familiarity with the juveniles' cases and may handlethem less formally or are less likely to adjudicate them asdelinquent.  Consequently they may be less likely to appoint counsel. The officials whom we interviewed and our review of the literatureoffered the following possible reasons why juveniles without counselwere less likely to have their cases adjudicated:   The judges may be more likely to ensure that juveniles have counsel     when they believe that a juvenile has a greater risk of     receiving a severe disposition (e.g., placement).   The informality of juvenile court processing in some states may be     a reason.  Juveniles without representation are     disproportionately found in rural areas.  Judges in these areas     may have greater familiarity with cases, and handle them less     formally.  For example, for these cases, they may be less likely     to appoint counsel.   Judges may be more lenient to juveniles already under supervision     by the court and may be willing to continue their present     sentence, rather than adjudicating for a new offense.      Recognizing this, the juveniles may decide to waive counsel.   The relationships between judges and attorneys may be a factor.      For example, some judges may have antagonistic relationships     with attorneys.  The presence of attorneys, therefore, may     result in more severe dispositions.  Judges may also be more     protective of juveniles without counsel and, therefore, less     likely to give them a severe disposition. --------------------\31 The juvenile was being supervised as a ward of the courtimmediately prior to the referral.       LIKELIHOOD OF PLACEMENT WAS      STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH      DETENTION AND PRIOR OFFENSE      HISTORY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.2In our regression models, we analyzed variables that were associatedwith placement outcomes.\32 The models indicated generally that (1)whether the juvenile was detained prior to adjudication and (2) prioroffense history had a large impact on the likelihood of placement. In each state, across most crime types, juveniles detained prior toadjudication were more likely to be placed than juveniles who werenot detained.  In general, detention prior to adjudication was viewedas an indication of the severity of the offense, and juveniles whowere part of more severe cases were more likely to be placed. Therefore, the positive association between detention and thelikelihood of placement is not surprising. Similarly, juveniles' prior offense history or prior contact with thejuvenile justice system had strong and positive effects on thelikelihood of placement for most crime types for California andPennsylvania.  In California, juveniles who were under courtsupervised probation for a previous offense when they committed theircurrent offense were from 2 to 8 times more likely to be placed (forall crimes except rape and robbery) than juveniles who were not undercourt supervision.  In Pennsylvania, juveniles with more than 3priors were from 4 to 27 times more likely to be placed (for allcrimes except weapons) than juveniles with fewer than 3 priors. We also found that the types of representation influenced thelikelihood of placement.  For example, in California and Nebraskajuveniles who were represented by privately paid attorneys were lesslikely to be placed than juveniles who were represented by otherattorney types for larceny and drug-related crimes.  In Pennsylvania,juveniles represented by privately paid attorneys were more likely tobe placed than juveniles represented by other attorney types foraggravated assault and larceny. --------------------\32 For a discussion of the constraints imposed on our analysis bythe small number of unrepresented and placed cases, see appendix III.    JUVENILES IN ADULT CRIMINAL   COURT HAD SAME RIGHT TO   REPRESENTATION AS ADULTS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8Under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution, all defendants,including juveniles being tried as adults, have the right to "theassistance of counsel for his or her defense." We could not locate adatabase containing information on how frequently juveniles wererepresented in adult court.  Our review of the law showed thatjuveniles tried as adults were to be afforded the same right torepresentation as adults tried in criminal court.  In addition, theresults of our prosecutor's survey revealed their overallsatisfaction with the quality of counsel juveniles were receiving inadult court.    QUALITY OF COUNSEL PROVIDED   JUVENILES CONSIDERED ADEQUATE   BY SURVEY RESPONDENTS AND LOCAL   OFFICIALS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9According to state officials, no criteria existed to determine howwell juveniles were being represented by counsel, either in adult orjuvenile court.  For example, we found no national or state databasesdesigned to define or measure quality within the context of thejuvenile justice system.  In the absence of such criteria, weobtained some perspective of how well juveniles were beingrepresented in both juvenile and adult court by soliciting the viewsof juvenile justice officials around the country.  To obtain someperspective, we conducted a nationally representative survey ofprosecutors that handle juvenile justice matters and interviewedselected juvenile court judges in eight states.  In addition, throughpersonal interviews, we obtained the opinions of juvenile justiceofficials in four states.  In our survey of prosecutors andinterviews with judges and various officials, we asked questionsregarding their perceptions of the quality of counsel across severaldimensions, including overall (1) preparation, (2) legal skills, and(3) effectiveness.  The questions were targeted to the three types ofcounsel that represent juveniles in both juvenile and adult courts: public defenders, privately paid attorneys, and court-appointedattorneys. The results of our survey and discussions revealed overallsatisfaction with the quality of counsel juveniles were receiving,both in adult and juvenile courts.  Some officials, however, raisedconcerns over nonqualitative considerations that were perceived toaffect the quality of counsel, such as high caseloads and limitedstate funding.       PROSECUTORS WERE GENERALLY      SATISFIED WITH QUALITY OF      ALL THREE TYPES OF COUNSEL      PROVIDED JUVENILES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.1Our survey showed that while there were some differences in qualityof these three types of counsel, the respondents generally viewed allthree types of attorneys as being sufficiently prepared, possessingthe requisite legal skills, and representing their clientseffectively.\33 For example, as table 8 shows, most prosecutorsresponded that all three types of counsel in juvenile court were wellprepared.  Similarly, as shown in table 9, most prosecutors respondedthat all counsel in adult court were well prepared.  (See app.  V foradditional details on our survey of prosecutors.)

Source:  GAO Survey. Finally, we asked prosecutors for their views on the impact ofrepresentation on juvenile dispositions that were "similar" exceptfor the presence of counsel.  Most prosecutors believed that havingcounsel did not have a big impact on the eventual outcome of thecase.  About 70 percent said that juveniles received similardispositions regardless of whether they had counsel.  Therefore, inthe views of most prosecutors, having representation in juvenilecourt did not produce large, measurable differences in outcomes forjuveniles. --------------------\33 We did not obtain a national perspective from other juvenilejustice officials (e.g., judges or public defenders).       JUDGES WERE GENERALLY      SATISFIED WITH QUALITY OF      COUNSEL PROVIDED TO      JUVENILES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.2We obtained the views of 16 judges regarding the issues related tothe quality of counsel within their jurisdictions in Florida,Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, andUtah. Overall, the judges indicated that the quality of counsel provided tojuveniles in juvenile court was adequate.  For example, 10 of the 12judges who commented on the quality of counsel provided juveniles injuvenile court characterized their perception of quality of counselwith responses such as "acceptable," "good," and "excellent." Inaddition, one of the 12 judges indicated that the counsel affordedjuveniles in juvenile court was as good as the counsel adults receivein adult court.  However, when asked to comment on the quality ofcounsel by attorney type (i.e., public defender, private, andcourt-appointed), 7 of the 11 judges who responded indicated thatquality of counsel varied by type of attorney.  For example, four ofthe seven judges noted that, of the three attorney types, publicdefenders are generally more knowledgeable about issues such asjuvenile law, court proceedings, and disposition options.  One judgeof the four, in noting the public defender's familiarity withjuvenile court law, commented that he perceived public defenders as"specialists."In commenting on the dimensions of quality representation in ajuvenile case, judges most often cited (1) legal skills, (2)knowledge of the law, (3) commitment to the client, and (4)preparation.  Other dimensions cited were experience, a thoroughinvestigation of the case, knowledge of alternatives, and meetingwith the client.       OFFICIALS IN FOUR STATES      VISITED BELIEVED QUALITY OF      COUNSEL WAS GENERALLY      ADEQUATE, DESPITE LIMITED      RESOURCES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.3We discussed the quality of counsel issue with various juvenile courtand justice officials--including juvenile prosecutors, judges,attorneys, service workers, and probation officers--located in eightjurisdictions in Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Utah. According to state officials, none of these states had developedcriteria against which quality of counsel provided could be measured. However, two jurisdictions had established specific qualificationsthat attorneys must meet to represent juveniles in certain cases.\34Overall our discussions with juvenile justice officials revealedgenerally favorable responses concerning the quality of counselprovided to juveniles.  Further, several of the officials in Florida,Louisiana, and Pennsylvania indicated that, in terms of effectiverepresentation, public defenders are at least as capable as theprivate attorneys in representing juveniles.  The most frequentlycited reasons were the public defenders' familiarity and experiencewith juvenile court procedures and available disposition or serviceoptions.  For example, several of these officials noted that publicdefenders may do a better job than private attorneys because they aremore knowledgeable of the laws and local rules governing juvenileproceedings.  In Utah, one official noted that while some privateattorneys may be more aggressive, court-appointed attorneys developmore expertise in handling juvenile cases. However, some of these officials raised nonqualitative considerationsthat were perceived to affect the quality of counsel, such as highcaseloads and limited state funding.  They recognized that whilepublic defenders tended to have the most experience in juvenile lawand procedures, the officials also noted that public defenders hadvery high caseloads.  For example, one official noted that because ofthe limited resources, public defenders do not have as much time toprepare and often must seek continuances while others pointed outthat the number of public defenders had not kept pace with theincreased demand for indigent defense services.  Another officialcommented that the court-appointed attorneys do not have as manyresources or the time to devote to a case as private attorneys. --------------------\34 The two jurisdictions included Tallahassee, Florida, andPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania.  Tallahassee officials told us that theSecond Judicial Circuit required that, when appointing an attorney tohandle a case representing a juvenile in a case in which more thanthe one juvenile is involved, the appointed attorney must (1) be anactive member in good standing of the Florida Bar Association; (2)have at least 1 year of juvenile court practice with demonstratedcompetence; (3) have had, within the past two years, some specializedtraining in juvenile law or litigation; (4) be familiar with therequisite court system, including specifically the procedural rulesregarding timeliness of filings and procedural default; and (5) havedemonstrated proficiency in and commitment to quality representation. The Philadelphia Criminal Rules provide guidance on the appointmentof counsel.  The rules required the juvenile court to maintain a listof attorneys qualified for appointment in both major felony juvenileand nonmajor felony juvenile cases.  The rules also specified that,major felony juvenile cases (where the juvenile is likely to beincarcerated as a juvenile or certified to an adult court), theattorney must (1) have qualified for appointment for adult felonycases, (2) have prior experience in at least five juvenile cases,which were tried to completion, and (3) have had at least two majorfelony juvenile cases in the past 2 years.  For all other juvenilecases, however, the attorney must have fulfilled the requirements forappointment of counsel in adult misdemeanor cases.  For both majorand nonmajor cases, the Rules specify that attorneys must havecompleted at least one continuing legal education course in juvenilelaw within the past year, are familiar with the Pennsylvania JuvenileAct and the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Juvenile Court Rules,and are reasonably available to accept appointment. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.4We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General; theAdministrator, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention;the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interestedparties.

Each judicialcircuit has a juvenile court judge, who is appointed by the circuitcourt. \b "Organized" as defined by the National Center for Juvenile Justice(NCJJ), refers to the level of government from which a service isorganized in a state.  NCJJ arrived at this definition by determining(1) the level of government in a state from which the authority forthe provision of a service originates (e.g., probation services aredelivered at the local level but may not be organized from thatlevel) and (2) the level of government in a state from which thedelivery of service can be directly affected. \c "Administered" as defined by NCJJ, refers to the branch ofgovernment that is vested with the responsibility for the day-to-dayprovision of a service. \d In all but three counties, (Kansas City, St.  Louis City, and St. Louis County), every circuit court has an intake unit administered byprobation. \e The county executive funds a probation department that usuallysupports a separate juvenile probation division.  The juvenileprobation function often includes intake and investigation services. \f Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services is anintegrated system that delivers social, health, and rehabilitativeservices to children and youth in 11 Children, Youth and Familydistricts.  Each district maintains a program office that isresponsible for integrated intake and program coordination thatencompass delinquency, child welfare, and health services. \g In other states, this individual may be referred to as a probationofficer. \h On the state level, the Department of the Youth Authority,Community Corrections Branch, has regional offices that work closelywith county probation to run prevention and community correctionsprograms.  The Department also administers state funds that flow tocounty probation. \i The Division employs Community Control Officers to supervisejuveniles placed on community control (probation supervision) bycircuit courts and to provide aftercare supervision to juvenilesreleased on "furlough" from juvenile institutions.  Several CommunityControl Unit Offices are located throughout each District. \j NCJJ has defined aftercare as the community supervision of youthreleased from the state delinquent institution.

However, in Douglas, Lincoln, and Sarpy counties,separate juvenile courts exercise jurisdiction.  Nebraska statuteauthorizes the establishment of separate juvenile courts in countieswith a population greater than 30,000 where authorized by theelectorate.  In Nebraska, both county courts and juvenile courtsexercise their jurisdiction over delinquency matters in concurrencewith district courts. \b A Juvenile Court Judges Commission advises juvenile courts on theproper care of delinquents, establishes administrative procedures andstandards, examines personnel practices and employment standards usedin probation offices, collects and publishes statistics, administersa grant-in-aid program to improve county juvenile probation services,and provides training. \c In Allegheny and Philadelphia counties, the Family Court Divisionof the Court of Common Pleas exercises jurisdiction. \d "Organized" as defined by NCJJ, refers to the level of governmentfrom which a service is organized in a state.  NCJJ arrived at thisdefinition by determining (1) the level of government in a state fromwhich the authority for the provision of a service originates (e.g.,probation services are delivered at the local level but may not beorganized from that level) and (2) the level of government in a statefrom which the delivery of service can be directly affected. \e "Administered" as defined by NCJJ, refers to the branch ofgovernment that is vested with the responsibility for the day-to-dayprovision of a service. \f Juvenile probation services vary widely among counties.  Thenumber of staff and the caseload per probation officer are greatlyaffected by the size and wealth of the particular county.  Smallercounties generally maintain a small staff consisting of one to twopeople who are likely to handle both adult and juvenile cases. \g Screening varies among counties.  In Douglas County, for example,the county attorney screens the juvenile over the phone, having nevermet the individual.  In Sarpy County, on the other hand, ProbationOfficers screen the juvenile in person. \h In 1985, Nebraska's Juvenile probation services transitioned to astatewide system.  Accordingly, juvenile probation services operateunder the Nebraska Probation System of the State Judicial Branch. \i NCJJ has defined aftercare as the community supervision of youthreleased from the state delinquent institution. Source:  We developed this information from discussions with variousstate and local juvenile justice officials, court administrators,juvenile justice advocacy groups, judges, and prosecutors.  We alsoreviewed federal, state, and local documents on juvenile justiceprocedures and processes.

OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY========================================================== Appendix IIThe 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice andDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) required us toconduct a study of access to counsel during delinquency proceedingsin juvenile court.  In discussions with the staffs of the HouseCommittee on Economic and Educational Opportunities (formerly theCommittee on Education and Labor) and the Senate Committee on theJudiciary, we agreed to  review state laws for 15 states that we selected to determine     juveniles' right to counsel,  determine the frequency with which juveniles have counsel in     juvenile courts in three states,  determine the likely impact of counsel on juvenile outcomes,  determine if juveniles who are in adult court have counsel, and  provide insights regarding the issue of quality of counsel. In addressing these objectives, we met with officials from OJJDP,NCJJ, and other organizations familiar with juvenile justice issues,such as the American Bar Association, National Legal Aid DefendersAssociation, and the Coalition for Juvenile Justice to determinetheir perspectives on juveniles' access to counsel.  We conducted areview of literature identified in bibliographies provided by NCJJand OJJDP as well as articles and studies we identified.  We usedonly those studies that were relevant to addressing our objectives. We did not evaluate the studies or their limitations.  Also, tobetter understand state juvenile justice systems, we developedprofiles of juvenile justice processes in nine states:  Arizona,California, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania,South Carolina, and Utah.  We developed this information fromdiscussions with various state and local juvenile justice officials,court administrators, juvenile justice advocacy groups, judges, andprosecutors.  We also reviewed state and local documents on juvenilejustice procedure and processes.  We did not verify the accuracy ofthe information through a review of state statutes and administrativerules.  These states were selected for their range of urban and rurallocations and their diversity of juvenile justice systems. To determine the scope of juveniles' right to counsel in selectedstates, we analyzed statutes, administrative rules, and case law in15 states:  Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana,Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania,South Carolina, Texas, and Utah.  We selected these states afterconsidering such factors as the diversity of each state's juvenilejustice system and the availability of state juvenile courtprocessing data maintained by NCJJ.\1 In addition to our legalanalysis of statutes in selected states, we reviewed an analysis ofstatutes nationwide prepared by NCJJ. To determine the frequency with which juveniles have counsel injuvenile court, we used annual juvenile court data sets and caserecords compiled and maintained by NCJJ.\2 Specifically, we analyzeddata on petitioned delinquency offenders in juvenile courts inCalifornia, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska.  We identified four otherstates with NCJJ data on counsel, which we excluded because they werethe subject of another study (Minnesota), had a relatively smallpopulation (North Dakota), or did not have data we needed for othermandated juvenile justice studies--e.g., Juvenile Justice:  MinimalGender Bias Occurred in Processing Noncriminal Juveniles(GAO/GGD-95-56, Feb.  28, 1995).  We used the NCJJ data for thecounties in the three states for which data were available to developstatistics for a 2-year period in California and Nebraska coveringcalendar years 1990 and 1991, and for 1991 for Pennsylvania, the mostrecent available data at the time of our review.  The sample for eachstate was limited to petitioned delinquency cases only, excludingstatus cases as well as abuse, neglect, and dependency cases, androutine traffic offenses.  We arranged the delinquency offenses intoseven broad categories:  violent, property, simple assault, drugs,weapons, public order, and indeterminate. To obtain indications of the impact of counsel on dispositions, wedid a two-part analysis.  First, we developed statistics on caseprocessing outcomes for each state.  Second, we developed statisticalmodels that controlled for variables that may affect a juvenile'sdisposition, e.g., offense severity or prior history.  Specifically,for each state, we estimated a series of logistic regression modelsthat investigated the relationships between the type ofrepresentation in juvenile delinquency proceedings and key decisionpoints in the juvenile judicial process controlling for a number ofrelevant variables.  We measured four types of representation:  (1)no counsel, (2) privately retained counsel, (3) court-appointedprivate counsel, and (4) public defender.  We analyzed two keydecision points:  (1) whether the juvenile was, in fact, adjudicatedas delinquent and (2) whether the juvenile received an out-of-homeplacement as disposition of the case after adjudication.  Weestimated the models separately for each of the 3 states for up to 10crime types. Data were available for five counties in California which represented40 percent of the juvenile population between ages 10 and 17.  ThePennsylvania data, which were only for 1991, excluded cases fromPhiladelphia because Philadelphia petitions all cases, not just themore serious cases, to juvenile court.  These limitations apply toall results using California and Pennsylvania data.  Table 1 providesinformation on the specific types of crimes falling into each offensecategory in each state.  The figures in this table were computedafter excluding cases in which the type of counsel was missing in thedatabase.  In California, this amounted to about 5 percent of 64,275cases; in Pennsylvania about 5 percent of the 15,397 cases; inNebraska about 18 percent of the 6,603 cases.  According to aNebraska official, data were not available on representation rates inone of the state's larger counties.  Therefore, we also omitted thiscounty's cases from our analysis, which amounts to 14 percent of allof Nebraska's cases.  However, the official added that an estimated75 percent of the juveniles were represented at adjudication hearingsin that county. Regarding juveniles in adult court, we were unable to locate anational database containing information on the frequency ofrepresentation.  However, we discussed the matter with juvenilejustice officials during our field visits and solicited informationin our survey of prosecutors. To provide insights regarding the quality of counsel, we surveyed anational sample of local prosecutors; interviewed juvenile justiceofficials, such as judges at the state and local levels; and surveyedpublic defender offices. To gather opinions and experiences of prosecutors concerning accessto counsel in the juvenile court system, we obtained 226 completedquestionnaires from a nationally representative, probability sampleof district prosecutor offices that deal with juveniles in juvenilecourts.  We first identified a stratified probability sample ofcounty prosecutors in 290 of the 3,110 counties in the United States. To gather information about large and small counties, the sample wasstratified on the basis of the number of felony convictions in 1985. The 1985 felony convictions were used to first draw this sample of290 counties in 1986 for the National Judicial Reporting Program. We developed the questionnaire with advice from experts at NCJJ andthe Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics andpretested it with selected prosecutor offices.  The survey was mailedin March 1994.  Two sets of follow-up telephone calls and twoadditional mailings were conducted between May and July 1994. We contacted all 290 selected counties to determine whether they hadjuvenile prosecutors and to determine the counties over which theprosecutors had jurisdiction.  We determined that 270 of the 290counties were eligible members of our study population of prosecutoroffices that dealt with juvenile offenders in juvenile court.  Afterweighing the probabilities of selection, we estimated that the studypopulation consisted of approximately 2,118 such juvenile prosecutorsin the United States.  This number is less than the number ofcounties (3,110), partly because some counties are consolidated undera single juvenile prosecutor and partly because some jurisdictions donot have prosecutors that appear in juvenile court.  Of the 270sampled prosecutors from the study population, 226 responded, for aresponse rate of 84 percent. We estimated all figures reported in the text from the returnedquestionnaires to the estimated 2,118 juvenile prosecutor offices. All sample surveys are subject to sampling error.  This may occurbecause the sample results may differ from what would have beenobtained if the entire population had received and returned thequestionnaire.  The size of sampling errors in any survey dependslargely on the number of respondents and the amount of variability inthe data.  In this report, all estimates, with two exceptions, aremade at the 95-percent confidence level with a sampling error of plusor minus 10 percent.  This means that, if we drew repeated samplesfrom the entire study population of prosecutor offices, 19 out of 20samples would produce estimates within 10 percent of the trueproportion in the total population.  In table 9, the estimates of 80percent and 74 percent have confidence intervals of plus or minus10.1 and 10.2 percent, respectively. In addition to the reported sampling errors, any survey may besubject to nonsampling errors as well.  For example, differences inhow a particular question is interpreted, in the sources ofinformation that are available to respondents or in the types ofpeople who do not respond, can introduce unwanted variability intosurvey results. We included steps in the data collection and data analysis stages tominimize such nonsampling errors.  We selected the sample from acomplete list of all counties, and we pretested our questionnairewith experts and members of the target population.  Our extensivefollow-up efforts were designed to maximize the response rate, and weachieved a final response rate of 84 percent.  All data were keyedtwice and verified during data entry, and all computer analyses werereviewed by a second, independent analyst. We also administered a semistructured interview to 16 judges togather information concerning their views on the quality of counselprovided to juveniles.  We asked the judges about their perceptionsrelated to quality of counsel for the three types of counsel providedto juveniles--public defenders, private attorneys, andcourt-appointed counsel.  The judges--located in Florida, Louisiana,Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah--werejudgmentally selected on the basis of their availability, and theirviews do not necessarily represent those of other judges. We also sent a questionnaire to 26 state-level public defenderoffices.  We selected those states that, according to officials fromthe National Legal Aid Defenders' Association, comprised the universeof statewide public defender offices that represented juveniledelinquents.  We received 19 responses and followed up with telephonecalls for clarification. In reporting survey and interview results from juvenile justiceofficials, we did not evaluate their responses for possible biases. To develop comparative information about the availability of counselfor delinquents, we visited a total of eight jurisdictions withineach of four states.  Those jurisdictions included Tallahassee andTampa, Florida; Baton Rouge and West Francisville, Louisiana;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Salt Lake City, Logan, and Ogden,Utah.  We judgmentally selected Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, andUtah on the basis of several factors, such as the large concentrationof juvenile offenders, the diversity of juvenile justice systems, therange of urban and rural locations, and the availability of statejuvenile court processing data from NCJJ.  Generally in each of theselected states, we interviewed local judges, prosecutors, and publicdefenders as well as representatives of juvenile courts, barassociations, and state child welfare agencies.  We selected them onthe basis of their availability at the time of our visits.  Wherepossible, we obtained statistical information on access to counsel,which was maintained by the jurisdiction, and observed juvenileproceedings in session. --------------------\1 Each year, NCJJ collects juvenile court processing data for up to26 states. \2 We used data that were housed in and made available by theNational Juvenile Court Data Archive, which is maintained by NCJJ andsupported by a grant from OJJDP.  These data were originallycollected by the Alameda County, CA, Probation Department; the LosAngeles County, CA, Probation Department; the San Francisco County,CA, Juvenile Probation Department; the San Joaquin County, CA,Probation Department; the County of Ventura, CA, Corrections ServicesAgency; the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and CriminalJustice; and the Pennsylvania Center for Juvenile Justice Trainingand Research.  Neither the original data collectors nor NCJJ bear anyresponsibility for our analyses or interpretations of the data. METHODS FOR ANALYZING THEFREQUENCY OF REPRESENTATION ANDIMPACTS OF COUNSEL ON JUVENILECOURT OUTCOMES========================================================= Appendix IIIThis appendix discusses the methods we used (1) to review thefrequency with which juveniles accused of delinquent activitiesreceived counsel and (2) to assess the impact of counsel on twojuvenile court outcomes.  For each issue, we restricted our analysisto cases petitioned to juvenile court that were disposed in calendaryears 1990 and 1991 in California, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania.  Forthe purposes of this analysis, we used the term case to refer to asingle juvenile defendant.  We used petitioned to refer to defendantswho had adjudicatory hearings or who were handled in a formal mannerby the juvenile court.    APPROACH OF THE REVIEW------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:1To review the frequency of representation, we identified cases ofjuveniles petitioned to court and then determined if they had legalrepresentation during the processing of their cases.  We looked atwhether represented juveniles differed from those withoutrepresentation on three characteristics:  (1) the type of crime withwhich they were charged, (2) their offense history, and (3) thelocation of the court in more urban or more rural counties. We reviewed the relationship between legal representation and twojuvenile court outcomes--adjudication as delinquent and receiving anout-of-home placement after being adjudicated as delinquent. Adjudication refers to the fact-finding hearing in which the juvenilecourt determines whether or not there is sufficient evidence tosustain the allegations in a petition.  Out-of-home placement refersto post-adjudication dispositions that result in the placement of thejuvenile outside his or her own home, regardless of whether suchplacement is in a secure or nonsecure facility. To analyze these relationships we compared the differences inoutcomes for juveniles who were represented against those who werenot, controlling only for the type of crime.  Second, to control forvariables other than the type of representation, which may also beassociated with juvenile court outcomes, we conducted regressionanalysis of the relationship between the outcomes and juveniles' casecharacteristics.  Specifically, we estimated separate logisticregressions for up to 10 crime types in each of the 3 states for eachof the 2 juvenile court outcomes:  (1) whether a juvenile wasadjudicated as delinquent and (2) whether an adjudicated juveniledelinquent was placed out-of-home\1 .  In estimating these equations,we controlled for three classes of characteristics (1) demographicvariables, such as age, race, and gender; (2) offense andoffender-behavior variables, such as current offense, offensehistory, and juvenile court supervisory status; and (3) juvenilecourt processing variables, such as detention prior to adjudicationand the location of the court.\2We estimated these regressions to answer three general questions: (1) What were the independent or main effects of whether a juvenilewas represented on the likelihood either of being adjudicated or ofbeing placed?  (2) What difference did the type of counsel--publicdefender, court appointed, and privately paid--have on theselikelihoods?  and (3) What independent variables had the largestimpacts on the dependent variables? --------------------\1 These two dependent variables--adjudicated and placed--weredichotomous dependent variables.  Each had only two possible values. Juveniles' cases either were adjudicated as delinquent or they werenot.  Similarly, they either were placed out-of-home or they werenot.  In our analysis, we looked first at whether a case wasadjudicated and second, only for those cases that were adjudicated,we looked at whether they were placed.  We did not identify types ofplacements because of data limitations. \2 The specific crime types and variables used in the models arediscussed in more detail in the following sections.    APPROACH, DATA, AND METHODS TO   THE ANALYSIS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2In general, we discuss three types of analyses in this appendix. First, we analyzed the data to determine the number of cases in whichjuveniles were represented or not.  Drawing on issues raised in theliterature, we analyzed the representation rates for a number ofcharacteristics, including type of offense, offense history, andlocation of juvenile courts. Second, we compared juvenile court outcomes--whether adjudicated orplaced out-of-home--of juveniles who were represented with those whowere not represented.  We reported the aggregate differences betweenthese two groups by offense categories. Third, because juvenile court outcomes depend on more than whether ajuvenile had counsel, we estimated logistic regressions to determinethe independent impacts of the three types of representation on thelikelihood of adjudication and placement controlling for othercharacteristics that affect these likelihoods.  In addition, wesought to determine which characteristics were most stronglyassociated with these likelihoods.       DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.1We used juvenile court case-level data from California, Nebraska, andPennsylvania for cases disposed in calendar years 1990 and 1991.\3 Weobtained these data from the National Juvenile Court Data Archive(NJCDA) of the NCJJ.  We obtained the data on magnetic tape, and weperformed our own analysis of these data.  We consulted with researchstaff at NCJJ to obtain assistance in understanding the data and inclassifying certain variables for analysis.  For example, we obtainedassistance in categorizing the specific statutory offenses orbehaviors that were recorded on the data tapes into offensecategories and offense types that we could use in the analysis. The data from California were limited to five of the largest counties(Alameda, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jaoquin, and Ventura) thatreported their data to the NJCDA.  These counties represented about40 percent of the state's juvenile population between ages 10 and 17. For Pennsylvania, we used only the 1991 data, and we did not includedata from Philadelphia.  In 1991, 14,584 cases were petitioned tojuvenile courts in Pennsylvania in counties other than Philadelphiacounty, where there were 8,102 cases.  Those petitioned inPhiladelphia county were not directly comparable with those in therest of the state because Philadelphia petitions all juvenile casesto court--regardless of the severity of the offense.  In the rest ofthe state, petitioned cases are usually limited to the more seriousoffenses or more serious offenders.  In addition, we limitedourselves to the 1991 data because in 1990, Pennsylvania did notreport data on the offense history of juveniles, and therefore wecould not analyze representation rates by looking at offense history. For similar reasons, we did not include data from Philadelphia countyfor either year.  In addition, Philadelphia also did not report onthe prior offense history of juveniles and certain other variablesthat we used in our analysis.  We were able to report, however, theoverall representation rates for Pennsylvania in 1990 andPhiladelphia in 1991.  (See the notes in table III.3.)Nebraska reported data from all of its counties in 1990 and 1991. However, Nebraska had the highest percentage of cases across thethree states in which the type of counsel was not reported (about 18percent).  In addition, we had to omit cases from one of the largestcounties in Nebraska because of the way it measured legalrepresentation.  According to a state official, unlike the othercounties, in that one large county, the type or lack of legalrepresentation is recorded when a juvenile arrives at intake.  Atintake, few juveniles are accompanied by attorneys; therefore, mostcases in that county are reported as not having counsel.  However,the state official indicated that about 75 percent of juveniles whoappeared before judges at adjudicatory hearings in that county wererepresented by attorneys even though the reporting system indicatedthat they were unrepresented.  Because the data systems did notindicate this change in representation, we deleted these cases fromour analysis.  There were 905 cases petitioned to juvenile court inthis county, or about 16 percent of all petitioned cases in Nebraska. --------------------\3 These were the most recent data that we were able to obtain fromNCJJ at the time we began our analysis.       SAMPLE SELECTION ISSUES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.2For all three states, we limited our analysis to those cases thatwere petitioned to or formally handled by the juvenile courts fordelinquency offenses.  This choice was made irrespective of the finaldisposition of cases.       CRIME CATEGORIES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.3To analyze these data, we classified detailed information on theoffenses for which juveniles were petitioned to court into broaderoffense categories.  For example, the original California dataidentified offenses by the particular California statute and sectionthat was violated.  More than 1,000 potential types of violationswere listed.  In Pennsylvania, a few hundred specific offenses werelisted with which a juvenile could be charged.  We created sevenbroad classes or categories of crimes, which we used in thedescriptive analysis to show representation rates and differences injuvenile court outcomes between represented and unrepresentedjuveniles.  Within these broader categories, we defined severalspecific crime categories.  We used these more specific crime typesin our regression analyses to control for the wide variation inbehaviors that were represented in the general crime categories.  Seetable 1 for our classification scheme. For each state we estimated regressions for different sets of crimetypes.  The specific number and types of crimes were determined bythe available data.  In California, we estimated regressions for 10different crime types.  In Pennsylvania, we estimated 9 and inNebraska, we estimated regressions for 5 crime types.  Thedetermination as to whether or not a regression could be estimatedwas based on the number of cases falling into each crime type.       REGRESSION METHODS----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.4We estimated logistic regressions for two dichotomous dependentvariables:  (1) whether a case was adjudicated as delinquent and (2)whether a case was placed out-of-home.   First, we estimated these regressions to determine the independent     effects of representation on juvenile court outcomes when we     controlled for relevant variables that also might have been     associated with these outcomes.  This was a refinement of our     earlier analysis in which we simply reported the aggregated     differences in whether adjudication or placement was likely for     counseled versus uncounseled juveniles.   Second, we estimated the regressions to determine whether variables     representing the presence of counsel or other factors were more     strongly associated with the two outcomes.  We did this to     determine the relative importance of counsel in predicting     juvenile court outcomes.   Third, we estimated the regressions to analyze the effects of     different types of counsel on these two outcomes.  We estimated     the independent effects of having no counsel, privately retained     counsel, court-appointed private counsel, and public defender     representation on the likelihood of adjudication and placement.      We were able to note differences in the effects or impacts of     the types of counsel for various types of crime across the three     states. We fit the data using maximum likelihood techniques.\4 We testedalternative specifications using likelihood ratio tests to arrive atour final models.\5We used the parameters from the models and the means of the variablesin the models to estimate probabilities in order to compare thedifferences in the likelihood of adjudication or placement resultingfrom lack of representation and from different types of counsel.  Wemade these comparisons by estimating the overall probabilities fromthe variables in the models.  Then we estimated separate sets ofprobabilities for each type of counsel.  The differences in theestimated probabilities give an indication of the differences in thelikelihood of obtaining an outcome for a particular type of counsel,as compared with the overall estimated likelihood of obtaining thatoutcome. In addition, because the parameters from logistic regressions are noteasily interpretable, we exponentiated the estimated parameters toform the odds ratio for each variable in the final models.  The oddsratios have a relatively straightforward interpretation.  The oddsratio is an estimate of how much more or less likely it is for theoutcome of interest to be present among those having a particularcharacteristic than those not having that characteristic.  Forexample, an odds ratio of four for a variable indicating that a casewas unrepresented would be interpreted to show that unrepresentedcases were four times as likely as represented cases to have theoutcome of interest.  Our discussion of the effects of variables onthe outcomes is based largely on the use of odds ratios. --------------------\4 We used the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) logistic procedureto estimate the parameters in the models.  SAS uses iterativelyreweighted least squares to compute its estimates.  See, for example,SAS/STAT User's Guide, Volume 2, GLM-VARCOMP, Version 6, FourthEdition.  Cary, NC:  The SAS Institute, 1990. \5 As part of this effort, we used stepwise regression procedures toeliminate variables that did not add to the overall "goodness of fit"of each of the models.       VARIABLES USED IN THE      REGRESSION ANALYSES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.5As mentioned, we estimated models for two dependent or outcomevariables:  (1) whether a case was adjudicated as delinquent and (2)whether a case was placed out-of-home.  We used three broadcategories of independent variables in these regressions and specificvariables used in the models fell within these categories.  On thebasis of existing literature, we used (1) demographic, (2)offense-related, and (3) court-related broad classes of variables. Demographic variables included the juvenile's age, race, and gender. We included these variables in the analysis because the literature onjuvenile court dispositions identifies them either as importantdeterminants of outcomes or as indicators of important hypothesesabout judicial decisionmaking.  For example, age is important indetermining outcomes because judges may not want to commit very youngjuveniles to out-of-home placements.  Gender and race may beimportant indicators of bias. Offense-related variables included the current offense, more or lessserious offense behavior within offense types, and prior offensehistory.  These variables give indications of the seriousness of thebehavior for which a juvenile is being judged and the seriousness ofthe offender.  More serious offenses and more serious offenders(e.g., "career offenders") generally are viewed as more likely to beadjudicated as delinquent or to receive out-of-home placements. Omitting these variables may lead to overestimates of the effects oftypes of or lack of counsel on juvenile court outcomes. Finally, court-related variables included those related to judicialprocessing and those related to location or geography.  The courtprocessing variables included whether a case was represented and ifso the type of counsel, detention prior to adjudication, the lengthof time it took to dispose of a case, the source of referral tojuvenile court, whether a juvenile was under supervisory status atthe time of referral, and whether charges changed between referraland disposition.  The location variables included whether the courtwas in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan county\6 and the populationdensity of the county in which the case was heard. These variables were included for different reasons.  The measures ontypes of and lack of counsel were related to the key questions ofthis analysis.  Detention prior to adjudication or placement gaveanother indication of the severity of the case or of the need toensure that a juvenile would appear for a hearing.  The length oftime it took to dispose of a case may indicate the lack of evidencein a case, the weakness of a case, or the complexity of a case. Cases disposed of quickly may have been stronger or simpler cases. Change of charges, particularly a decrease in the severity of thecharges, indicates the severity of the case.  Finally, locationvariables at a minimum helped to classify courts into types ofcounties.  The literature suggests that rural courts arecharacterized by less formal processes in which a judge may know thejuvenile or juvenile's family personally and use that information indeciding cases.  Urban courts are characterized as having more formalmechanisms for deciding cases. Not all variables were available in each state's database and, insome cases, variables were measured differently across the statesbecause of the way events were recorded in their juvenile courts. Table III.1 shows the variables available for use, whether they wereused in a state, and if so, how they were measured in that state.

We included these variablesto determine if missing values were associated with the dependentvariables. --------------------\6 We defined metropolitan counties as those counties falling withina primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) or metropolitanstatistical area (MSA), as defined by the U.S.  Bureau of the Census. Nonmetropolitan counties fell outside of PMSAs or MSAs.  Thesedesignations were chosen as proxies for urban and less denselypopulated areas.  The data we obtained did not have measures oflocation that would have permitted us to identify urban and ruralareas, as defined by Census.  For California, all of the cases camefrom metropolitan counties.  For Pennsylvania, about 90 percent ofthe cases were from metropolitan counties.  For Nebraska, about 55percent of all cases were from metropolitan counties.       OMITTED VARIABLES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.6As in all modeling efforts, the results are interpretable only in thecontext of the variables included in the models.  Excluding relevantvariables from the models, such as a juvenile's demeanor or ajudges's personal knowledge of a case, could affect the estimates ofthe effects of variables in the models.  It is not possible, apriori, to determine the direction or magnitude of such effects ofall potentially relevant variables that may have been excluded fromthe models.  We tried to produce models that were reasonable, thatis, that included at least some of the important variables identifiedin the literature.  Ultimately, we were constrained in our efforts bythe variables contained in each state's database.       SAMPLE SELECTION AND CASES      ANALYZED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.7We estimated separate regressions for up to 10 crime types for theadjudication and placement outcomes in each state.  Table III.2 showsthe crime types for which we estimated models.  We selected thesecrime types primarily because of the number of cases available foranalysis with the exception of public order offenses.  We did notestimate models for public order offenses largely because of therelative lack of seriousness of these offenses.  We also did notestimate models for indeterminate offenses because we could notascertain the crime type.  We did not estimate models for otheroffense categories because of the wide variation in crime typesfalling into that category. For the adjudication models, we selected those cases that werepetitioned to juvenile court or otherwise handled more formally atthe initial processing of the case.\7 For the placement models, weselected only those cases that were adjudicated as delinquent.

For example,in Pennsylvania, there are differences between Philadelphia countyand the rest of the state in terms of which cases are petitioned tojuvenile court.  Philadelphia county petitions all cases, regardlessof seriousness, and then decides whether to dispose of cases formallythrough adjudication or informally by another mechanism, such as theconsent decree.  Further, regardless of the county in Pennsylvania,consent decrees are used as informal adjustments after cases arepetitioned to court.  In cases disposed of by consent decrees, ajuvenile master, rather than a juvenile court judge, hears the case;juveniles do not appear for an adjudicatory hearing; and juvenilestend not to receive legal representation in these cases.    RESULTS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3The results of our analyses are discussed in two sections.  First, wereviewed the findings on the frequency of representation and on thedifferences in the probabilities of adjudication and placement forunrepresented juveniles compared with represented juveniles in thedetailed crime type classifications.  Then we discuss three resultsfrom the modeling exercise:  (1) the effects of lack ofrepresentation on the likelihoods of adjudication and placement; (2)the effects of different types of counsel on the estimatedprobabilities of adjudication and placement; and (3) the variablesthat had the strongest associations with the adjudication andplacement outcomes.       REPRESENTATION RATES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3.1As table III.3 shows, the representation rates varied among thestates.  Overall, juveniles in California were more likely to berepresented for all serious crime types.  More than 99 percent of allviolent offenders and more than 98 percent of all property offendersin California were represented.  Only for the relatively less seriouscrime types, public order offenses, did the representation rate inCalifornia drop below 90 percent.  Besides that one crime category,over 99 percent of juveniles in California would have beenrepresented.

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. In Pennsylvania, the representation rates were similar, althoughslightly lower, than California's.  Nevertheless, 94 percent of allviolent offenders in Pennsylvania were represented.  Apart from fraud(with relatively few cases) and other property offenses, more than 88percent of Pennsylvania's property offenders were represented.  As inCalifornia, for comparatively less serious offenses, therepresentation rates were slightly lower in Pennsylvania. In Nebraska, however, representation rates are comparatively low atabout 65 percent overall.  These rates seem to decrease as crimesbecome less serious.  For example, violent offenders in Nebraskagenerally are more likely to be represented than property offenders.       COMPARATIVE PROBABILITIES OF      ADJUDICATION----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3.2Table III.4 shows the comparative probabilities of adjudication forrepresented and unrepresented juveniles for the detailed crime typeclassifications.  In general, for California and Pennsylvania,unrepresented juveniles were less likely to be adjudicated than thoserepresented.  In Nebraska, conversely, unrepresented juveniles weremore likely to be adjudicated as delinquent.

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. Table III.4 shows the relatively few unrepresented juvenile cases inCalifornia and Pennsylvania for many crime types.  In California, forfour of the nine crime types--all having fewer than 20 unrepresentedjuvenile cases--the probability of adjudication was higher forunrepresented juveniles.  Overall in California, only 946 of the41,985 adjudicated cases (or 2.2 percent) in table III.3 wereunrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, of the 8,488 cases that wereadjudicated, only 305 (or about 3 percent) were unrepresented.  Thedifferences in the likelihood of adjudication between unrepresentedand represented cases in California are based on relatively fewunrepresented juvenile cases.  For Pennsylvania, the same caveatholds true, that is, differences in the likelihood of adjudicationbetween represented and unrepresented juveniles are based on arelatively small number of unrepresented cases. In Pennsylvania, only for arson did the probability of adjudicationfor unrepresented juveniles exceed that of represented juveniles, andthere were fewer than 20 arson cases.  This suggests that a higherlikelihood of adjudication for unrepresented juveniles as comparedwith represented juveniles in California and Pennsylvania was arelatively rare event.  The higher likelihood in these cases may bedue to specific circumstances in the case that may not have beenmeasured or recorded in the state's juvenile court databases. In Nebraska, however, the probability of adjudication is higher forunrepresented juveniles than for represented juveniles for many crimetypes, whether or not there are relatively few unrepresented juvenilecases.  Overall, 2,156 of the 4,580 adjudicated cases (47 percent)were unrepresented in Nebraska.       COMPARATIVE PROBABILITIES OF      PLACEMENT----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3.3Table III.5 shows the comparative probabilities of placement forunrepresented and represented juveniles adjudicated in the threestates.  For most crime types across the three states, unrepresentedjuveniles were less likely to receive out-of-home placements thanrepresented juveniles, and, as with the adjudication outcomes, therewere a number of crime types with relatively few unrepresented cases(i.e., fewer than 20 cases) where juveniles faced placementdecisions.

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. Some exceptions occurred in California.  In most of the cases inwhich unrepresented juveniles were more likely than those representedto be placed, there were fewer than 20 unrepresented juvenile cases. The exception to this rule was for other property offenses, but thesecases tend to include relatively minor property offenses, such aspossession of stolen property. For Pennsylvania and Nebraska, arson in Nebraska was the only crimetype in which unrepresented juveniles were more likely to be placedthan those represented, and that result was based on fewer than 20unrepresented juvenile cases.  The major difference betweenCalifornia and both Pennsylvania and Nebraska was the prevalence withwhich each state used out-of-home placements as a juvenile courtdisposition.  California used placements at a higher rate than theother two states.  Consequently, unrepresented juveniles inCalifornia face an overall risk of placement that is somewhat higherthan in the other states, despite the fact that there were relativelyfew unrepresented juvenile cases being placed in California. However, because so few juveniles were unrepresented in California,the likelihood that a juvenile was both unrepresented and placed waslowest there of the three states.    RESULTS FROM THE REGRESSION   MODELS------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4Because we found differences in the comparative probabilities ofadjudication and placement between unrepresented and representedjuveniles, we looked more closely at the likelihood of receivingthese outcomes as a function of whether a case received legalrepresentation and the other characteristics of a case that maydetermine these outcomes.  Thus, we used the regressions first todetermine if the lack of representation had an independent effect onthe likelihood of adjudication and placement. Second, given the relatively small number of unrepresented cases inCalifornia and Pennsylvania, we analyzed the effect on adjudicationand placement outcomes of the different types of counsel.  Third,given the importance of offense severity and offense history tojudicial decisions, we used the regressions to determine whetherthese and other variables had stronger effects on the likelihood ofadjudication and placement than did the lack or type ofrepresentation. In interpreting the regression results, two caveats should beconsidered.  First, selection effects can influence outcomes at eachstage.  Selection effects refer to the process whereby juvenileshaving selected characteristics are the ones who move onto aparticular stage of processing.  The characteristics used to selectthe juveniles who move onto the next stage are important if they alsoare the characteristics used to determine whether or not a juvenilereceives representation.  For example, if juveniles who commit lessserious crimes are less likely to be adjudicated and less likely toreceive representation because they are less likely to beadjudicated, then these selection effects may cause our regressionsto over-estimate the effects of representation on juvenile courtoutcomes. Second, although we used relatively narrow crime types, the crimetypes encompass a relatively wide range of behaviors for which datawere not available.  For example, data on victim injury in robbery orassault cases were not available, but victim injury may be importantin judges' decisionmaking.  Similarly, these unmeasured behaviors mayalso be related to the provision of counsel and thus have some effecton the estimates of counsel's impact on juvenile court outcomes.\8--------------------\8 The data in tables III.3, III.4, and III.5 report probabilities ofvarious outcomes.  Some of these are quite high (e.g., California'spercentage represented).  If the grouped data were used in theregressions, we would encounter problems of restricted variances andvariables would not covary with the dependent variable.  By using theindividual-level data and estimating logistic regressions, weeliminated this potential problem.       ADJUDICATION OUTCOMES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1In the following discussion, the results of our analysis ofadjudication outcomes are considered on a state-by-state basis.  Theeffects of the lack of representation on adjudication are discussedfollowed by the effects of different types of representation.  Theeffects of other variables on adjudication concludes the review ofeach state.          CALIFORNIA--------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1.1In California, almost all adjudicated cases were represented. Specifically, of the 41,985 cases reported as adjudicated on tableIII.3, only 946 were unrepresented.  As a result, there wererelatively few unrepresented cases from which to derive estimates ofthe effects of lacking representation on the likelihood ofadjudication.\9 Nevertheless, for 7 of the 10 crime types for whichwe estimated adjudication models in California, we found that thelack of representation did not exert independent effects on thelikelihood of adjudication.  For burglary, larceny, and weapons, thelack of representation had an independent effect on the likelihood ofadjudication after controlling for the other relevant variablesidentified in table III.1.\10 For burglary and weapons, the lack ofrepresentation was associated with lower likelihoods (as comparedwith represented cases), but for larceny it was associated with ahigher likelihood of adjudication.  Specifically, unrepresentedburglars were about one-half as likely to have their casesadjudicated as those represented.  Unrepresented juveniles with casesinvolving weapons were about four-tenths as likely to have theircases adjudicated as those represented.  Conversely, unrepresentedjuveniles with larceny cases were about one and one-half times morelikely to be adjudicated than those represented. For robbery and drug trafficking cases, the lack of representationwas negatively associated with the likelihood of adjudication, butthe effects were too small to be considered meaningful. The lack of representation had some independent effects on thelikelihood of adjudication for some crime types in California. However, the effects operated in opposite directions across crimes,were not widespread across crime types, and generally were smallrelative to the size of the effects of other variables. The influence of the type of representation was also difficult tocharacterize.  In California, most cases were represented by eitherpublic defenders or by court-appointed private representation. Privately paid attorneys represented juveniles in about 3 percent ofthe cases.  Thus, the main comparisons between types ofrepresentation are between public defenders and court-appointedprivate representation.  In general, the effects of these two typesof representation on the likelihood of adjudication were mixed. Juveniles represented by court- appointed private attorneys were morelikely to be adjudicated than those represented by public defenders,for drugs and simple assault, but less likely for rape and aggravatedassault.  Thus, court-appointed private attorneys likely decrease thechances of adjudication in the more serious crimes.  Of course, thisresult may be due in part to the public defender workload and otherfactors. The absence of consistent effects of the lack or type ofrepresentation on the likelihood of adjudication indicates thatvariables other than representation may be more responsible fordetermining judicial decisions than the type of representation.  Infact, this appears to be the case.  We used the models to identifythose variables that had consistently large effects across equations. We found that three variables had large effects on the likelihood ofadjudication across most types of crimes.  These variables werewhether a case was under court supervision (ward probation) at thetime of referral, whether a juvenile was detained prior toadjudication, and the location of the court (i.e., the county inwhich a case was heard).  A fourth variable, the age of the juvenile,also was strongly associated with the likelihood of adjudication, butthe effects of age were not as consistent nor strong as these othervariables. Juveniles "on ward probation"\11 at the time the current offense wascommitted were from 1.6 to 3.1 times more likely to have their casesadjudicated than those not on ward probation for the crimes ofrobbery, aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, larceny,weapons, drug possession, and drug trafficking.  Across crime types,juveniles detained prior to adjudication were from 1.2 to 1.5 timesas likely as those not detained to have their cases adjudicated. Across different locations, the likelihood of adjudication varied. Depending upon the location of the court and the type of crime,juveniles could be more likely to have their cases adjudicated (from1.2 to 3.9 times as likely) or less likely to have them adjudicated(about one-half as likely).  Older juveniles were slightly lesslikely to have their cases adjudicated than younger juveniles. Finally, for some specific crime types, other variables, such as raceand gender, were associated with adjudicatory outcomes.  For example,males referred for aggravated assault were slightly less likely tohave their cases adjudicated than females referred for that crime. In addition, blacks referred for drug possession were less likelythan persons of other races to have their cases adjudicated. --------------------\9 The relatively small number of unrepresented cases constrained ourchoice of model specification to using a dummy variable to indicatethe absence of counsel.  We would have preferred to estimate separateequations for unrepresented and represented cases and compare theparameter estimates across the equations for all variables in themodels.  This latter approach is equivalent to estimating one modelwith a complete set of interactions with the counsel dummy variable. It has the added advantage, however, of not imposing the assumptionof equal variances between the uncounseled and counseled equations,as is implicit in the fully saturated model.  The implications ofconstraining the variances relate mostly to hypothesis tests onindividual variables. \10 The final equations for each crime type contained a differentsubset of the variables listed on table III.1.  The final variablesin the models were determined by the contribution of individualvariables to the overall goodness of fit of the model to the data. The parameter estimates, odds ratios, and variances for variablesused in the 28 adjudication models are available upon request fromus. \11 Ward probation refers to supervision of a juvenile as a "ward ofthe court."         PENNSYLVANIA--------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1.2As was the case in California, most adjudicated cases in Pennsylvaniawere represented.  Of the 8,488 adjudicated cases, only about 3percent were unrepresented.  Thus, while we tested for the effects ofthe lack of representation on adjudication outcomes, unrepresentedcases were rare, and unrepresented adjudicated cases were even rarer. For two of nine crime types in our regressions, the lack ofrepresentation exerted an independent and negative effect on thelikelihood of adjudication.  Burglary and simple assault cases thatwere unrepresented were less likely to be adjudicated than cases inthose crime types that were represented.\12Unrepresented juveniles in burglary cases were about four-tenths aslikely to have their cases adjudicated as those who were represented;unrepresented juveniles in simple assault cases were about half aslikely. There were generally no large differences in the effects of thevarious types of representation on the likelihood of adjudicationacross the crime types.  Thus, type of representation also did nothave consistent effects on adjudicatory outcomes. In Pennsylvania, the variables that were most strongly associatedwith the likelihood of adjudication were whether a consent decree wasordered and whether a case was detained prior to adjudication.  Thetype of offense was strongly associated with the likelihood ofadjudication, but its effects were not consistent across crime types. Consent decrees are used in place of adjudications for certain,relatively less serious cases in Pennsylvania.  Most unrepresentedjuvenile cases for robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny,and simple assault were disposed of by consent decrees.  Juvenilesdetained prior to adjudication increased the likelihood of havingtheir cases adjudicated, relative to juveniles not detained, for allcrimes except weapons.  Juveniles detained were from two to seventimes more likely to have their cases adjudicated than those notdetained. In simple assault and burglary cases--where the gap betweenunrepresented and represented cases persisted--variables other thanthe lack of representation had larger effects on the likelihood ofadjudication than did the lack of representation.  Cases disposed ofby consent decrees; cases in which juveniles have been detained priorto adjudication; and cases where either the location of the court(for simple assault), the gender, and the length of time beforedisposition (for burglary) all produced larger changes in thelikelihood of adjudication than did the lack of representation. In addition, race exerted independent influences on the likelihood ofadjudication in robbery and rape cases and gender exerted independentinfluences on the likelihood of adjudication in burglary, larceny,and drug possession cases.  Black juveniles referred for rape orrobbery were less likely (0.102 and 0.255 times) than other juvenilesto have their cases adjudicated.  Males referred for burglary,larceny, and drug possession were more likely than females (2.63,1.5, and 2.5 times) to have their cases adjudicated. Thus, as in California, variables associated with case processingwere more strongly associated with the likelihood of adjudication inPennsylvania than with the lack of representation for most crimetypes. --------------------\12 Unrepresented juveniles in weapons cases also were less likely tohave their cases adjudicated than those who were represented;however, this finding was based on fewer than 10 cases, 2 of whichwere adjudicated.  In our view, this was too few cases for asubstantive finding.          NEBRASKA--------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1.3Unlike California and Pennsylvania, juveniles in Nebraska had abouthalf (47.1 percent) of their adjudicated cases unrepresented. Further, Nebraska adjudicated about one-ninth as many cases asCalifornia, but Nebraska also had more than twice the number ofunrepresented adjudicated juvenile cases as California.  Similardiscrepancies occurred in comparing Nebraska to Pennsylvania.  Thus,Nebraska's case is very different from the other two states. The results from the regressions show that Nebraska differs fromCalifornia and Pennsylvania.  First, after controlling for juveniles'characteristics, unrepresented juveniles were less likely to beadjudicated only for larceny--a relatively less serious propertyoffense.  In larceny cases, unrepresented juveniles were aboutfour-tenths as likely to have their cases adjudicated as those whowere represented.  For all other crime types, unrepresented andrepresented juveniles were about equal in the probability of havingtheir cases adjudicated, after controlling for juveniles'characteristics. Second, the type of representation was not systematically related tothe likelihood of adjudication across crime types.  Juvenilesrepresented by court-appointed private attorneys were about half aslikely to have their cases adjudicated than those represented bypublic defenders for simple assault and larceny crimes.  Juvenilesrepresented by privately paid attorneys were half as likely to havetheir cases adjudicated in simple assault cases as compared withthose represented by public defenders.  In weapons cases, however,juveniles represented by privately paid attorneys were about 10 timesmore likely to have their cases adjudicated than those represented bypublic defenders.  In general, juveniles represented by publicdefenders were more likely to have their cases adjudicated than thoserepresented by other types of attorneys or those that wereunrepresented (except for weapons cases). Third, measures of the location of the court in which a juvenile'scase was heard had the largest effect on the likelihood ofadjudication across crime types.  The population density of thecounty where the court was located had the strongest association withthe likelihood that a case was adjudicated for the crimes of simpleassault, burglary, larceny, and weapons.  The association wasnegative, that is, as the population density of the county increased,the likelihood of adjudication decreased within crime categories.  Inother words, in less densely populated counties juveniles were morelikely to have their cases adjudicated as delinquent than in moredensely populated counties, controlling for other characteristics. However, burglary and larceny cases heard in metropolitan countieswere more likely to have their cases adjudicated than those heard innonmetropolitan counties.  This apparent contradiction may stem fromthe fact that within metropolitan counties there may be two classesof counties in which the outcomes differ.  For example, in the mostdensely populated metropolitan counties (e.g., those containing thecentral city of the PMSA or MSA), the likelihood of adjudication maybe lowest.  (This accounts for the negative relationship betweenpopulation density and adjudication.) Such a relationship would notinvalidate the fact that, on the whole, juveniles in metropolitancounties are more likely than those in nonmetropolitan counties tohave their cases adjudicated. For aggravated assault and drug cases, the length of time beforedisposition also had a strong association with the likelihood ofadjudication.  For both of these crimes, the longer it took todispose of a case, the less likely it was to be adjudicated. However, in aggravated assault cases, the type of attorney had aneffect.  Cases with no attorneys and those with court-appointedattorneys were less likely to have their cases adjudicated, whereasin drug cases, there were no differences in the relative likelihoodof adjudication across types of attorneys. Other variables having large, positive effects on the likelihood ofadjudication included whether a juvenile was detained (for burglary),prior record (for larceny), and age (for weapons).       PLACEMENT OUTCOMES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.2In analyzing out-of-home placements, we restricted the sample tocases adjudicated as delinquent.  We estimated equations for the samecrime types as in the adjudication analysis.  In general, we foundthat the presence or lack of representation was not associated withthe likelihood of placement for most crime types.  In part, this wasdue to the relatively few cases involving unrepresented juvenilesthat were placed in the states, especially in California andPennsylvania.  For example, in California only 6 of the 2,852 casesadjudicated for aggravated assault in which a juvenile faced aplacement decision were unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, only 61 of1,283 cases adjudicated for burglary in which a juvenile faced aplacement decision were unrepresented.  In general, where there weresufficient cases to produce a robust estimate of the effect ofrepresentation on placement outcomes, we estimated models thatincluded representation variables. There were exceptions to this general finding of no effect of thepresence or lack of representation on the likelihood of placement. Specifically, in California, unrepresented juveniles were three tofive times more likely to be placed, in larceny and drug traffickingcases, than were represented juveniles.  In Pennsylvania,unrepresented juveniles were two and one half to three times lesslikely to be placed than those who were represented in burglary andsimple assault cases.  In Nebraska, unrepresented juveniles were halfas likely to be placed in burglary cases and about two-fifths inlarceny and one-tenth as likely to be placed in drug cases than wererepresented juveniles. The influence of the type of attorney on the likelihood of placementvaried across the states.  In California for all crimes exceptmurder, juveniles represented by court-appointed private attorneyswere more likely to be placed than those represented by privateattorneys or by public defenders.  Juveniles represented by privatelypaid attorneys were less likely to be placed than those representedby public defenders in robbery, larceny, weapons, and drug possessionand trafficking cases. In Pennsylvania, for all crimes except robbery, simple assault, anddrug trafficking, juveniles represented by private representationwere from slightly more than one to six times more likely to beplaced (depending upon the crime type) than those represented bypublic defenders.  In addition, juveniles represented bycourt-appointed private attorneys were one and one half to two andone half times more likely to be placed than those represented bypublic defenders in burglary, larceny, and simple assault cases. In Nebraska, juveniles represented by privately paid attorneys tendedto have lower chances of receiving placements than those representedby public defenders for burglary, larceny, and drug cases. A few variables tended to have relatively consistent effects on thelikelihood of placement.  These included whether a juvenile wasdetained prior to adjudication, whether charges were changed betweenthe time of referral and disposition, offense history and courtsupervisory status, and the location of the courts. In California, for example, for the violent crimes of murder, rape,robbery, and aggravated assault, the likelihood of receivingout-of-home placement was highest for juveniles detained prior toadjudication, as opposed to those not detained.  These juveniles werefrom 3.1 to 10.5 times as likely to be placed out-of-home.  Thelikelihood was lowest for juveniles whose charges were changedbetween referral and disposition.\13In such cases, these juveniles were 0.08 to 0.38 times less likely tobe placed than those whose referral charges were not changed. For the less serious violent crime of simple assault, for propertycrimes, such as burglary and larceny, and for weapons and drugpossession the odds of receiving out-of-home placements were highestfor juveniles on ward probation at the time the referral offense wascommitted and for juveniles detained prior to adjudication. Juveniles on ward probation were from 4.1 to 5.8 times more likely tobe placed as compared with those not on ward probation.  Juvenilesdetained were from 2.4 to 3.2 times as likely to be placed ascompared with juveniles who had not been detained. In Pennsylvania, across all crime types except rape, detention, priordispositions, and population density were consistently among thevariables most likely to influence the likelihood of a juvenilereceiving out-of-home placement.  Juveniles detained, for example,were from 2.6 to almost 10 times more likely to be placed; juvenileswith priors also were from about 3 to more than 10 times more likelyto be placed than juveniles without priors.  As the populationdensity of the county in which the juvenile's case was handledincreased, juveniles tended to be less likely to be placed and moredensely populated counties within metropolitan areas--such as thecounty containing the central city of the metropolitan area--weregenerally less likely to use out-of-home placements than the othermetropolitan counties. In Nebraska, across all crime types, prior record, detention prior toadjudication, location of the court, and the population density ofthe county where the court was located were the variables having thelargest impacts on the likelihood of placement.  Juveniles withpriors were from 2 to 6 times more likely to be placed than thosewithout priors, depending on the type of crime, and juvenilesdetained prior to adjudication were generally from 5 to 10 times morelikely to be placed than those not detained. In addition in Nebraska, the effects of the location of the courtinfluenced the likelihood of receiving an out-of-home placement foraggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, and larceny.  Innonmetropolitan counties, juveniles who committed these crimes wereless likely to be placed, reflecting, perhaps, the relative scarcityof placement options.  In addition, as the population density of thecounty where the court was located increased, juveniles were morelikely to be placed.  This is consistent with the view that there maybe more placement options in urban areas and that the availability ofthese options influences the likelihood of placement. Finally, a few other variables had noticeable impacts on thelikelihood of placement in some cases.  For example, in Pennsylvania,race influenced the likelihood of receiving an out-of-home placementfor rape.  Blacks were 0.044 times less likely than whites and othersto be placed for rape.  Changes (reductions) in charges reduced thelikelihood of placement for rape, robbery and aggravated assaultoffenses, but changes in charges had no effect on the likelihood ofplacement for property, weapons, or drug offenses.  In California,race and gender affected outcomes for some crime types. Specifically, for drug possession and drug trafficking, blacks were2.1 and 1.5 times as likely as other persons to be placed.  For drugpossession, males were 2.5 times as likely as females to be placed. --------------------\13 In almost all cases, charges were reduced between referral anddisposition.

One approach for dealing with at-riskyouth--residential care--removes them from where they normally live andplaces them in settings ranging from tents in the woods to suburbanhomes, where they are taught skills and prepared to return to theircommunities and become contributing members of society.   GAO found thatalthough few rigorous evaluations of residential programs have beendone, the studies issued so far suggest that residential care cansuccessfully treat some high-risk youths.  Thorough evaluations areneeded to determine which treatments are most effective and what thelong-term effects of the treatment are for youths so that policymakerscan make sound decisions on the most effective mix of programs and thebest role for residential care.  Program officials and other expertsagree that some key elements enhance the programs' ability to alterhigh-risk behavior, such as close ties with the youths' families andcontinuing support after the youths have left the residential settingand returned to their neighborhoods.--------------------------- Indexing Terms ----------------------------- REPORTNUM:  HEHS-94-56     TITLE:  Residential Care: Some High-Risk Youth Benefit, But More              Study Needed      DATE:  01/28/94   SUBJECT:  State-administered programs             Disadvantaged persons             Public assistance programs             Local governments             Minors             Program evaluation             Juvenile offender rehabilitation             Juvenile correctional facilities             Juvenile delinquency             Rehabilitation programsIDENTIFIER:  Starr Commonwealth, Cedar Village Program (Albion, MI)             Boys Town Home Campus Program (Boys Town, NE)             Paint Creek Youth Center Program (Bainbridge, OH)             Piney Woods Country Life School Program (Piney Woods, MS)             Hyde School Program (Bath, ME)             Oasis Center Program (Nashville, TN)             Salesmanship Club Youth Camp Program (Hawkins, TX)             Harbor Schools and Family Services, Haverhill Program              (Haverhill, MA)             Boysville Program (Clinton, MI)             Children's Village Program (Dobbs Ferry, NY)             Bridge Over Troubled Waters Transitional Living Program              (Boston, MA)             *************************************************************************** This file contains an ASCII representation of the text of a GAO        ** report.

LevinChairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government ManagementCommittee on Governmental AffairsUnited States SenateDear Mr.  Chairman: The nation faces daunting challenges in deciding how best to approachthe problem of youth whose behavior places them at risk of notbecoming self-sufficient members of society.  One study has estimatedthat more than 10 percent of the nation's youth aged 10 to 17 engagein three or more of the four behaviors most commonly associated withthis risk:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,and early unprotected sexual activity.\1One approach for dealing with at-risk youth--residentialcare--removes youths from where they normally live and places them insettings ranging from tents in the wilderness to family-likeresidences in the suburbs.  In these settings, youths are taughtskills and provided treatment designed to prepare them to return totheir communities and become contributing members of society. Because the Subcommittee is interested in the role of the federalgovernment in providing education, health, and social services tochildren living in precarious environments, you asked us to studyresidential programs that provide comprehensive long-term help foryouths who are exhibiting multiple high-risk behaviors.  Our studyobjectives were to determine  what is known about the effectiveness of such programs in preparing     youths to lead self-sufficient, productive lives and  what can be learned about key program characteristics important for     mitigating risky behaviors of young people. --------------------\1 Joy G.  Dryfoos, Adolescents at Risk:  Prevalence and Prevention(New York:  Oxford University Press, 1990).    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1Studies indicate that the consequences associated with high-riskbehaviors are costly not only in terms of individual suffering anddiminished quality of life, but also in terms of long-term socialcosts and lost productivity.  Some examples follow:   On average, each male who drops out of high school will earn     $260,000 less and pay $78,000 less in taxes during his lifetime     than those who graduate from high school.  Similar estimates for     a female dropout were $200,000 and $60,000, respectively.   Over 500,000 youths entered detention centers in 1988, and the     average cost to hold one youth in custody for a year was nearly     $30,000.   Early unprotected sexual activity costs taxpayers an estimated $19     billion annually for income support, health care, and nutrition     for families begun by adolescents.  It also increases the     incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, including acquired     immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Experts recognize that problems of youths who exhibit multiplehigh-risk behaviors are best addressed simultaneously and intensivelyover an extended period, in part because problem behaviors are ofteninterrelated.  For example, some high-risk youths experience problemsin school, become abusers of drugs and alcohol, and become involvedin delinquent activity. One way to serve high-risk youth is through comprehensive, long-termresidential programs that remove young people from their homes,generally for 6 to 18 months.  The programs provide education,health, and social services to address the youths' multiple problemsin-house or through arrangements with local providers.  Other ways ofaddressing youths' problems include nonresidential community-basedprograms that serve youths at home or at school or other communitylocations. The severity of problem behaviors exhibited by youths served inresidential programs varies considerably.  Some youths engage inhigh-risk activities, such as drug peddling or prostitution, orsuffer from severe psychological and social problems.  They may bereferred to residential programs by juvenile justice, child welfare,or mental health organizations.  Other youths are truant from schoolor run away from home.  Some who live in crime-ridden neighborhoodsor who come from hostile families need protection.  Parents or socialagencies may refer these youths to residential care programs,including boarding schools, which provide an opportunity for theyouths to be educated and receive guidance in a safe and stableenvironment. Many youths in these programs come from low-income homes in troubledneighborhoods.  Many have been victims of physical and sexual abuseand have had a number of prior placements such as foster care orcorrectional facilities.    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2To examine what is known about the effectiveness of residential careprograms, we searched the literature and contacted experts on theneeds of at-risk adolescents to identify recent studies of programeffectiveness.  We obtained and reviewed relevant studies.  Becausenational associations and agencies we contacted could not providecomprehensive listings of long-term residential programs for youthsaged 10 to 17, we relied on program officials and other experts inthe field to suggest individual programs that, in their opinion, werenotable or had some documented measures of effectiveness. In all, we judgmentally selected and contacted 29 residentialprograms which, based on information we had at the time, were likelyto meet the following criteria:  served youths aged 10 to 17;provided long-term, comprehensive services that addressed each of thefour problem behaviors of poor performance in school, substanceabuse, delinquency, and early unprotected sexual activity; and hadrecent outcome data on program effectiveness. After contacting the 29 programs, we found that 17 met our criteriaand included them in our review.  We also included another program,the Piney Woods Country Life School, a boarding school that servesyouth who are not currently exhibiting the four problem behaviors,but who come primarily from dangerous urban neighborhoods where theymay be at increased risk of adopting the behaviors.  Appendix IIIlists the names and addresses of these 18 programs. We visited 9 of the 18 programs--selected to illustrate a variety ofpopulations (ranging from youths with relatively minor problems tothose convicted of felonies) and locations (urban, suburban, andrural).  We conducted telephone interviews with officials of the nineprograms we did not visit to obtain comparable information aboutprogram orientation and outcomes, participant profiles, and funding. We used the views of program officials and other experts we contactedand the literature to develop a list of program characteristics thatappeared to be key to program success.  We then asked officials fromthe 18 programs to assess the importance of these key characteristicsto their programs' success. We conducted our work between August 1992 and November 1993 inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendixes I and II contain descriptions of each program included inour study and results of evaluations and outcome measurements.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3Residential care appears to be a viable treatment option for somehigh-risk youths.  Each of the 18 programs we contacted reportedbenefits for some youths in such areas as maintaining attendance inschool and avoiding drug abuse and criminal behavior.  However,programs seldom conduct controlled or comparison studies to determinehow outcomes are linked to their treatment efforts, and few programshave conducted studies to show what happened to participants morethan 12 months after they left the programs. Not enough is known about residential care programs to provide aclear picture of which kinds of treatment approaches work best orabout the effectiveness of the treatment over the long term. Further, no consensus exists on which youths are best served byresidential care rather than community-based care or how residentialcare should be combined with community-based care to best serveat-risk youths over time.  Many program officials and other expertswe spoke with said that further research is needed into theeffectiveness of residential care and other treatment approaches. This could be an appropriate role for the federal government. The programs we reviewed differed greatly from one another in suchrespects as size, setting, and treatment approach.  Despite thesedifferences, program officials considered certain characteristics tobe key for success.  These 11 characteristics (see pp.  16-21)included involving a parent or other concerned adult in the client'scare, placing a strong emphasis on building self-esteem, and planningfor the youth's return to the community after completing the program. One of the characteristics that seemed to be particularly importantwas an effective link with community-based services that continue tosupport high-risk youths and their families after the youths leaveresidential care.    RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS PROVIDE   BENEFITS, BUT MORE INFORMATION   ON THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS   NEEDED------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4All programs we contacted reported positive outcomes for some youths,such as achieving certain educational or employment goals or avoidingillegal activity after completing the program.  However, few programsconducted rigorous evaluations to measure effectiveness or long-termoutcomes. Program reports ranged from a one-time collection of data to arigorous study using a control group.  Programs we reviewed typicallyreported outcome data on participants for periods of 12 months orless after discharge.  None of the studies we reviewed referred toany specific criteria that could be used to evaluate the resultsreported. The following examples depict the results reported at 12 months afterdischarge:   Of 27 participants in the Eckerd Family Youth Alternatives, Inc.,     Wilderness Educational System, Camp E-How-Kee (Brooksville,     Florida), who were discharged in the 1991-92 year and for whom     data were available, 18 (67 percent) had neither dropped out of     school nor been truant.   Of 113 youths released from Boysville of Michigan, Clinton Campus,     in 1991, 17 (15 percent) were employed full- or part-time, 64     (57 percent) were unemployed, and the employment status of 32     (28 percent) was unknown.   Of the 52 participants who successfully completed the Starr     Commonwealth, Cedar Village program (Albion, Michigan) in 1991,     40 (77 percent) had no record of subsequent arrests.  Twelve (23     percent) were rearrested, and 8 (15 percent) of them were     convicted.   Of the 30 participants from the KidsPeace National Centers for Kids     in Crisis, Presidential Treatment Center (Bethlehem,     Pennsylvania) contacted 12 to 24 months after their discharge in     1990, 23 (77 percent) were in school or had earned a general     educational development (GED) certificate. Studies of 14 of 18 programs we contacted did not use control orcomparison groups.  We could therefore not determine whether theoutcomes reported were due to the programs' treatments or to otherfactors.  However, one program we visited--Father Flanagan's Boys'Home, Boys Town Home Campus near Omaha, Nebraska--had conducted twolongitudinal studies using a comparison group, and another--New LifeYouth Services, Paint Creek Youth Center in Bainbridge, Ohio--hadconducted a study using a control group. Boys Town Home Campus, in two separate studies, compared outcomes forits youths to outcomes for another group of youths who were referredto the program during the same period, and met eligibility oradmission requirements, but did not attend.  One study, which lookedat educational attainment and occupational status, found Boys Townparticipants outperforming the comparison group on most measures. For example, 83 percent of participants had graduated from highschool or obtained a GED, compared to 69 percent of the comparisongroup.  The other study, which looked at relations with friends,family, and supervising adults, found significantly more improvementover time among Boys Town participants than among the comparisongroup. Paint Creek Youth Center randomly assigned youths to control andtreatment groups to evaluate its effectiveness as an alternative to astate correctional facility.  The incarceration rate for Paint Creekparticipants 1 year after discharge was 23 percent compared to thecontrol group's 29 percent.  This difference was not statisticallysignificant.  However, study investigators commented that, despitethe lack of a statistically significant difference, the Paint Creekstudy should lend support to the argument that such programs can berun as cost effectively as training schools and without undue risk tothe public. Information is also limited in two other important areas:  treatmenteffects over the long term and the place of residential care in thecontinuum of treatment. Longer term data are needed to test the endurance of treatmenteffects.  Our review of the literature identified a number of studiesthat found that some youth leaving residential facilities have adifficult time maintaining treatment gains.  Five programs wecontacted studied program effects longer than 12 months afterdischarge.  One of them--Boysville--found that, for the 317 youthsdischarged in 1987 from its residential programs, the cumulativereimprisonment rate rose from 9 percent in the first year followingdischarge to 15 percent in the second year and to 20 percent (a totalof 62 youths) in the third year. Information is also limited on the appropriate place of residentialcare in the service continuum--that is, which at-risk youth are bestserved by residential care rather than community-based care and howresidential care should be combined with community-based care to bestserve at-risk youth over time.  Boysville has been examining therelative roles of its residential care and community-based programsin serving at-risk youth and their families and has concluded thatchanges should be made in its residential care approach.  Programofficials reported that while they had always believed their programto be superior, it did not fully meet their high expectations. Therefore, they concluded that a radically different approach toserving clients was needed.  As a result, Boysville officials areplanning to restructure their program by shortening the time youthspend in residential care and placing increased emphasis oncommunity-based care. Program officials and other experts stated that rigorous studies oflong-term program effectiveness using control or comparison groupsare difficult to conduct.  Specifically, program officials cited thefollowing barriers to conducting such studies:   difficulty tracking youth after they leave the program,  high cost, and  reservations about the ethics of withholding treatment from a     control group. Without such evaluations, however, program officials have limiteddata to show the specific effects their treatment has had on thelives of the clients they have served, and policymakers lackinformation on whether programs have been a worthwhile social andeconomic investment.  Officials from 14 of the 18 programs wereviewed said studies are needed that (1) are longitudinal and usecontrol groups, (2) identify youth who would be best served byresidential treatment, and (3) determine whether some youth could besuccessfully treated in less costly, less restrictive nonresidentialsettings.  Further, some experts suggested that an appropriatefederal role might include supporting effectiveness studies ofresidential care and other treatment approaches. Experts and program officials cited both advantages and disadvantagesto residential care.  On the positive side, experts with whom wespoke and the literature we reviewed indicated that residential careis suited for addressing the needs of some at-risk adolescentsbecause  providing comprehensive services, around-the-clock contact with     clients, and services focused on individual needs can provide an     effective treatment environment;  removing clients from dangerous home and community influences can     provide a safe setting for addressing their problem behaviors;     and  establishing a routine and discipline can bring order to what may     have been fairly chaotic lives. On the other hand, our review of the literature suggests thatresidential care  is a restrictive form of care;  can disrupt youths' attachments because it removes them from family     and community, which is the setting to which treatment gains     will have to transfer if positive outcomes are to be sustained     after discharge; and  is costly.  For example, 10 of the 18 residential programs we     contacted cost over $40,000 per youth for a year of treatment.      However, not enough is known about the long-term effectiveness     of residential care, or where it best fits in the continuum of     services, to determine under what circumstances it may be cost     effective compared with other types of care such as     community-based treatment.    PROGRAMS VARY IN APPROACH BUT   SHARE KEY CHARACTERISTICS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5The programs we contacted varied considerably in setting and size,the types of troubled youth they serve, their treatment approach,cost, and funding sources.  Program types ranged from a small urbanprogram that served 8 homeless adolescent girls who had been activelyengaged in prostitution or at risk of doing so, to a large suburbanprogram on a 1,400-acre campus serving 560 young men and women with avariety of problems.  Average length of treatment ranged from 6months to 2 years, with a median stay of 12 months.  Table 1summarizes selected aspects of the programs we visited, and table 2shows these aspects for the programs we contacted by telephone. The programs served youth with a wide variety of problems, rangingfrom felony offenses, such as aggravated assault or burglary, totruancy and defiance of parental authority.  One program wevisited--Piney Woods Country Life School near Jackson,Mississippi--primarily served youth who were not exhibiting specificproblem behaviors but, in many cases, came from dangerous urbanneighborhoods.  Two other programs, The Hyde School in Bath, Maine,and Oasis Center, Michael's Kids House in Nashville, Tennessee, didnot keep records of problem behaviors exhibited by their studentsbefore they came to the program.  With the exception of these threeprograms, officials at all others reported that some youth in theirprograms exhibited all four risky behaviors--poor performance inschool, delinquency, substance abuse, and early unprotected sexualactivity.  Further, as indicated in figure 1, 10 of the programsestimated that 50 percent or more of program youths exhibited allfour behaviors.

Costs vary across programs and are notstrictly comparable.  All programs provide services that target eachof the four risky behaviors.

Percentages are based on program officials' estimates. \b Annual treatment costs are computed by dividing total programbudget by average population.  Costs vary across programs and are notstrictly comparable.  All programs provide services that target eachof the four risky behaviors.  However, some programs collaborate withexisting community providers to provide such services as schooling atno cost to the program, while other programs employ their ownteachers to educate clients.  Other variations may reflectdifferences in the education level and intensity of staffing, type offacility, or other factors.    Figure 1:  Youths Who Exhibit   All Four Risky Behaviors   Constitute Differing   Percentages of Program   Populations   (See figure in printed   edition.)Notes:Programs are listed by increasing percentage of youths (left toright) who exhibited the following four risky behaviors:  (1) poorperformance in school, (2) delinquency, (3) substance abuse, and (4)early, unprotected sexual activity.Two of the eighteen programs were unable to provide data on problembehavior. The annual cost of serving one youth ranged from about $20,000 toabout $132,000, with a median cost of about $44,000.  The most costlyprograms did not necessarily serve youth with the highest percentageof risky behaviors.  (See fig.  2.)   Figure 2:  Annual Treatment   Costs Do Not Appear to Be   Linked to the Percentage of   Youths With Four Risky   Behaviors   (See figure in printed   edition.)Notes:Programs are listed by increasing percentage (left to right) of youthwho exhibited all four risky behaviors.Annual treatment costs are computed by dividing total program budgetby average population.Two programs could not provide data on the percentage of youth withall four risky behaviors.  The annual cost per youth at theseprograms are (1) Hyde School, $20,073 and (2) Oasis Center, Michael'sKids House, $24,321. While most programs depended largely on public funding, fundingsources varied considerably.  Fourteen of the 18 programs in ourstudy received over half of their funding from public sources, and 10received 90 percent or more.  While most public funds were from stategovernments, some of this money included federal funds for fostercare and other purposes that were passed on to the programs by thestates.  Few program officials we interviewed could provide us withcomplete information about the portion of public funds for theirprograms that originated at the federal level. Although programs we studied varied with respect to the severity ofthe participants' problems, we found several similarities amongparticipants' backgrounds.  Twelve of the programs reported that mostyouth were from low-income families; seven said most of theirparticipants came from dangerous or crime-ridden neighborhoods. Reported rates of sexual abuse among youths at 15 of the programswere high, ranging from 30 to 100 percent of the girls and 20 to 70percent of the boys.  Eleven programs said at least 80 percent oftheir youth had previous out-of-home placements, including fostercare, psychiatric hospitals, group homes, and jails. Amid the considerable variety of program approaches, programofficials and other experts said that certain key elements wereimportant for success.  Descriptions of these 11 key elements follow.       DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL      TREATMENT PLANS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1According to program officials, nearly all programs in our studydeveloped individual treatment plans for each youth.  Plans, in somecases, are updated at specific intervals, such as monthly.  Often theyouth participate in the planning process by identifying issues theyneed to address and in setting goals.  At Starr Commonwealth, CedarVillage, each youth's plan is discussed in monthly peer groupmeetings.  One program official from Boysville noted that if youthscan see their own treatment gains, they will begin to see themselvesas successful.       PARTICIPATION OF A CARING      ADULT---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2Important in many youths' successful experiences in such programs,officials said, was the presence of a caring adult, such as acounselor or other staff member.  For example, a Boys Town officialtold us that his program asserts that all behavioral change can onlytake place in the context of a caring relationship--youth will listenand learn only from adults they believe care about them.  A StarrCommonwealth official said his program's expectation is that thetrust developed in an adult will extend to other adults after youthsleave the program.  At Boys Town Home Campus and the SalesmanshipClub Youth Camp, staff live with the youths around the clock, 7 daysa week, and are involved in virtually all of the youths' activities.       SELF-ESTEEM BUILDING---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3According to officials from most programs, it is important for theprograms to provide opportunities to build self-esteem so that youthscan develop a sense of success; two officials told us that the youthsin the programs are accustomed to failure.  Programs buildself-esteem through such activities as sporting events, physicaleducation, and academics and by teaching practical skills such asplanning and budgeting for household expenditures.       PLANNING FOR POST-PROGRAM      LIFE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.4Planning for transition from the program may begin as soon as youthsenter the program.  An official from Harbor Schools and FamilyServices, Haverhill Program (Haverhill, Massachusetts) said programofficials begin to talk with youths about discharge and arrangingplacement even before admission.  After leaving residential programs,youths are discharged to such settings as their biological families,foster care, or independent living.  To prepare for the transition,some programs connect the youths to services in their community andwork with the family to strengthen relationships and resolve problemssuch as substance abuse.  During their stay, youths are providedassistance with career planning, vocational education, and finding asuitable place to live.       TEACHING SOCIAL, COPING, AND      LIVING SKILLS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.5One of the most important purposes of residential care is to prepareyouths to function in the everyday world.  To this end, youths aretaught skills such as establishing good work habits, handlingconfrontations, and planning and preparing nutritious meals.  Someyouths have never learned how to hold a meaningful conversationaround the dinner table or have never been required to keep theirrooms tidy.  Programs use group activities as well as individualinstruction to develop and enhance these skills.  In some programs,special events are used to teach practical lessons and skills. Youths at the Salesmanship Club Youth Camp, for example, plan andwork together as a group to organize and carry out week-long campingtrips.  Youths at Boys Town Home Campus share a daily family-styledinner, which they help to prepare, with their house mates and familyteachers (surrogate parent figures who live with the youth on a24-hour basis).       COORDINATION OF SERVICES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.6Program officials viewed coordination of services as important,whether the services were provided by a single caseworker or a team. At Boysville, Clinton Campus, teams of directors, specialists,educational coordinators, and others who work with the families trackthe academic, social, and family progress of each youth under theircare and collaborate in carrying out treatment goals.  At Boys TownHome Campus, the family teachers coordinate all services provided tothe youths entrusted to their care.       INVOLVING THE FAMILY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.7Programs acknowledge that youths' problem behaviors are often relatedto family problems and dysfunction.  Several programs we contactedinvolve families as part of the formal treatment approach, and threeprograms require such participation.  The Hyde School requiresparents to agree to attend certain activities before the schoolagrees to admit students.  Parents are required to participate threetimes a year with their children at the school in several days ofgroup discussions and physical challenges, including rigorous outdooractivities.  The Salesmanship Club Youth Camp requires the parents toparticipate in therapy during their child's stay in camp andencourages the parents to continue therapy for 6 months after theirchild's release. Programs that involved the family typically had social workers andtherapists work with parents individually, in parent support groups,and with parents and children together.  Some programs providedcounseling for parents as well as treatment for problems such assubstance abuse.  While nearly all programs we contacted consideredfamily involvement to be desirable, some said it was not alwaysfeasible.  The program may be too far from a parent's residence or afamily may be unwilling to participate.       POSITIVE PEER CULTURE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.8Peer influence is used to effect healthy behavior changes in youths. For example, three programs that serve mostly youths who areconvicted felons use participants' influence on each other to fosterinsight and growth.  At all three programs, youths are assigned topeer groups and conduct nearly all their activities in these groups. Staff work with the peer groups to foster desirable values andbehavior patterns.  At Starr Commonwealth, Cedar Village, andBoysville, Clinton Campus, for example, daily group meetings focus ona particular experience or problem surfaced by one of the youths frompersonal experience.  Youths also initiate impromptu meetings to callone another to task for negative behaviors.       ENFORCING A STRICT CODE OF      DISCIPLINE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.9Officials from several programs believed a strict code of disciplinefor residents was of great importance.  At The Hyde School, forexample, accountability is the fundamental structure on which theschool's discipline system is built.  Students encourage each otherto report violations of school rules.  If a student knows, but doesnot report, that another student has disobeyed Hyde rules, bothstudents are considered equal offenders and subject to discipline.       POST-PROGRAM SUPPORT--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.10Twelve of the programs we contacted continue services, such ascounseling and school placement for the youths and family counseling,after the youths are discharged from residential care.  Of thoseprograms that do not directly provide aftercare, four told us thatthey link the youths and their families with such services in thecommunity. A number of research efforts have suggested that a youth'senvironment after discharge is crucial to sustaining the effects ofresidential treatment.  For example, a 1966 study of a group of 50boys who were discharged from the Bellefaire Jewish Children'sBureau's residential program in Ohio found that successful outcomeswere directly related to the quality of the family environment towhich youths returned after discharge.\2 A 1991 study of youthsdischarged from the same residential setting in the mid-1980sconfirmed the importance of post-program support.\3One program we contacted--The Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry, NewYork--conducted a study of aftercare.  This study, now in its ninthyear, is demonstrating the effectiveness of intensive aftercareprovided to a sample of youths (all males, mostly aged 13 when theyentered the program) discharged from the residential program.  Theaftercare included counseling to help participants complete school,secure employment, and adjust in the community.  The program alsoencouraged participants to save money by offering to match what theyhad saved.  The comparison group consisted of youths from TheChildren's Village whose aftercare was limited to such contact asbimonthly mailings on job training and education and verbalencouragement.  Among the findings from the first 6 years of thisstudy was a 12-percent school dropout rate among the group receivingintensive aftercare versus a 29-percent rate for the comparisongroup. --------------------\2 M.E.

Hobfall, "Factors Associated With YouthDischarged From Residential Treatment," 1991, Children and YouthServices Review, 13, 199-216.       PROVIDING A FAMILY-LIKE      ATMOSPHERE--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.11According to program officials, because many at-risk youths have nothad the opportunity to grow up in constructive family environments,several of the programs help youths develop skills and relationshipsin a healthy family-like setting.  Use of this approach wasparticularly important at Boys Town Home Campus, where the treatmentapproach centers around a teaching family headed by a married couplethat acts as surrogate parents.  Teaching parents participate in suchactivities as shopping with the youths, taking them to medicalappointments, attending school functions, and helping them with theirhomework.  The youths have household responsibilities such ascleaning their rooms and planning and cooking daily meals.  Similarto Boys Town, the Bridge Over Troubled Waters Transitional LivingProgram in Boston, Massachusetts, operates its program much as ahousehold would operate, with participants scheduled to shop, cook,and do other chores on a rotating basis. Figure 3 shows the number of program officials citing each keyelement as important to their programs' success.  Although 12programs provide post-program support and considered it to be ofgreat or moderate importance to their success, four others consideredit important but were unable to provide it.    Figure 3:  Program Elements   That Officials Consider   Important to Success   (See figure in printed   edition.)   CONCLUSIONS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6While few rigorous evaluations of residential programs have beendone, the outcome studies conducted to date suggest that residentialcare can be successful as a treatment approach for some high-riskyouths.  However, limited information is available to drawconclusions about how residential care can be best applied in thecontinuum of services for high-risk youths and their families. Additional study is needed to answer such questions as which youthare best treated in residential settings and which would be bettertreated in less restrictive and less costly community-based programs. In particular, rigorous evaluations are needed to determine whichtreatment approaches are most effective and what the long-termeffects of the treatment are for youths--in residential and otherprograms--so policymakers can make sound decisions about the mosteffective mix of programs and the best role for residential care. Although conclusions cannot be drawn about the success of residentialprograms, there appears to be some consensus among program officialsand other experts that certain key elements enhance the programs'ability to alter high-risk behavior.  Program officials agree thatany effective residential program for high-risk youths should includesuch elements as a close alliance with the youths' families wheneverpossible as well as continuing support after the youths have left theresidential setting and returned to their community. The scarcity of rigorous outcome studies limits the ability ofpolicymakers to determine whether support for residential programsconstitutes the best use of limited public resources.  Conductingrigorous program evaluation is expensive and complicated.  However,without such research, questions will remain about what the mostcost-effective approaches are for treating at-risk youths.    MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE   CONGRESS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7If the Congress decides that the federal government should reexamineits financial support for programs serving at-risk youth, it shouldconsider earmarking funds for rigorous evaluations of residentialcare and other treatment approaches for this population to determine  what kinds of programs work best for which youths and  the appropriate place of residential treatment on the service     continuum. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health andHuman Services, the Attorney General, appropriate congressionalcommittees, and other interested parties.  Please call me on (202)512-7119 if you or your staff have any questions.  Other majorcontributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. Sincerely yours,Mark V.  NadelAssociate Director, National and Public Health IssuesPROGRAMS GAO VISITED=========================================================== Appendix IThe following descriptions of nine programs we visited contain dataobtained from interviews with program officials and written materialthey provided.  We did not verify the data--including program costsand the effectiveness studies and reports.  The methodologies used tomeasure program outcomes and the factors they measured varied,thereby preventing comparison among programs.  Programs are listed inalphabetical order.    BOYSVILLE OF MICHIGAN, CLINTON   CAMPUS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1The program seeks to meet the social, educational, economic, andspiritual needs of its clients and staff through such means asproviding a community-oriented living and working environment andmaintaining group programs that incorporate peer influence,individual attention, family involvement, and staff teamwork in anopen setting.  Boysville expects its youth to become more responsibleand to learn to appreciate their own and others' personal worth.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.1The Clinton Campus in Clinton, Michigan, one of Boysville ofMichigan's 13 residential programs, covers 400 acres of mostly cropland, of which 60 acres are reserved for the treatment program.  Thecampus includes dormitories, school and recreational facilities, acentral cafeteria, and administrative offices. Boysville of Michigan, Inc., headquartered on the Clinton campus, isa private, nonprofit child and family service agency serving about900 clients a year in Michigan and Ohio through its residential,community, and home-based programs.          NUMBER OF YOUTH SERVED IN         1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.2The maximum capacity of the program was 125; the average populationat a given time was 121.  The total population served was notprovided.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.3The program serves boys aged 12 and older, 60 percent of whom comefrom the Detroit area.  About half are adjudicated delinquents whowould otherwise serve their sentences in the state's training school;the other half are wards of the state Department of Social Servicesand referred because of delinquent conduct.  Clinton accepts the moresevere delinquency cases--referred boys have committed crimes againstproperty or persons, drug-related offenses, or sexual offenses. However, Clinton does not accept boys who are psychotic, who do nothave the mental capacity to participate in the education program, orwho have a history of unprovoked assaults. Of the 1992 participants, about two-thirds were African-American andone-fourth white.  Nearly all of the 1992 participants had at leastone previous placement and 73 percent had single parents.  Based ondisclosures during counseling sessions, staff estimate that 70 to 100percent of the boys had been sexually abused.  About 70 percent ofthe youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poorperformance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.4The average length of stay was 1 year; stays ranged from 8 to 16months.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $46,508; for an average stay of1 year, the cost was $46,508.          FUNDING SOURCES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.6The following funding sources are for all of Boysville of Michigan,Inc., including the Clinton Campus.

The sessionsare facilitated by a treatment coordinator.  The sessions begin witheach member in turn stating an issue, such as anger management orvictimization, that he's working on at the time.  The group thendecides to focus the meeting on one member, who receives help to talkthrough and think about his issue and is offered advice whenpossible.  At the end of the meeting, the treatment coordinatorsummarizes the discussion and comments on the group dynamics. In addition, if at any time a group member feels that someone in thegroup is acting inappropriately, he can call a "circle," meaning thegroup members circle around and talk through the issue. The treatment coordinator is a member of an interdisciplinarytreatment team responsible for formulating and implementing eachboy's treatment goals and tracking progress.  Family therapy is a keycomponent of treatment--staff try to involve the family in counselingsessions, which may continue for up to 6 months after discharge. Throughout the program, Clinton staff emphasize four basic values--tohelp, respect, trust in, and take responsibility for self and others. As boys learn to control their behavior and demonstrate they arelearning the basic values, they are moved along a three-step systemleading to their release.  Boys move from the first step, where theyare expected to need much guidance from their peers and staff, to thelast, where they are expected to do the right thing for the rightreason without relying on rules, staff direction, or peer opinions.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.8Routinely collected data.  At 3 and 12 months after departure,Boysville staff conduct telephone surveys of youths and theirfamilies.  A comparison of some 3- and 12-month outcomes for the 113youths released from the Clinton Campus in 1991 follows:   59 percent were in a setting less restrictive than the Clinton     Campus at 3 months after discharge; at 12 months, that figure     was 52 percent.  However, the drop mainly reflects an increase     in the "unknown" category.   The number of boys who were enrolled in school decreased from 53     percent 3 months after discharge to 46 percent at 12 months     after discharge.  The decline is due to those who had dropped     out of school and had not obtained a high school diploma or a     general educational development certificate. Special studies.  No special studies have been conducted specificallyof the Clinton campus.  However, Boysville has done several studiesof its programs' performance in general.  In one study, Boysvilleanalyzed the imprisonment rates of youth released from its grouphomes and campus-based residential facilities in 1985 and 1987. Twenty-five percent of those who were tracked for 5 years (1985cohort) and 20 percent of those who were tracked for 3 years (1987cohort) were imprisoned in Michigan.  The type of treatment received(campus-based residential treatment or community-based group home)and the legal status (child welfare case or delinquency case) werefound to be unrelated to imprisonment rates, but two other factorswere found to be significant:  boys released to their homes,relatives' homes, or independent living situations were less likelyto be imprisoned, and nonwhite boys who had multiple convictionsbefore coming to Boysville were more likely to be imprisoned. Boysville also analyzed 1982-89 outcome data for its Michiganresidential programs.  Analysts found declines in the percentage ofboys successfully released who were still maintaining a lessrestrictive living situation 12 months after release.  Successfulcompletion means a boy has met all or nearly all of his treatmentgoals such as improving academic skills or developing appropriate andproductive relationships.  Of the successful releases in 1982, 68percent were in a less restrictive setting 12 months after release. Of the successful releases in 1989, 54 percent were in a lessrestrictive setting 12 months after release. Using 1990 data, Boysville also evaluated the cost effectiveness oftwo residential programs, a foster care program, and a home-basedprogram.  Boysville found that the residential programs cost morethan the other programs and resulted in fewer successful releasesthan the home-based program--but more than the foster care program. With regard to campus-based residential care, these special studiesled Boysville to propose shortening the time boys spend in such careand provide longer term and more intensive community-based aftercarefor youths and their families.  Boysville plans to assigncampus-based residential care a more limited role in the continuum ofservices the agency offers.  Campus-based residential care would bereserved for those youths who cannot initially be safely treated inthe community (because of potential harm to themselves or others) orwho have already demonstrated an unwillingness or inability torespond to community-based treatment.  Boysville officials said that,ideally, youths should be placed in the least restrictive settingavailable, such as a nonresidential program, in the continuum ofcare.    THE BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS   TRANSITIONAL LIVING PROGRAM--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2The Bridge Transitional Living Program aims to help youth make thetransition from the streets to become fully sustaining members ofsociety.         SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.1The Bridge Transitional Living Program occupies four floors of aremodeled rectory in a lower-income Boston residential neighborhood. The first floor contains a kitchen/eating area and a living area;bedrooms are on the upper floors.  Rooms are simple but light andspacious, and decorations reflect occupants' preferences. The program is one of a variety of services provided by Bridge OverTroubled Waters, a nonprofit organization in Boston.  Bridge's otherservices include an independent living program, medical outreach van,GED program, medical and dental care, a substance abuse counselingprogram, and runaway and family counseling.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.2The maximum capacity for the program was 16; the average populationat a given time was 16.  The total served was 43.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.3The program serves both men and women ranging in age from 16 through22; in 1992, 74 percent were under age 20.  The primary reason forreferral to the program is homelessness.  However, about 80 percentof these youths have been physically abused or neglected and about 40percent, sexually abused.  Forty percent are white; 40 percent,African-American; and 20 percent, Hispanic.  About 20 percent of theyouths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poorperformance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and earlyunprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.4The average length of stay was 8 months; stays ranged from 6 to 18months.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $22,609; for an average stay of8 months, the cost was $15,073.  Costs do not include education.

Theprogram coordinator works with each youth to design a specific planat intake.  Based on that plan, youths receive individual and grouptherapy, medical services, and education at other facilities bothwithin and outside Bridge.  However, youths return "home," i.e., tothe Bridge Transitional Living Program, each evening to a fullcomplement of housekeeping, cooking, and gardening jobs and time withthe peers they come to regard as a family and a support group. The house setting, peer group, and program coordinator--who is incharge of the house and is seen as a parent figure--are much like afamily.  Program officials regard this environment as critical andsee the family setting as enabling youths, who have been largelyisolated, to open up and receive support on hurtful issues. In addition to functioning as a parent figure, the programcoordinator also facilitates a Tuesday night meeting, with compulsoryattendance, at which youths review events of the previous week,including the consequences of their actions on others and on theeffective functioning of the household. The program generally does not release youths until they are involvedin a job or vocational program.  Some go on to the Bridge IndependentLiving program, perhaps to share an apartment based on a friendshipformed at the Bridge Transitional Living Program.  Bridge recentlybegan a follow-up group aimed at maintaining youths' contacts withBridge after discharge.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.8Routinely collected data.  For the 1993 annual report, the Bridgecompiled data on outcomes such as education, living situation, andwork status of 13 youths who were at the Bridge Transitional LivingProgram for at least 6 months beginning in September 1991 and hadbeen out of the program between 1 and 15 months.  The report showsthat  9 (69 percent) were working full time, two (15 percent) were in     college full time, and the other two were rearing children who     were being supported by the children's fathers; and  11 (85 percent) had earned a high school diploma or GED     certificate--10 since coming to the Bridge Transitional Living     Program--and the other 2 (15 percent) were still enrolled in a     GED program. Special studies.  A 1986 report summarized the results of a 2-yearstudy by a researcher at the University of Massachusetts whoevaluated outcomes of 2 years' participants in Bridge House, theprecursor to the Bridge Transitional Living Program.  The reportexamined the program's effectiveness in achieving improvedself-concept and more stable education, employment, and living statusfor a group of 16- and 17-year-old youths.  The study reported that11 youths who had been out of the program an average of 5.7 monthsfared significantly better than did a group of 18 youths with similarbackgrounds who were involved in programs other than Bridge'stransitional living program.  For example,  10 (91 percent) of the program youths were employed, compared with     eight (44 percent) of the non-Bridge group; and  7 (64 percent) of the program youths were in school or had     graduated compared with six (33 percent) of the non-Bridge     group. The Bridge Transitional Living Program is one of 10 study sitesincluded in a federally funded multiyear transitional living programstudy.  The study will gather information--such as living situation,change in drug and alcohol use, and progress in education--at intake,6 months later, and 6 months after discharge.    FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS' HOME,   BOYS TOWN HOME CAMPUS--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3The program seeks to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical care,education, spiritual development, and treatment for the behavioraland emotional problems of homeless, abused, neglected, and delinquentyouths who require out-of-home placement.  In doing so, it hopes togive them the skills they need to live in a larger society and leaduseful lives.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.1Boys Town's Home Campus consists of about 1,400 acres in suburbanOmaha, Nebraska.  It contains a high school and middle school,churches, a hospital, a farm, research and training facilities,administrative offices, and 76 homes--each of which houses two familyteachers and four to eight youth. In addition to the Boys Town Home Campus residential care, FatherFlanagan's Boys' Home provides a variety of services, includingemergency shelters, therapeutic foster care, family preservation, andparent training.  The organization has used programs developed at thehome campus as models for Boys Town USA sites it has established in13 cities across the country.  It also provides training andconsultation to other programs and operates a national hot line.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.2The maximum capacity was 562; the average population at a given timewas 558.  The total served was 847.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.3Boys Town serves mainly boys and girls who are 13 to 19 years old. The average age at admission is about 15.  Most are referred to theprogram by social service agencies.  They typically come fromlow-income families who live in midwest urban neighborhoods that aremarred by crime and drug problems.  They have an average of two priorplacements such as foster care or group homes, and about 30 percenthave juvenile court arrest records.  Fifty-eight percent are white,24 percent are African-American, and 18 percent are other minorities. Nearly 73 percent of the youth admitted are considered out of controlof parental authority.  Other common problems include vandalism andtheft, verbal aggression, and school learning problems.  Programofficials estimate that about 80 percent of the girls and 35 percentof the boys have been victims of sexual abuse.  About 60 percent ofthe youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poorperformance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.4The average length of stay was 18 months; stays ranged from 10 monthsto 6 years.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $49,279.  For an average stayof 18 months, the cost was $73,918.

The family teachers function ina role analogous to parents--providing counsel, taking the youthsshopping and to medical appointments, and teaching them how to livein the family and community.  Family teachers also function as theprimary treatment agents.  They strive to motivate youths to learnappropriate behavior and reduce destructive behavior, offering bothpraise and corrections throughout the day.  They also coordinate theyouths' treatment with other agency service providers. As part of a program emphasizing skills needed to operate in familyand societal settings, the program teaches skills to resolve disputesand solve problems.  Boys and girls are taught to organize theirthoughts and daily activities, participate in family life activities,negotiate satisfactory relationships with others, and solve problemsrationally. Youths are initially placed on a point system on which they earn orlose points depending on their daily conduct.  Positive points earnthe youths special privileges for the next day and can be accumulatedfor larger privileges in the future. Boys Town boys and girls attend the campus high school or middleschool whose curricula and teaching methods are designed to addressboth academic and social skills that will be relevant in school, intheir home communities, and in employment settings.  Because manyyouths are reading several years below their grade levels, Boys Townhas established a Reading Center where youths receive remedialreading classes and staff conduct research to diagnose and developnew ways to address reading deficiencies.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.8Routinely collected data.  In June 1993, Boys Town began to collectoutcome data on all youths discharged from its programs--includingresidential care and family preservation--90 and 180 days afterdischarge.  Boys Town social workers are conducting interviews withthe youths and, when appropriate, the families.  Information gatheredincludes where the youths are living, their employment history, andtheir education status.  Boys Town plans to collate the data inquarterly reports that will be used to evaluate treatmenteffectiveness and modify and improve their programs.  Boys Town alsohopes to compare the cost effectiveness of its residential care andfamily preservation programs.  The data collection will be expandedto include a random sample of youths 1 year after discharge. Special studies.  Boys Town has conducted recent studies of itsresidential program using comparison groups. Boys Town conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 497 formerresidents--who entered Boys Town between May 1981 and June 1985--andcompared their progress with that of a group of 84 youths who hadbeen accepted to Boys Town during the same time period but who didnot attend.  Participants were interviewed by telephone before,during, and every 3 to 6 months after their stay at Boys Town.  Finalinterviews took place in 1989.  Results indicated that the Boys Towngroup did significantly better in such things as rate of graduationfrom high school, grade point average, and attitudes about theimportance and chances of attending college.  For example, 83 percentof the Boys Town youth graduated from high school or completed a GEDcertificate, while 69 percent of the comparison group did so. Another study conducted by Boys Town compared its 1987-1989graduates--surveyed in 1990--to a sample of "typical" high schoolgraduates.  Boys Town graduates were asked about their lives afterprogram completion, in areas such as employment, post-secondaryeducation, and church attendance.  Interviewers were able to contact121 of 193 Boys Town graduates.  Study results showed that Boys Townyouths--who typically have had more behavior and academicproblems--did as well or better than the comparison group in severalareas.  For example,  93 percent of the Boys Town youths were in school and/or had a job     compared to 88 percent of the comparison group and  84 percent of the Boys Town youths reported that they did not use     drugs other than alcohol, compared to 62 percent of the     comparison group.    THE HYDE SCHOOL--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4The Hyde School seeks to provide a learning environment in whichindividuals develop character and discover a purpose for their lives. Originally founded as a more general boarding school, the Hyde Schoolhas an education approach that emphasizes effort over achievement,which has moved it in the direction of working more closely withyouth with behavior problems.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.1The Hyde School in Bath, Maine, is located on a 150-acre campus--theformer estate of shipbuilder John S.  Hyde.  The original mansion hasbeen restored and now houses classrooms and faculty offices.  Classesare also held in a converted carriage house.  The campus includes 6dormitories for 12 to 24 students each; a sports complex and severaloutdoor playing fields; a family learning center for parent weekendsand retreats; and a student union, which contains a performing artscenter, the student/faculty dining room, and a study hall.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.2The maximum capacity was 200; the average population at a given timewas 195.  The total served was 195.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.3Hyde students are boys and girls aged 13 to 19.  About 60 percent aremale and 40 percent are female.  Most students are white; about 10percent are minorities, including Asian, African-American, andHispanic.  Most students come from upper-income families andneighborhoods.  Students come from many states with about 15 percentof them coming from Maine. Most of Hyde's students have a history of family problems.  Primaryreasons for referral are rebelliousness, lack of respect forauthority, and poor performance in school.  About 10 percent of thestudents have been in drug rehabilitation programs.  Hyde has anongoing program to accept a total of five students selected by theBoys Clubs of New York City and the Boys and Girls Clubs ofWashington, D.C., based on their potential as students.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.4The average length of stay was 2 school years; stays ranged from 1 to5 school years.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.5For 1 year of treatment (including the Summer Challenge Program), thecost was $20,073.  For an average stay of two 9-month school years,the cost was $33,846.          FUNDING SOURCES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.6                                                                         Percent----------------------------------------------------------------------  --------Tuition payments                                                              92Contributions                                                                  8--------------------------------------------------------------------------------         TREATMENT APPROACH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.7Hyde School is a nonsectarian college preparatory boarding school forgrades 8 through 12.  Most students live in dormitories on campus. Each dormitory has a school staff member serving as resident housemother or father.  Student roommates are matched so that one is anolder student and one is a younger or new student.  Students areresponsible for keeping their rooms clean and for dormitorymaintenance, such as cleaning the bathrooms or vacuuming the livingroom.  Students, faculty, and staff eat meals together in the dininghall.  Students are required to participate in sports and encouragedto participate in performing arts activities and community service. Hyde students are graded on both their academic achievement and theirlevel of effort in school.  Their effort grade must be at least ashigh as their achievement grade to be acceptable. Hyde maintains that the first step toward appropriate behavior may bejust going through the motions but that, eventually, the student willbegin to make an effort and finally take responsibility for his orher success. Students are expected to report all inappropriate behavior to staffand are taught that reporting is an act of caring.  Studentsencourage each other to self-report.  However, if a student knows,but does not report, that another student has broken school rules,such as by drinking or using drugs, both are treated as equaloffenders.  Students are not expelled for their inappropriatebehavior, but must work on eliminating it. Hyde believes that parental participation in the program isimperative--if the youth is to make permanent life changes, theparent and family must participate and change as well.  Parents ofHyde students must attend monthly meetings and a yearly retreat heldin their home regions of the country, a 3-day campus seminar, andon-campus family weekends in the fall and spring.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.8Routinely collected data.  Hyde keeps records of the number ofstudents who go on to 4-year colleges.  School officials report thatabout 90 percent do so. Special studies.  None   NEW LIFE YOUTH SERVICES, PAINT   CREEK YOUTH CENTER--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5The program seeks to provide comprehensive, high-quality servicestailored to the individual requirements of youths convicted offelonies such as aggravated burglary or manslaughter.  The goal is tochange the youths' values so that they can stand up to negativeinfluences when they return to the community.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.1Located east of Cincinnati on 32 rural acres in Bainbridge, Ohio,Paint Creek consists of very spartan, barracks-like dormitories andclassrooms, an office building containing a kitchen and dining room,and a recreational area.  The facility also includes a woodworkingshop, basketball court, playing field, and two tennis courts. New Life Youth Services, Inc., a private, nonprofit organization inCincinnati, provides a variety of residential and community-basedprograms.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.2The maximum capacity was 33; the average population at a given timewas 28.  The total served was 51.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.3Paint Creek serves boys aged 15 to 18 at the time of admission. These boys, who come from southwest Ohio--principally Columbus,Cincinnati, and Dayton--have been convicted of a class 1 or 2 felony,such as aggravated burglary.  Between 50 and 75 percent come fromlow-income families, and between 60 and 70 percent are fromcrime-ridden neighborhoods.  About 60 percent are white; the rest aremainly African-American.  Seventy-one percent come from single-parentfamilies and another 11 percent are reported as having no parent. Youths may be referred by the sentencing judge but must passscreening by the Ohio Department of Youth Services.  Youths acceptedinto the program must be able to function in a group and be housed ina facility that is not physically secured.  The program does notserve youths who have been convicted of murder nor high-profileyouths such as gang leaders.  About 77 percent of the youths servedhave exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school,substance abuse, delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.4The average length of stay was 17 months; information on the rangesof the stays was not available.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $35,188.  For an average17-month stay, the cost was $51,023.  Costs exclude medical costs,which are billed directly to Medicaid, and education services, whichare provided on site by the local school district.          FUNDING SOURCES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.6                                                                         Percent----------------------------------------------------------------------  --------Ohio Department of Human Service                                              93U.S. Department of Agriculture lunch program                                   3Subsidy from New Life Youth Services                                           3Wood shop sales and miscellaneous                                              1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------         TREATMENT APPROACH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.7Paint Creek uses a combination of therapeutic approaches in a strongpeer culture.  First, boys are required to acknowledge that they havecriminal personalities, which they have to overcome by adopting a newway of thinking.  Second, they are required to accept responsibilityfor their own behavior and--individually and collectively--for theirrehabilitation.  For example, peers (as they refer to one another)call each other to task for behaviors that reflect "thinking errors,"such as physical or verbal abuse of others or projecting blame. Paint Creek is second only to state correctional institutions interms of restrictiveness.  Youths move around the campus single filewith one hand on the shoulder of the youth in front.  Duringmeetings, one youth is assigned to sit in front of the door todiscourage others from leaving. Youths are required to earn their way out of the facility,progressing through three levels of increasing privilege.  Initiallyyouths must earn such basic amenities as permission to hang a posterbehind their beds.  Later, youths earn permission to participate incommunity service activities and to have personal radios. Ultimately, youths earn permission to move around the campusunsupervised after notifying staff and checking in with staff upontheir return. While at Paint Creek, boys attend school.  The curriculum is intendedto parallel the one used in public schools.  The program provides aspecial education section and a high school section into which boyscan progress when ready. During a period of intensive aftercare, a community services workeris assigned to the youths as a support person.  Initially, a boy canleave the house only with the community service worker's permissionand accompanied by a parent, except to go to school, work, or anappointment arranged by Paint Creek staff.  Gradually, the youthprogresses to increasing freedom of action and less supervision.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.8Routinely collected data.  NoneSpecial studies.  A Rand Corporation study of Paint Creek examinedrates of recidivism within 1 year of discharge.  The study compared75 youths assigned to Paint Creek between February 1986 and April1988 with a randomly assigned control group serving time at two statecorrectional institutions. The study found Paint Creek youths had a 51-percent rearrest ratecompared to 61 percent for the control group.  The reincarcerationrate was 23 percent for Paint Creek youths compared to 29 percent forthe control group.  Neither difference was statistically significant. The 1993 Rand report suggested that, despite the lack ofstatistically significant differences, the Paint Creek study shouldlend support to the argument that such programs can be run as costeffectively as training schools and without undue risk to the public.    PINEY WOODS COUNTRY LIFE SCHOOL--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6Piney Woods' objectives are to strengthen students' reading, writing,and critical thinking skills; to develop good study habits and astrong work ethic in each student; and to eliminate the sense ofacademic futility and build a sense of academic achievement.  Theschool believes that, throughout the United States, there arestudents, especially black students, who have the capability tosucceed, but do not have the opportunity to do so for financial orother reasons.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.1The school is 21 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi, on 2,000rural acres that include woods, lakes, farmland, and 50 acres ofcampus.  On the campus are several dormitories, classroom buildings,a cafeteria, a recreation center, administrative offices, a generalstore, faculty and staff homes, and the log cabin that served as theoriginal school building.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.2The maximum capacity was 345; the average population at a given timewas 345.  The total served was 345.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.3Piney Woods is a private school serving male and female boardingstudents in grades 7 through 12.  Most students come from low-incomefamilies--many from dangerous urban neighborhoods.  While moststudents are not currently exhibiting problem behavior, many studentsare at increased risk of academic failure or delinquency and otherpersonal troubles.  All students are black--about half are fromMississippi, and the rest are from 22 other states and 3 Africancountries. To be admitted to Piney Woods, students must have a minimum C-minusgrade average and be in good standing with their current schools. They can have no prevailing substance abuse or delinquency problems.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.4There is no representative average stay.  Some students stay fromgrade 7 through high school graduation.

The daily schedule of a dormitory for girls in grades 9 through 12provides an example of their routine.  Wake-up time is 5:30 a.m.;room check is at 6:30 a.m.  (beds must be made with hospitalcorners); breakfast is at 7:00 a.m.  (all students must be present). Students attend classes until about 2:00 p.m.  After school they areresponsible for housecleaning and other chores at the dormitory.  Onweekday evenings, students must do homework from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. Students must sign out when they leave the dormitory, saying wherethey are going.  They must have a pass signed by the dorm parent ifthey are out after 5:00 p.m.  Lights out is at 10:00 p.m.  for grades9 through 10 and 10:30 p.m.  for grades 11 through 12. In addition to their studies and dormitory cleaning responsibilities,students in grade 7 and above are required to participate in thestudent work program 10 hours per week to receive meaningful workexperience and to earn work credit toward tuition charges. Assignments include grounds maintenance, working at the souvenir shopand book store, and working in the administrative offices.  OnSunday, students are required to attend Sunday school and churchservices. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, there are recreationalactivities at the campus recreation center.  These include playingcomputer games, swimming, and watching TV and movies.  Parties areheld around holidays. The school has strict grooming, dress, and behavior codes.  Studentscan be suspended or expelled for such things as failure to attendclass; use of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; and failure to follow thedress code.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.8Routinely collected data.  The percentage of students who go on tocollege is calculated each year.  Officials report that it rangesfrom 90 to 95 percent for each graduating class. Special studies.  None   SALESMANSHIP CLUB YOUTH AND   FAMILY CENTERS, INC., YOUTH   CAMP--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7The program seeks to provide a wilderness environment in which youngpeople can experience success and learn problem-solving skills underthe supervision of trained counselors.         SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.1The Youth Camp is located on a 1,250-acre wilderness site east ofDallas in Hawkins, Texas.  It is organized into three boys' and threegirls' campsites grouped by age and developmental level.  Each groupconsists of about 12 youth and has 4 counselors.  Youths build theirown tents with wood floors to serve as living quarters, weekendkitchen and dining facilities, and bathroom facilities.  The siteincludes a school, central dining hall used on weekdays, andrecreational facilities. The camp is one of three programs for at-risk youth and theirfamilies that the Salesmanship Club of Dallas operates.  The othertwo are a comprehensive day treatment center and school program forat-risk youth and an intensive outpatient family therapy program,both in Dallas.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.2The maximum capacity was 72; the average population at a given timewas 65.  The total served was 158.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.3The camp serves boys aged 12 to 14 and girls aged 13 to 16 from theDallas metropolitan area who are experiencing emotional or behavioralproblems at school or home.  Most boys and girls are white and arefrom lower-middle or lower income families.  Typical participantshave problems in school, are substance abusers, and have behaviorproblems such as defiance of authority.  Many have been physicallyand emotionally abused, and many are suffering from depression. To be accepted into the program, youths must have an intellectualcapacity of slow normal to bright, be physically capable ofparticipating in normal camp routine, and cannot be pregnant ordependent on drugs.  Boys and girls are generally not accepted ifthey have sexually abused other children, are actively psychotic orsuicidal or have parents who disagree on the need for placement orrefuse to participate in therapy.  Most youths are referred to theprogram by their parents and are not in the custody of a publicagency.  About 29 percent of the youths served have exhibited allfour risky behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse,delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.4The average length of stay was 6 months; stays ranged from 4 to 12months.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $25,738.  For the average stayof 6 months, the cost was $12,869.

Counselors livewith the youth around the clock in the camp setting, with two on dutyat any one time.  The groups design and build their tents and plantheir daily activities, including trips away from the wildernesssite.  They attend school on site for 3 hours a day and return homeat least one weekend a month. Difficulties in group interactions, including problem behavior, aredealt with immediately through "huddle-ups." In these huddle-ups,group members help one another address and resolve problems with theobjective of building the social skills and self-esteem needed to besuccessful.  Family participation is also an important element of theprogram--the youths' families are required to participate in familytherapy in Dallas and are encouraged to continue therapy for up to 6months after the youths complete the program.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.8Routinely collected data.  Cumulative data on campers and theirfamilies are collected routinely and reported in special studies suchas that described below. Special studies.  The Salesmanship Club programs have an evaluationsystem that--since 1983--has gathered data and reported on thecharacteristics of the families and youths served as well as theimpact of services provided.  The current study group consists of 314youth and families served by the Salesmanship Club'sprograms--including 157 discharged from the youth camp--between July1989 and April 1991.  Youths and families are interviewed at intake,at discharge, and for several years after leaving program services. For a September 1991 report, the program was able to contact andobtain information from 76 of 133 families at 6 months afterdischarge.  While program officials caution that data are notnecessarily representative of all families in the program, theybelieve the families who participated in the study are making clearprogress.  For example,  72 percent of the youths had been receiving special education     services before they entered the program compared to 29 percent     receiving them 6 months after discharge and  family satisfaction ratings were high, with 81 percent of the     families rating themselves a 5 or 6 on a scale ranging from     "very unsatisfied" with the program (1) to "very satisfied" with     the program (6).    STARR COMMONWEALTH SCHOOLS,   CEDAR VILLAGE RESIDENTIAL   PROGRAM--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8The program seeks to provide for the care, education, treatment,counseling, and nonsectarian spiritual guidance of troubled childrenand youths.  Its goals are for participants to develop positiveattitudes and values, recognize and reach for their potential,improve their self-image, increase their self-confidence, and returnto their home communities.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.1Cedar Village is located on Starr Commonwealth Schools' Albion,Michigan, campus, a 350-acre wooded area in rural south centralMichigan.  The campus includes cottages, school and recreationfacilities, and administrative offices.  Cedar Village is one ofthree residential programs on the campus. The Albion Campus residential programs served 361 youths in 1992 andare located on one of three residential campuses operated by StarrCommonwealth Schools.  In addition to residential care, StarrCommonwealth also provides community-based services such as analternative education program and in-home care.  In 1992, StarrCommonwealth Schools served 4,950 children, youths, families, andadults in Michigan and Ohio.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.2The maximum capacity was 57; the average population at a given timewas 58.  The total served was 121.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.3The program serves boys, aged 14 to 18, largely from low-income,single-parent families living in poor communities in easternMichigan, from the upper peninsula down through the Detroit area. All youths entering the program are delinquents, typically withmultiple felony convictions such as breaking and entering, assault,motor vehicle theft, and drug sales.  Of the 83 youths released in1992, 53 percent were African-American, and 34 percent were white. Most boys in the program have had previous placements, usually inyouth homes.  Of the youths released in 1992, 64 percent have asubstance abuse problem, about 36 percent have experienced physicalabuse or neglect, and 50 to 60 percent have been sexually abused.  Tobe accepted by the program, boys must be able to socialize in a groupand, among other things, not be highly violent or chronically truant. About 70 percent of the youths served have exhibited all four riskybehaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,and early, unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.4The average length of stay was 10 months; stays ranged from 7 to 14months.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $51,373.  For the average stayof 10 months, the cost was $42,811.  Costs include special educationcosts not covered by the school district.

Staff use the test results with other inputsuch as staff observations to develop the boy's individual growthplan.  Based on vacancies in cottages and on the boy's compatibility,he is then assigned to a peer group of 10 to 12 boys within acottage.  Seven staff are assigned to each cottage.  Except forindividual counseling or medical treatment, the boys live, eat,attend classes, and undergo therapy with their peer group. Through the group process and under the guidance of staff counselors,the boys develop a sense of self-worth and learn to take care ofthemselves and others.  Once the peer group is satisfied that a boyhas dealt with the group's feedback on his problems and is resolvingthem, the group makes the initial recommendation that he is ready forrelease.  Staff consider the group's recommendation in decidingwhether a boy has achieved the goals in his growth plan and is readyto return to the community. Staff maintain contact with the boy's family throughout the program. When the boy arrives at Cedar Village, staff counselors and a familyservice worker immediately begin working with the family to develop apost-placement plan.  The goal is to create a supportive environmentfor the boy once he is discharged.  Counselors and the service workermay hold family conferences to strengthen family relationships oraddress problems such as substance abuse in the family.  Families areencouraged to visit the campus, where apartments are available fortheir stay.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.8Routinely collected data.  Starr Commonwealth Schools collects dataon outcomes at 3 and 12 months after discharge.  A comparison of someoutcomes for the 52 youths who successfully completed Cedar Village'sprogram in 1991 follows.  While only 47 boys could be contacted forthe 3-month survey, all 52 boys were contacted for the 12-monthsurvey.  Of those contacted,  47 were in a less or equally restrictive setting relative to Cedar     Village at 3 months after discharge; at 12 months, 41 were;  43 were in school and/or working at 3 months after discharge; at 12     months, 40 were; and  4 had been rearrested at 3 months after discharge; at 12 months,     the cumulative number of boys who had been rearrested was 12. Special studies.  None available   YOUTHCARE, THRESHOLD PROGRAM--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9The program is designed to help young women leave street life byproviding a safe, stable place to live, a stable source of income,effective role models, and some resolution of family issues. Threshold's goals include helping the women to work and liveeffectively in their current situation and to be prepared for theirfuture role as adults.          SETTING----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.1Threshold uses a number of residential settings in and aroundSeattle, Washington, for its three-phased program.  Phase I islocated in a shelter for runaway youth.  The shelter, a brick housein an urban neighborhood, has six bedrooms and is close to bus lines. A licensed group care home in Seattle serves as the phase IIresidence.  During phase III, girls aged 18 and older liveindependently, such as in their own apartments, while younger girlslive with foster families. YouthCare, a Seattle-based private, nonprofit agency, providesresidential programs and counseling, education, and medical care andother services to meet the needs of youth in crisis in the localcommunity.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.2The maximum capacity was eight (four in phase I and four in phaseII); the average population at a given time was six for phases I andII.  The total served was 10.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.3Threshold serves girls aged 14 to 18 who have been physically,sexually, or emotionally abused or neglected and who have historiesof prostitution or are at high risk of becoming involved inprostitution.  Girls come from low-income families in the county andusually have had prior placements or interventions such as fostercare and family counseling.  All girls are referred by state childprotective services.  Of the 1992 participants, six were white, threewere African-American, and one was Native American.  Girls acceptedinto the program must be motivated to stop such behaviors as abusingdrugs or alcohol, engaging in prostitution, or assaulting others. About 75 percent of the youth served have exhibited all four riskybehaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,and early, unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.4The average length of stay was 7 months for phase I plus 12 monthsfor phase II; stays ranged from 3 to 8 months for phase I and from 12to 16 months for phase II.          COST PER YOUTH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $28,927; for the average stayof 19 months, the cost was $45,802.  Costs cover phase I and II only. Local school districts pay for the education of girls who attenddistrict schools.  Phase III services are funded by YouthCareunrestricted funds and not by the Washington state grant.          FUNDING SOURCES----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.6                                                                         Percent----------------------------------------------------------------------  --------Washington State Department of Social and Health Services grant               93United Way                                                                     7--------------------------------------------------------------------------------         TREATMENT APPROACH----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.7Phase I, which is very structured, is designed to stabilize thegirls' behavior and allow staff to assess individual needs anddevelop a trusting relationship with the girls.  Initially, the girlsmust stay in the house except to attend school and go on occasionaloutings with other residents and staff.  The girls must sever allties with their former associates.  They are also expected to attendindividual counseling sessions with their Threshold caseworker,pursue at least a GED certificate through local schools or programs,learn job-finding skills, find jobs if they are old enough, andperform household chores.  Many residents for the first time learnhow to clean their rooms, wash laundry, prepare meals, budget, andshop.  The girls must demonstrate cooperation, motivation, andresponsibility to earn privileges such as 1-hour walks or overnightstays with friends or relatives.  Girls attend a weekly meeting wherethey may discuss problems arising from communal living or any topicof interest to the group. After demonstrating they have the skills to live in asemi-independent manner, girls graduate to phase II.  The phase IIgroup home operates as a family home, allowing the girls to earn theright to be alone in the house, carry keys, and have friends over. In addition to pursuing education and employment goals, girlscontinue to care for themselves, taking on more responsibility forcleaning and meals.  Because many of the girls missed the opportunityto participate in, and learn from, recreational activities while theywere growing up, the program provides many activities such as campingand visits to local parks. In phase III, girls move to independent living situations orsupportive foster care homes where they continue to receive supportand care from Threshold staff for 6 months to a year or more.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.8Routinely collected data.  NoneSpecial studies.  Six months after they left Threshold's phase II, 24girls who had entered phase II between January 1987 and July 1989were assessed by YouthCare.  YouthCare found 10 girls (42 percent)were living in a stable situation, employed or attending a school orvocational training program, and were free of substance abuse andinvolvement in crime.  Eight girls (33 percent) had returned tostreet life or were abusing drugs, and no information was availableon 6 girls (25 percent) who could not be contacted. PROGRAMS GAO CONTACTED BYTELEPHONE========================================================== Appendix IIThe following descriptions of nine programs we contacted by telephonecontain data obtained from interviews with program officials andwritten material they provided.  We did not verify thedata--including program costs and the effectiveness studies andreports.  The methodologies used to measure program outcomes and thefactors they measured varied, thereby preventing comparison amongprograms.  Programs are listed in alphabetical order.    THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE,   TOMPKINS TRANSITIONAL CARE   PROGRAM-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1The program provides comprehensive services to the most at-risksegment of the Children's Village population to move youthsuccessfully to a less restrictive Children's Village or otherprogram.         SETTING---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.1The Tompkins program is located on the Children's Village campus inDobbs Ferry, New York.  It is housed in a single cottage at thecenter of an ellipse of 21 residential treatment cottages, which aredivided into seven "neighborhood" units. The Children's Village has provided residential care for childrensince 1851.  Currently, in addition to its campus-based residentialtreatment, it provides community-based group homes for boys, andfoster family care homes for boys and girls.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.2The maximum capacity was 12; the average population at a given timewas 12.  The total served was 15.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.3Tompkins serves boys aged 8 to 15.  All have had previous placements: approximately half are in the next stage of their recovery afterrelease from a mental hospital; and the other half are referred fromother Children's Village programs where their behavior has suddenlydeteriorated due to some trauma.  Their specific problems includeconduct disorder, lack of impulse control, depression, episodes ofviolence, attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity, or being adanger to themselves or others.  All are from New York state,principally New York City and nearby counties, and are referred bythe New York Department of Social Services.  Tompkins excludes boysfor whom a less restrictive approach would be appropriate. All come from families whose income is below poverty level.  About 20percent are reported as having no parents; the remaining 80 percentare from single-parent families.  Between 60 and 70 percent have beensexually abused and 90 percent have been physically abused orneglected.  About 10 percent of the youths served have exhibited allfour risky behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse,delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.4The average length of stay was 15 months; stays ranged from 6 to 24months.          COST PER YOUTH---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $65,496; for an average stay of15 months, the cost was $79,141.  This included all costs exceptfundraising and investment counseling fees and education, which isprovided by an on-campus public school.

Tompkins' higher staff-to-youth ratios and more intensiveclinical services allow treatment of youth who would otherwiserequire psychiatric hospitalization. As with other Children's Village programs, cottage life is importantto the Tompkins program.  To provide a firm structure thatestablishes boundaries of behavior, cottages have clear rules as wellas clear consequences for breaking them. Each boy has a primary case manager and must sign a contract thatcommits to specified behaviors.  A daily checklist reports andrewards acceptable behavior.  Group therapy uses life events to teachappropriate behavior.  The program uses special events such ascarnivals, circuses, and art fairs to develop youths' skills andthereby enhance their self-esteem.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.8Routinely collected data.  NoneSpecial studies.  No special studies have been conducted specificallyof the Tompkins program. One study, which has aftercare as a principal component, is under wayfor selected participants of Children's Village.  This study, now inits ninth year, examines a program called Work Appreciation forYouth, which involves intensive counseling, work ethics education,and financial incentives for saving money. Work Appreciation for Youth participants--who are about 80 percentminorities and are all academically deficient--receive these servicesboth while at Children's Village and after discharge.  The studytracks the performance of 65 of these participants and compares it toanother group of youths who did not participate in the WorkAppreciation for Youth program while at Children's Village--and whoreceived less intensive aftercare services. Based on data from the first 6 years of the study, youths who haveremained in the Work Appreciation for Youth program havesignificantly outperformed the comparison group with respect to notdropping out of school, completing high school, and earning somemoney.  For example,  40 percent of the Work Appreciation for Youth participants have     graduated or received a GED certificate, compared to 18 percent     of the comparison group; and  12 percent of the Work Appreciation for Youth participants have     dropped out of school, compared to 29 percent of the comparison     group.    EASTERN NEBRASKA COMMUNITY   OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH   ADOLESCENT TREATMENT FACILITY-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2The program aims to make boys more self-aware and more controlled inbehavior and emotions.  The intent is that they be reunited withtheir biological families, if available, or with surrogate familiesor placed in other long-term or permanent situations.         SETTING---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.1The Adolescent Treatment Facility is in a large group home in aresidential neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska.  It has its own fencedblack-topped tennis/basketball court. The facility is one of three long-term residential treatmentfacilities that the Eastern Nebraska Community Office of MentalHealth operates within a service spectrum that also includesemergency short-term care, therapeutic foster care, and home-basedmental health services to children and adolescents.  In addition, theagency provides residential and day rehabilitative services foradults.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.2The maximum capacity was 8; the average population at a given timewas 8.  The total served was 14.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.3This program provides around-the-clock treatment and care for boysaged 12 to 19 with diagnosable psychiatric disorders--such as majordepression or conduct disorder--for whom a less controlled treatmentsetting is not considered appropriate.  Boys must have sufficientintellectual potential to respond to active psychological treatment. They are referred by the Nebraska Department of Social Services, butmost have been charged as delinquents and have plea bargained to aless serious charge with the understanding that noncooperation couldresult in their being placed in the corrections system.  All havebeen through a psychiatric hospital and received a recommendationagainst their return home. Ninety-nine percent of the boys' families are below the povertylevel, and 80 percent are single-parent families.  About 90 percentof the boys come from the Omaha metropolitan area.  Almost all of theyouths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poorperformance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.4The average length of stay was 9 months; stays ranged from 5 to 12months.          COST PER YOUTH---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $24,740; for an average stay of9 months, the cost was $18,555.  These figures include all costsexcept administrative and school costs.

Others whom the family and youthidentify as important are also invited to participate.  The programidentifies the boy's and family's strengths and weaknesses, and usesan individualized approach to provide encouragement for the boy tobuild on identified strengths.  Efforts include working to empowerthe boy by teaching social, coping, and living skills--therebyboosting self-esteem. To produce changes in behavior, the program uses a system of tokensand positive reinforcement for good behavior.  By accumulatingtokens, boys can progress to a higher level in the program in whichthey are permitted to engage in more independent actions as theydemonstrate increased skills and self-control. Criteria for returning youths to their families include improvementof family dynamics, communication, and understanding so that thefamily can function as an effective unit. The treatment plan identifies strengths and weaknesses of the boy'sfamily and sets goals and objectives with time frames--for example,to improve family communications or to teach parents to useincentives for good behavior instead of punishment for inappropriatebehavior.  The program conducts weekly meetings with parents andhelps the family identify and link with community supports that willprovide family survival skills.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.8Routinely collected data.  Other than monitoring changes in youths'scores on a standardized test of child behavior over the course ofthe program, Eastern Nebraska collects data on a single outcome--thesetting to which boys are discharged.  The program was able tocontact 10 boys who were discharged in 1991:   Of the five who were contacted 12 to 18 months after discharge,     none was in a correctional institution, one was in another     residential placement, and four were living with a biological     parent.   Of the five who were contacted 18 to 24 months after discharge,     three were in a correctional institution and the other two, in     foster care. Special studies.

The total served was 36.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.3The program serves boys aged 10 to 15 with serious psychiatricdisorders, ranging from depression to medically controlled psychosis,or major learning handicaps such as attention deficit disorder. Approximately 70 percent are referred by the California Division ofFamily and Child Services, 20 percent by the county mental healthemergency center, 6 percent by the schools, and 2 percent each byhealth care facilities and family members. About 73 percent of these boys are white; 15 percent, Hispanic; 8percent, African-American; and 4 percent, Asian.  Their familyincomes average $9,500, with 92 percent below the poverty level. About 62 percent are from single-parent families.  Family problemsinclude domestic violence and drug and alcohol problems.  Youths comefrom Santa Clara County, California--generally from low-incomesections with high crime rates, some gang activity, and poor housing. About 35 percent of the youths served have exhibited all four riskybehaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,and early, unprotected sexual activity.

Each cottage houses 8 youths and has a primary therapist who isresponsible exclusively for youths in that cottage.  Boys spendafter-school hours and weekends largely with the residents of theircottage.  The therapist is responsible for developing andcoordinating the treatment plan for each youth.  The plan is woveninto all aspects of the program:  individual therapy, group therapy,recreational activities, family therapy, and--in coordination withthe community schools the youth attends--educational program. Throughout its activities, the program uses a system that holds boysresponsible for achieving their behavioral goals and rewards positivebehavior with points that accumulate to earn promotion through fourlevels to discharge. Eastfield Ming Quong also attaches importance to family counseling,though family participation is not a requirement.  Family therapysessions occur once each week with the youths included at thediscretion of the primary therapist.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.8Routinely collected data.  The program collects data on a singleoutcome:  the setting to which boys are discharged.  For the 139youth discharged during 1991 and 1992, 78 percent were discharged toa lower level of care--such as a parent, relative, community grouphome, or a foster home; 16 percent were discharged to the same levelof care; and 6 percent were discharged to a higher level of care (apsychiatric hospital).

The aim is to assistchildren in developing appropriate social competencies, personalvalues, and self-management skills that can be successfullytransferred to their home, school, and community setting.         SETTING---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.1Camp E-How-Kee in Brooksville, Florida, is in a wilderness area inthe central part of the state.  It is 1 of 19 programs operated byEckerd Family Youth Alternatives, Inc., of Clearwater, Florida. These programs, which serve youth from seven states, include 13wilderness camps, a juvenile correctional facility, a short-termresidential program for less serious offenders, and the FloridaConservation Corps.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.2The maximum capacity was 60; the average population at a given timewas 56.  The total served was 110.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.3Camp E-How-Kee serves boys aged 10 to 16 from the central Floridaarea.  They are primarily status offenders or truants.  The boystypically come from lower-middle-income urban families with a historyof child abuse, substance abuse, and marital problems.  Most boys arereferred by the Florida Department of Health and RehabilitationServices.  About 60 percent have been victims of sexual abuse.  Allyouths have had multiple failures in other treatment programs orout-of-home placements such as foster care, short-term residentialpsychiatric hospitals, and counseling.  Of the 1991-92 participants,about 52 percent have received court judgments, with an average ofthree convictions; 19 percent of the judgments were for crimesagainst persons.  Eighty-five percent are white, 12 percent areAfrican-American, and 3 percent are Hispanic.

The groups construct their own shelters, cuttheir own wood for cooking and heating, make needed repairs, andprovide their own recreation.  The program is designed to increasethe boys' feelings of self-worth by developing the skills theyacquire in providing for their own basic needs and by seeing how many"luxuries" they can do without and still be content and comfortable. Within these groups--through daily routines and specialactivities--boys are taught to identify and resolve problems.  Eachboy pursues an individual education plan that places priority onlistening, speaking, writing, and reading.  While the boys are incamp, parents are required to participate in parent therapy groups,attend three family conferences yearly at the camp, and maintaincontact with Eckerd family workers.  Youth make home visits for 4days every 6 weeks to give them and their families a chance topractice new skills. The parent organization, Eckerd Family Youth Alternatives, Inc.,provides aftercare services for up to 6 months to maintain and buildon the gains made at the camp.  Aftercare includes identifyingindividual needs, such as counseling or care for chronic healthproblems, and helping families contact appropriate community serviceagencies.  A program family worker continues to work with the youthand families through frequent face-to-face contact supplemented byphone calls.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.8Routinely collected data.  At 6 and 12 months after discharge, theprogram collects outcome information.  At the time of our study, theprogram had 12-month data on 33 of the 42 boys discharged in fiscalyear 1992.  The data showed the following:   Delinquency:  18 (55 percent) had no further encounter with the law     while 15 (45 percent) had--resulting in such actions as     commitment to a secure residential program or being put on     probation.   Education:  9 (27 percent) were truant or had dropped out of     school.   Living status:  59 percent (17 of the 29 for whom the program had     this data) were living with their natural or adoptive families;     the remainder were in placements such as foster care and group     homes. Special studies.  No special studies had been conducted for CampE-How-Kee.  However, the Eckerd Wilderness Education System isconducting a 3-year longitudinal study of 250 campers--50 from eachof 5 camps other than E-How-Kee--beginning with campers entering inMay 1990.  Data will be collected for the period before the youthsentered the program, during the program, and 3 years after.  Thepreliminary report issued in June 1992 reported gains made by youthat the time of discharge in academics, family functioning, behavior,and self-esteem.    HARBOR SCHOOLS AND FAMILY   SERVICES, HAVERHILL PROGRAM-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5The immediate tasks are to break the cycle of failure, stop thevictimization of self and others, and bring order to chaotic lives.

The program uses an 86-point behavior checklistas part of its comprehensive behavior management system.  Girls aretaught new skills for dealing with anger, anxiety, and frustration. Each girl progresses at her own pace from one level of the program tothe next less restrictive level. Girls receive individual therapy each week from private cliniciansand also attend group counseling sessions supervised by staff andclinicians.  These group sessions serve in part to allow the girls tomake decisions about the daily operations of the program.  Every girlhas an individual education plan and attends small classes of four toeight students on the program premises.  They also receive trainingin practical life skills.  They can join a work-study program, andsome hold down after-school and weekend jobs. All girls are involved in the recreation program, which includessports, crafts, camping, scouting, and local movies.  Familyinvolvement takes place through parental support groups andindividual contacts with a staff caseworker who provides informationabout the girls' progress and about techniques for better parenting.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.8Routinely collected data.  NoneSpecial studies.  No studies have been conducted exclusively of theHaverhill program.  However, in 1989 the Harbor Schools' executivedirector conducted a one-time survey of 20 youths who had beendischarged from Harbor programs--including Haverhill--over a periodof 2 years.  The survey found that, 3 months after discharge, 14 (70percent) of the youths had returned to school, family life, andpart-time work.

An individual counselor and a therapist manageimplementation of the plan.  In a highly structured environment, theprogram sets out basic expectations, rules, and consequences ofbreaking the rules.  These consequences are enforced by a counselorassigned to the youth.  Youths live in cottages where the environmentis designed to nurture and provide support.  They receive weeklyindividual and group counseling and regular reviews of their progressunder the supervision of a staff psychiatrist. Treatment staff monitor and grade behavior throughout all activities,including recreational activities.  Youths receive daily grades onbehaviors, and these form the basis for privileges such asallowances, extended bedtimes, and outing participation. Youths in the program go to one of three private schools that theprogram shares with other KidsPeace programs.  Families receivecounseling either from program staff--if the families live nearby--orfrom clinical affiliates in their communities.  Youths participatewith their families in that counseling either while on home visits orby monthly conference call. In developing a plan for discharge, a program social workercoordinates with service resources in the community to which theyouth is returning.  After discharge, program staff provide in-homecounseling to sustain program gains.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7.0.8Routinely collected data.  NoneSpecial studies.  The program is currently in the fourth year of anevaluative research project looking at selected outcomes between 1and 2 years after discharge.  The project was able to contact 30 ofthe 78 youths who were discharged in 1990 after completing at least 6months in the program.  Some did not answer all questions; however,of those that responded, outcomes reported included  23 of the 30 (77 percent) were living in a less restrictive     setting;  15 of 27 (56 percent) reported they had not had any police     involvement, while 12 reported they had;  8 of 25 (32 percent) were employed; and  23 (77 percent) were satisfied with the care they had received.    OASIS CENTER, MICHAEL'S KIDS   HOUSE-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8The program provides counseling services and training in the livingskills that will enable youths to live independently and to perseverein an educational setting or a job.          SETTING---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.1The Michael's Kids House group home in Nashville, Tennessee, is in aresidential community close to city bus lines.  It contains threebedrooms, two baths, a living room, dining room, kitchen, and office. As part of the program, some youths move on to apartments in whichthey live more independently. In addition to Michael's Kids House, Oasis Center programs inNashville include a runaway shelter, crisis counseling, a teen crisisline, and a youth employment program.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.2The maximum capacity was 13 (6 in the group home and 7 inapartments); the average population at a given time was 13.  Thetotal served was 32.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.3Michael's Kids House serves boys and girls aged 17 to 21 who do nothave any other safe living alternatives and who typically have hadnumerous previous placements.  All youths are in the custody of theTennessee Department of Human Services.  They are referred by thatdepartment or by the Tennessee Department of Youth Developmentbecause of a lack of a suitable family environment or behaviorproblems.  Youths exhibit various problems, such as school failure,emotional difficulties, and drug abuse, and many are victims ofparental abuse, neglect, or abandonment.  About two-thirds are whiteand about one-quarter are African-American. To be eligible for the program, youths must be willing to pursue aneducation plan and maintain at least part-time employment.  They mustnot be currently involved in destructive behavior such as drug andalcohol use or stealing.  Finally, they must have a level ofintelligence that will permit them to function within the program.          LENGTH OF STAY---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.4The average length of stay was 9 months in the group home, althoughdata were not available for the apartment stay.  Stays ranged from 9months to 3 years for group home and apartment combined stay.          COST PER YOUTH---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $24,321.  This figure includescosts of both group home and apartment phases.  For an average stayof 9 months, the program could not provide cost data.

While youths areencouraged to learn to make decisions on their own, they are requiredto sign an agreement to live within house rules.  With the help of aprimary counselor, youths develop a contract defining individualgoals and the training in skills that will be needed after discharge. Youths who violate their contracts or house rules receive counseling,may be put on probation, and may be expelled from the program. Skills such as money management, comparative shopping, and eatingnutritiously are taught in course form, and staff ensure that youthsare given opportunities for supervised practice. The program also provides education assessment and counseling to helpyouths set appropriate educational goals.  Additionally, it providesemployment services such as a week-long course to help youth identifytheir strengths and weaknesses, instruction on how to get and keepemployment, and job placement.  All youth are required to participatein individual counseling and a group counseling session once a week. While staff are responsible for enforcing rules against illegal ordestructive activity, their principal role is to guide youths inmaking personal decisions and to provide support as youths experiencethe consequences of those decisions.  Staff work in shifts, with acounselor always on call.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.8Routinely collected data.  Oasis gathers information on Michael'sKids House Program youths after discharge--through phone calls andfrom what youths report at an annual homecoming event.  Informationincludes boys' and girls' living status and education.  They reportthat five of the nine youths (56 percent) who had completed theprogram in 1992 had achieved all aspects of what the programconsiders successful completion, meaning they (1) had been dischargedto a placement outside the state human services system or to anindependent living situation; (2) had a home to go to; and (3) haddemonstrated the skills of employability, money management, and usingsupport systems.  All nine who completed the program were employed. Special studies.  None   PRESSLEY RIDGE SCHOOLS, GRANT   GARDENS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9The program seeks to break the cycle of repeated out-of-homeplacements for status offenders, that is, youth with delinquentbehavior such as chronic truancy or running away.  It is operated byan organization that has the goal of being a national leader indeveloping and providing services to children and families withdifficult problems.  Pressley Ridge School at Grant Gardens wasestablished to serve status offenders.          SETTING---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.1The residential program of Pressley Ridge School at Grant Gardens isin Ona, West Virginia--a small, rural community east of Huntington. Grant Gardens also provides community-based services such as familypreservation and therapeutic foster care.  It is 1 of 12 programs inPennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio operated by PressleyRidge Schools of Pittsburgh.  Pressley Ridge's services includein-home and family preservation services, a day-school, shelter care,foster care, and three residential facilities.          NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED         IN 1992---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.2The maximum capacity was 20; the average population at a given timewas 19.  The total served was 35.          CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS         SERVED---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.3The residential program of Pressley Ridge School at Grant Gardensserves boys and girls aged 13 to 17 from southern West Virginia.  Allof its youths, who are about equally divided between boys and girls,are in state custody for such offenses as truancy or being out ofparental control, though some may have delinquency adjudications aswell.  About 90 percent of the youths have had previous placements. Eighty percent come from families with incomes below $15,000, and 95percent come from single-parent families.  About half have a historyof physical abuse or neglect, and 30 percent have been sexuallyabused.  Eighty percent of the boys and girls are referred by theWest Virginia Department of Health and Human Services; 15 percent arereferred by probation officers; and 5 percent are referred by mentalhealth sources.  About 50 percent of the youths served have exhibitedall four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school, substanceabuse, delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity.          LENGTH OF STAY---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.4The average length of stay was 7 months; stays ranged from 3 to 24months.          COST PER YOUTH---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.5For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $49,772; for an average stay of7 months, the cost was $29,033.  These figures include all costsexcept school, which is provided by the county school districtwithout charge to the program.

Each boy's or girl's progress toward achievingbehavior goals is assessed at the end of each day, with the youth,staff, and peer group awarding points, as positive reinforcers, basedon their combined assessment of the youth's behavior.  Members of thepeer group, which is central to the program, hold one anotheraccountable for inappropriate behavior.  As conflict arises or youthdisplay inappropriate behavior, staff work within the group process,discussing the consequences of behaviors.  Staff use role modeling tohelp youths learn appropriate behaviors in observed problemsituations and relate them to situations that might arise at home orin the community.  For example, when a youth loses his or her temper,staff may discuss and demonstrate behaviors that could later help theyouth cope effectively with a family member's losing his or hertemper.  Staff also work on identified problems with the youth. Youths attend school on campus for as long as necessary until theycan function in a community school setting.  Most youths attendschool on campus for about 25 percent of their stay at theresidential programs at Grant Gardens.  Thereafter, they attendcommunity schools. The program emphasizes family participation, recognizing that eventhough the youth is in the custody of the state, he or she may returnto the family.  Staff ask families what the families need to helptheir youngsters achieve a successful outcome and try to help themmeet those needs.  By scheduling meetings at the family'sconvenience, the program is able to involve about 80 percent offamilies. Ninety percent of participants receive follow-up services in thefirst 6 months after discharge, paid for either by Medicaid or by theDepartment of Social Services on a fee-for-service basis.  Based onneeds identified in formulating discharge plans, Grant Gardens hasalso begun providing home services and child placement services forthose boys and girls who cannot return to their families.          EFFECTIVENESS DATA---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.8Routinely collected data.  According to Pressley Ridge officials,because Grant Gardens was established in 1990, they do not yet haveoutcome data for that program.  However, they provided us withoutcome data from Laurel Park, a program established several yearsearlier for status offenders in northern West Virginia.  According toPressley Ridge officials, the two programs are comparable and wouldbe expected to have similar outcomes. Outcome data have been collected 1 to 2 years after discharge for allyouths discharged from 1983 to 1990.  Data include such measures asgoing to school or working, restrictiveness of living situation,educational placement, drug use, stealing, and negative policecontacts.  Of 15 youths discharged from Laurel Park during the yearending June 1990, for example, 10 (67 percent) were in school orworking 1 year later, 11 (73 percent) had earned a high schooldiploma or GED certificate or were needing less support in school, 12(80 percent) were in a less restrictive living situation, 3 (20percent) were using drugs, and 3 (20 percent) had at least one policecontact. Special studies.  No special studies have been conducted at theresidential program at Grant Gardens, but one has been conducted atLaurel Park.  Pressley Ridge Schools collected outcome data for 3years on youths discharged between July 1987 and June 1988.  PressleyRidge staffs were able to locate 14 of 17 youths 1 to 2 years afterdischarge and 12 of 17 youths 3 to 4 years after discharge fromLaurel Park to participate in this study.  Staff interviewed theyouths' probation officers, caseworkers, other Pressley Ridge staff,teachers, youths' families, and the youths themselves.  Three to 4years after discharge, some outcomes showed improvement compared to 1to 2 years after discharge, and others did not.  For example, 3 to 4years after discharge,  all 12 (100 percent) were living in a less restrictive setting     compared to 12 of 14 (86 percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge,  6 of 12 (50 percent) were either going to school or working     compared to 5 of 14 (36 percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge,  2 of 12 (17 percent) were using drugs compared to 4 of 14 (29     percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge,  6 of 12 (50 percent) had been involved in a physically aggressive     act compared to 5 of 14 (36 percent) 1 to 2 years after     discharge, and  4 of 12 (33 percent) had negative police contacts compared to 3 of     14 (21 percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge. While other Pressley Ridge programs that provide therapeutic fostercare, day school, or treatment in a wilderness setting showed betterresults than Laurel Park on several dimensions--such as school orwork status--a larger percentage of Laurel Park youths were livingwith their own family, with a foster family, or independently ontheir own.

In 1993, AFDC supported almost 5 million low-incomefamilies across the United States and was projected to cost over $26billion in federal and state funds in fiscal year 1995. Increasingly, concerns have centered on the rising number of teenagemothers, and particularly on the high public costs associated withtheir dependence on programs such as AFDC. The forces that place a young teen girl at serious risk of long-termwelfare receipt begin very early.  Recent reports have noted thepositive association between growing up in an adverse environment,such as an abusive family or an impoverished neighborhood, and futurecognitive, behavioral, and physical functioning.\1 However, thecurrent mix of education, health, and social support programs hasbeen unable to mitigate the effects of multiple family problems anddeteriorating neighborhoods on the children being raised in theseenvironments, particularly young teen girls.  While many federal,state, and local human service programs target at-risk children andtheir families, the programs are not configured and services are notdelivered in ways that maximize their impact on multiple familyproblems. Because of these concerns, you asked us for information about youngteen girls who may be at risk for AFDC dependency.\2 Specifically,our focus was the following:   describe the health and well-being of young at-risk teen girls and     their families, and the condition of the urban neighborhoods     where they live;  obtain the local service providers' perspectives on the needs of     these girls, how they are addressing those needs, and what     obstacles service providers face in working with the girls,     their families, and their communities; and  describe how the communities where these girls live are responding     to the service needs of this group. To develop this information, we reviewed the relevant literature,contacted experts on services for at-risk adolescents, analyzed datacollected by the Bureau of the Census, and conducted site visits inthree urban neighborhoods--Ward 7 in Washington, D.C.; Boyle Heightsin Los Angeles, California; and West Oakland in Oakland, California. In addition, we visited a community redevelopment project in Detroit,Michigan.  (A complete discussion of our methodology and descriptionsof the neighborhoods appear in apps.  I and II.) We did our work inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. --------------------\1 Starting Points:  Meeting the Needs of Our Youngest Children (NewYork:  Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994); and LosingGenerations:  Adolescents in High Risk Settings, National ResearchCouncil (Washington, D.C.:  National Academy Press, 1993). \2 For the purpose of this report, we defined young at-risk teengirls as those who (1) have poor general life circumstances (such aspoverty) or exhibit problematic behavior (such as early sexualactivity) that is associated with problems such as teen pregnancy orillegal drug use, and (2) generally fall into the age group of 10 to15 years old.    RESULTS IN BRIEF------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1The forces of poverty--eroding the foundations of individuals,families, and communities--can show some of their most debilitatingeffects on young at-risk teen girls.  Service providers in theneighborhoods we visited characterized many of the 10- to 15-year-oldgirls they serve as detached and isolated from their families andcommunities, sexually abused and neglected, and threatened byviolence.  A combination of poor economic and social conditions--(1)poverty and deteriorating neighborhoods, (2) dysfunctional families,and (3) poor self-image of the young teen girls themselves--hascreated a population of adolescents with multiple problems who havecharacteristics, such as early parenthood, associated with long-termpublic dependency. Generally, community service providers told us that services forat-risk girls aged 10 to 15 were limited, and the services that wereavailable were often provided after problems reached the crisisstage.  The services that did exist in the neighborhoods we visitedwere not coordinated, and they focused only on the teen and aspecific problem, ignoring, for example, the positive influence aparent could have and, conversely, the negative impact of adysfunctional family.  We also found that these girls (1) received alower level of services than other at-risk groups, (2) were offeredfew preventive services, and (3) had limited access to the array ofhealth and support services, provided in a safe environment, thatexperts agree are needed by young at-risk teen girls.  Communityservice providers told us that the services needed to address sexualabuse and exploitation, psychological and physical neglect, and drugand alcohol dependency were nonexistent, unknown or ignored by thosein need, or located far from neighborhoods. To better serve and reach more area residents, including young girls,some neighborhoods are organizing coalitions, led by local providers,often with assistance from private organizations and public agencies. In some cases, these efforts at integrating services have had apositive effect on neighborhood children.  Some providers, oftenworking in middle schools, have expanded their role in the communityto better integrate services for at-risk teens and their families. Providers working in these coalitions told us they believed theemergence of neighborhood leadership is critical to the long-termsuccess of the coalitions.  New service delivery strategies beingtried include identifying and providing multiple preventive servicesand activities, contacting parents or guardians and encouraging themto become involved in their children's activities, and increasing thecommunity's participation and commitment to the initiative.    BACKGROUND------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2There is growing concern among program providers and policymakersthat large numbers of our nation's adolescents--particularly younggirls between the ages of 10 and 15--are at great risk for a numberof problems including pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, and schoolfailure.  Many of these young teens live in poor neighborhoods.\3According to the 1992 Current Population Survey (CPS), there wereover 7 million girls under 18 years old living in poverty, with over2.5 million residing in poor neighborhoods.  In addition, as many ashalf of all adolescents aged 10 to 15 are reported to be at moderateor high risk of school failure, early sexual activity, drug andalcohol use, or criminal behavior.\4 Among the most far reaching andcostly of all negative outcomes for young at-risk girls is earlyparenthood.  In 1990, about 361,000 babies were born to unmarriedteenagers--approximately 9 percent of all births in that year.\5--------------------\3 A "poverty neighborhood" is defined as a census tract with apoverty rate of 20 percent or more based on the 1980 census. \4 At-Risk Youth, The Urban Institute Policy and Research Report,Vol.  23, No.  1 (Washington, D.C.:  Winter/Spring 1993). \5 Kids Count Data Book 1993:  State Profiles of Child Well-Being(Washington, D.C.:  Center for the Study of Social Policy, 1993).       TEEN BIRTHS RISING AND      COSTLY---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1From 1960 to 1992, the birth rate for all teens increased from 15.3to 44.6 births per thousand.  While the number of births to the veryyoung--aged 15 and younger--is not large, this group is experiencingthe greatest rate of increased births.\6 Pregnancy rates for allgirls under 15 years old rose 4.1 percent in the United States duringthe period between 1980 and 1988--higher than any other teen agegroup.  In addition, these young mothers often have othercharacteristics that are associated with long-term welfare dependencyand other long-term problems, such as deficient education andemployment skills and histories of child abuse and neglect. The public costs of teen mothers are high.  According to the mostrecent Census data available, nearly one-half of all women receivingAFDC from 1976 to 1992 were or had been teenage mothers (see fig. 1).  In addition, these women were more likely to be the leasteducated and have larger families, thus making them the least likelyto leave AFDC and become self-sufficient.\7 The Center for PopulationOptions estimated that in 1992 the federal government spent over $34billion on AFDC, Medicaid, and Food Stamps to support families begunby teens.

PAST PREVENTION PROGRAMS      HAVE SHOWN LITTLE SUCCESS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2Generally, teen pregnancy prevention projects have produced less thanencouraging results, whether programs were targeted to prevent teensfrom their first pregnancy or additional pregnancies.  For example,the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) reviewed pregnancyprevention programs that attempted to (1) increase teens' knowledgeabout reproduction, (2) improve access to contraceptives, or (3)broaden teens' life options.  OTA concluded that despite somepromising approaches, no evidence existed of significantly reducedpregnancy rates among teen girls when the approaches were appliedindependently. Intervening after teens have become sexually active or after theyhave given birth appears to be too late for positive impacts,regardless of the type of program.  For example, a nationaldemonstration project that provided education and employabilitydevelopment as well as other supportive services to teen mothers wasunsuccessful at reducing the rate of second pregnancies among teenmothers.  The developers of this effort recognized the difficulty ofovercoming "serious obstacles to advancement, some psychological innature, others related to dysfunctional families, dangerous schoolsand neighborhoods, and other factors in their social, physical, andeconomic environments."\8Historically, federal initiatives to address the individual problemsof youths, their families, and teen pregnancy have generally resultedin "single-problem" programs and reactive, crisis-oriented servicestrategies by local providers.  A Congressional Research Service(CRS) study concluded that some federal programs aimed at reducingthe incidence of teen pregnancy disagree on the federal role,resulting in a patchwork of differing goals ranging from promotingabstinence to encouraging the use of pregnancy planning amongsexually active teens.\9 Consequently, federal programs often supportlocal projects that target one of these goals at the exclusion ofothers. --------------------\8 New Chance:  Interim Findings on a Comprehensive Program forDisadvantaged Young Mothers and Their Children (New York:  ManpowerDemonstration Research Corporation, Sept.  1994). \9 Welfare Reform:  Adolescent Pregnancy Issues (CRS, 1994).    POOR, DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES   AND DETERIORATING NEIGHBORHOODS   IMPACT ON YOUNG AT-RISK TEEN   GIRLS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3In neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor families, many 10-to 15-year-old girls have multiple problems.  The combination ofabuse and neglect in young teens' households and dangerous anddecaying neighborhoods has increased the numbers of young teen girlswith the risk characteristics associated with long-term welfaredependency, education deficits, and early parenthood.  These girlsare growing up under circumstances that often compromise theirhealth, impair their sense of self, limit their developmentpotential, and generally restrict their chances for independent andproductive lives.       FAMILY ABUSE AND NEGLECT      LEAVE YOUNG TEEN GIRLS      ISOLATED AND VULNERABLE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1In the neighborhoods we visited, family poverty combined withparental substance abuse and sexual or physical abuse of childrenmakes growing up a significant challenge for many young girls.  Manyof the girls in these communities lived in households where theincome was below the poverty level.\10 In Washington, D.C.'s, Ward 7,for example, according to the 1990 census, 18 percent of thehouseholds were considered to be poor.\11 In addition, many of thegirls in the communities we visited lived in single-parenthouseholds, typically headed by their mothers.\12 These households,as characterized by providers, lacked parental supervision and leftyoung girls isolated from family members as well as from theirneighborhoods.  The principal of a middle school in West Oakland toldus that many of her female students' parents were abusing drugs oralcohol, and crime and violence proliferated in their neighborhoods;one or both parents were often absent; and many of the adults in thehomes did not have the skills and abilities to function as parents. Families living in poverty are stressed and constrained by the normalactivities of daily life, which can make parents and children feelhopeless and helpless.  In our interviews with service providers andour reviews of recent studies, we found (1) high rates of substanceabuse among the parents of young teen girls, (2) widespread physicaland sexual abuse of teen girls, and (3) many young girls that wereleft unattended for long periods of time and who often assumed adultresponsibilities in their homes. Factors associated with family dysfunction, such as substance abuse,were prevalent in all the communities we visited.  Nationally, ratesof drug and alcohol abuse among women living in poverty and AFDCrecipients, for example, have been estimated to range from more than15 percent to almost 30 percent.\13 Drug and alcohol abuse amongparents was seen as a widespread, serious problem by manyneighborhood providers, as well as by the young teen girlsthemselves.  For example, in the West Oakland neighborhood wevisited, the arrest rate for narcotics was more than double that forall of Oakland.  Boyle Heights in Los Angeles registered almost threetimes the rate of alcohol-related arrests as Los Angeles as a wholebetween 1991 and 1993.  The Ward 7 community was no different.  TheDirector of Recreation for Washington, D.C., said that many of theyoung girls the Department of Recreation serves witness daily alcoholand drug abuse. Physical and sexual abuse were also reported by community providersas significant problems.  In West Oakland, where the reported numberof sexual abuse incidents rose from 49 in 1992 to 91 in 1993, theAdolescent Family Life Director believed that as many as 65 percentof the young girls the office serves have been sexually abused.  Someproviders reported that young victims of abuse--characteristicallypassive, lacking self-esteem, and pressured into early sex byextended family members and older men--have few options or rolemodels and often follow what are seen as common practices in theirneighborhoods.  Providers in residential care facilities forparenting teens reported that most of their clients were victims ofabuse.  Recent research confirms their observations.  Studiesreported that as many as 68 percent of teen mothers were sexuallyabused as children.\14According to community providers, young girls are often unsupervisedor on their own for extended periods of time and essentiallyparenting themselves, which isolates them from their families andcommunities and makes them vulnerable to outside influences.  Localproviders believed that many of these girls become the functioningadult in the household and assume the responsibility of caring foryounger family members. --------------------\10 In 1993, the federal poverty level for a family of three was$11,521. \11 The city of Washington, D.C., is split into eight politicalwards. \12 Nationally, the percentage of children under 18 living with asingle parent rose from 12 percent in 1970 to 27 percent in 1993. More notable, however, is that of those children living with oneparent, the proportion of those living in a never-married householdrose from 24 percent in 1983 to 35 percent in 1993.

NEIGHBORHOODS OFTEN      DANGEROUS AND DECAYING---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2The condition of the neighborhoods where these girls live inducesfear and apprehension throughout the community.  Their high crimerate, deteriorating infrastructure, and scarcity of commercialventures threatens neighborhood children and provides them with fewpositive examples of future livelihoods.  The areas we visited alsohad high numbers of declining public and private residential housingunits.  Each of these areas started out as a vibrant section of thecity, but a variety of socioeconomic factors over time has causedthese areas to deteriorate, leaving vacant and dilapidated buildingsand reduced community resources.  (Fig.  2 contains photographs ofthe neighborhoods we visited.)Crime is an important contributor to the destruction of a community. Young teen girls in the neighborhoods we visited feared for theirsafety and saw few places of refuge.  In Boyle Heights, gang violenceis a serious problem.  Providers told us that the approximately 30gangs in the area had a membership of about 15,000.  In 1993, thepolice reported 763 gang-related crimes in the Boyle Heights areaalone.  Service providers told us that the teen girls in the area areat risk of joining gangs--one provider estimated that about 60percent of the teen girls are already in gang-related activities. Although gang-related crimes were not reported to be high inWashington, D.C., the homicide rate in 1993 for Ward 7 was more thandouble that for the whole city.  The girls we spoke with said thatthey feared going outside and preferred to stay at home.  One girltold us that she feels "paranoid .  .  .  wondering which way thebullet will go."The physical and economic infrastructure of the neighborhoods wevisited paralleled the social conditions.  The neighborhoods werecharacterized by high numbers of public housing units--Washington,D.C.'s Ward 7 had the highest concentration of public housing unitsin the city.  This neighborhood once had a solid middle-classresidential and small business presence.  Today, although the areacontinues to be residential with over 70,000 residents, 25.8 percentof the households were poor in 1990.  In addition, although the areaonce had a substantial number of small businesses and stores, it nowhas no restaurants, except for fast-food places, and fewopportunities for cultural activities.  Boyle Heights, once anaffluent suburb, is a mixture of aging commercial and industrialsections and subsidized housing.  West Oakland has no drug stores,banks, or major grocery stores to serve its more than 15,000residents. Figure 2: Neighborhoods GAO Visited (See figure in printed edition.) (See figure in printed edition.) YOUNG GIRLS IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AT RISK FOR MULTIPLE PROBLEMS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3The interplay of family poverty--often with parental substance abuseand child neglect and abuse--and neighborhoods with few resourcesleaves young teen girls at risk for many problems and dangerousbehaviors. Research studies and reviews have noted the relationshipbetween adverse living conditions and outcomes that seriously impedeteens' growth to self-sufficiency. Family poverty and parental dysfunction are associated with a numberof problems among the children in the household. First, therelationship between teen births and poverty is clear. Nearly halfof the AFDC caseload is made up of women who gave birth during theirteens, and these women are also less likely to have completed theirhigh school education. Their children are in poorer overall healthand can, as a result, suffer developmentally--increasing thelikelihood of poor school performance. Parental drug and alcoholabuse has been shown to significantly increase the odds that anadolescent will become a substance abuser. Likewise, research hasdemonstrated a relationship between a woman's being abused as a childand her becoming a teen mother. Neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor families generallyhave poor quality schools that, in addition to family economicstresses, increase the chance that children will fail in school ordrop out. Children in poor neighborhoods also run a high risk ofbecoming both victims and perpetrators of crimes. Compounding theproblem, because high numbers of youths and adults in thesecommunities exhibit negative and antisocial behavior, positivecommunity role models are scarce or absent. These distressedcommunities, with large numbers of children at risk, challenge thelimited number of service providers and the poorly coordinatedoverall system of care. COMPLEX NEEDS RARELY REFLECTED IN SERVICES FOR YOUNG TEEN GIRLS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4Communities with high numbers of young at-risk teen girls have hadlimited success in designing services and approaches that would helpthe most vulnerable of these young teens. The few services for thesegirls and their families are typically offered only when problemsreach the crisis state. Neighborhood residents see providers andservices open and close as funding appears and disappears. Providersbelieved that the services available generally ignore the positiverole a parent can play in a child's development, as well as thenegative impact of a dysfunctional family. Services designed to helpdysfunctional families, such as mental health and substance abusetreatment, are either in short supply or far from the neighborhoods. Many experts agree that young at-risk teen girls could be betterserved if traditional approaches were modified to include earlyidentification and treatment, long-term program commitment, andgreater community involvement. NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES NOT DESIGNED TO MEET MULTIPLE PROBLEMS OF AT-RISK TEENS---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1Many of the providers in the neighborhoods we visited said thatsupportive services were often provided too late and lackedcontinuity. Most of the human services available to at-risk teenswere crisis-oriented--provided only after a problem had occurred. For example, the schools in all communities we visited hadspecialized programs for teens who were either pregnant or alreadyparents of very young children. Oakland's school-based AdolescentFamily Life Program provided health and supportive services, parenteducation, job training, and counseling to teen girls under 17 years. However, to be eligible, a girl must be either pregnant or a parent. Providers saw the need for a more continuous approach to avoid earlyparenthood, such as offering early instruction and counseling orbeginning career orientation programs in primary school. Earlyinstruction and counseling is needed, they believed, because of theshortage of positive adult role models and the fact that these girlslive in neighborhoods that often condone dependency andsubmissiveness. In West Oakland, a middle school counselor told usthat any positive effects on young girls that a program supplyingmental health workers to an elementary school had were eroded whenthe program was not continued in high school. In addition, service providers cited a number of critical servicesneeded by young teen girls that were either scarce or nonexistent. These include preventive services, such as strategies to avoid earlysexual activity and pregnancy, resist drug use, and avoid gangmembership; after-school recreational activities in a safeenvironment; and ways to identify early signs of school failure. Acounselor at the Boyle Heights Boys and Girls Club saw young girls asthe "forgotten majority." As their performance in school falters orthey leave school because they are pregnant, they are barely missedby the community institutions, unlike the highly visible andsometimes violent young boy. Through our visits to neighborhoods andlocal inventories of existing services in those neighborhoods, wefound few service providers who offered preventive care to young teengirls. For example, in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, we found onlyone prevention program targeting young girls--Education Now andBabies Later. Safe and secure locations where young girls could findrecreational activities before and after school and on weekends werevery rare in these communities. Violent gang activity, especially inthe Boyle Heights neighborhood, where there are reportedly 30separate gangs, creates an environment of fear. Several of the youngteens we interviewed said that they felt unsafe walking in their ownneighborhood and often were afraid to come out of their home. FEW SERVICES OFFERED TO DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2In the neighborhoods we visited, the number and scope of mentalhealth services, including substance abuse treatment, supportiveservices designed to identify potentially abusive parents, andefforts to prevent abuse from occurring, fell far short of addressingthe communities' problems. According to providers, community-basedtreatment and prevention programs geared to dysfunctional families,especially those emphasizing mental health and substance abuseissues, were either not available, in short supply, or located farfrom the neighborhoods. Community service providers believe that family dysfunction adverselyaffects the growth and development of young teen girls and can leadto long-term dependency on public assistance. While providersreported the need for and lack of mental health services for theyoung girls in their communities, they also said that the parentsare, at best, not prepared for their role as a parent and, at worst,need clinical treatment themselves. Even when the programs exist, providers said that difficulty ingetting parents involved in their children's activities is asignificant barrier to serving at-risk teen girls. According toproviders, parents are often unaware of their children's activities;may condone early sexual activity and childbearing; and give littleattention and support to their children. Providers told us thatoften these characteristics are a function of long-standing andestablished patterns of parenting in the neighborhood and a generalsense of hopelessness in the community. For example, counselors froma West Oakland middle school estimated that "75 percent of themothers are not there for their children." In this school, childrenwere reluctant to have a day to honor their mothers, and preferred tohave their teachers attend. In about half the cases, according to amiddle school principal, by the time a young girl reaches middleschool, her household has dissolved and she is living with agrandparent.\15--------------------\15 In 1993, 5 percent of all children were living in a householdwith grandparents present (3.7 percent of white children, 12.1percent of black children, and 5.9 percent of Hispanic children). Ofthe households, 30 percent have only grandparents present--24.9percent of white households, 38.7 percent of black households, and22.8 percent of Hispanic households.. See Marital Status and LivingArrangements. ADOLESCENT SERVICES CAN IMPROVE WITH CHANGES IN APPROACH AND SCOPE---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3Research on the problems of adolescents and their service needs hasreached a number of conclusions about the best approaches to meetingthis population's multiple needs. For example, OTA's study onadolescent health--a comprehensive synthesis of the researchfindings--notes growing consensus on key components to successfulpreventive services for teens.\16 Recognizing along with otherresearchers that many adolescents' needs for health and relatedservices are not being met with mainstream primary care, OTAconcluded that school or community-based centers can offercomprehensive and accessible services. Others have joined inreexamining both programmatic and larger system strategies foraddressing the problems of at-risk teens generally and teen pregnancyprevention specifically. They concluded that certain programmaticchanges, moving toward a more comprehensive approach to care, canlead to greater success.\17 For example, the Urban Institute's reviewof program practices designed for at-risk adolescents cited thefollowing components for a successful program: early identification and intervention; long-term and consistent intervention; individualized attention, instruction, and counseling; emphasis on skills enhancement, life options, and vocational orientation; development of multiple channels of influence, including parents, churches, and community organizations; and service delivery in a safe physical environment.\18Techniques suggested by experts to better integrate communityservices include collocating multiple service providers, jointplanning among providers, and new local-level funding strategies.\19"System" changes involve trying new service delivery approaches andattempting to reduce conflicts among programs by removinginconsistencies in program rules and requirements. In our previouswork, we found that to accomplish these changes, public and privateservice agencies need to reorganize administrative structures aroundcommon populations or problems, use more flexible funding approaches,and create coordinated service planning at different levels ofgovernment.\20--------------------\16 Adolescent Health, Vols.

NEW SERVICE APPROACHES DEPEND ON INCREASED COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP AND INVOLVEMENT------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5A community's ability to address the problems of at-risk teen girlsdepends on more than a collection of programs and service providers. Residents and providers in the neighborhoods we visited are becomingincreasingly aware that a coordinated, integrated, and comprehensivenetwork of services is needed to address the problems of teen girls. To do this, neighborhoods may have to overcome deficiencies in theirown leadership and organization. Community service providers in the neighborhoods we visited viewedthe emergence of local leadership as an important ingredient in thedevelopment of new service strategies. They told us that identifyinglocal leaders to initiate community action, sustain communitysupport, and help residents gain control over their problems is keyto the organization of better services for young teen girls as wellas adolescents in general. In Ward 7, West Oakland, and Detroit, forexample, coalitions and networks of local service providers are beingdeveloped to improve the capacity to address community needs andproblems. Neighborhood coalitions can take various forms. Theneighborhoods we visited showed that these service coalitions can beinformal--a network consisting of frequent working relationshipsamong various providers; or they can be a formal, comprehensiveplanning and implementation effort that incorporates residents,merchants, service providers, and the area's public agencies. Throughout these cooperative efforts, similar themes shape theirgoals and objectives. Providers believed they have to workcollaboratively with local residents and businesses to deal with theneeds and problems of not only teen girls but also the families andthe communities as a whole. Most importantly, these communitiesrealized that the strategies and solutions to their problems mustcome from within. Local providers also found that they have to coordinate communityactivities with one another as well as with other entities in thecommunity. For example, providers in Detroit's North High Schoolneighborhood saw that they needed to link various activities in orderto address the needs and problems facing adolescents, their families,and the surrounding neighborhood. Through a major privatephilanthropic organization in Michigan, the Kellogg Foundation, acomprehensive 20-year planning and coordination effort was developedjointly by the foundation and local providers and residents. Otherefforts are more informal. For example, the Teen Life Choicesprogram in Washington, D.C., established monthly lunch meetings thatincluded many of the youth service providers in the community.\21These meetings served as a way to get neighborhood providers tobetter understand each other's services, activities, and programprocedures. Local providers are also leading efforts to build coalitions witharea schools as a strategy to deliver coordinated programs to theright age groups. In all the neighborhoods we visited, junior highor middle schools have emerged as major "catchments" for programsserving at-risk teen girls. For example, West Oakland's LowellMiddle School and Washington, D.C.'s Evans Junior High School areworking with nonprofit agencies to deliver case management-styleprograms in the schools to serve their teen populations. Oakland'sLowell Middle School provided on-site case management and supportservices for students and their families. These services includedindividual and family counseling, home visits, crisis intervention,and community service referrals. Also, a West Oakland middle schoolprincipal is planning a program to include students, parents, and thecommunity at large. The program would operate between 4:00 p.m. and10:00 p.m. and would provide a fitness lab, computer/job skillstraining, medical information, mental health services, and parentingcourses. Evans Junior High School's Turning Points program providedindividual counseling and group activities to students as well asattempted to include parents by developing adult activities andhiring parents as Turning Points staff. \22The collaborative school-based efforts we observed in Detroit andWest Oakland were achieving positive outcomes. A preliminaryevaluation by the University of California of school-based projectsin West Oakland identified successes in the start-up of theschool-based programs. These programs were seeing positive responsesfrom teachers and school officials as well as increased involvementfrom teens and their families. West Oakland found that these effortsreduced the number of discipline hearing procedures and the number ofsuspensions for students in schools receiving the services, whenthese students were compared with students in schools not receivingthe services. In Detroit, the community, along with the KelloggFoundation and Henry Ford Hospital, created a teen health clinicwithin Hutchins Middle School. The project reported a reduction inteen pregnancies from 14 in 1991 to 1 in 1993, immunization for allchildren in the school, and improved standardized achievement testscores over 2 years in both reading and math. Both the literature and neighborhood providers told us that key tothe development of any school-based program is the acceptance andapproval of the school's principal.\23Principals hold significant leverage over school curriculum andphysical space. In addition, school principals are well informedabout what is going on in school neighborhoods because theyparticipate in various neighborhood activities and coordinatingcouncils. Neighborhood providers and school officials we interviewedagreed that a program's success depends on the principal's acceptanceof it. In some cases, programs have to overcome the reluctance ofprincipals and teachers, who may try to "wait out" new initiatives. Providers told us that principals and school staff view new programsas politically motivated, claiming overly optimistic results, orrequiring school time and physical space that could crowd out otherprograms and curricula. --------------------\21 Teen Life Choices ceased operation on Octorber 1, 1994, as aresult of city budget cuts. \22 In February 1995, the Turning Points Program at Evans Junior HighSchool and 14 other middle and elementary schools in Washington,D.C., was eliminated as a result of the city's budget cuts. \23 School-Linked Human Services: A Comprehensive Strategy forAiding Students at Risk of School Failure (GAO/HRD-94-21, Dec. 30,1993); and The Future of Children: School-Linked Services, Volume 2,No. 1 (Los Altos, CA: The Center for the Future of Children, Davidand Lucille Packard Foundation, 1992). CONCLUSIONS------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6The conditions that surround many young at-risk teen girls, whichhave replaced the traditional supports provided by functioningfamilies and safe neighborhoods, have created a group of childrenwith few options for future success. These children are among themost vulnerable and least visible residents of our urban areas, andare extremely difficult to serve. Often last in line for servicesdelivered from a taxed and fragmented delivery system, at-risk teengirls--if left unserved--will continue to use scarce public resourcesand remain waiting to join the rolls of long-term welfare recipients. Individual programs alone, while well-intended and innovative intheir approaches, have had little effect on the overwhelming, complexproblems of this population. Community-designed and -directedinitiatives that coordinate human service programs have shown promisein some urban neighborhoods in attacking the broader influences thatplace the well-being of these children and their families at risk. These initiatives need to facilitate collaborative planning,problem-solving, and program development at the neighborhood level. The challenge for both policymakers and program officials is todevelop and implement national strategies that will support localleadership and at the same time foster cooperative ventures amonglocal service providers. ---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :6.1Because this report focuses on local responses to at-risk teens andtheir families, we did not obtain agency comments. We did discuss,as a part of our field work, our observations with local providersand program officials. We are sending copies of this report to relevant congressionalcommittees and other interested parties. Copies will also be madeavailable to others upon request.

Other majorcontributors are listed in appendix III. Sincerely yours,Jane L. RossDirector, Income Security IssuesSCOPE AND METHODOLOGY=========================================================== Appendix ITo develop the information for this report, we collected and reviewedthe literature on adolescent health and service approaches to at-riskteens. In addition, we reviewed studies on teen pregnancy andprevention and analyzed data collected by the Bureau of the Census. We also contacted program officials from federal agencies andrepresentatives from organizations who were familiar with thispopulation and its service needs. We visited three urban neighborhoods for close review--Ward 7 inWashington, D.C.; Boyle Heights in Los Angeles, California; and WestOakland in Oakland, California--to document the availability of humanservices for at-risk teen girls; the barriers to serving thispopulation; and how communities are responding to this population'sservice needs. We selected these neighborhoods because they had (1)high numbers of at-risk teens who had characteristics such as highrates of poverty, teen births, and crime; and had (2) some servicesfor young adolescents. In addition, we visited a communitydevelopment program in Detroit, Michigan, that was supported by aprivate foundation. We interviewed local officials, serviceproviders, and young teen girls served by service providers toidentify the programs and problems in these neighborhoods. We didour work between September 1993 and December 1994 in accordance withgenerally accepted government auditing standards. PROFILES OF THE THREENEIGHBORHOODS REVIEWED========================================================== Appendix II BOYLE HEIGHTS, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1Boyle Heights, located east of downtown Los Angeles, is one of theoldest communities in the city. Since the 1940s, Boyle Heights hasbeen populated by first-, second-, and third-generation families ofpredominantly Mexican heritage. The community has become animportant point of entry for thousands of new immigrants since the1970s. Boyle Heights has a population of over 94,000, and 94 percentare of Hispanic origin. The majority of the area's housing was built in the 1920s. Singlefamily houses compose 43 percent of the residential area. Six of the21 public housing projects in Los Angeles are located in BoyleHeights, which include 2,166 units for about 8,300 residents. Commercial and industrial corridors in the area were developed in the1920s and 1930s and currently include clothing and fabricated metalproduction. The predominant retail trade businesses are restaurants,groceries, and clothing stores. Almost 70 percent of the households are low income, and the area hasa poverty rate of about 30 percent, compared with a citywide rate of19 percent. In 1990, the unemployment rate was almost 14 percent, 8percent citywide. Approximately 3,000 of the area's 14,500school-age children are in AFDC households, and the area has the 11thhighest number of children receiving free and reduced-price meals inLos Angeles County. The crime rate in Boyle Heights is higher than in the city as awhole, with homicide at almost twice that of all of Los Angeles;1991-93 averages were 13 homicides per 10,000 versus 7 per 10,000 forthe whole city. Gang violence is a serious problem. Local providersestimate that about 30 gangs operate in the Boyle Heightsneighborhood. According to Los Angeles Police Department data, 763gang-related crimes were committed in the district covering BoyleHeights in 1993.

Neighborhoodconditions began to deteriorate after World War II, when houses builtfor wartime workers were torn down as defense-related jobs dwindled. Also, large public construction projects, such as the CypressFreeway, a Bay Area Rapid Transit station, and a main postalfacility, displaced families, destroyed homes, and separatedcommercial activity from the neighborhood. Since the 1970s, theneighborhood has been unable to regain the local businesses it oncehad--the neighborhood has no drug stores, banks, or major grocerystores. West Oakland has 12 public housing projects and one of the city'shighest concentrations of Section 8 housing assistance recipients. In addition, 39 percent of all housing units in West Oakland areassisted housing, in contrast to 10 percent for the entire city ofOakland. West Oakland has poverty and unemployment rates that far exceed thoseof Oakland as a whole. About 34 percent of West Oakland residentslive in poverty, almost double the city average of 19 percent. Moreover, more than half (55 percent) of the youths living in WestOakland are poor, compared with 30 percent citywide. West Oakland is a dangerous neighborhood. West Oakland's crime ratesexceed those in the rest of the city, with a homicide rate that ismore than double the citywide average, and rape and burglary ratesthat are almost 150 percent higher.

Although it was never among thewealthiest of the District's communities, Ward 7 once had a solidbase of middle-class families, as well as a substantial number ofsmall businesses and retail establishments. However, theout-migration of many middle-income families and businesses, whichbegan in the 1970s, has helped to destabilize the ward. Ward 7 has the highest concentration of public housing stock in thecity, one-third of the city's total stock--or about 2,880 units. In1990, Ward 7 had a population of about 73,000, as compared with over86,000 in 1980. The neighborhood in Ward 7 we visited had about43,000 residents. Over 25 percent of the Ward's residents live inpoverty. In contrast, about 17 percent of the total Washington,D.C., population lives in poverty. Forty-six percent of theneighborhood's 32,473 adult residents (16 and older) were either notin the labor force or not employed. Nearly 5,300 families, or 67 percent of the Ward's families withchildren, were headed by a single parent. Further, 26 percent of itspopulation was under 18 years of age in 1990. About 20 percent ofall births in the neighborhood were to females under age 20. In 1993, the Ward 7 neighborhood accounted for 64, or about 14percent, of the city's 453 homicides and 11 percent of the reportedrapes that occurred in the city. Figure II.3: Ward 7, Washington, D.C.

It contains material on the nature, scope andextent of organized crime, particularly as it relates to drugtrafficking, money laundering, and labor racketeering. The President's Commission on Organized Crime The President's Commission on Organized Crime was establishedby Executive Order 12435 July 28, 1983. The Executive Orderdirects the Commission to: Make a full and complete national and region-by-region analysis of organized crime; Define the nature of traditional organized crime as well as emerging organized crime groups, the sources and amounts of organized crime's income, and the uses to which organized crime puts its income; Develop in-depth information on the participants in organized crime networks; Evaluate Federal laws pertinent to the effort to combat organized crime; Advise the President and the Attorney General with respect to its findings and actions which can be undertaken to improve law enforcement efforts directed against organized crime; Make recommendations concerning appropriate administrative and legislative improvements and improvements in the administration of justice; and Report to the President from time to time as requested, and to submit its final report by March 1, 1986. The Commission is authorized to issue subpoenas for thetestimony of witnesses and the production of information, toissue orders compelling testimony over a claim of the privilegeagainst self-incrimination, and to seek the assistance of theDepartment of Justice in applying for writs of habeas corpus adtestificandum or judicial orders requiring testimony or theproduction of information before the Commission. In addition, theCommission may obtain, use, and disclose electronic surveillancedata obtained by law enforcement agencies under Title III of theOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and otherinformation from Federal departments and agencies under the BankSecrecy Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as well as fromfinancial institutions under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Commission hasprepared this report on organized crime's role in drugtrafficking and drug abuse. Based on the totality of the evidencebefore it, the Commission has concluded that drug trafficking andabuse together constitute the single most serious organized crimeissue confronting this Nation. Therefore, in contrast to the other subjects covered in theremainder of it's final report, this topic is treated in aseparate volume. The research and drafting on this report wasperformed on the Commission's behalf by Chief Investigator ManuelGonzalez (FBI). Research assistants Abigail Johnson and MaryKarol, Deputy Counsel Kevin McEnery, Investigator Thomas Sheehan(DEA), and Contract Consultant Susan Mellody, under thesupervision of Deputy Executive Director Rodney G. Smith.

The drug trade generates billions of dollarsfor organized crime each year, imposing incalculable costs onindividuals, families, communities, and governments worldwide.But drug trafficking is only part of a broader, unifiedphenomenon, which also includes the illicit use of drugs. It isdrug users who finance organized crime through their drugpurchases, and it is they who must accept responsibility for thebroad range of costs associated with the drug industry. Drug abuse ruins individual lives, drains billions of dollarseach year from American society, and erodes the nation's qualityof life. The violence and corruption that are an integral part oforganized crime drug trafficking take the lives of American andforeign officials and private citizens, undermine drug controlefforts, and threaten entire governments. To the extent that thestability of friendly nations is threatened, particularly in thishemisphere, our own national security is jeopardized. The impactof organized crime and drug trafficking on society thus hasfar-ranging consequences, from the mental or physical destructionof the individual drug user to questions of national security. This Commission has found drug trafficking to be the mostwidespread and lucrative organized crime activity in the UnitedStates. According to this Commission's survey of local lawenforcement agencies, marijuana, cocaine, and dangerous drugtrafficking are the three primary activities of organized crimegroups, as defined by local agencies, nationwide. Drugtrafficking accounts for almost 38 percent of all organized crimeactivity across the country and generates an income estimated tobe as high as $110 billion. A concept fundamental to this report is the dual nature of thedrug phenomenon: drug supply and drug demand are mutuallydependent aspects of a single global problem. All strategic andtactical evaluations in this report have been arrived at in thiscontext, and it is imperative that the planning undertaken bythis government and its allies be performed within the sameframework. The gaps that now exist between strategists who seekto reduce supply and planners who want to reduce demand must beclosed. The situation confronting us is a crisis both nationallyand internationally. Our response can be no less than nationaland international mobilization. As this report sets out indetail, the menace of drugs is not restricted to a particularsegment of society, but is now of a scope and severity that is athreat to our national security and therefore a legitimatenational security issue. The appropriate response must therefore involve our entiresociety, not just our law enforcement and health professionals.Parents, educators, employers, the legal profession, financialinstitutions, the military, and the diplomatic and intelligencecommunities must all recognize that we are in a nationalemergency. Military strategists have warned and painful nationalexperience confirmed that a war must not be fought without aclear notion of the victory sought. In this war on drugs - aphrase worn by use but nevertheless the only accurate descriptionof what must be done - this Commission has adopted a definitionof victory: the dramatic reduction, if not complete elimination,of drug abuse in this society. The ultimate goal is a distantone, to be sure, requiring patience, determination and vision. Noless an objective is acceptable. Short fixes, compromises, andresignation are a breach of faith with ourselves, our children,and generations to come. Just as we must clearly define victory, so must we identifythe enemy. Here again, there is no room for compromise. We mustunite against drugs themselves, and anyone who is their ally.Producers, refiners, smugglers, and sellers, all those we know as"traffickers," are obvious targets. It is ourobligation to look further and recognize that those among us -friends, relatives, colleagues, and other "respectable"people - whose small, personal drug purchases at the base of theconsumption pyramid are the driving force behind the traffickers'assault on this country. It is the consumer's dollars that cometogether to finance the organized crime drug traffickingdescribed in this report, and it is thus their responsibility andours to confront this truth. This means an end to tolerance ofdrug use at every level of society. While all drug trafficking, by its nature, requires somedegree of organization, it is essential for the purposes of thisreport to identify the threshold at which the organizationinherent in drug trafficking can be distinguished from organizedcrime drug trafficking. The Commission's definition of organizedcrime, which sets out the six characteristics of organized crimegroups, is helpful in making this distinction. Thesecharacteristics are: continuity, structure, defined membership,criminality, violence, and power as its goal. These elements,together with a reliance on the "buffer" that thisCommission has found to be an integral part of organized crime,are common to the world's most notorious traffickingorganizations. This report examines the organized crime groups that trafficin illicit drugs. To the extent necessary to grasp the dynamicsof worldwide drug traffic, it also details the nature of thedrugs themselves. It describes the array of enforcement agenciescurrently in place, analyzes their various strategies andtactics, and presents specific recommendations for more effectiveanti-drug efforts. In the portion of this report devoted to efforts to reduce thesupply of illicit drugs, "Supply Strategies," it isclear that our law enforcement and other government agencies,particularly on the Federal level, are deployed with a degree ofdetermination, imagination, and resource commitment unparalleledin American history. This government must continue to pursuestrategies to reduce supply with all possible vigor, or it is thegovernment's obligation to do all within its power to protect itscitizens, no matter how formidable the foe. Nevertheless, if thedemand for illicit drugs continues at its present voraciouslevel, improvements in the area of reducing supply will continueto be slow, expensive, infrequent, and too often only temporary. This report places great emphasis on the need for completenational resolve in this area and for that resolve to betranslated into fully coordinated governmental action.Compartmentalization and parochialism, which have been far toocommon in past efforts, must be brought to an end. In thisregard, we are at a particularly propitious moment in history.The slow and painful evolution of our strategy has finallyachieved a centralized authority for our national effort: theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Not just another advisorybody, this Board is a true congregation of every component of ournational government's anti-drug effort. It provides the means forachieving a thoroughly coordinated national attack on everyaspect of drug trafficking and abuse. It is vital that the PolicyBoard move effectively, thoughtfully and decisively, but it ismost urgent that it move. Indecisiveness are signals inthemselves, the wrong signals, to drug traffickers, users,concerned parents, health and social planners, and even foreigngovernments. Perhaps most critically, indecisiveness and delayare the wrong signals to those U.S. governmental agencies thatmust choose where anti-drug efforts will fall on the list ofcompeting priorities in a time of hardening fiscal austerity. Byaction, not mere promises, the Policy Board must send the propermessage: we are in a fight for our lives, and every agency mustarrange its priorities accordingly. Our strategies to reduce supply will require not onlydedication, but patience and objectivity. The war against drugswill not be won until individuals stop using them. Strategies toreduce supply can do no more than hold the line against illegaldrugs while public attitudes and private choices change. That isnot to say that our enforcement strategies should not beaggressive and persistent. On the contrary, this report makesclear that there is much in this area that is being done andshould continue, and much more that might be done. Many of thespecific recommendations in this report are devoted to thistheme. What is necessary at the outset, however, is anunderstanding that such efforts must not be judged by anunrealistic standard. As long as this society is willing toprovide its enforcement agencies scarcely more than a penny forevery dollar our citizens squander on illicit drugs, it has noright and no reason to expect more. Ultimately, the curse of drug abuse will be broken, but onlyby a nationwide dedication to persistent and unyielding assaultson both supply and demand. The supply is already under siege byour enforcement, diplomatic, and intelligence communities.Because an end to consumption is our ultimate goal, it is aconcerted and direct attack on demand that must be mounted. Illicit drugs are an attack upon the integrity, character, andhealth of the individual. Although discussions of drugs are oftenframed in terms of costs to society and society's responses, thefact is that individuals, not societies, take drugs. It is theindividual user who finances all of the violence, corruption, anddegradation that this report describes. The powerful,sophisticated, and thoroughly evil organized crime drugtrafficking groups described herein are a reflection of nothingmore than our self-destructiveness. It is as a result ofindividual acts of will that such groups came to be and aresustained, and it is by individual acts of will that they willfinally be defeated.

In the past scientists made a clear distinctionbetween physical and psychological drug dependence, but thehealth and social consequences of cocaine use have demonstratedthat the two courses lead to the same end: cocaine, like otheraddictive drugs, ruins lives and kills. Widely available acrossthe United States, cocaine is now used by individuals of allsocioeconomic groups. The cocaine industry generates an estimated$11 billion in illicit income annually, and it is growing.Cocaine production, importation to the United States andconsumption have all increased significantly in recent years. Thecocaine industry is fueled by the approximately 25 millionAmericans who have tried cocaine, of which five to six millionuse it at least once per month. Of the regular users, it isestimated that almost half may be considered addicted. Althoughthe total number of users appears to have leveled off in the lastfew years, cocaine consumption has increased 12 percent between1983 and 1984, from 50-68 metric tons to 55-76 metric tons. Ascocaine consumption has increased, so too have more dangerousforms of use of the drug and the deleterious effects associatedwith it. Cocaine-related deaths increased 77 percent from 1983 to1984 and cocaine-related emergency room visits increased 51percent. Requests for treatment for cocaine use have increased600 percent during the past three years. In 18 states, cocaine isreported as the primary drug of abuse for clients in treatmentfacilities. There is no indication that without a comprehensiveeffort at reduction of both the supply of and demand for cocaine,the increases in cocaine use or its deleterious medical andsocial effects will subside in the near future. From a lawenforcement perspective, the consequences of this tolerance andaddiction are the intense, steady and increasing demand for theproduct, which generates vast revenues for organized crime.Today's Cocaine User The cocaine industry is sustained by the appetite of thecocaine user. With the possible exception of marijuana, cocaineis used by a wider demographic cross-section of society than anyother controlled substance. Facts demonstrate that the popularbelief that cocaine use is restricted to the wealthy is a myth.For example, a study of 6,406 males arrested for serious crimesand processed in New York City's Manhattan Central Booking policeoffice in 1984 reveals that 42 percent tested positively forcocaine in their system, the drug most frequently detected. Theuse of cocaine in combination with other drugs appears to beincreasing. Fifty-nine percent of the cocaine-related deaths in1984 involved other drugs, particularly alcohol, heroin and PCP.In addition, more dangerous routes of cocaine administration arenow being used. Use of "speedballs," injections ofheroin and cocaine, which are often lethal, increased 37 percentfrom 1983 to 1984. Smoking of coca paste and base, forms ofconsumption with particularly dangerous health consequences, havealso increased. Surveys of cocaine users demonstrated there is no"typical" cocaine user. Results of a 1983 survey ofcallers to the national 800-COCAINE hotline indicate that theaverage caller was a 31-year old, white, middle class male withat least some college education and a job with an annual salaryexceeding $25,000. Results of the 1985 survey of callers to thehotline reveal that more women, minorities and adolescents calledthan just two years earlier, and 73 percent of callers in 1985reported an income of less than $25,000 per year. While almosthalf of the calls to the hotline in 1983 came from the northeast,calls were fairly evenly geographically distributed in 1985. Justas it has spread geographically and to different socioeconomicgroups, cocaine use has increased among certain age groups. Mostalarmingly, an increase in adolescent use of cocaine has beenreported in the 1984 and 1985 surveys of drug use among highschool seniors. The surveys found that current use of cocaineamong respondents climbed from 4.9 percent in 1983 to 5.8 percentin 1984, and to 6.7 percent 1985. According to the surveys,annual and lifetime use of cocaine also increased. HealthConsequences of Cocaine Use One reason that use of cocaine is sowidespread is because of the properties of the drug itself.Cocaine is derived from the leaves of the coca plant(Erythroxylon coca) and has been identified by Dr. Donald IanMacDonald, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and MentalHealth Administration, as one of the most powerfully addictivesubstances known to man. Cocaine is a stimulant traditionallyused to produce euphoria. Other initial effects, however,typically include excitation, increased alertness, insomnia, lossof appetite, increased heart rate, increased respiration andincreased blood pressure after even one use. Death can alsoresult from first time use as discussed below. Repeated use ofcocaine can cause chronic fatigue, convulsions, depression,irritability, loss of sex drive, memory problems, nasal bleeding,paranoia, severe headaches, increased body temperature and death.These symptoms are neither theoretical nor infrequent. Chroniccocaine use causes tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and addiction.Tolerance is evidenced by the fact that chronic cocaine usersneed to increase their dosage of cocaine to achieve the sameeffects as lower dosages. As dosage increases, the effect ofcocaine use become more pronounced. According to cocaineresearcher Dr. Reese T. Jones, "The existence of a truewithdrawal syndrome following cocaine use seems compelling."This syndrome includes "depression, social withdrawal,craving, tremor, muscle pain, eating disturbance,encephalographic changes and changes in sleep patterns." The addictive nature of cocaine and its toxicity have beendocumented in both animal studies and human experience. Accordingto the results of a study reported in the July 5, 1985 issue ofthe Journal of the American Medical Association, 90 percent ofrats self-administering cocaine intravenously died within 30days, while the mortality rate for rats self-administering heroinwas only 36 percent. The study found that rats using cocaine lostup to 47 percent of their body weight, ceased grooming themselvesand deteriorated in general health. Several rats experiencedseizures, but immediately self-administered more cocaine afterthe cessation of convulsions. The study concludes that in regardto human cocaine use: As the intake of cocaine increases and theconcentration of this compound becomes greater (through theavailability of higher-purity drugs, by IV injections or by'free-basing') the number of fatalities associated with cocaineabuse is likely to increase. Hundreds of fatalities each year areassociated with cocaine use. According to Dr. Mark Gold, directorof research at Fair Oaks Hospital in New Jersey: "We have noway of predicting who'll die from the drug and who won't. Itcould be a regular user or it could be a first-time user."Although overdose is the primary cause of cocaine deaths, deathcan also result after a regular cocaine user takes the sameamount of the drug that he usually takes. This phenomenon isknown as "kindling" and is not well understood byscientists. According to Miami's Deputy Chief Medical ExaminerDr. Charles Wetli, "What was a safe dose one day becomes afatal dose the next." The precise cause of cocaine-relateddeaths, regardless of dosage, include respiratory failure,cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrest or seizures. Because cocaineincreases blood pressure and heart rate, individuals withcardiovascular problems are at particular risk. Cocaine'stendency to induce convulsions also creates special risks forepileptics. Death by cocaine is often preceded by anxiety,hallucinations, high body temperature and seizures. One commonmyth about cocaine is that addiction and death cannot result fromintranasal use, or "snorting," which is the most commonroute of administration. While cocaine deaths are usuallyassociated with intravenous use, coroners have documented casesof death from intranasal use of cocaine. One particular dangerassociated with intravenous use of cocaine, or any drug, isinfection. Hepatitis and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome(AIDS) have both been associated with intravenous drug use.Cultivation The cultivation, refinement and trafficking necessaryto bring cocaine from the fields of South America to the streetsof the United States obviously requires organization. Coca bushesare grown primarily in the South American countries of Peru,Bolivia and Colombia. The plants are first harvested as early as18 months after planting, and can usually be harvested from threeto four times annually for up to 20 years. The cultivation ofcoca has increased significantly in recent years, primarily as aresult of the cultivation of new coca plants and the maturationof previously existing coca plants. Notwithstanding increased lawenforcement pressure in Colombia, the tremendous profitsassociated with cocaine trafficking have encouraged the spread ofcoca cultivation throughout the region. Processing In arelatively simple chemical process, coca leaves are convertedfirst to cocaine paste, then base, then cocaine hydrochloride(HCl), the form of coca most commonly abused in this country. Theconversion of leaf to paste to base usually occurs near thecultivation site. The dried leaves are first moistened in analkaline solution and then soaked in kerosene. The kerosene isremoved leaving a cocaine precipitate. This in turn is filtered,producing a paste. The paste is dissolved in a solution ofsulfuric acid and then potassium permanganate. This mixture isthen filtered, ammonium hydroxide is added and the precipitatethat forms is coca base. Traditionally, base has been smuggledout of Peru and Bolivia by small aircraft or boats to Colombia,where most of the refining from base to HCl takes place. Innumerous cocaine laboratories in the jungles of Colombia, cocabase is transformed into pure cocaine HCl by adding ether andacetone, and filtering this mixture, which is then dried. Toproduce one kilo of pure cocaine, approximately 500 kilos of cocaleaves are needed. The pattern of processing and transshipment issomewhat different from that of cultivation. In the area ofrefining and smuggling cocaine, it is estimated that 75 percentof the drug available in the United States comes from Colombia,15 percent from Bolivia, 5 percent from Peru and 5 percent fromEcuador, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. However, these figures aresubject to frequent changes because of the mobility of drugtraffickers. For example, while most of the conversion to HCltakes place in Colombia, and other South American countries, anincreasing number of cocaine laboratories are being seized in theUnited States. Six such laboratories were seized here in 1982, 11in 1983, 21 in 1984 and 25 during the first half of 1985. Reasonsfor this trend include increased law enforcement in Colombia andthe increasing cost of ether and acetone in Colombia. The cost ofthese chemicals has increased as a result of controls imposed bythe Colombian government on their importation and sale and aconcerted effort initiated by the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration to disrupt the supply of chemicals essential inthe cocaine refinement process. A 55-gallon drum of ether nowcosts approximately $7,000 in South America, while the sameamount costs only $500 to $600 in the United States. Further,acetone and ether are widely available for commercial purposes inthe United States, making control of their illicit use much moredifficult than it has been in South America. Heroin Scope of the Problem Traditionally viewed as the "hardest drug," heroin'sreputation is well-earned. Although there are fewer heroinaddicts than users of other illicit drugs, more deaths andemergency room visits are associated with heroin than with anyother drug. Heroin's "worst drug" status has alsodeveloped because of the crime generally associated with heroinuse, a stereotype of the heroin addict as an inner-city streetdweller who commits crimes as his sole means of support, the factthat heroin is most often used intravenously, the dramaticaddiction and withdrawal symptoms associated with use of thedrug, and the relatively quick and generally lethal effects of aheroin overdose. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates there were490,000 heroin addicts and users in 1981. It is estimated thatthousands more individuals use heroin occasionally, but are notincluded in this number. While the addict population has remainedrelatively steady since 1979, indicators of heroin consumptionand effects have increased in recent years. Annual heroin-relateddeaths reached 1,046 in 1984, a 31 percent increase from 1983.Emergency room visits involving heroin use increased 55 percentfrom 1981 to 1984, with 10,901 such visits in 1984. Thisrepresents a decrease from the 11,028 emergency room visits in1983. Estimated heroin consumption increased 55 percent from 1981to 1984, with 5.97 metric tons of heroin consumed in 1984. As aresult of increased heroin purity and increased use of the drugin combination with other drugs, the number of heroin addicts andthe number of deaths and emergency room visits associated withheroin use should be expected to increase. Heroin is thus an extremely valuable commodity for organizedcrime: in fact, an ounce of pure heroin is approximately tentimes more expensive than an ounce of gold. Heroin users provideorganized crime with billions of dollars each year: it isestimated that illegal income from heroin sales in the UnitedStates totaled $6.12 billion in 1982. The Heroin Addict Historically, data collection and law enforcement experiencesupport the view that heroin use has been an urban phenomenon,confined in large part to minority populations. One recent studyof black inner-city heroin users across the country suggests theextent of heroin's grip in those areas: Because of the regular availability of heroin and thestructure of the relationship of intercity residents to society,the heroin lifestyle has become firmly established as analternative lifestyle for Black youngsters. Such studies typically reveal a portrait of the heroin addictas an unemployed, minority male with little education who commitscrime to support his habit: A 1985 study of heroin users in Eastand Central Harlem found the following: 75 percent were male; 55percent were black and 44 percent Hispanic; 36 percent were under30 years of age; 61 percent had less than 11 years of education;and 81 percent were unemployed. The annualized crime rate forthese heroin users was 1,075 crimes per person. Crimes committedby heroin addicts includes property crime, violent crime and drugoffenses. While regular use of heroin is generally addictive, thereappears to be a group of users, known as "chippers,"who are able to use heroin occasionally over a long period oftime without becoming addicts. In his study of heroin, StanfordUniversity professor John Kaplan maintains: It is now clear that there exists a sizable population ofnon-addicted but regular heroin users who seem well integratedinto society and in many ways indistinguishable from the rest ofthe population. Recently a new group of heroin users has emerged that includesboth addicts and non-addicts. These are the "middleclass" users, who are involved with heroin as a result oftheir cocaine habits. In order to counteract the effects of heavycocaine use, many began to use heroin intranasally, andeventually became addicted to the drug. Dr. Forest Tennant,director of a number of drug abuse clinics in the Los Angelesarea, observes: As cocaine use increases, we're seeing more addicts becauseheroin is the strongest neutralizer around for cocaine toxicity .. . And we're not talking about gang members and derelicts. I'mtreating people who pay their union dues, go to the PTA, taketheir kids to Little League. We've even got a program forexecutives. Health Effects of Heroin Use While narcotics serve an essential medicinal purpose asanalgesics, or painkillers, they are often abused. Heroin, themost abused opiate, is derived from the opium poppy (Papaversomniferum). Heroin is generally used intravenously, the mostefficient and dangerous route of administration."Speedballs," injections of heroin mixed with cocaine,are particularly dangerous. Heroin can also be usedsubcutaneously, called "skin-popping." All of theseintravenous forms of use are associated with AIDS and hepatitis,as discussed earlier. In addition, heroin can be smoked or usedintranasally. Heroin is a particularly dangerous drug because of the easewith which a user can overdose, A lethal dose of heroin is only10 to 15 times a normal dose. According to Dr. Donald C. ThomasIII, former director of emergency care at the District ofColumbia General Hospital: Heroin numbs you to pain, gives you a euphoria, takes you awayfrom reality, makes you slower and changes appetites . . . Thereal problem for an addict is that the threshold between the doseof heroin that gives that effect, as opposed to the dose thatwill kill him by suppressing respiratory or cardiac centers inhis brain, is very narrow. Multiple overdose deaths sometimes result from one"batch" of heroin. In March 1985, for example,according to local press accounts, 8 people died and 14 werehospitalized in a few days in Washington, D.C., after injectingsome particularly potent heroin. Seven months earlier, 10 peopledied in Washington within 8 days in a similar incident. It isstriking evidence of the drug's overpowering influence that thisrisk of sudden death apparently poses no deterrent to theseasoned user. As expressed by one heroin addict: A true, full-blown drug addict would follow a morgue wagon toits origin of overdose to obtain that substance. Cultivation Heroin entering the United States is produced from opiumpoppies, which are harvested in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan(Southwest Asia, the Golden Crescent); Burma, Thailand and Laos(Southeast Asia, the Golden Triangle); and Mexico. In 1984, anestimated 51 percent of United States heroin came from SouthwestAsia, 32 percent from Mexico and 17 percent from Southeast Asia. From 1983 to 1984 illicit opium production decreased inSouthwest Asia. This change resulted from decreased figures foropium production in Afghanistan caused by adverse weatherconditions and a change in the methodology used to estimate opiumproduction in Afghanistan. While total opium production forSouthwest Asia decreased in 1984, significant productionincreases were noted in Southeast Asia and Mexico. Opium poppy cultivation has begun to appear in the UnitedStates as well. During a Federal raid in August 1985, more than4,000 opium plants were discovered in Vermont, Washington,Michigan and California. Although officials of the DrugEnforcement Administration believe this opium was used forsmoking, the potential for domestic heroin production exists. While America's heroin addict population has remainedrelatively stable, the problem of heroin addiction in Europe hasincreased significantly in recent years. According to a 1984United Nations report: The drug abuse and trafficking situation in Western Europe isgrim and deteriorating . . . Western Europe remains seriouslyaffected by heroin abuse which is a major public health problem. The number of heroin addicts in the opium producing and othercountries is also significant. There is a greater sense of the need for internationalcooperation on the problem of drugs, in part because drugproducing nations are now feeling the effects of drug abuse, withwhich the industrialized world has dealt for decades. Thisdevelopment is critical if drug control efforts, including croperadication, interdiction and drug education, are to besuccessful. Processing The production of heroin begins after the petals of the opiumpoppy flower have fallen. Several incisions are then made in theseed pod from which sap oozes. The sap dries, darkens and becomesgummy, and is scraped from the pod. This dried sap is raw opium.Each pod can be incised up to five different times. To produce one kilogram of heroin, a precipitating agent isadded to 10-12 kilograms of opium. This mixture is pressed,leaving one kilogram of morphine base. This base is treated withacetic anhydride, which yields one kilogram of heroin. In anotherproduction method, poppies are allowed to mature and dry.Alkaloids are then extracted from these plants leaving poppystraw concentrate, which is sold in a brownish powder form. Marijuana Scope of the Problem According to the most recent National Survey on Drug Abuse,which was conducted in 1982, 50-60 million Americans,approximately 20-25 percent of the entire population, have triedmarijuana; and 20 million people use the drug at least once permonth. Marijuana use has been widespread in this country for thelast two decades. Both the number of users and the duration ofmarijuana's popularity indicate that marijuana use is firmlyentrenched in American society. Although some surveys indicate that the number of marijuanausers has been declining recently, levels of use remainsignificantly higher than for any other illicit drug. TheNational Survey on Drug Abuse indicates a decline in marijuanause for some age groups. Yet the survey shows that in 1982, 11.5percent of 12-17-year-olds and 27 percent of 18-25 year olds usedmarijuana at least once per month. The study indicates a slight,but steady, increase in marijuana use among people over age 25.In 1977, 3.3 percent reported monthly marijuana use, comparedwith 6.0 percent in 1982. According to the survey of high schoolseniors conducted each year by the University of MichiganInstitute for Social Research, marijuana use among high schoolseniors peaked in 1978, when 37 percent of these studentsreported monthly use of marijuana and 11 percent reported dailyuse of the drug. By 1984 these figures had dropped to 25 percentand 5 percent respectively. However, this decline in marijuanause ended in 1985 when 26 percent of the survey respondentsreported monthly marijuana use. Marijuana consumption and the number of marijuana-associatedemergency room visits have remained relatively steady in recentyears. In 1984 Americans consumed an estimated 7,800-9,200 metrictons of marijuana, as compared with 8,000-9,600 metric tons in1983. Use of marijuana in conjunction with other drugs,particularly PCP, diazepam and cocaine, increased in 1984. The Marijuana User Marijuana is probably used by a wider demographiccross-section of American society than any other drug. Thiswidespread use was recognized by the 1972 National Commission onMarihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse: The stereotype of the marihuana [sic] user as a marginalcitizen has given way to a composite picture of large segments ofAmerican youth, children of the dominant majority and very muchpart of the mainstream of American life. While it appears that marijuana, like other drugs, is mostcommonly used by those between the ages of 18 and 25, its use isby no means confined to that age group. One analysis of marijuanause found that: Marijuana is now found at the Friday afternoon brainstormingsessions of a New York publishing house. In the cabs of long-haultrucks. In the office of a president of a cosmetic firm. Even, itis alleged, among executives of major American banks. According to the 1982 National Survey on Drug Abuse, 23percent of 16 and 17 year olds, 8 percent of 14 and 15 year olds,and 2 percent of 12 and 13 year olds used marijuana at least onceper month. Surveys have indicated marijuana use in children asyoung as nine years old. Health Effects of Marijuana Use Marijuana includes any part of the plant Canabis sativa. Inaddition to marijuana, the following forms of cannabis are alsoabused: hashish, a resin of the plant; hashish oil, a liquidconcentrate derived from cannabis; and sinsemilla, from thefemale cannabis plant. The effects of marijuana use have been the subject ofexaggeration and misunderstanding for decades. In 1936, forexample, the film "Reefer Madness" portrayed thoseeffects as instant violence and insanity. In 1972 the NationalCommission on Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse embraced theopposite extreme: No conclusive evidence exists of any physical damage,disturbances of bodily processes or proven human fatalitiesattributable solely to even high doses of marijuana . . . [The]few consistently observed transient effects on bodily functionseem to suggest that marihuana [sic] is a rather unexcitingcompound of negligible immediate toxicity at the doses usuallyconsumed in this country. Both views have been refuted by medical evidence gatheredsince the early 1970's. Today marijuana is described as "themost chemically complex of all commonly used illegal drugs."Marijuana contains 421 known chemicals, which when smoked arecombusted into more than 2,000 chemical compounds. Marijuana isvariously classified as a stimulant, depressant and hallucinogenbecause its effects vary among users. Those chemicals found only in cannabis are calledcannabinoids. The primary intoxicant in marijuana isdelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The concentration of The inmarijuana has steadily increased over the last decade as a resultof improved agricultural techniques. Analysis of marijuanasamples indicates that the average percentage of The in marijuanahas increased from .7 percent in 1973, to 3.1 percent in 1982, to5.6 percent in 1983. The potencies have been reported as high as14 percent in domestically produced sinsemilla. Since 1967 when the first intensive government researchprogram on marijuana began, over 7,000 scientific papers havebeen published on the subject. Contrary to the findings of the1972 National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, adversephysical and psychological effects associated with marijuana usehave been demonstrated. The measurement of long-term effects ofmarijuana use are at present problematic because marijuanasmoking has been prevalent in the United States for onlyapproximately 15 to 20 years, shorter than the latency period formany marijuana-related diseases. In the case of tobacco it wasnot until after 50 years of heavy use that there was ampleevidence to issue warnings about its effects. Despite the common public perception that marijuana is lessharmful than tobacco, scientific evidence indicates thatmarijuana, in fact, causes substantially more adverse healtheffects, due in part to the properties of the drug itself and themanner in which it is smoked. Marijuana is not filtered, as aremost tobacco cigarettes, and marijuana smoke is generally inhaledmore deeply and held in the lungs longer than tobacco smoke.Marijuana smoke has been found to contain many of the samechemicals as tobacco smoke; indeed it has 50 percent more ofcancer-causing hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. According to the American Lung Association, marijuana smokingharms the lungs and may cause bronchitis, emphysema and lungcancer. Evidence supporting this conclusion has been building fora number of years. For example, a 1976 study reported thatexaminations of human lung tissue "have found malignantcellular changes after shorter periods of exposure to marijuanasmoke than to tobacco smoke." One comprehensive review ofmarijuana projects that: Starting in the latter 1980's, we predict an increase in therate of lung cancer among middle-aged people, representing themarijuana epidemic that began in the mid-sixties. Those smokingboth tobacco and marijuana are most at risk. Marijuana use can also adversely affect both male and femalereproduction. Marijuana use by pregnant women is particularlydangerous and has been linked to lowered birth weight, fetalabnormalities and nervous disorders in offspring. These adversephysical effects are magnified because cannabinoids, being fatsoluble, collect in the fatty organs of the body, such as thetestis or ovaries, brain and liver. This is of particular concernbecause marijuana is used by a large population of young peoplewhose lungs, reproductive organs, and other parts of their bodiesare still maturing and are particularly vulnerable to the adverseeffects of drugs. In addition to these physical effects of marijuana use,several psychological and behavioral effects have also beenassociated with the drug. These behavioral changes have beencalled "the amotivational syndrome." Although lack ofmotivation may often precede marijuana use, many clinicians haveconcluded that: Motivational effects are directly related to use and . . .following cessation of marijuana use normal motivation mayreturn. In addition to the effects of marijuana on motivation,marijuana use has been found to affect short-term memory,concentration, and logical thinking. A 1982 report concerning theimpact of marijuana use on education concludes that: Every element of learning is incompatible with either theacute intoxication or the chronic mental change that marijuanause can bring. A 1980 study reported that use of marijuana 20 times or moreper month is "positively correlated with absenteeism andpoor school achievement among high school seniors." Theseconclusions are particularly disturbing given the fact that tensof thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of adolescentsuse marijuana every day. A final concern in this area, marijuana's role as a"gateway" to subsequent use of more dangerous drugs,cannot be categorized as either physical or psychological. Whilemany beliefs about marijuana have been proven wrong by subsequentresearch, this concept has been affirmed. This"gateway" theory does not indicate that marijuana usewill definitely lead to the use of other drugs; however,according to a review of marijuana studies conducted by theDepartment of Health and Human Services, Statistically, there is little question that use, particularlyheavier use, is associated with a likelihood of experimentationwith other drugs. Synthetic Drugs Scope of the Problem Many illicit drugs do not occur naturally. Unlike cocaine,heroin and marijuana, which are derived from plants, syntheticdrugs are produced solely from chemicals. These synthetic drugsinclude stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, known asdangerous drugs; synthetic narcotics, such as methadone; andcontrolled substance analogs, often called "designerdrugs." A controlled substance analog has a chemicalstructure similar to a controlled substance, and is designed toproduce a similar effect. Use of synthetic drugs is widespread in the United States.More than six million Americans used synthetic drugs fornon-medical purposes in 1982. Over 2.5 million people abuseddepressants, approximately 2.8 million abused stimulants, andalmost 1 million abused hallucinogens. Consumption of"dangerous drugs" increased 15 percent between 1983 and1984, from an estimated 2.66 billion dosage units to 3.06 billiondosage units. The greatest increases were associated withmethamphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Methamphetamine-relatedemergency room visits increased 20 percent from 1983 to 1984, anddeaths associated with both amphetamine and methamphetamine alsoincreased in 1984. Statistics regarding the use of controlled substance analogsare difficult to compile. This is because the use of thesesubstances is a relatively new phenomenon, and medical examinershave generally failed to identify controlled substance analogs asa cause of death. Despite these difficulties, one syntheticanalog has been responsible for the deaths of at least 100 peopleon the West Coast. While most of these deaths occurred inCalifornia, many law enforcement authorities fear that productionand use of controlled substance analogs might spread across thecountry because of the ease of production and large profit marginassociated with these drugs. This spread has already occurred inat least one instance: drug treatment program directors inCalifornia, Florida, New York, Texas and Virginia have reportedcases of use of the controlled substance analog MDMA. Synthetic Drug Users While synthetic drugs are used for a wide range of medicinalpurposes, they are also widely abused by individuals from allsocioeconomic groups. According to a 1978 study of individuals intreatment for stimulant and/or depressant drug abuse, 68 percentwere men, 61 percent were white, 20 percent black and 19 percentof another ethnicity, 59 percent were unemployed, 77 percent hadpreviously been treated for drug abuse, 59 percent were 25 yearsof age or older, and 46 percent had less than a twelfth gradeeducation. While most people associate heroin use with crime, a 1982study by the RAND Corporation found violent crime to be committedmost often by multi-drug users, particularly those usingcombinations including dangerous drugs. Certain synthetic drugsare particularly associated with crime. A study of all arresteesin Washington, D.C., from May 1984 to April 1985 found that PCP,an hallucinogen, is the drug most often detected in thesearrestees. An average of over 30 percent of all adults arrestedin Washington, D.C., during this period tested positive for PCPuse. A study of almost 5,000 male arrestees in New York City in1984 found that 12 percent of those arrested had PCP in theirbodies. Health Effects of Synthetic Drug Use Tolerance to stimulants develops quickly. Because of the"crash," or depression, followed by stimulant use,users tend to take stimulants more often in order to compensatefor or avoid the post-stimulant letdown. Stimulant users aresubject to a vicious cycle in which they must take depressants atnight to be able to reverse the stimulant's effects. Stimulantscan cause physical dependence and death. Withdrawal ischaracterized by depression, fatigue and excessive sleep, whichmay last for several days. Other withdrawal symptoms, includinganxiety and thoughts of suicide, may last for weeks or months. Depressants can also cause tolerance and physical dependence.Abuse of depressants is marked by impaired judgment, slurredspeech and loss of motor coordination. Depressants areparticularly dangerous when used in combination with alcohol orother drugs. Heavy use of depressants can cause a weak, rapidpulse, shallow respiration, coma and death. Hallucinogens alter mood, and, in large doses, cause delusionsand hallucinations. This impaired judgment can lead a user tophysically harm himself or others. "Flashbacks," inwhich the user has a brief recurrence of the psychedelic effectsof hallucinogens, sometimes occur long after the drug is used.Tolerance and psychological dependence can also result. PCP,often called "Angel Dust," is one of the most dangerousand widely abused hallucinogens. Reactions to PCP areunpredictable and include euphoria, depression, anxiety or panic.PCP use is associated with extremely violent behavior, includingassault, rape, and murder. Feelings of omnipotence sometimes leada PCP user to suicidal behavior, including walking in front ofmoving vehicles or jumping out of windows. Controlled substance analogs are designed to mimic the effectsof various drugs and are particularly dangerous because of theirtoxicity. One synthetic analog, 3-methyl fentanyl, is up to 1,000times more potent than morphine. According to Dr. Robert J.Roberton of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs,"You could kill 50 people with the amount that fits on thehead of a pin." Fentanyl analogs, the most commonly abused controlledsubstance analogs, produce a feeling of euphoria similar to thatassociated with heroin use. These drugs also produce respiratorydepression and muscle rigidity. MPTP, which is a synthetic analogof the narcotic meperidine, causes brain damage, Parkinson'sdisease and death. Although Parkinson's disease usually strikespeople in their fifties and sixties, people of various ages, whohave used MPTP, have contracted the disease, which causes slowedmovement, tremors, rigidity, dementia and death. The neurologicaldamage associated with use of MPTP is irreversible. Drug Abuse Fuels Drug Trafficking Drug abuse in the United States is a problem of vast andgrowing proportions Millions of Americans use cocaine, heroin,marijuana, or synthetic drugs, or combinations of these drugs.Consumption of cocaine and dangerous drugs has increased recentlyas have the deleterious health effects associated with then. Thedownward trend in marijuana use which began in 1979 appears tohave ended at least temporarily in 1985. Particularly dangerous forms of drug use have increased duringthe last few years. Use of "crack," coca base which issmoked and which has been called the most potent, addictive, andcheapest form of cocaine, has become prevalent in the New YorkCity area. Use of "designer drugs," some of which havecaused Parkinson's disease, have been blamed for over 100 deaths.There is evidence of a link between intravenous drug use and thecontraction of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Drug abuse affects much more than the individual drug user; italso impacts on families, communities and entire governments. Thetaint of drugs has reached into virtually every aspect ofAmerican life, from public safety to the integrity ofprofessional sports. These problems and the full range of massivegovernment and private responses discussed in this report,including increased education and enforcement efforts, expandedintelligence and interdiction programs, and diversions ofmilitary resources, costing billions of dollars, is the directresult of a single cause: the destructive self-indulgence ofindividual drug purchasers. Each time a drug user buys cocaine,heroin, or other drugs, he makes a contribution to organizedcrime. Such contributions are the sole sustenance of theviolence, corruption, illness and death that trafficking groupsbring to this and other societies.

Large trafficking organizations dominate the illicitdrug market. These groups include the "families" ofAmerica's La Cosa Nostra, as well as an array of more recentlyidentified crime groups such as the Sicilian "Mafia,"outlaw motorcycle gangs and groups based in the Nigerian andColombian communities. While La Cosa Nostra has historically beeninvolved in narcotics trafficking, newer organizations, in manyways quite different from La Cosa Nostra, now play a major rolein the drug trade. Generally, these newer groups develop solelyaround drug trafficking operations and are activity-specific,dependent only on drug-related criminal activity for income. Theytend to be more fluidly organized than La Cosa Nostra, and arenot as self-contained but are marked by a degree of violence andcorruption unsurpassed by any other criminal activity. Organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, however,share a central feature with other organized crime groups in thatthey consist of a core criminal group and a specialized criminalsupport designed to facilitate illicit activity. This"core/support" configuration is one this Commission hasfound to be common to all organized crime groups today. Cocaine Trafficking America's cocaine supply at present originates exclusively inSouth America. Coca is cultivated principally in Peru, Bolivia,Colombia and Ecuador, and conversion laboratories have beenlocated in Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela. Other South Americanand Caribbean countries serve as transshipment sites. All phasesof the cocaine trade, including cultivation, processing anddistribution have expanded since 1984, and the industry shows nosigns of diminishing despite the fact that cocaine supply alreadyexceeds consumer demand. Control of the cocaine industry has traditionally beenmaintained by a cartel of Colombian traffickers. Colombian groupsare the largest, wealthiest, most sophisticated organizationstrafficking in cocaine. A key to their domination of the markethas been their control of the processing laboratories used toconvert coca grown traditionally in Bolivia and Peru. Export ofthe drug to the United States has also been handled almostexclusively by Colombian trafficking organizations. WhileColombians currently control an estimated 75 percent of thecocaine distributed to the United States, their domination hasbeen lessened recently both by the Colombian government'simposition of severe restrictions on the importation of chemicalsessential to cocaine processing and by the destruction of cocaineprocessing sites throughout Colombia by government authorities.In 1984 three major Colombian conversion laboratories werediscovered and destroyed: at Tranquilandia, the largest facility,ten metric tons of cocaine and 10,000 barrels of processingchemicals were seized. In total, Colombian authoritiesconfiscated 16 metric tons of cocaine in 1984, a 600 percentincrease from the 2.5 metric tons seized in the previous year.The pressures on cocaine traffickers were compounded in that yearby the Colombian government's decision to extradite drugtraffickers to the United States, and by the subsequent issuanceof warrants for the arrest of several major traffickers. Intensified Colombian law enforcement measures have hadsignificant impact on trafficking operations. The initiativeshave prompted many traffickers to seek refuge in other SouthAmerican countries, and in some cases to relocate theirprocessing laboratories. These incidents have resulted in ageographic dispersal of cocaine processing and export activities,most notably to Bolivia and Peru. While it appeared initiallythat activity in these countries was sponsored and overseen byColombian traffickers, increasing evidence suggests that groupsin both countries are becoming self-sufficient. Suchdevelopments, however, remain an exception to the prevailingColombian dominance. Despite the spread of cocaine activity through South America,Colombian groups have left little room in the cocaine trade forsmall-scale smugglers. While some independent operators andsmaller smuggling groups occasionally work independently of theColombian cartel, most are tied to the larger organization in atleast a contractor relationship. The Colombian Connection: Origins The Colombian involvement in U.S. cocaine trafficking can betraced to the influx of Cuban citizens to South Florida after theCastro Revolution in the early 1960's. Some of the Cuban-settledcommunities became bases for the continuation of establishedCuban organized crime networks known as the "CubanMafia." The Cuban Mafia had been a major distributor of thecocaine in Cuba, where the drug has long been accepted as asocial luxury, and thus had existing connections with SouthAmerican cocaine trafficking organizations. At first, the FloridaCuban Mafia factions imported only enough cocaine to satisfymembers of their own community, but by the mid-1960's, they beganto import greater quantities of the drug in an effort to expanddistribution and increase profit. By 1965 Colombians suppliednearly 100 percent of the cocaine moving through the Cubannetworks. Colombians refined the drug and Cubans trafficked anddistributed it in the United States. The system worked for atime, but the Colombians increasingly desired control of theentire operation. Through the late 1960's and early 1970's theybecame more involved in cocaine production, and increased theirtrafficking role. By 1978 Colombian traffickers had cut all tieswith the Cubans and assumed the dominant role they now play insupplying cocaine to the American market. Colombian groups have continued to control the U.S. cocainemarket through the 1980's for a number of reasons.Geographically, Colombia is well-positioned both to receive cocafrom Peru and Bolivia and to export the processed drug to theUnited States either by air or by sea. In addition, the country'svast central forests effectively conceal clandestine processinglaboratories and air strips, which facilitate the traffic.Perhaps most importantly, the Colombians have a momentum bybenefit of their early involvement in the cocaine trade. Theyhave evolved from small, disassociated groups intocompartmentalized organizations and are sophisticated andsystematized in their approach to trafficking cocaine in theUnited States. Further, groups in the Colombian population in theU.S. provide traffickers access to this country and often servesas a distribution network for Colombian cocaine. The Colombian Organization The major Colombian trafficking organizations are structuredto control each intermediate step required in processing andexporting cocaine. Like traditional organized crime groups, theyare built of interdependent and essential component"divisions," each with a specialized area ofresponsibility. Different members act as laborers, processors,transporters, financiers and enforcers. In addition,organizations generally supplement their regular membership withcriminal support of affiliates who perform services on a feebasis. Few members of any organizational division are aware ofthe others involved in the enterprise, and trafficking bosses arewell-insulated and protected by their organizations. Organization laborers and processors prepare cocaine for U.S.consumption. Most laborers in the cultivation phase are Peruvianor Bolivian peasants who cultivate and harvest coca in remoteareas of the Eastern Andes, then process the coca leaves to basein nearby villages. The growers are allied in small, independentgroups, but are typically financed, overseen, and protected bymembers of a larger Colombian organization. Processed coca base is usually flown on light aircraft fromthe mountain villages to Colombian processing facilities by thosemembers of the Colombian organization responsible fortransportation. The planes land at clandestine airstrips, oftensimple mud runways, located near the processing laboratories. Thelaboratories vary widely in size, ranging from crudesmall-quantity operations to large, sophisticated complexes, andcan be found both in Colombia's jungle and urban areas. Coca base is typically processed to cocaine hydrochloride inthe laboratories, then bagged and taped into kilogram packages,which are sometimes coded to indicate a particular United Statesdestination. The packages are loaded into duffle bags or burlapsacks, then moved by the transportation group to a "stashhouse," a storage facility usually located near a seaport ora clandestine airstrip. The cocaine is held at the stash houseuntil it is exported from Colombia. Colombian trafficking organizations currently export anestimated 62 percent of the cocaine they process on privateaircraft. The remaining 38 percent is shipped on ocean vessels orsmuggled on commercial air carriers. Most shipments are smuggledout of Colombia from the country's northern coastal region, theGuajira peninsula. Principal smuggling centers include the citiesof Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Medellin. Inaddition, a significant percentage of processed cocaine leavesColombia from airstrips located near larger processing facilitiesin the jungles. Typically, Colombian organizations oversee each cocaineshipment from cultivation through wholesale transactions in theUnited States. Retail and street-level sales are handled by avariety of smaller groups and individuals in this country. The money generated by the wholesale cocaine transaction ismaintained for the organization by financial experts familiarwith international banking, who are responsible for laundering,banking and investing drug profits, and for assuring that aportion of the drug profit is returned to Colombia forreinvestment in the organization's cocaine enterprise. Thecartel's own financial experts are supported by a complement ofbankers, lawyers and other professionals in the United States,who play a crucial role in facilitating these transactions. Colombian trafficking organizations, like other organizedcrime groups, rely on "enforcement" through violenceand intimidation to protect their inventory and profits."Enforcement" occurs both in Colombia and in the UnitedStates and includes the collection of debts owed to theorganization and the elimination of interference fromcompetitors, informants and law enforcement officials. Pilots: The American Affiliates Cocaine is ordinarily smuggled from South America to theUnited States for major trafficking organizations by Americancitizens acting as mercenary pilots. Recruits includeex-military, commercial and private pilots, and in some cases,unlicensed aviators. The speed, mobility and evasive capabilitiesof air transport have made it the preferred node of shipmentamong Colombian traffickers, and many have built airstrips eithernear their processing centers or along the coastlines to permitthe fast direct export of cocaine. On Colombia's north coastalone, over 150 clandestine landing strips and threeinternational airports facilitate smuggling activities. Individual pilots are generally responsible for purchasing orleasing transportation vehicles and hiring flight crews.Obtaining a plane for purchase seldom presents any difficulty,since many aircraft are regularly advertised for sale in a numberof trade periodicals. One popular journal, Trade-a-Plane, ispublished three times each month and advertises thousands ofaircraft available for sale in each issue. Planes are alsoavailable for purchase at numerous government auctions of seizedproperties. These events often allow traffickers to repurchaseaircraft, which they were previously forced to forfeit. Because traffickers attempt to ship the largest possiblequantities of cocaine to the widest range of destinations in theUnited States, the aircraft selected for smuggling generallyrepresent the optimum balance between range and cargo capacity.The most popular of these are conventional light twin engineplanes, such as the Piper Aztec, Piper Navajo and the Cessna 400series. Most such planes can transport about a ton of cocaineover a range of about 1,800 miles and can stay airborne for 11and one hours with standard fuel systems. Larger airplanes suchas DC-3 aircraft are common on shuttle flights between the UnitedStates and various transshipment points; the fastest aircraft arealways preferred when available. To maximize range and capability, smuggling planes are oftenoutfitted with auxiliary fuel systems. These auxiliary systemsmay be attached to the outside body of the aircraft or the wing,but must be inspected and approved by the Federal AviationAdministration each time the outfitted aircraft prepares forflight. A favored auxiliary system for cocaine traffickers is thecollapsible rubber fuel "bladder," which may be placedin the plane's fuselage, and simply folded up or thrown awayafter the fuel contained within is used. The space occupied bythe bladder on the trip to Colombia can be utilized for cocainetransport on the return journey. Bladders are, under allcircumstances, prohibited by Federal law. Although the legitimate need for auxiliary fuel systems isvery limited, the systems are well-advertised and readilyavailable. One trafficker told the Commission he purchasedbladders and other long-range fuel systems regularly, alwayspaying the seller with "suitcases full of cash." Heclaims his cash was never questioned or refused. Traffic From Colombia to the United States: The Hydra's Head Smugglers use a vast number of both air and sea traffickingroutes to transport cocaine from South America to the UnitedStates. The most commonly travelled routes are through theWindward Passage between Cuba and Haiti, through the YucatanChannel between Mexico and Cuba, and through the Mona Passage,bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Traditionally, 90 percent of the cocaine shipped by theseroutes has entered the United States at points along the Floridacoast; traffickers now, however, more frequently delivershipments to all the States along the Gulf Coast and elsewherethroughout this country. Cocaine traffic also now runs directlyfrom Colombia's west coast to California and other westernstates. These shifts are perceived as a response by traffickersto increased law enforcement pressure in South Florida,specifically to the intensified efforts of the SouthFlorida/Caribbean Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.The theme is a common one: as law enforcement closes off onepoint of entry to drug traffickers, traffickers develop many newpoints of entry as replacements. Air Shipment Nearly two-thirds of the cocaine exported from South Americato the United State is transported by general aviation aircraft.Planes of all sizes, ranging from small turbo-prop craft to largeC-123 cargo transport planes, are used for drug shipment. Smallaircraft, which cannot carry adequate fuel to allow direct flightfrom Colombia to the United States, must refuel at transshipmentpoints between the two countries. These contact points areindispensable, and are located throughout Central America, theDominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.Transshipment points may be simply refueling stations, or may bebases or stations equipped to allow cocaine off-loading andrepackaging. From the transshipment points, cocaine is generallyferried to the United States by small planes or boats. Mexico has gained popularity as a transshipment point since1980. Although coca cultivation has not been observed in Mexico,an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the cocaine exported to theUnited States currently transits that country. Three Mexicantransshipment patterns are typical. First, Mexican traffickersobtain cocaine in South America, transport it to Mexico, thentraffic the drug overland into the United States. Second,Colombian or American couriers travel by commercial aircraft fromSouth America to Mexico, then cross the border into this country.Finally, Colombian or North American traffickers use Mexico'snumerous clandestine airstrips, especially in Yucatan, forrefueling and for loading purposes; the smuggling plane in usemay continue directly into the United States, or the shipment maybe broken into smaller loads, then trafficked overland by Mexicanorganizations. The majority of cocaine shipped through Mexico istransported to the United States by car, truck or bus, but asignificant amount is smuggled aboard small aircraft. The Mexicangroups, formerly limited primarily to trafficking heroin andmarijuana, have eagerly expanded their role as middlemen betweenColombian traffickers and American consumers. Maritime Shipment An estimated 18 percent (15 tons in 1984) of the cocainetrafficked into the United States is exported from South Americaby sea vessel. All types of ships are used for smuggling, fromsmall high-speed cigarette boats to large commercial cargocarriers. Colombians dominate maritime cocaine smuggling, andmost shipments depart that country's north coastline, whichfeatures three major seaports and countless debarkation ports forsmaller craft. Approximately one-half of the cocaine exported bysea is concealed in commercial vessels, and a smaller percentageis shipped in private boats which are frequently outfitted withspecial compartments designed for drug storage. Small amounts ofcocaine are also often shipped on with marijuana onnon-commercial smuggling vessels. Maritime trafficking routes have shifted significantly in thepast five years, primarily in response to increased lawenforcement surveillance. While a major portion of the maritimetraffic formerly flowed directly into South Florida, traffickersnow increasingly use the longer eastern routes through theCaribbean to the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, as well asdirect routes to the U.S. west coast. These routes make smugglingmore expensive for traffickers, since they require largervessels, larger crews and more sophisticated electronicequipment. Case Study: Devoe Airlines Devoe Airlines was a scheduled commuter air service operatingbetween Miami and smaller Florida cities during the early 1980's.Owned by Miami pilot Jack Devoe, the business was essentially afront for a Colombian drug trafficking operation, which includedregular large quantity marijuana and cocaine smuggling. In total,8 to 10 contract pilots employed by Devoe were involved in over100 trafficking flights over a five year period and carriedroughly 7,000 pounds of cocaine from South America to the UnitedStates. Jack Devoe estimates that his flying organization grossedmillions of dollars each month during peak smuggling periods. Devoe's trafficking pilots initially travelled non-stop routesbetween the United States and Colombia, but developed atransshipment point on Little Derby Island in the Bahamas forpurposes of "security . . . [and] police protection" inthe 1980's. Devoe hired six to eight employees to work as neededat the island base to unload and repackage drug shipments. Therewas no interference from Bahamian law enforcement at the LittleDarby base "as long as the payments [to officials] were ontime." Typically operating mid-size turbo-prop aircraft, Devoe pilotsdeparted for Colombia either from the base at Little Derby Islandor from Florida airports. Their route took them through theWindward Passage generally to Colombian locations about 60 milessouth of the equator. In the early stages of the operation,landings were made at official Colombian airports including theairfields at Santa Marta and Riohacha. In at least one instance,cocaine was openly loaded onto the smuggling aircraft at Riohachaairport. In the early 1980's Devoe shifted landings toclandestine jungle airstrips maintained by the organization'scocaine supplier, Pepe Cabrera. This system streamlined thetrafficking process by eliminating transport of the cocaine to anairport. The cocaine shipment was loaded directly onto theaircraft near the strip, where the plane was simultaneouslyprepared for the return flight. Generally, Devoe pilots returned to the United States withinone day. Their preferred return route extended along theColombia/Venezuela border, over Haiti, and to the Bahamian baseon Little Derby Island. There, cocaine was sealed into the wingfuel tanks of a small aircraft and flown directly into SouthFlorida for delivery to the cartel's representative there. The Devoe organization's methods for avoiding interdictionbetween South America and the United States were relativelysimple and typical of such smuggling operations. A Devoe pilotlearned the frequencies of DEA surveillance aircraft on oneoccasion by "acting like a helicopter buff" inspectinga DEA Cobra pursuit helicopter parked near the Devoe hangar.Inside the helicopter the pilot copied the frequencies from aclipboard hanging on the instrument panel. As the pilot explainedto the Commission: By [subsequently] using our scanner and our knowledge of thefrequencies in use, we could monitor the activities of DEA planes. . . we could learn not only the activities of the planes, butalso go up and check the plane out. By learning what types ofaircraft DEA was using we could plan our own strategy moreeffectively . . . Devoe also regularly sent "cover-flight" aircraftahead of the smuggling planes along the trafficking route tomonitor DEA and Customs Service surveillance patrols by radio.These planes, which carried no drug cargo, were also used todecoy pursuit aircraft. Once in the United States, Devoe strategyfor clearing Customs inspection was to: ". . . act normally and file a flight plan, come in andland, and let them inspect the airplane . . . Customs inspectorswere far less interested in a lengthy examination of my plane ifI came in on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of the televisedfootball game. If the Dolphins were playing, that was evenbetter." Using these tactics, Devoe Airlines was able to complete over100 trafficking flights from Colombia without interference fromlaw enforcement authorities. Case Study: Barry Seal Adler Berriman Seal, a former TWA 747 captain, flew cocainefrom Colombia to the United States for over seven years duringthe late 1970's and early 1980's. Seal was recruited as atrafficking pilot by a personal friend who worked for theColombian cocaine trafficking organization headed by Jorge Ochoa,and eventually worked directly with that organization'sleadership. Initially, Seal flew direct trafficking flights betweenLouisiana, and Colombia. He piloted a number of differentsmuggling aircraft, the largest of which was a Vietnam-vintageC-123 capable of holding tons of packaged cocaine. Seal alwaysdeparted and returned to his Louisiana base at night to reducechances of interdiction. His typical route took him over theYucatan Peninsula (not over the more heavily patrolled Yucatanchannel) and directly over Central America to the eastern tip ofHonduras, then south to any one of a number of airstrips andairports in north central Colombia. According to Seal, the Ochoa organization paid Colombianofficials bribes of $10,000 to $25,000, per flight for a"window," i.e., a specific time, position and altitudedesignated for the smuggling flight's penetration of theColombian air space. If this payment was not made, the aircraftwas susceptible to interception by Colombian authorities. Sealgenerally arrived in Colombia at dawn. His aircraft was loadedwith cocaine and refueled within an hour, sometimes withinfifteen minutes; and he returned immediately to the UnitedStates. Seal used two fairly simple techniques to avoid interdictionon his return trip to the United States: both were effectivebecause of the heavy helicopter traffic running between the GulfCoast States and the hundreds of oil rigs located off shore.First, when he reached the middle of the Gulf on his return trip,Seal slowed his aircraft to 110-120 knots and was thus perceivedby monitoring radar as a helicopter, not a plane. Secondly, at adistance of about 50 miles off the United States coast, hedropped the aircraft to an altitude of 500-1000 feet in order toco-mingle with the helicopter traffic, and thereby arouse evenless suspicion. Once in United States airspace, Seal proceeded to prearrangedpoints 40 to 50 miles inland. The points were mapped out inadvance with Loran C, a long-range navigational instrument.Further inland, he was generally joined by a helicopter. The twoaircraft proceeded to a drop zone, where the helicopter hoveredclose to the ground. Seal then dropped the load of cocaine fromthe airplane on a parachute; the helicopter picked up the loadfrom the drop zone and delivered it to waiting automobiles, whicheventually moved the cocaine to Miami. Seal proceeded to land hisdrug-free aircraft at any nearby airport. Seal was well paid for his services. He claims his top fee forsmuggling a kilogram of cocaine was $5,000; an average load was300 kilograms. His most profitable single load netted him $1.5million. He was never apprehended in connection with thisoperation. Specialized Electronics: The Smuggler's Edge Like many trafficking pilots today, both Seal and Devoe reliedon sophisticated electronic equipment to maintain and securecommunications within their organization and to monitor lawenforcement surveillance efforts. Most devices used, whileexpensive, are readily available in the United States, andtrafficking organizations, of course, fund the purchase of anyequipment that will facilitate their operations. Seal, forexample, once spent over $200,000 cash on communication andsurveillance equipment for the Ochoa cocaine traffickingorganization here in the United States in a two-day period.Payments for this type of equipment are almost always made incash - sometimes suitcases full of cash - and are rarely refused. The communication devices most commonly used by traffickersinclude state of the art radio equipment, communicationscramblers, pocket pagers and encrypting devices. The equipmentis used to prevent law enforcement interception of communicationbetween traffickers. A scrambler, for example, attaches to anordinary radio, and "scrambles" the normal radiofrequency with a number of different codes. Only someone with areceiver coded to the particular scrambler frequency can decipherthe transmitted message; the transmission is unintelligible toall other receivers. Digital encryption devices are used to sendmessages in code, and are often secured so that they can beaccessed only after a security number is punched directly intothe device. The security feature allows only members of thetrafficking organization, who know the access code, to send ordecipher coded messages. The speed with which a digital messageis transmitted precludes radio tracking, at least by traditionaltriangulation. Among the other specialized devices used by traffickers todetect and avoid law enforcement surveillance are radaraltimeters, beacon-interrogating digital radar, position trackingequipment and long-range navigation instruments. Latestgeneration night vision goggles are also frequently used bytraffickers flying at low altitudes in darkness. The strap-ongoggles intensify any available light by a factor of 50,000 andgreatly reduce a smuggler's risk of interdiction by allowing himto fly his aircraft without lights. The Combined Effort A number of independent Colombian trafficking organizations,among them the largest and most powerful operations, work incollaboration on individual smuggling ventures. As described byDEA special agent Michael Fredericks, the resulting organizationis fluid: There is a level of organization that may involve . . . ahandful of people at the top. . . Below that level . . . thereare many workers who move between one organization and another. .. It seems that in the Colombian organizations, a laboratoryoperator may work for 1 [specific] trafficker . . . and not evenbe aware of it simple because of the levels of insulation. At the time of the preparation of this report, three men,Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasques, andCarlos Enrique Lehder-Rivas, were reported to control the mostsignificant trafficking organizations in Colombia. Known as"Los Grandes Mafiosos" in the Colombian press, eachdirects a separate organization, but the organizations work inconcert and exchange personnel and equipment in various instancesto maximize efficiency and profit. The resulting cartel systemaffords these traffickers numerous advantages, among them controlover the price and the quality of Colombian cocaine, greateraccess to smuggling and processing equipment, and a wide varietyof methods by which to avoid law enforcement. A chart detailing a temporary cooperative venture based inMedellin, Colombia, between the Pablo Escobar organization andthe Jorge Ochoa organization was confiscated from a mid-leveltrafficker involved in the operation, and was provided to theCommission by the Drug Enforcement Administration (Figure 2). Asdiagrammed, the Escobar and Ochoa organizations combined anddivided the trafficking responsibilities typically completed by asingle organization. The same component parts - labor,processing, transportation, finance and enforcement - werecarried over from the individual organizations, with the Escobargroup taking responsibility for production activities, and theOchoa group handling enforcement and finances. Colombia Cracks Down Through the 1970's cocaine traffickers operated throughoutColombia with little interference, and in fact with considerablesupport from the Colombian government. The situation changed inApril 1984 when drug traffickers assassinated Colombia's Ministerof Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Lara's assassination came twomonths after he authorized a raid on a major cocaine processingplant known as Tranquilandia in Southeastern Colombia's Llanosregion, which resulted in the destruction of over $1 billionworth of cocaine. Following Lara's assassination, ColombianPresident Belisario Betancur Cuartas declared a "war withoutquarter" on all drug smugglers and signed extradition ordersfor a number of known major traffickers. President Betancur alsoshifted trafficking trials to Colombia's military courts,increased eradication and interdiction efforts within hiscountry, and increased regulation of those chemicals necessaryfor processing coca base into cocaine. President Betancur's actions have had important ramificationsboth for traffickers and for other South and Central Americangovernments. When the intensified Colombian programs becameeffective, a number of major traffickers, among them Escobar,Lehder and Ochoa, went into hiding and moved their processingoperations to neighboring countries. In 1984 processinglaboratories as well as stockpiles of essential conversionchemicals were discovered and destroyed in Panama, Venezuela,Mexico and Canada. Evidence suggests that significant processingactivity is now also taking place in Nicaragua and Brazil. TheColombian regulation of ether and other essential precursorchemicals has resulted in an increase in cocaine processingactivity in the United States: 21 processing laboratories werediscovered and destroyed in South Florida in 1984 as opposed to11 in 1983. In March 1985 despite his status as a fugitive, Carlos Lehderappeared on Colombian television, filmed live from a jungleclearing by a Spanish film crew. Lehder used the televisionopportunity, which he had arranged, to appeal to the Colombianrevolutionary organizations to participate in the "cocainebonanza . . . the arm of the struggle against America." Healso characterized cocaine as the "Achilles heel of Americanimperialism." Lehder disappeared into the jungle after theinterview and remains at large, presumably in the remote junglesof Colombia. Heroin Trafficking Traditional Organized Crime: La Cosa Nostra and the FrenchConnection Heroin trafficking in this country first became big businessin the 1920's, when organized criminals based in New York City'sJewish community began to control the importation anddistribution of the drug. By the late 1930's, La Cosa Nostrajoined the Jewish groups in the heroin enterprise, importing thedrug from France, Asia and the Mideast. When these sources becameinaccessible during World War II, Mexico became the major U.S.heroin supplier. After the war, La Cosa Nostra took control of America's heroinmarket, this time importing most of its drug supply from Italianrefineries. When the Italian government banned the manufacture ofheroin in the early 1950's, La Cosa Nostra traffickers wereforced to look to other sources. A new system was quicklydevised, by which Turkish morphine base was refined to heroin inMarseilles, then shipped to Montreal or Sicily. Organized crimegroups located in these transshipment points then sent the heroindirectly to the United States. This arrangement, popularly knownas the "French Connection," allowed La Cosa Nostra tomonopolize the heroin trade from the 1980's through the early1970's. During the peak French Connection years, the LCNcontrolled an estimated 95 percent of all of the heroin enteringNew York City, as well as most of the heroin distributedthroughout the United States. The La Cosa Nostra heroin monopoly lasted until 1972, whenunder diplomatic pressure from the United States, Turkey bannedopium production and the French Connection collapsed. Amsterdamreplaced Marseilles as the center of European heroin traffic, andChicago, Los Angeles and Miami joined New York City as major U.S.distribution centers. Other trafficking groups rose to competewith the LCN for heroin dollars in New York City and throughoutthe country. Source Country Traffickers: Mexico In the five years after the collapse of the French Connection,Mexico became the major source of U.S. heroin. Mexico's rise waslogical: the country contains extensive regions suitable for bothopium cultivation and refining and shares a lightly guarded 2,000mile border with the United States. Mexicans could manufactureheroin and smuggle it into the United States with little risk ofdetection. This simplified trafficking system resulted inincreased Mexican heroin availability in the United States. For generations, opium has been grown in remote areas ofMexico's Sierra Madre Mountain states of Durango, Sinaloa andChihuahua. Culiacan, on the western side of the Sierra Madre, andDurango to the east, developed in the 1970's as major productioncenters for heroin destined for U.S. distribution. Traffickingorganizations are now entrenched in these areas, and are involvedin all phases of the heroin manufacture and distribution process.Opium gum is collected by peasants in isolated mountain areas andis transported by mule or carried by hand to nearby mountainvillages. Typically, village middlemen sell the opium to a drugtrafficking organization boss, who moves drugs to anorganization-held laboratory for processing to heroin. Mexicancouriers then transport the heroin to the members of thetrafficking organization in the United States. The major Mexicanheroin trafficking organizations supplying heroin to America aregenerally extended familial organizations, but loyal workerssometimes are given status as "quasi-family" members ofthe groups. The organizations work to eliminate competition andto control as completely as possible all aspects of the herointrade. Members act as opium cultivators, village middlemen, andheroin brokers and distributors. In the United States, theorganization typically controls distribution from the wholesalerto the retail distributor, but has little or no involvement instreet distribution. This is seen as an unnecessarily risky andlow-profit aspect of the business, and is left to outsiders. Violence is an integral part of Mexican trafficking.Organization members provide cultivators with semi-automatic andautomatic weapons to protect their crops; weapons are usedthroughout the trafficking system to eliminate informants, and tointimidate competitors and law enforcement officials. Corruptionof Mexican police officials is well-documented and is essentialto the smooth operation of the Mexican trafficking organizations. In 1984, Mexican traffickers provided 32 percent share of theheroin consumed in the United States. The figure is expected torise over the next several years due to the continued devaluationof the peso and improved agricultural technology. Case Study: The Herrera Family Since the early 1970's the Jamie Herrera-Navarres organizationhas been a major heroin smuggling power operative between Mexicoand the United States. The Herrera organization is aconfederation of families related by blood and marriage, althoughsome non-family members have been accepted into the group overtime. Older family members process opium and morphine base,younger members handle the drug sales and shipments in Mexico andin the United States. The Herrera organization is now estimatedto have 3,000 to 5,000 members, a significant portion of whom arenaturalized American citizens and illegal aliens residing in thiscountry. Despite the 1978 conviction and incarceration of JamieHerrera, and several key family members, the organization remainsactive. In July 1985, 135 persons in the United States,comprising eight separate Herrera-related distribution rings,were indicted in Chicago on drug trafficking charges. TheseHerrera groups allegedly trafficked heroin and marijuana fromMexico through El Paso to a middleman in Texas. From Texas, thedrugs were shipped to Chicago, then distributed throughout thecountry. This Herrera enterprise, only a small fragment of thetotal organization, is estimated to have had gross annual profitsof over $200 million. The arrests are expected to have asignificant effect on the Herrera organization, if only on atemporary basis. Source Country Traffickers: Southeast Asia Mexican heroin production decreased in the late 1970's due toenforcement, eradication and poor weather conditions. By 1980,Mexico provided only 25 percent of the heroin consumed in theUnited Stated, down from a peak level of 80 percent in 1975. Atthe same time, heroin production in Southeast Asia accelerateddramatically. By 1976, the "Golden Triangle" of Burma,Thailand and Laos supplied more than a third of the heroinconsumed in the United States; Mexico supplied the remainder.Golden Triangle heroin first gained popularity with Americanservicemen stationed in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam Warbecause it was readily available, inexpensive, and considerablymore pure than Mexican heroin. After the war, Golden Triangleheroin was exported to the United States in increasing amounts. Nearly 90 percent of the Golden Triangle opium is currentlyproduced in Burma. Two-thirds of this crop is produced in thenortheast area of the country, where control is shared by theBurmese Communist Party (BCP) and the Shan United Army (SUA).Both groups were at one time political insurgent organizationsbut are now almost entirely devoted to obtaining profit for theproduction, smuggling and sale of heroin base. They deriveconsiderable income from "taxes" and fees they levy onopium growers and heroin producers and traffickers. This incomeis used to purchase weapons, to be utilized not in furtherance ofpolitical goals, but for protection of each group's narcoticsenterprise. Traditionally, the two groups have coexistedpeacefully: the BCP has acted as the major opium supplier inSoutheast Asia and the SUA has been the area's major refiner andtrafficker. The BCP has recently become involved in refining anddistribution activities, and the organizations are currently inconflict. Opium and morphine base produced in northeastern Burmatransported by horse and donkey caravans to refineries along theThailand-Burma border for conversion to heroin and heroin base.Most of the finished products are shipped across the border intovarious towns in North Thailand and down to Bangkok for furtherdistribution to international markets. In the past major ethnicChinese traffickers in Bangkok have controlled much of theforeign sales and movement of Southeast Asian heroin fromThailand, but a combination of law enforcement pressure,publicity and a regional drought has significantly reduced theirrole. As a consequence, many less-predominant traffickers inBangkok and other parts of Thailand now control smallerquantities of the heroin going to international markets. Although Thailand is the primary transit center for SoutheastAsian heroin destined for international markets, alternatetrafficking routes are increasingly utilized as a result ofThailand's sustained enforcement actions. Some opium, morphinebase, and heroin base are moved South through Burma to southernThailand and Malaysia for conversion to heroin in laboratoriesalong the Thailand/Malaysia border. Refined heroin is alsotrafficked from Burma to India, then to the West. Heroin from Southeast Asia is most frequently brought to theUnited States by couriers, typically Thai and U.S. nationals andHong Kong Chinese, traveling on commercial airlines. Californiaand Hawaii are the primary U.S. entry points for Golden Triangleheroin, but small percentages of the drug are trafficked into NewYork City and Washington D.C. While Southeast Asian groups havehad success in trafficking heroin to the United States, theyinitially had difficulty arranging street level distribution.However, with the incarceration of Asian traffickers in Americanprisons during the 1970's, contacts between Asian and Americanprisoners developed. These contacts have allowed Southeast Asiantraffickers access to individuals and organizations distributingheroin at the retail level. Chinese organized crime groups, known as Triads, locatedprimarily in Hong Kong, and their U.S. counterparts, Tongs, arepositioned to participate in Southeast Asian heroin traffic, butthe extent of their activity in these enterprises is not known atthe present time. These organizations provide Asians directaccess to criminal groups in the United States, and couldpotentially assume a significant role in U.S. heroin traffickingactivities. Currently, there are major Triad organizations in NewYork, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Toronto. Source Country Traffickers: Southwest Asia Opium production in Southeast Asia was significantly reducedin the late 1970's and early 1980's due to a prolonged drought.This decrease, along with the unstable political climate in theregion caused by the fall of the ruling governments in SouthVietnam and Laos, resulted in a reduction of Southeast Asianheroin exports to the United States. During this period, opiumproduction in the Golden Crescent area of Southwest Asia,comprising the common border regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan andIran, markedly increased. In 1979 the Golden Crescent became theprimary U.S. heroin source. Southwest Asia continues to be thiscountry's major supplier: over one-half of the heroin enteringthe United States in 1984 originated as opium in the GoldenCrescent. The surge in Golden Crescent heroin exports to the UnitedStates can be attributed to a number of factors. Opium has alwaysbeen grown in the region, but traditionally, opium grown inAfghanistan and Pakistan was shipped directly to Iran to supplythat country's one million opium addicts. The situation changeddramatically after the 1980 fundamentalist revolution in Iran, aspolitical and social instability allowed greatly increaseddomestic opium production and curtailed the demand for opium fromPakistan and Afghanistan. The Iranian market was further closedto outsiders by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, whichblocked several of the traditional smuggling routes into Iran. Concurrent with the reduction in Iranian demand fornon-domestic opium, growers in Afghanistan and Pakistan harvestedrecord crops. The opium crop in Pakistan alone increased by 400percent between 1974-1979, from 200 to 800 metric tons.Consequently Pakistani and Afghan traffickers learned to refinetheir opium into heroin, and sought new markets for theirproduct, mainly in Western Europe and the and the United States. Southwest Asian opium is grown in remote mountain areas andgenerally is transported to crude laboratories in thePakistan/Afghanistan border areas. Most of the refineries arelocated in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province orAfghanistan's Nangarhai Province; many are clustered in the areaof the Khyber Pass. Refined heroin leaves Pakistan via severalroutes: through Baluchistan to Iran and beyond; by sea throughKarachi to Bombay and on to the Arabian Gulf States or Europe;overland through the Lahore area enroute to transit points inIndia; or by air through Islamabad or Karachi. Southwest Asian heroin is typically smuggled into the UnitedStates concealed in legitimate shipments of air and sea cargo,such as textiles or sports equipment manufactured by Pakistanicompanies, or it is carried by air couriers. Couriers generallytravel on commercial carriers, and many have connections withairline crews and station managers. The international postalsystem is also commonly used to ship heroin from Pakistandirectly to the United States in sealed newspapers andperiodicals. Golden Crescent heroin is trafficked into the United States bya variety of narcotics organizations. The following is anoverview of some of the more significant groups involved in theSouthwest Asian heroin trade. Pakistani Traffickers Pakistani nationals are responsible for trafficking asignificant percentage of Golden Crescent heroin in the UnitedStates, especially in the Northeast. The Pakistanis do not have asophisticated retail sales network in the United States andtypically rely on family or Pakistani friends in this country todistribute drugs. They also have relied on black traffickingorganizations in Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, and withItalian organized crime in New York City. One Pakistanidistribution system was described in testimony before thisCommission by a Pakistani national who was incarcerated for hisinvolvement in a distribution network. The Commission witness hasrelatives living both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in the UnitedStates; he was a resident of Houston, Texas and was employed asan engineer while involved in heroin trafficking. In the heroinoperation, a family member in Lahore sent couriers to JFK airportin New York with heroin concealed in false-bottom luggage. FromJFK, the couriers traveled "in transit" to La Guardia,then on to Toronto. Because of their "in transit"status, Customs Service officials did not search the travelers inthe United States, and Canadian Customs inspection was notdifficult to clear. In Canada, traffickers often held a particular heroin shipmentfor three to six months, until appropriate distribution contactswere established and it was certain that law enforcementofficials were not aware of the shipment. At that time,distribution contacts traveled by automobile to Toronto, pickedup a portion or all of the heroin shipment, and drove the heroininto the United States without Customs interdiction. Thisparticular network supplied heroin to Seattle, Houston, SanFrancisco, New York and Las Vegas. The contacts were all relatedby blood or marriage. Pakistanis also rely on the international postal system tomove drugs from Southwest Asia to the United States. In July1983, for example, U.S. Customs officials at JFK Airport seizedone kilogram of heroin concealed in rolled newspapers destinedfor Pakistani nationals residing in New York. The package hadbeen sent from the United Arab Emirates. Two other packages, eachcontaining one-half kilogram of heroin, were mailed to Berkeley,California from the same source. Rolled newspapers and magazinescan conceal up to one kilogram of heroin and are generally sealedin plastic. Drugs are also sent through the mail concealed inshipments of textiles, clothing and other durable goods. Lebanese Traffickers A portion of Golden Crescent heroin passes through Lebanon enroute to the United States, thus affording Lebanese nationals anopportunity to become involved in the trafficking activity. Asignificant percentage of the heroin exported from Lebanon leavesvia Damascus International Airport. In the United States, trafficking by Lebanese nationals isespecially prevalent in the Northeast. In one network,non-Lebanese couriers primarily from Canada traveled to Damascusand Beirut to pick up heroin which they then transported toHouston, Detroit and New York via commercial carrier. Heroin wasconcealed in false-bottom luggage and inside photo albums. Theheroin was transferred to Lebanese nationals living in Torontoand Ontario, Canada, and in various cities in the United States.Some of the money generated from the sale of this heroin waslaundered in banks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. India A proportion of the heroin traditionally distributed abroadthrough the Pakistan cities of Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta isnow being shipped through Bombay and New Dehli. Traffickerssmuggle Southwest Asian heroin into India along the Indo-Pakistanborder and transport it overland to the Indian cities; SoutheastAsian heroin is brought into Bombay and Calcutta by sea andoverland routes. Bombay, Calcutta and New Dehli are now majorstaging, shipping and trafficking centers for heroin smuggled tothe West. Trafficking activity is frequent at Perlane Airport inDehli and at Bombay's Sahar International Airport, and Indianharbors and airports are used by Pakistani, Afghan and Indiantraffickers as points of embarkation to Western destinations. West Africa. In the past three years, West African countries, especiallyNigeria, have been documented as transshipments centers forGolden Crescent heroin. Nigerian couriers based in Lagos travelto Pakistan to obtain heroin, then continue on commercial flightsto their final destinations, or return to Nigeria to repackagethe narcotics into smaller amounts for smuggling to the West. A number of loosely associated Nigerian heroin traffickingorganizations have connections both with suppliers in Pakistanand with retailers in Western Europe and the United States.Typically, Nigerian couriers travel directly to Karachi oncommercial aircraft and purchase heroin in that city, but somecouriers continue to Peshawar to make their purchases. Couriersreturn to Nigeria transiting other countries in Africa andEurope. A different group of couriers, usually students or poorresidents of Lagos, traffic the drugs to Europe or the UnitedStates. Couriers typically enter the United States directly throughJFK airport in New York although in some cases, they come to thiscountry via cities in Europe and Canada. Drugs are concealed inbody cavities, and in false-bottom suitcases. After the heroin arrives in the United States, it is sold onlyto one or two American distributors in a given area. Distributionnetworks are most active in New York City and Washington, D.C.and are operative in Los Angeles, Houston and Boston. DEA reportsthat individuals in nearly every community of Nigerian nationalsin the United States has some link to heroin traffickers andcouriers. Profits from heroin sales are laundered through banksin the United States in Britain. The Post-French Connection LCN Traditional organized crime continues to play a significantrole in this country's heroin trade through the 1980's. The LCN'slong established connections with criminal organizations inSicily facilitate the movement of heroin from Europe to theUnited States, and while Sicily is no longer a major refinery forheroin, the country is a major transshipment center for Southwestand Southeast Asian heroin. Sicilian organizations supply LCNaffiliates with heroin; LCN networks either distribute the drugthemselves or sell it in large quantities to major distributors. The LCN As A Supplier: The Nicky Barnes Operation Black criminal groups have controlled some percentage ofheroin traffic in New York City since the 1940's. Their influenceincreased significantly in the early 1970's, after the FrenchConnection. The first major independent black traffickingorganization, a group of over one hundred distributors andcouriers, was headed by Charles Green. The Green organizationimported heroin and cocaine from South America and distributedthe drugs throughout New York City during the late 1960's. Greenwas arrested in 1970, control of this heroin network passed toFrank Matthews. Matthews was brought in to the heroin business byLouis Cirillo, a major LCN associate, and was continuallysupplied with LCN heroin. Leroy "Nicky" Barnes succeeded Matthews in 1971.Under his leadership, the organization controlled heroin salesand manufacture throughout New York State into Canada andPennsylvania. The Barnes operation was well-organized andlucrative. By 1976, Barnes had at least seven major lieutenantsunder his direction; each of them controlled a dozen mid-leveldistributors, who in turn supplied up to forty street-levelretailers. Barnes at all times remained well insulated from thedaily trafficking activities, and maintained a wealthy lifestyle.He owned five homes, a Mercedes, a Maserati, several Lincolns,Cadillacs and Thunderbirds, and hundreds of suits and coats. Heestimates that his total trafficking income was at least severalmillion dollars. Barnes joined with six other major New York dealers to form aheroin cartel called the "Council" in the mid 1970's.Members of the Council pooled funds to purchase multi-kiloamounts of heroin, worked to ensure a consistent supply of thedrug in their distribution area, combined their"cutting" and distribution networks in certain cases,and often used a common sources for diluents, weapons,automobiles and other resources. The Council had specific"departments" which arranged legal services, securityand enforcement, and financial services including moneylaundering. Barnes' most significant source of heroin, to whom he directedother Council members, was LCN associate "Natty"Madonna. Despite Barnes' assertion and belief that the Councilworked completely independently of the Mafia, through the Madonnaconnection, LCN heroin was prevalent in Harlem traffic from 1972to 1976. The Asian-LCN Links La Cosa Nostra actively seeks out Asian nationals asconnections to heroin sources in Southeast Asia. In testimonybefore the President's Commission on organized crime, FranklinLiu, a veteran Hong Kong clothier, explained how he was recruitedas a courier for a New York La Cosa Nostra family involved inheroin trafficking. Liu, who held a legitimate four year businessvisa which allowed him to travel without restriction, was firstcontacted by Antonio Turano, a reputed member of the SicilianMafia, in connection with Turano's money laundering operations.In one instance, Turano brought Liu a suitcase filled with$400,000 cash, and requested that Liu wire the money to a bank inZurich. Turano met with Liu in Milan in the course of theoperation to make certain that the money had been wired withoutincident. At a later date, after Liu had successfully participated in anumber of money laundering operations, Turano asked Liu if he hadany connections to drug traffickers in the Far East; Liu did not.Turano arranged a connection, and agreed to pay Liu $5,000 forevery kilo of heroin he trafficked into the United States. Liuwas subsequently contacted by Turano's agent, a Thai woman, andarranged to meet her at a hotel in New York City. When they met,each held half of a one dollar bill given to them by Turano asidentification. Liu gave the woman his car keys; the next day shereturned the car with heroin in the trunk and requested a paymentof $40,000 in cash and a $60,000 bank check. When Liu went tocollect the money from Turano, he found that Turano had beenarrested. Liu was subsequently arrested and convicted on chargesof conspiracy to import heroin in connection with this case. The Pizza Connection During the late 1970's and early 1980's members of La CosaNostra in the United States allegedly cooperated with theSicilian Mafia in a drug trafficking conspiracy which resulted inthe importation of heroin worth over $1.6 billion into the UnitedStates. In April, 1984, 38 individuals were indicted on chargesrelated to the trafficking operation, popularly known as the"Pizza Connection." The network that developed tofacilitate the traffic in this enterprise was reputedly one ofthe largest heroin importation operations in history, and usedpizza parlors throughout this country to distribute heroinsmuggled from Southeast and Southwest Asia via Sicily to theUnited States. Additional heroin that was trafficked through thissystem was produced in laboratories operating in Sicily. According to the indictment in the case, the "PizzaConnection" heroin network relied upon a faction of the NewYork Bonanno organized crime family headed by Salvatore Catalanoto distribute the heroin in this country. In turn, the heroinbusiness of this Bonanno crime faction was tied directly toorganized criminal groups in Sicily, the rest of Italy,Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil. Direct evidence of the existenceof the network was first obtained in 1980 when couriers wereobserved transferring enormous amounts of cash through investmenthouses and banks in New York city to Italy and Switzerland. Tensof millions of dollars derived from heroin sales in this countrywere transferred overseas in this fashion, apparently inviolation of the Bank Secrecy Act. Investigations related to the "Pizza Connection"case have revealed that factions of the Sicilian Mafia operate inthe United States independently of the American La Cosa Nostra.While the two groups apparently cooperate on certain venturessuch as the "Pizza Connection" heroin importationoperations, they appear to be distinct and separate organizationsunder different leadership.

The volume of demand for marijuanaprecludes domination of the market by any group of traffickersand allows a constant influx of small-scale and mid-sizeoperators as limited suppliers. These smaller groups are in largepart able to enter the market because of marijuana'scomparatively low wholesale cost. While an investment of tens ofthousands of dollars is required for entry into the U.S. heroinor cocaine traffic, a capital investment of less than $10,000 isgenerally sufficient in the marijuana trade. Finally, althoughmarijuana is supplied to U.S. consumers by growers in Colombia,Mexico and Jamaica, nearly one-sixth of the U.S. supply isdomestically grown. Because significant amounts of the drug arecultivated in all 50 States, American traffickers need not travelto a foreign source country for a marijuana supply. While the barriers to entry in the U.S. marijuana traffic arerelatively low, marijuana sales generate a small profit incomparison to other illicit drugs. This is primarily becausemarijuana, unlike heroin or cocaine, in not diluted or"cut" in the intermediate phases of trafficking, but issold in much the same form at the wholesale and retail levels.Marijuana is bulky and difficult to transport in high-profitquantity: the profit generated from the retail sale of 700 poundsof commercial Colombian marijuana could most probably be equalledfrom the retail sale of one kilogram of diluted cocaine. Finally,trafficking marijuana implies increased risks of interdictionbecause the bulk of the drug makes it most visible to lawenforcement authorities. Despite the relative ease with which small-scale traffickerscan enter the marijuana market, only large criminal organizationshave the resources and connections necessary to generate largeprofits from marijuana trafficking. Many of these groups deal inother drugs in addition to marijuana, and are organized tofacilitate the movement of any drug to the United States withminimal interference from law enforcement authorities. Their sizeallows group control of all aspects of a trafficking venture fromcultivation through the wholesale transaction, thus eliminatingmiddlemen, decreasing costs and maximizing profit. Unlike smalleroperations, the major trafficking groups have the capitalrequired to purchase the large vessels, trucks, or planesnecessary for smuggling high profit multi-ton quantities ofmarijuana. A final advantage is their willingness to use violenceand corruption, the tools traditionally associated with organizedcrime, to ensure the success of smuggling ventures. Historical Context From the 1930's through the mid-1970's, Mexican growers andtraffickers supplied nearly all of the marijuana consumed in theUnited States. Most shipments of the drug were smuggled into thiscountry by car or truck; a small percentage was transported byair. The Mexican monopoly ended in 1975, when in a joint venture,U.S. and Mexican authorities increased marijuana interdiction anderadication efforts in major Mexican cultivation regions andalong the U.S. borders. Paraquat, a potent herbicide toxic tohumans, was used widely in the eradication program, andcontaminated much of the Mexican crop. Despite the interdictionefforts, a portion of the tainted marijuana was successfullysmuggled into the United States, and many Americans who smokedthe drug subsequently suffered adverse health consequences.Eradication and interdiction of the Mexican crop, compounded bythe American marijuana smokers' reluctance to purchase apotentially paraquat-tainted drug, resulted in a simultaneousdecrease in the availability of and the demand for Mexicanmarijuana. By 1979 Mexico supplied only an estimated 11 percentof the marijuana available in the United States and by 1981 thatfigure dropped to 4 percent. Concurrent with the commitment of more manpower and resourcesto marijuana eradication and interdiction efforts in Mexico,authorities in Jamaica, which was the source of the 10 percent ofthe American supply not originating in Mexico, mounted a similarcampaign. The Jamaican initiatives significantly reducedmarijuana production and trafficking in that country, andvirtually eliminated Jamaica from the American marijuana tradefor a number of years. During the mid-1970's America's two marijuana supply sources,traffickers in Mexico and Jamaica, had only small amounts of thedrug available for export. The resulting vacuum was swiftlyfilled by Colombian criminal groups, who for years had beeninvolved in smuggling all manner of contraband. Through the late1960's these groups increased cultivation of marijuana in remoteregions of the Guajira Peninsula and began to develop systems tofacilitate the transport of multi-ton quantities of the drug tothe United States. At the same time, many Colombian groups wereestablishing themselves as major operators in the cocaine trade:the organizational structures, trafficking routes and corruptedofficials necessary for cocaine ventures often proved equallyuseful for marijuana trafficking. Once the Colombians established a position as marijuanatraffickers, their role in the traffic expanded rapidly. By 1975airstrips capable of handling heavy 4-engine planes with thecapacity to hold one ton of marijuana were common along theGuajira Peninsula. Loading facilities for"motherships," large vessels capable of transportingtons of marijuana, dotted the coast. By the early 1980's aCongressional committee estimated that between 15 and 60 thousandtons of marijuana were exported from that country to the UnitedStates each year. In 1985 Colombia remains the major supplier of U.S. marijuana,but the Colombian share of the market has declined significantlysince 1980. This decrease is attributed to increased eradicationin Colombia and to accelerated interdiction along majortrafficking routes. Colombia's reduced production has been offsetby increased cultivation and trafficking both in Mexico andJamaica. Mexico, now ranked second in world marijuana production,could become the leading producer in 1986, given a Mexican bumperharvest and continuing eradication in Colombia. This short history of marijuana trafficking demonstrates thatlaw enforcement pressure in a particular cultivation area iscompensated by production and trafficking increases elsewhere.Trafficking organizations are positioned in all major sourcecountries to handle increased volume when opportunities present. Trafficking Today: Colombia Colombia supplied 42 percent of the marijuana consumed in theUnited States in 1984. The major percentage of this traffic wascontrolled by large Colombian criminal organizations. Although the Colombian marijuana crop is cultivated in severalregions of the country, the largest production occurs along theGuijara Peninsula. Colombian traffickers purchase marijuana fromgrowers, and sometimes provide protection and additionalfinancing for cultivation. Crops are harvested twice each year,with the largest harvest occurring in the fall. The harvestpattern directly affects the level of marijuana traffickingactivity between Colombia and the United States; trafficking isnaturally heaviest after the fall harvest. Nearly 90 percent of the marijuana exported from Colombia isshipped to the United States by sea; almost all the remainder istransported on general aviation aircraft. Both maritime and airtraffic are primarily concentrated along Colombia's north coast,although some percentage of the traffic is centered along thecountry's Pacific coast. The major portion of Colombian marijuana is shipped to theUnited States on large motherships. These ships are typicallyfishing vessels or freighters and can hold tons of marijuana; a100-foot mothership can transport SO tons and a 400 footmothership can ship over 100 tons of the drug. These ships,generally owned or at least controlled by Colombian traffickingorganizations, remain at sea or in selected Colombian ports untila shipment is prepared for export and transported to a beach sitealong the Colombian coast. There are more than 100 such sitesalong the north coast from Barranquilla to Portete, all which arelinked by a network of roads, trails and airstrips to the majorgrowing areas. When preparations are complete on shore, themothership moves into a prearranged loading point typicallyone-half to 3 miles offshore. Small boats then ferry bales ofmarijuana from shore to the mothership; loading of many tons maybe accomplished within an hour. Motherships are nearly alwaysloaded at night to decrease risks of detection. The loaded motherships generally either sail from the Guajiracoast directly to the southeastern United States or to Caribbeantransshipment points, where cargo is off-loaded for futurepickup. Traffickers use the same maritime routes popular withcocaine traffickers; the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti,the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and the MonaPassage, bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, aremost frequently traveled. From these routes American ports alongthe Gulf of Mexico and the east coast are accessible tosmugglers. In addition, a small percentage of Colombian ships nowsail directly to the U.S. west coast. Those motherships that approach the U.S. coast typically hover50-100 miles offshore in international waters. There, they aremet by small ships, typically purchased or rented shrimp boats,which off-load and ferry the drug shipment to shore. Whiletraffickers traditionally made no attempt to conceal bales ofmarijuana, either on motherships or on off-loading vessels,increased law enforcement surveillance has recently promptedsmugglers to hide their drugs in secret compartments or in emptyor false fuel tanks. The Colombian trafficking organization normally oversees thecultivation and export of marijuana only through the off-loadingprocedure. Off-loading is accomplished by "serviceproviders" who never actually own the marijuana, but whomerely collect a fee for its safe transfer. Once on the U.S.shore, the drug shipment is delivered to a distributor, who inturn supplies lower level dealers. The traffic below thewholesale distributor level is vast and not well-understood. Motherships that do not travel to the United States generallytransit the Bahamas and/or the Caribbean. In both regionsmarijuana traffickers can either transfer shipments frommotherships to smaller crafts, which sail to the United States,or they can unload and store shipments at island storage bases.Use of island transshipment points has increased as lawenforcement efforts have intensified along the southeastern U.S.coast. Rampant official corruption in a number of island nationsfacilitates this traffic. An estimated 3 percent of the marijuana shipped from Colombiato the United States by sea is transported on commercial vessels.Typically, marijuana is concealed in containerized cargo, but insome instances crewmen or cruise ship passengers have beendirectly implicated in trafficking the drug. In terms ofquantity, cargo shipment provides great opportunities fortraffickers and presents a decreased risk of interdiction. Air Shipment An estimated 10 percent of the marijuana smuggled fromColombia to the United States reaches this country via generalaviation aircraft or commercial air shipment. Non-commercial airshipment of marijuana parallels the Colombian air traffickingpatterns common in cocaine smuggling. Many of the same air routesand transshipment points are used; the same airstrips areaccessible along the north coast of the country, and the samemethods used to avoid law enforcement interference areapplicable. Smugglers use both smaller twin engine aircraft andlarger four-engine planes for marijuana transport. When airtransport allows faster shipment, it limits export quantities andincreases the likelihood of interdiction. A small portion of the marijuana exported from Colombia isshipped by aircraft, then air-dropped over sea or land for pickupand further shipment to the United States. Most airdrop activityoccurs in the Bahamas, but an increasing number of drops havebeen intercepted in the Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, Haiti, theDominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Medium-size to large twinengine aircraft are typically used for air-drop operations. In addition to trafficking marijuana to the United States ortransshipment points, Colombian organizations sell marijuanadirectly to non-Colombian traffickers, who assume responsibilityfor the shipment in Colombia. The buyers then traffic the druginto the United States using maritime and air shipment systemssimilar to the Colombian methods. Mexico Mexican marijuana production nearly doubled from 1983 to 1984,positioning Mexico as the second leading supplier of the drug tothe United States. An estimated 20 percent of the marijuanaavailable for consumption in the United States originates in ortransits Mexico, and that figure is expected to increase with abumper harvest in 1985. PEA analysts predict that this increasedproduction, with concomitant eradication and interdictionsuccesses in Colombia, could make Mexico the top Americanmarijuana source in 1985. Although marijuana is grown in nearly every state in Mexico,heaviest cultivation occurs in the northern and western states ofSonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Oaxaca and Cuerra. As in Colombia,crops are harvested twice each year, with the largest harvest inthe fall. Cultivation occurs both in small open fields and inwell-maintained, hundred-acre sites. Growers are typicallyoverseen and financed by larger trafficking organizations. Harvested marijuana is prepared for shipment near thecultivation fields. Mexican marijuana is transported to theUnited States by primarily overland methods, although aircraftare also used to smuggle drugs across the border. Overlandshipments are typically concealed in automobile trucks, falsetruck beds, camper tops and tanker trunks. The larger truckscommonly haul multi-ton quantities: U.S. officials at El Paso,Texas, seized nearly 6.5 tons of marijuana from a tanker truck inFebruary 1984, and nearly 30 tons from a cargo truck in March ofthat year. In addition, suitcases of marijuana are oftenforwarded on commercial bus lines to destinations beyond bordercheckpoints for subsequent pick-up. Air shipments generally run between private Mexican airstripsand clandestine runways or drop spots in the southwestern UnitedStates. Single engine aircraft are popular with Mexican smugglersbecause they can land on open fields, roadways and rough landingstrips common on both sides of the border, and typically carryabout 1,500 pounds of marijuana. While few details are availableconcerning marijuana air shipment, the great assortment ofairstrips on both sides of the border suggests a significantvolume of air traffic. A 1977 survey, for example, detectednearly 3,000 airstrips in Mexico; one-half of them wereconcentrated in ten major clusters. About 600 strips lie alongthe United States border and are ideally positioned to serveeither as launching sites for flights into the United States oras refueling stops for flights en route to this country fromsouthern Mexico. Strips in the other clusters most likely serveas refueling and transshipment points for aircraft travelingbetween South America and the United States. A large number ofairstrips in the southeastern United States serve as landingsites for the Mexican flights. Larger Mexican criminal organizations appear to control asignificant portion of the marijuana traffic between Mexico andthe United States. Many groups are active in both cocaine andheroin smuggling as well as marijuana trafficking. The centralorganizations are generally controlled by members of one extendedfamily, but often include non-family members in lower positions.Like other trafficking groups, the Mexicans rely consistently onan essential criminal support of attorneys, bankers and otherprofessionals, both in Mexico and in the United States. Prominent among the larger Mexican organizations are thegroups headed by Jamie Herrera Navarres, Rafael Caro Quintero,Ernesto Fonesca and Miguel Felix Gallardo. These groupscollaborate in smuggling ventures, much as the major Colombiancocaine trafficking organizations work in concert to maximizeresources and profits. In one recent instance, for example, aconsortium of traffickers led by Caro Quintero cultivatedhundreds of hectares of marijuana at five separate large-scalesites throughout the state of Chihuahua. All fields werelandscaped, fertilized and well-irrigated, demonstrating theMexican traffickers' knowledge of high-tech agriculturaltechniques. The cultivation sites, along with eight associatedprocessing camps, were seized by Mexican authorities in November1984. The seizures netted 10,000 metric tons of whole marijuana,or an estimated 1,900 to 2,400 tons of net marketable marijuana.In this single operation, officials confiscated 8 times moremarijuana than Mexican and American authorities at the timebelieved was produced annually throughout Mexico. The seizureraised serious questions both about the magnitude of drug trafficbetween Mexico and the United States and about continuingofficial corruption throughout Mexico. It seems highly unlikelythat an operation the size of the Chihuahua system could developor function without earlier detection by authorities. Jamaica Jamaica, from 1980 to 1984 this country's second leadingmarijuana supplier, provided 14 percent of the United Statesmarket share in 1984, trailing Colombia's 42 percent and Mexico's20 percent contributions. Jamaican traffickers, much less highlyorganized than their counterparts in Colombia and Mexico,supplied about 1800 metric tons of marijuana, as well as smalleramounts of sinsemilla and hashish oil to United States consumersin 1984. The greatest portion of Jamaican marijuana is transported tothe United States by general aviation aircraft, although somemaritime shipment also occurs. Over 70 island airstrips, one-halfof which are clandestine, facilitate the air traffic, whichcommonly includes shipment by single engine and light to heavytwin engine aircraft. Jamaican marijuana shipments are typicallyeither flown directly to United States landing sites or areair-dropped to small pleasure craft in waters near the Bahamas. Multi-ton marijuana shipments are occasionally transported tothe United States on small motherships, pleasure craft and cruiseships. A small percentage of Jamaican marijuana exported to theUnited States is concealed in containerized cargo on commercialmaritime vessels. The United States Crop The United States is currently a significant marijuana sourcecountry: about 12 percent of the marijuana consumed in the UnitedStates in 1984 was domestically cultivated. The largest crops aregrown in Hawaii, California, and Oklahoma, but there is now someproduction in every State. Growers can be landowners, but aretypically squatters who operate independently or in small groups.They cultivate their crops in Federal fields, forested land,private clandestine plots or greenhouses, scattering plants nextto trees or amid legitimate crops to avoid detection. Planting onFederal land offers growers the advantage of anonymity andshields them from recently enacted laws which authorize seizureof their property or other assets. Many plots, including those onFederal parkland are wired with devices, such as punji sticks,fish hooks hung at eye level, and trip wires attached to guns andboulders, designed to ensure the security of the crop. Growersare often armed and violent. There is presently no evidence of a highly developeddistribution system for the domestic marijuana crop in the UnitedStates. It appears that numerous smaller organizations trafficthe drug between states and that some individual growers supplylarger criminal organizations in major cities nationwide. Theseorganizations, which include both La Cosa Nostra groups andtrafficking specific groups, distribute domestic and importedmarijuana to brokers, retailers, and street-level dealers. Theextent of their control of the U.S. market is uncertain butestimated to be significant. The Role of the LCN In 1967 Federal officials reported that the LCN was notsignificantly involved In trafficking marijuana. Low profit wasthought to be the primary disincentive to La Cosa Nostrainvolvement; in addition, the large and loosely structured marketwas thought to be unattractive and uncontrollable. In the late1960's the United States marijuana supply was exported almostexclusively from Mexico. Entry into the trafficking businessrequired little capital and a simple border crossing, and thusattracted many small and independent operators. When Colombiabecame the major United States marijuana supplier in the early1970's, however, the LCN was provided with a more controllablesource. Concurrent with this production shift, the United Statesdemand for marijuana and the retail price level for the drugsteadily escalated, prompting some LCN families to becomeinvolved in trafficking marijuana. For a short period, thisactivity proved to be a high profit/low risk enterprise fortraditional organized crime. Additionally, trafficking marijuanacarried little of the social stigma associated with traffickingheroin or cocaine. As the following case study demonstrates, marijuanatrafficking has increased the vulnerability of some organizedcrime families and has led to a number of significant LCNarrests. Case Study: The Cleveland Connection In the mid-1970's, Carmen Zagaria, a Cleveland drug dealer,began to buy wholesale marijuana by the pound and sell it atretail in one ounce bags. He rapidly expanded his business in thecourse of a few years and developed a network of suppliers,couriers and distributors. Although the business prosperedgenerally, Zagaria lost a substantial investment in one foileddrug transaction in 1979 and borrowed money from Angelo Lonardo,the reputed underboss of the Cleveland LCN Licavoli family. Inreturn for the loan, the Licavoli family assumed control of theZagaria operation. Under Lonardo's oversight, the Zagaria enterprise expandedrapidly. By 1980 the organization was buying 400-800 pounds ofmarijuana per week and had incorporated over 20 couriers. PCP,LSD, cocaine and hashish were added to the traffic. The methods used by Zagaria were simple. His couriers flew tothe southeastern United States, usually to Florida via commercialairline, and established contact there with a Zagaria supplier.Suppliers included both LCN affiliates and non-LCN dealers.Couriers picked up large marijuana shipments, paid for them incash, and drove the drugs back to Cleveland in rental cars. InCleveland the shipments were stored in stash houses, thendistributed to a network of wholesalers and retailers. TheZagaria enterprise was a high-volume multimillion dollaroperation; in a single 10-day period in 1980 the group brought3,000 pounds of marijuana to Cleveland from Atlanta. In the course of his trafficking business Zagaria was involvedin numerous crimes, including murder. In 1982 he was convicted ofselling seven pounds of marijuana and 21 grams of cocaine and wassentenced to 10-30 years in prison. Zagaria became a Federalinformant and though never a member of the Licavoli familyhimself, provided sufficient testimony about family activities tobring the leadership before a grand jury. In 1983 Angelo Lonardoand five other Licavoli associates were convicted andincarcerated without possibility of parole for numerous crimes,including conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Other Drugs Millions of Americans abuse a number of licit and illicitdrugs other than heroin, cocaine and marijuana; these includestimulants, synthetic narcotics, hallucinogens, and depressants.Most popular among these dangerous drugs are diazepam (Valium),methamphetamine and PCP. In addition, controlled substanceanalogs known commonly as "designer drugs," have gainedpopularity with users since 1980. Dangerous drugs are available to the consumer from three majorsources. Many of the drugs are approved for medical use in theUnited States, and reach the illicit market through a variety ofdiversion methods. A significant portion of the United Statessupply of certain drugs, notably amphetamines and diazepam, isdiverted from licit channels in foreign countries and smuggledinto the United States. Finally, it is estimated that all the PCPand chemical analogs, nearly all the methamphetamine and about 80percent of the injectable amphetamine available on the illicitmarket in 1984 were produced in clandestine United Stateslaboratories. Only certain areas of the traffic in dangerous drugs clearlyreflect organized crime involvement. Most notably, the trafficappears to be dominated nationwide by outlaw motorcycle gangs.According to the Commission's survey of local law enforcementofficials, these gangs control nearly 40 percent of the"dangerous drug" traffic in the United States. Whilethese gangs have traditionally been active in trafficking a widevariety of illicit drugs, they have developed the technology tomanufacture methamphetamine and PCP, and have been a major forcein the wholesale and resale distribution of these two drugsnationwide. The major outlaw motorcycle gangs traffic dangerous drugswithin separate territorial boundaries: the Hell's Angels controlthe West Coast trade, the Outlaws dominate the Midwest and partsof the east coast, the Bandidos control the Southwest, andEastern Seaboard States are dominated by the Pagans. Officialsare uncertain of the total membership of the four groups, butestimate that nearly all the U.S. traffic in PCP, and up tothree-fourths of the illicit methamphetamine traffic falls undertheir control. The Hell's Angels, the oldest of the four groups, first becameinvolved in drug distribution in the late 1960's. Initially, thegroup trafficked marijuana, heroin, cocaine, seconal, PCP,amphetamines and methamphetamines. In the early 1970's theorganization recruited a chemist to manufacture methamphetamineand to instruct other organization members in the procedure.Hell's Angels' activity shifted as their production ofmethamphetamine increased and within a short period of time, theorganization dominated west coast methamphetamine manufacture anddistribution. In the eastern United States, the Pagan's gang leadership alsorecruited chemists and gained control of the methamphetamine andPCP markets from Florida to New England. Pagan drug activity iscentered in the Philadelphia/ South New Jersey area; severalPagan-controlled processing centers and small laboratories arelocated in the region. It is known by law enforcement officialsthat Pagan gang members have frequently cooperated in jointventures with the Philadelphia Bruno organized crime family,especially in methamphetamine and PCP manufacture anddistribution. Officials believe that the Bruno leadershipregularly finances a portion of Pagan drug activities in returnfor a percentage of the drug profits and enforcement andprotection services. In addition, it appears that the Pagans andthe Bruno family have arranged to divide control of themethamphetamine and PCP markets in certain territories and thatthe two groups coexist and cooperate in these regions. Case Study: The Pagan/Bruno Relationship. Between 1977 and 1981 both the Pagan motorcycle gang and theBruno organized crime family were active and competitivedistributors of methamphetamine throughout the mid-Atlanticstates. Both groups obtained P2P, an essential chemical inmethamphetamine production, from Ronald Raiton, the majorsupplier of the chemical in the eastern United States. Raitonsupplied P2P directly to Ronald Kownacki, a businessman closelyaligned with the Pagan leadership, and to Ronald Martorano, aBruno family associate. Though Kownacki and Martorano bothoperated in the Philadelphia area, their laboratories andclientele were distinct. Kownacki paid the Bruno family a $10,000 fee for every gallonof P2P he purchased from Raiton. He sold the methamphetamine heproduced to Pagan Walter "Buckets" Jozwiak, who cut thedrug and distributed it to Pagan mother club members in NewJersey, Delaware and Philadelphia. Martorano distributed hismethamphetamine through Bruno family channels. In 1980 Kownacki was assaulted and robbed by two Brunoassociates, who claimed they were collecting a debt owed to theBruno family. They stole a significant amount of gold fromKownacki, which he maintained belonged to the Pagans. In February1981 a number of Pagans confronted members of the Bruno familyand demanded that the gold be returned. The Bruno associatesrefused, but agreed to meet with the Pagans to negotiatedpossible joint ventures in trafficking methamphetamine and PCP.Finally in 1982 the Pagans and the Bruno family agreed that eachgroup would control methamphetamine and PCP markets in separateterritories and that competition between them in these areaswould cease. In 1983 after the agreement, the estimated streetvalue of the Pagan PCP and methamphetamine operations was $15.5million. Organized crime involvement in trafficking dangerous drugsother than methamphetamine and PCP in the United States is notwell-documented. La Cosa Nostra appears to be active intrafficking methaqualone from Colombia through Florida to majorUnited States cities, but the scope of their interest in thismarket is not known. Mexican traffickers have smuggledsignificant quantities of diazepam, methaqualone and amphetamineinto this country for at least ten years. A major portion of theillicit methaqualone traditionally available in this country wastrafficked to the United States by Colombian organized crimegroups; however, international controls adopted by virtually allmajor producing and exporting countries have led to worldwideshortage of the drug. The DEA currently reports that organized crime is not nowinvolved in the production or distribution of controlledsubstance analogs, "designer drugs." Given the enormousprofit potential of these substances, however, and the relativelysimple manufacturing processes required in their production, theformulation and distribution of controlled substance analogswould seem to be an endeavor perfectly suited to organized crime. Drug Trafficking, Terrorism, and Insurgency Drug trafficking organizations in many areas of the worldcoexist and cooperate with political insurgent groups andterrorists. Their typical relationship is mutually beneficial:traffickers supply terrorists with American currency and weaponsin return for protection and assistance in smuggling activities.While terrorists and insurgents do not currently controlsignificant portions of the drug trade, the profit potentiallyrealized from even isolated drug transactions could providesizable revenues for a militant cause. Terrorists and insurgentsfunded through drug trafficking could very conceivably becomepowerful enough to disrupt governments in a number of countriespresently allied with the United States, and thus pose a seriousthreat to this country's national security. The role of terrorists and insurgents in drug trafficking hasexpanded greatly since the early 1970's as drug trafficking hasspread across the world. At that time, heroin traffic wascontrolled by North American organized crime groups working withSicilian suppliers in the French Connection, marijuana wassupplied to the United States almost exclusively by Mexicantrafficking organizations, and cocaine traffic in this countrywas insignificant. Heroin now reaches North America from Europe,the Middle East, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Marijuana istrafficked to the United States by Colombian and Caribbean basedgroups as well as by Mexicans, and cocaine from nearly everycountry in South America satisfies a still-increasing demand forthe drug throughout this country. At the same time, the expanded United States market forillicit drugs has swelled the profit from trafficking to enormousproportions, and attracted terrorist and insurgent groups to thisactivity. In addition, this source of funding serves theideological purposes of many groups. As explained by terrorismexpert Michael Ledeen: Running drugs is one sure way to make big money in a hurry.Moreover, the directions of the flow are ideologicallyattractive. Drugs go to the bourgeois countries, where theycorrupt and where they kill, while the arms go to pro-Communistterrorist groups in the Third World. The links between terrorist and insurgent groups andtraffickers are most substantial in drug source countries,including Colombia, Peru, Burma and Thailand. In Colombia, fourmajor insurgent organizations work in collaboration with cocainetraffickers. The oldest, largest, and best-equipped of thesegroups is the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC), whichis the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) andclaims over 5,000 active members and supporters. The FARC forcesconsist of between 23 and 28 "fronts," essentiallyindependent company-level forces, nearly all of which are locatedin Colombia's rural areas. Over one-half of the fronts operate incoca and marijuana growing regions. FARC forces cultivate somecoca, but derive more profit by collecting protection paymentsfrom coca growers in their operating territory, often demanding a10 percent share of the drug profits. One FARC front reportedlyobtained over $3.8 million per month by assessing this protectiontax. Collected monies are used to buy weapons and supplies whichare often shipped into Colombia on return drug flights. Two FARCfronts have had documented direct dealings with cocainetraffickers to obtain arms and ammunition. In exchange for the levied fee, the FARC forces protectgrowing and trafficking areas, including air fields, and warntraffickers of nearby anti-narcotics police or military patrols.In certain areas of Colombia FARC fronts control enough strategicpoints to make police travel difficult or impossible. FARC encampments have recently been discovered in closeproximity to several major cocaine processing centers. Forexample, on April 6, 1984, during a raid of a fully operationalprocessing center in Southeast Colombia known as "LaLoma," officials discovered and subsequently destroyed aFARC guerrilla base camp. The FARC camp, complete with airstripsand large stockpiles of food and medical supplies, that group'sdirect involvement in providing protection for the cocainetraffickers. A month prior to the La Loma raid, when authoritiesraided another processing center nearby known as Tranquilandia,they were met by approximately 30 armed resistors in fatigueuniforms believed to be FARC members. A number of other militant organizations in Colombia have alsobeen associated with the drug trade. The leftist 19th of Aprilmovement (M-19) has been most notable for its October 1985takeover of the Colombian Palace of Justice in which 11 of thatcountry's Supreme Court Justices were murdered. Although M-19 wasonce hostile to traffickers, and on several occasions kidnappedrelatives of prominent drug smugglers, some officials maintainthat the October incident was related to drug trafficking. It isalleged that the attack was motivated by the M-19's desire todestroy records that might lead to the extradition a number ofmajor Colombian cocaine traffickers, and to intimidateauthorities in Colombia to force them to rescind the extraditiontreaty in effect between that country and the United States. M-19also at least once traded drugs for arms from Cuba throughColombian trafficker Jaime Guillot-Lara. In the early 1970's to1982 Guillot supplied M-19 with weapons in return for theirassistance in his drug smuggling activities through high-rankingCuban officials. The Cubans provided a safe haven for Guillot'sdrug smuggling vessels en route to the United States fromColombia in return for payments. M-19 received periodic weaponsshipments for facilitating the arrangement on Guillot Lara'sreturn trips to Colombia from the United States. In Peru, where an estimated 40 percent of the world coca cropis grown, insurgents and traffickers share much the samerelationship evidenced by the Colombians. Insurgents and growerswork in the same remote areas, primarily in the upper HuallagaValley, but operate separately. Smugglers supply arms and moneyare supplied in return for militant protection. The two groups donot maintain a structured relationship or pursue common goals;their collaboration is one of convenience. The most prominent insurgent group currently operating in Peruis the Maoist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), which seeks arural-based revolution to rid the predominantly peasantpopulation of the "imperialistic" influences of theUnited States and other foreign governments. While existingevidence is insufficient to link the Shining Path to the drugtrade, the group has incited peasants, many of whom make theirliving from coca cultivation, to rebel against anti-coca projectsin major growing areas. During 1984 several anti-coca projects,including a United States-supported crop substitution program,were attacked by armed mobs, resulting in many injuries anddeaths. In Southeast Asia a number of political insurgent groups relyprincipally on heroin smuggling to finance their activities. Theycontrol or influence the main areas of opium production innortheastern Burma, where the Burmese government does not exertauthority. The insurgents range from ideological revolutionarieslike the Burmese Communist Party (BCP), to ethnic separatists,such as the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), and opiumwarlords, like the Shan United Army (SUA). All of these groups,whatever their professed objectives, are heavily involved in theproduction, transport or sale of heroin. In Burma, where 90 percent of the southeast Asian opium cropis grown, the BCP controls an estimated two-thirds of the majoropium production areas and levies a protection tax oncultivators. While the BCP has traditionally controlled opiumcultivation and the SUA has exclusively dominated associatedrefining and trafficking activities, the BCP has recently begunto engage in processing and sales, and the groups have come intoconflict. The BCP remains an active political insurgency whilethe SUA now concentrates its resources almost entirely on thedrug trade. In Thailand the link between insurgency and drug traffickingis much weaker. Although Burmese groups operated with relativeimpunity on both sides of the Burma/Thailand border in the early1980's, government initiatives in Thailand have severelydisrupted their activities. The only indigenous Thai insurgentgroup of any consequence, the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT),is reportedly ready to engage in drug trafficking, but has beenkept under control by Thai security forces. In the Middle East, nearly all the militant groups engage instruggle in Lebanon - Palestinians, Phalangists, Druze andShiites - reportedly are financed in some part by the drug trade.Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is the site of significant hashishproduction; heroin laboratories are also believed to exist in thearea. Terrorists throughout that area can and do enter the drugtrade, either directly or by protecting drugs transshippedthrough regions they control. Armenian terrorists are also active in Lebanon, especially inBeirut, where Armenian nationals are heavily involved in drugtrafficking. In 1980 Noubar Sofoyan, an Armenian heroin andhashish trafficker connected with the right-wing JusticeCommandos of the Armenian Genocide, was indicted in the U.S. forheroin smuggling. Sofoyan allegedly helped fund the 1976 bombingof a Turkish installation in Zurich. He was arrested in Greece ondrug charges in 1981 and was subsequently extradited to Lebanonand released; he remains a fugitive today. Traffickers as Terrorists While drug traffickers are not by definition terrorists orinsurgents, they rely heavily on terrorist tactics to obtainlimited political objectives. The use of threats, violence,assassination and kidnapping by trafficking organizations toprevent vigorous enforcement of drug laws can only be categorizedas terroristic in nature. The use of terrorist tactics is most evident among traffickersin Colombia, Peru and Mexico. In Colombia much of the violencecenters on the issue of the extradition of reputed Colombian drugtraffickers to the United States for trial. The extradition issuehas become prominent in the past two years under ColombianPresident Belisario Betancur, and has prompted unprecedentedlevels of terrorism by traffickers. Two key members of theColombian government, Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara-Bonillaand Justice Ministry Assistant Eduardo Gonzalez, both outspokensupporters of the implementation of the United States/Colombiaextradition treaty, were murdered reportedly by traffickers in1984. The Colombian judiciary, the body responsible both for theinvestigation of drug cases and the disposition of extraditionrequests, has been targeted by traffickers. Twenty-four judges,among them the judge investigating the Lara assassination, havebeen murdered in the past two years. Americans have also beensingled out: Colombian traffickers have reportedly offered a$350,000 bounty for the murder of any top DEA official in theUnited States or in Colombia, and have threatened to kill fiveAmericans for every reputed Colombian drug trafficker extraditedto the United States. In Peru drug-related violence has been increasing since 1983,and has specifically targeted anti-drug efforts in the UpperHuallaga Valley. A series of violent attacks by traffickers onpolice units and eradication workers in that area led to theNovember 1984 torture and murder of 19 members of a UnitedStates-financed coca-eradication team, and subsequently to thebrutal murder of 17 United States financed eradicators by about50 traffickers armed with submachine guns less than one yearlater. Dozens of people in Peru, including policemen, mayors andfarmers have been reported killed in the past year in attacksattributed to cocaine traffickers. In Mexico trafficking violence culminated in the Februarykidnapping, torture and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camerena anda Mexican pilot. Camerena's abduction occurred shortly afterMexican police, alerted by DEA, raided the largest marijuanaplantation ever discovered in that country and seized anestimated 8,500 tons of marijuana. In the course of the searchfor Camerena, five persons, including a police officer, werekilled. Mexican trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero is being held byMexican authorities in connection with the Camerena murder. Thetrafficking-related violence in Mexico escalated further inNovember 1985, when 17 police officers and other members of ananti-drug team working in southern Mexico were lured into anambush, tortured, and killed by a large group of drug traffickersarmed with automatic weapons. Government Complicity A number of hostile foreign governments, motivated either by aneed for hard American currency, or by a more ideological desireto undermine governments in Europe and the United States,actively facilitate drug trafficking activities. Cuban andNicaragua blatantly aid traffickers smuggling drugs from Colombiato the United States; the Bulgarian government assiststraffickers transporting drug shipments from Southwest Asia toWestern Europe. All three countries are geographicallywell-positioned to serve as transshipment points for drugs enroute to Europe or the United States, and all allow traffickingroutes to cross through their sovereign territory, thus providinga way for traffickers to circumvent drug-interdictionauthorities. Cuba Reports of Cuban government involvement in drug traffickingfirst surfaced in the early 1960's, but were in large measureunsubstantiated. A series of reports in the 1970's subsequentlysuggested Cuban Government involvement, but did not provide solidevidence of such activity. In the early 1980's, however, the linkbetween the Cuban government and Colombian drug traffickers wasdocumented. In November 1982, the United States District Courtindicted four major Cuban officials on charges of conspiracy tosmuggle drugs; those indicted included the former CubanAmbassador to Colombia, two officials of the Cuban CommunistParty, and the Vice Admiral of the Cuban Navy. All four officialswere involved in facilitating the trafficking activities ofColombian Jaime Guillot-Lara, reputedly a major marijuana,cocaine and methaqualone trafficker. The Cuban officials,according to the indictment, agreed to allow Cuba to be used as asupply and loading center for Lara's ships transporting drugs tothe United States, and permitted him to navigate drug vesselsthrough Cuban waters to evade United States interdictionauthorities. The Cuban Government reportedly expected largepayments for their role in this traffic; on one occasion, thegovernment was to receive approximately $800,000 from the sale of10 million methaqualone pills and approximately 23,000 pounds ofmarijuana. In addition to facilitating maritime trafficking, recentreports indicate that drug traffickers regularly fly throughotherwise tightly controlled Cuban airspace. Traffickersapparently have an assigned corridor which they can transitwithout challenge from Cuban air defenders. Cuba also reportedlyallows Colombian traffickers to off-load drugs to other carriersfor the final journey to the United States. It is often difficult in drug trafficking cases to make adistinction between corrupt high-ranking government officials andgovernment-sanctioned involvement in the drug trade. Given,however, the tight controls exerted by the Castro government'ssecurity apparatus over foreign travel and communications, thedrug-related activities which have occurred in Cuba in recentyears almost certainly were known and approved by that country'shighest ranking officials. According to the Department of State: . . . the evidence clearly indicates more than a case ofcorruption by local or mid-level security officials in Cuba . . .Narcotics trafficking has apparently been sanctioned by Cuba as ameans to finance subversion in Latin America. Nicaragua Since 1981, the United States has received a steady stream ofintelligence indicating that Nicaragua is used by drugtraffickers as a transshipment point between Colombia and theUnited States, and that officials of the revolutionary governmentthere, the Sandinista Directorate, are involved in the drugtrade. Evidence further suggests that enforcement measuresimplemented by Colombian President Betancur have promptedColombian traffickers, notably Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar, torelocate their cocaine processing facilities to Nicaragua. The best evidence to date of the link between the Nicaraguangovernment and Colombian drug traffickers came to light in 1984.In that year, pilot Adler Barriman Seal, a former Ochoa cocainetrafficking pilot working then with the DEA in an undercovercapacity, reported that Escobar and Ochoa had agreed in April1984 to use Nicaragua as a cocaine smuggling base. At Ochoa'srequest, Seal flew 750 kilos of cocaine in June, 1984 fromColombia to an airfield just northwest of Managua. The airfieldwas used generally as a joint facility by the Nicaraguan armedforces and the Ministry of the Interior. Seal's aircraft wasdamaged in the landing, and according to Seal, Frederico Vaughn,a personal assistant to Interior Minister Thomas Borge, arrangedfor him to return to the United States in another plane. Laterthat June, Seal returned to the airfield in a C-123 aircraft,equipped with a hidden camera, to retrieve the drugs. Both Vaughnand Escobar, escorted by Nicaraguans in uniform and recorded onvideotape, personally helped Seal load the cocaine into theaircraft. Vaughn was paid $1.5 million for providing theColombian traffickers "secure facilities." In July 1984, Seal made another trip to Nicaragua from theUnited States to bring supplies for a new cocaine processingcomplex under construction there. In a subsequent tapedconversation with Seal, Frederico Vaughn stated that theprocessing center was ready for use. Eleven persons, including Vaughn, were indicted by a Federalgrand jury on charges stemming from this trafficking arrangement.All remain at large. It is highly unlikely that these traffickingactivities occurred without the knowledge and consent of theSandinista government. Bulgaria Since the late 1970's, reports that many drug dealers,especially Turkish nationals, operate out of semi-permanent basesin Bulgaria have been in circulation. The allegations againstBulgaria include charges that the Bulgarians, primarily throughan official government trading firm, Kintex, officially sanctionthe sale of illicit drugs to Western Europe and use the proceedsfrom those sales to finance illegal arms transactions and tobankroll terrorist groups. There are consistent reports thattop-ranking members of the Bulgarian Security Service orex-Bulgarian ministers comprise the directorate of Kintex. Certain smugglers are reportedly permitted to conductactivities within Bulgaria. In effect, Bulgarian officials,though Kintex, assign representatives to establish feearrangements with smugglers for bartered contraband. Smugglerstrafficking through Bulgaria are primarily Turkish nationals ofKurdish background, but include Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese andEuropean nationals. Corruption The Role of the Corrupt Official The corrupt official is the sine qua non of drug trafficking.By the corruption of his office, he protects the interest oftraffickers in all phases of growing, processing and smugglingillicit drugs. Officials "from the lowly constable onup" are bribed and subverted by traffickers. Mexico While United States officials and investigators commonlyacknowledge that corruption among the ranks of both the MexicanFederal Judicial Police and the Directorate of Securityfacilitates drug trafficking in and through that country, theyare hesitant to make open accusations concerning the relationshipbetween corrupt officials and traffickers. Their reasoning ispersuasive: Mexico is a neighbor and an ally, a politically andeconomically unstable one at that. The government of PresidentMiguel de la Madrid appears sincere in its efforts to improve thequality of drug law enforcement throughout the country.Nonetheless, mounting evidence prompted the Department of Stateto assert in its 1985 mid-year report to Congress that: There are strong indications that the Mexican [drug] programhas been less effective over the past two years, and thatcorruption is playing a major role in this decline. Drug-related corruption among members of Mexico's Federalpolice force, which was widespread and well-publicized in the1970's, continues to undermine anti-drug efforts in that country.Allegations of corruption surfaced in March 1985, after DEA agentEnrique Camarena Salazar and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelarwere kidnapped and murdered in Guadalajara. Six Mexican policeofficers were indicted on charges related to the Camarena murder;they were charged with assisting drug traffickers through"protection of personnel and goods, custody of drugs intransit, as well as continuing services of information." Thearrested officers have reportedly confessed that drug traffickersoffered them between $200 to $6,250 a month for officialprotection. In connection with the Camarena case, DEA officials maintainthat Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes, the First Commandante of theMexican Federal Judicial Police, who directed the investigationinto the Camarena murder, accepted a bribe from the traffickersuspect in the killing, Rafael Caro Quintero, and in returnallowed Caro to leave Guadalajara. Later apprehended in CostaRica, Caro claimed in a confession that he paid Pavon Reyes$265,000 to avoid arrest at the Guadalajara airport. Despite hisdenials of the charges, Pavon Reyes was indicted for the crime inMexico in April 1985. United States pressure after the Camerena murder andsubsequent revelations of corruption prompted a number of quickresponses from the Mexican Government. President de la Madridannounced a major reorganization and consolidation of the policeforces under stronger Federal control; the governor of oneMexican state dismissed that state's entire judicial system,including the state attorney general, police and administrativepersonnel; and a reported 100 agents of the Federal SecurityDirectorate, a political police force and counterintelligenceunit run by the Interior Ministry, resigned in the face ofcorruption allegations. Corruption in at least some Mexicaninstitutions, however, appears to be deeply embedded and notlikely to be eliminated quickly or easily. At the end ofSeptember, 1985, six months after the Camerena murder, evidenceof Mexican corruption continued to surface as the members of theUnited States Fraternal Order of Border Patrol Agents chargedthat: Mexican federal agents, using the latest in radio andscanner-equipped cars and armed with automatic weapons, have beenproviding transit security for huge loads of domesticallyproduced marijuana and heroin and in-transit cocaine. Bahamas and Caribbean The Bahamas and a number of Caribbean countries serve as amajor refueling transshipment points for traffickers transportingillicit drugs from Mexico and South America to the United States.Corruption among officials at all levels throughout thesecountries appears to be widespread. Drug-related corruption has reached the highest offices ofgovernment in the British-held Turks and Caicos Islands, where inMarch 1985, that country's Chief Minister, Norman Saunders, wasconvicted of conspiracy to travel in furtherance of a drug plotand on five counts of traveling in furtherance of in illicit drugtransaction. Saunders, the first foreign head of state to beconvicted on drug charges, was found not guilty of more seriouscharges of conspiracy to smuggle marijuana and cocaine. Trialwitnesses testified that Saunders accepted a total of $50,000 toallow drugs to move freely through his island chain. He plannedto use the islands as a "safe-haven" for traffickerssmuggling illicit drugs from Colombia to the United States.Stafford Missick, Minister of Commerce and Development in theSaunders government, was convicted of conspiracy to importcocaine and marijuana in the case; a third indicted Turks andCaicos official, Aulden Smith, has not yet been tried. In the Bahamas, a 1984 Commission of Inquiry investigatingdrug trafficking through the Islands reported that Bahamianofficials "from policemen to cabinet minister" allowedthe Islands to be used as a transshipment point for illicit drugsin return for sizeable bribes. A majority of the three-manCommission concluded that no credible evidence directly tiedBahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling to the drug-relatedcorruption, but noted that Pindling's bank accounts reflecteddeposits of $3.5 million in excess of his salary between 1977 and1983. The Commission of Inquiry noted that a number of the FamilyIsland Commissioners, the representatives of the centralgovernment on nearly all the Bahamian Islands: claimed they either had no direct knowledge of drugtrafficking or had never received any complaints regarding suchactivity . . . We find that to be quite remarkable and we do notbelieve that they were being candid with us . . . they could nothelp but know what was going on in relation to drug trafficking.We have concluded that there must have been a degree ofacquiescence on their part . . . The Commission report also charged that Colombian cocainetrafficker Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas operated an extensivecocaine enterprise in the Bahamian Island of Norman's Cay from1978 until 1982, and the Lehder paid "substantialbribes" to various ranks of policemen and customs officialsto facilitate his illicit drug activities. Former trafficker Luis Carcia, who transshipped marijuana andcocaine through the Bahamas on a regular basis in the late 1970'sand early 1980's testified before the President's Commission onOrganized Crime that he had: . . . never seen corruption such as there is in the Bahamas.The policemen used to plead with me to use airstrips in theirterritory so they could received the pay-off . . . sometimesoff-duty police unloaded the stuff from the plane and into theboats for me . . . we always operated out of the Bahamas becauseof the total corruption there. South America Official corruption has seriously hindered anti-drug effortsthroughout South America, especially in Bolivia and Peru.Throughout Bolivia during the 1980's regime of General GarciaMeza, corruption among high-level officials charged with drugenforcement was so rampant that "the government itselfbecame an international drug trafficker." Despite thesubsequent efforts the current Bolivian government to moreeffectively enforce drug control laws, corruption at all levelsof the Bolivian government remains a major problem. In 1983, forexample, Bolivian authorities arrested two suspected traffickerswith a small amount of cocaine and confiscated a 14,000 acreranch and two airplanes belonging to them. Two weeks later, themen were transferred to the authority of a local prosecutor whosubsequently released them and returned their possessions.According the reports, at least $250,000 in bribes were paid toBolivian police and government officials for the release of thetwo traffickers. In August 1985, officials in Peru began a drug corruptioninvestigation that country's entire Interior Ministry afterauthorities discovered direct telephone lines linking reputedcocaine trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopes to officials at theMexican Consulate in Peru. Officials also found a government carbelonging to a top aid of former Interior Minister and PrimeMinister Luis Percovich parked in front of Lopes' home. These are a few among many examples. Corruption linked to drugtrafficking is a widespread phenomenon among political andmilitary leaders, police and other authorities in virtually everycountry touched by the drug trade. The easily available andenormous amounts of money generated through drug transactionpresent a temptation too great for many in positions of authorityto resist.

In this chapter, there is only apassing reference to an opium law restricting trade by theChinese.

Chapter IV Part 1: Federal Drug Strategy... Federal Drug Strategy: Origins, Evolution, and Current Status Introduction The Federal response to the national problems of drug abuseand drug trafficking over the years has been both dynamic andcharacterized by frustration. Drug use and its concomitantorganized crime effects continue to challenge the Nation todevelop a more effective and sophisticated response. Typically, aparticular Federal enforcement reaction to drug abuse and drugtrafficking has prompted drug traffickers and drug abusers totake defensive actions, which in turn have required new ordifferent governmental responses. This reactive process has beenparticularly characteristic of the Federal effort over the lasttwo decades. The history of Federal drug policy that follows demonstratesthat approaches to reduce supply have been the preferred anddominant Federal response over the last 75 years. It is onlyrelatively recently that the nature of the drug supply-demanddynamic has become widely understood, leading to an increasedappreciation for and emphasis on programs to reduce demand, andthat there is still no consensus on what the role of the Federalgovernment in the national campaign against drug trafficking anddrug abuse should be. The Early Years Although use of drugs has been viewed by many Americans as amedical problem or a personal moral shortcoming throughout thiscountry's history, laws regulating or proscribing such use are ofrelatively recent vintage. The first significant piece ofprohibitory legislation relating to drugs in the United Stateswas an ordinance enacted in 1875 by the city of San Franciscoprohibiting the operation of opium dens, commercialestablishments in which the smoking of opium occurred. Onewestern state after another followed San Francisco's lead andenacted legislation prohibiting opium smoking. Within eight yearsof the passage of the San Francisco ordinance, Congress raisedthe tariff on smoking opium, which was a relatively mild form ofopium, from $6 to $10 a pound; the tariff on opium had first beenimposed in 1842. In 1887, apparently in response to obligationsimposed upon the United States by a Chinese-American commercialtreaty negotiated in 1880, Congress prohibited the importation ofsmoking opium by Chinese subjects. Despite these firstlegislative efforts, the incidence of drug use and addictionincreased, as did societal concern and illegal drug smuggling. Although estimates concerning the number of drug addictsduring the 50 years prior to the passage of drug legislation in1914 are inherently suspect, the available information suggeststhat drug abuse during that period was a "majormedico-social problem." In fact, by 1909, the United Stateswas confronted with a significant and growing drug problem. Theincreased opiate use and addiction in the United Statessubsequent to the Civil War has been attributed to severalfactors, including the indiscriminate use of morphine to treatbattlefield casualties during the Civil War. The increase inmorphine addiction was such that the phrase "armydisease" was used to describe the drug use amongex-soldiers. The widespread administration of morphine byhypodermic syringe also contributed to the increase in opiateabuse. Other circumstances, which exacerbated the situationduring the period of 1865-1914, included the spread of opiumsmoking from Chinese immigrants to American citizens, the use ofopium and its derivatives by the American patent medicineindustry, and the marketing of heroin beginning in 1898 as asafe, powerful, and non-addictive substitute for the opiumderivatives morphine and codeine. The American Opium Commission, established by an Act ofCongress in early 1908, investigated domestic opium use duringthat year. In response to the results of this investigation,Congress passed "An Act to Prohibit the Importation and Useof Opium for Other Than Medicinal Purposes" in 1909, whichamong other things, permitted the importation of opium formedicinal purposes but only to 12 ports of entry. However, it didnot regulate domestic opium production and manufacture or theinterstate shipment of opium products: Opium products were still available without a physician'sprescription and were being marketed throughout the countrythrough retail outlets and a growing mail order trade. Another motivation for the passage of the 1909 Act was therealization that the United States could not continue to advocatemeasures to ameliorate the opium problem in the Far East withouttaking serious steps to deal with its own "homeproblem." Although considered a necessary first step, the1909 Act was subsequently adjudged to be seriously defective inthat it "contain[ed] no provision against the possibleintrastate manufacture of smoking opium. It [did] no more thanexclude this form of the drug from the United States."Because few States had effective laws against the manufacture ofsmoking opium in addition to the proscriptions on its sale anduse, that gap could frustrate the objectives of Federal and Statelaws. Shortly before the enactment of the Act of 1909 anInternational Opium Commission, consisting of the representativesof 13 nations was convened in Shanghai at the initiative of theUnited States. The Shanghai Commission has been described as the"first international effort at the solution of the opiumproblem." Although originally conceived of as anorganization for investigating Far East opium use andtrafficking, the Shanghai Commission was transformed into a bodyfor examining worldwide opium use and trafficking because opiumaddiction had spread to other parts of the world, especially tothe United States, and because producer countries were notrestricted to the Far East. The Shanghai Convention unanimouslyadopted several resolutions for consideration by the governmentsof the participating nations, including the following three: (1) Consider the desirability of reviewing each country'ssystem of regulation of the use of opium in light of thediscrepancies among countries' regulatory systems; (2) Adopt measures to prevent the exporting of opium and itsderivatives to countries which prohibit the importation of suchitems; and (3) Take measures for the gradual suppression of opium smokingin each country's own territories and possessions. Because of the unanimity achieved by the Shanghai Commission,the United States on September 1, 1909, proposed to the otherparticipating countries that an international conference be heldto "conventionalize the resolutions adopted at Shanghai andtheir necessary consequences." The conference, which washeld at The Hague, began on December 1, 1911, and resulted in thesigning of the International Opium Convention on January 23,1912. The Convention was ratified by the United States Senate onOctober 18, 1913. The International Opium Convention committedits signatories to the enactment of laws designed to suppress the"abuse of opium, morphine, cocaine as well as drugs preparedor derived from these substances . . . In response to thisinternational obligation and to domestic considerations, theUnited States passed the Harrison Act on December 17, 1914 (Ch.1, 38 Stat. 785) , which "became the cornerstone of domesticnarcotics policy" for nearly 65 years. The Harrison Act: 1914-1936, Early Years of Enforcement Section 1 of the Harrison Act provided that any person who wasin the business of dealing in the covered drugs was required toregister annually and to pay a special annual tax of one dollar.Section 2 made it illegal for any person to sell or in any way togive away any of the covered drugs, except pursuant to thewritten order of the person to whom the drug was being sold orgiven; the written order was required to be on a form issued bythe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 4 made it unlawfulfor anyone who had not previously registered and paid the specialtax, required by Section 1 of the Act, to engage in interstatetrafficking in the drugs listed. With the exception of employeesof registrants and patients of physicians and dentists, Section 8prohibited the possession of any of the drugs covered by the Actby any person who had not registered and paid the special taximposed by Section I. Section 9 provided that the punishment forany violation of the Act was to be not more than $2,000 or notmore than 5 years in prison or both. Finally, Section 10 gave theCommissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to the approval of theSecretary of the Treasury, the responsibility for enforcing theAct. The history of enforcement under the Harrison Act wastremendously affected by Congress' chosen source of authority forthe legislation, its constitutional power to lay and collecttaxes. The principle of Federalism and the related concept of theStates' police power were effective constraints on the scope ofthe Federal government's powers at the time of the Harrison Act,hence the use of the constitutional authority to tax to regulatedrug-related activity. Because the Harrison Act was superficially a measure designedto raise revenue, its stated purpose dictated that theenforcement of the Statute be the responsibility of the TreasuryDepartment and, by the statute's own terms, of the Commissionerof Internal Revenue. Despite its revenue-raising veneer, itsregulatory purpose was acknowledged from the beginning: Certain individuals viewed the Harrison Act as a rational wayto limit addiction and drug abuse through taxation andregulation. It was a regulatory device which, according to theAmerican opium Commission, "would bring the whole trafficand use of these drugs into the light of day and, therefore,create a public opinion against the use of them that would bemore important, perhaps, than the Act itself" (Dr. HamiltonWright, American Opium Commission). The Act was heralded as amethod of drug abuse control and as a public awareness tool. The history of early enforcement efforts under the HarrisonAct, and of the nation's drug abuse problem and policy generally,was affected in no small degree by a series of Supreme Courtdecisions that were handed down during the decade immediatelyfollowing passage of the Act. The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of theHarrison Act in United States v. Doremus. In deciding the issuesraised by the Government's appeal of the dismissal of theindictment against a physician who had been registered under theAct, the Supreme Court set forth general principles that governedits resolution of the issues: If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to theexercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution,it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives whichinduced it. * * * The Act may not be declared unconstitutional because itseffect may be to accomplish another purpose as well as theraising of revenue. If the legislation is within the taxingauthority of Congress - that is sufficient to sustain it. The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of Section 2of the Act on the ground that it did relate to the raising ofrevenue. On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Doremus, italso answered in Webb v. United States the following question inthe negative: whether an order for morphine, which is issued by aphysician to a habitual user who is not under his professionalcare and which is issued not for the purpose of curing the habitbut for maintenance, is a "prescription." It did sobecause it concluded that "to call such an order . . . aphysician's prescription would be so plain a perversion ofmeaning that no discussion of the subject is required." The Court extended its Webb Ruling in United States v. Behrmanby holding that an order issued by a physician for large doses ofproscribed drugs, which were not prescribed for the purpose oftreating a condition other than the addiction itself and whichwere to be self-administered by the addict, to a person, who wasaddicted and who was under the physician's personal care,constituted a violation of the Harrison Act. In doing so, theCourt implicitly agreed with the district judge that"prescriptions in the regular course of practice did notinclude the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in suchquantity to addicts as charged in the indictments." The Harrison Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, was thestatutory framework within which Federal drug strategies weredevised and implemented over the next half-century. However,early enforcement efforts and priorities under the Harrison Actdid have somewhat unintended and undesirable consequences. As noted previously, the responsibility for enforcement of theHarrison Act was given initially to the Commissioner of Revenue,subject to review by the Secretary of the Treasury. In 1915, 162collectors and agents in the Miscellaneous Division of theInternal Revenue Service were given the responsibility under theHarrison Act for restricting the sale of proscribed drugs.Meanwhile, the administration and enforcement of the NationalProhibition or the Volstead Act, which was adopted to enforce theEighteenth Amendment, was committed to the Commissioner ofInternal Revenue who created a prohibition unit. Because itseemed logical to place responsibility for enforcement of theHarrison Act within this Prohibition Unit, a Narcotics Divisionwas created in that unit in 1919 with a staff of 170 agents andan appropriation of $270,000. This organizational unit for theenforcement of the Harrison Act existed until April 1, 1927, whenlegislation creating a Bureau of Prohibition and a Bureau ofCustoms, to be headed by Commissioners, within the Department ofTreasury, was enacted. The 1927 legislation also transferred tothe Secretary of the Treasury all powers and duties that had beenconferred by the revenue and prohibition laws upon theCommissioner of Revenue relating to intoxicating liquors andnarcotics. In addition, the Secretary was authorized to delegatesuch powers and duties to the Commissioners of Prohibition andInternal Revenue. The enforcement of the narcotics lawssubsequently was delegated to a narcotics unit under thedirection of the Deputy Commissioner of Prohibition. Enforcement efforts under the Harrison Act from 1914 through1929 were controversial. Following the expansive constructions ofthe Harrison Act by the Supreme Court in Doremus, Webb, andBehrman, thousands of additional prosecutions were undertaken asa result of investigations conducted by agents of the NarcoticsDivision of the Prohibition Unit. It has been estimated that over50,000 individuals, including many physicians and others who wererequired to register under the Act, were charged with violatingthe Act during the period of 1914-1922. After this initial burstof arrest activity directed against registrants, the NarcoticsDivision turned its attention to closing clinics that had beenestablished to conduct research and treat large numbers ofaddicts who could not afford private care. Because of pressure bythe American Medical Association, which had initially welcomedthe Harrison Act but which later came to view the actions of theNarcotics Division as harassment and an improper Federalintrusion into the practice of medicine, the Department of theTreasury encouraged its agents to focus on the "blatantlyillegal importation and sale of narcotics." Despite this change in enforcement direction, the earlierenforcement focus had a damaging, long-term impact. Because ofthe mere threat of prosecution under the Act, the "interestof physicians in these cases [of narcotic addiction]"declined and "they even began to refuse to prescribe."In closing the clinics, which had been established to treat thosewho were unable to afford private care, the Federal governmentmay have impeded - albeit unintentionally - research intonarcotic effects, use and addiction and as a result interferedwith the development of efficacious medical treatment. Finally,the Federal government's early success in decreasing the supplyof narcotic drugs from licit sources, i.e., registrants, to drugusers forced those users to seek out illicit sources of supply. The history of enforcement of the Harrison Act during thefifteen years following its enactment illustrates the operationof a principle that has been validated repeatedly since thattine: drug demand will result in the creation of supply channelsto satisfy the demand. An effective drug abuse policy requires asystematic and long-term demand reduction component;unfortunately, there was no such component of the Federal policyin the more than 50 years following the enactment of the HarrisonAct. Enforcement efforts were burdened, however, by publicdissatisfaction with the activities of the Narcotics Division,which was tainted by its association with the country'santi-liquor laws. The public dissatisfaction intensified becauseof a scandal involving falsification of arrest records andcharges relating to payoffs by, and collusion with, drug dealers.In response, Congress removed the responsibility for enforcingthe Federal drug laws from the Bureau of Prohibition, which wasitself incorporated into the Department of Justice. Drugenforcement was transferred in 1930 to a newly created FederalBureau of Narcotics (FBN) within the Department of the Treasury,which was headed by a Commissioner of Narcotics. Although the FBNwas primarily responsible for the enforcement of the Harrison Actand related drug laws, the task of preventing and interdictingthe illegal importation and smuggling of drugs remained with theBureau of Customs. With one major exception to be discussed atthe beginning of the next section, the Federal statutory andorganizational structure relating to narcotics that existed onJuly 1, 1930, remained in place for the next 35 years. 1937-1969: Intensification of Pressure for Change in FederalDrug Policy Marijuana was not made subject to the Harrison Act or to theNarcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (the Jones-Miller Act)because it was not viewed as a particularly dangerous drug. Inaddition, because of its use in the making of rope, twine,veterinary medicines, and other products, marijuana's commercialvalue was thought to outweigh any deleterious effects from itsabuse. However, as marijuana use became widespread in America,concern about its use also spread. Due to the efforts of a"small but vocal group of crusaders," the States beganto pass legislation to prohibit all marijuana-related activity.By 1931, "all but two states West of the Mississippi andseveral more in the East had enacted prohibitory legislationmaking it a criminal offense to possess or use the drug."The FBN initially minimized the dangers of marijuana use, and inits 1932 annual report, it instead urged the States to adopt aUniform State Narcotics Law. Such a law was drafted in 1932, andit included an optional marijuana provision. By 1937 every state had prohibited marijuana use. However,faced with continuing intensive lobbying efforts, the FBN didbecome an "ardent supporter" of marijuana legislation,which finally was embodied in the Marihuana Tax Act 1937. The Marihuana Tax Act was nominally a revenue measurepatterned after the Harrison Narcotic Act. It required that anyperson whose business related to marijuana to register and pay aspecial tax. In addition, the transference of marijuana had to bepursuant to a written order on a form issued by the Secretary ofthe Treasury and the transferee was required to pay a tax of$1.00/ounce if he had registered and $100.00/ounce if he had not.Finally, the Act made the transferor liable for the transfer taxif a transfer were made without an order form and without paymentof the tax by the transferee. From the late 1930's through the 1950's, the FBN's enforcementefforts were directed almost exclusively at disrupting theillegal importation of drugs into this country and to makingcases against distributors and dealers. Indeed, in 1942 the FBNrecognized that it was necessary to eradicate crops in Mexico ifits interdiction efforts were to achieve greater success. In thatsame year Congress enacted the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942,which, among other things, prohibited the domestic production ofthe poppy without FBN permission. During a great part of this period the FBN was handicapped tosome degree by a shortage of agents and inadequate budgets. Inthe Spring of 1956, a Congressional Committee found that: [FBN] is one of the few Federal agencies whose personnel andfunds have not been increased to reflect population growth andgreater responsibility. Over a period of 25 years, the Federalnarcotic laws have been enforced with a force of approximately227 agents and an average budget of less than $2 million. Thisrestriction on manpower and operating funds has seriouslycurtailed investigations of the illicit traffic in the UnitedStates and of sources of supply in foreign countries. Because of budget limitations, the present force of 250Federal narcotic agents is 25 short of the number authorized bythe Congress. By way of comparison, New York City hasapproximately 200 police officers assigned specifically tonarcotic enforcement. These statistics suggest that, during this time, drug abuseand trafficking were not the Federal priorities that they aretoday. Despite the handicaps that the FBN operated under during thisperiod, it nevertheless enjoyed a degree of success. According toLCN informer Joseph Valachi, the tactics used by the FBN toinfiltrate and disrupt trafficking organizations caused some LCNchieftains to rethink the advisability of their continuedparticipation in the drug trade. According to Valachi, FrankCostello, then acting boss of the Luciano Family, ordered itsmembers to stop trafficking in drugs in 1948. One of theprincipal reasons for the edict was explained as follows: Much more important . . . was the dogged harassment of theBureau of Narcotics. The Cosa Nostra despised - and feared - [theFBN] . . . . The Narcotics Bureau, unlike the FBI, which tends to look downits nose at it, does not depend on the informant system for muchof its intelligence but regularly engages its agents in dangerousundercover work; they are, as a result, . . . highly motivated,less disciplined, generally more daring and innovational,occasionally corruptible. Above all else, the [FBN] was the firstto recognize the existence of an organization like the CosaNostra, and no other arm of the law has put more of a crimp inits operation. Although continuing to warn of the dangers of drug use, theFBN, especially during the earlier part of the period,"adopted a more moderate approach in its dealings withCongress as well as the American people." The Bureau'sapproach reflected the attitude of the American public, whichappeared to consider the drug problem to be restricted to smallgroups at the periphery of society, with no great societalimpact. In the 1950's the rather complacent attitude toward the drugproblem began to change. The first indication of greater concernwas reflected in the enactment of the Boggs Act on November 2,1951, which generally increased the penalties for violations ofthe narcotic and marijuana laws. The primary motivations for thepassage of the Boggs Act were the inadequacy of penalties underthe existing law as deterrents and an increase in drug addiction.With respect to the former, Congress relied on statistics showingthat the rate of recidivism among drug violators had increasedsubstantially over a 15- year period of time; in 1935, 40 percentof those convicted of narcotics violations had prior drugconvictions, while 63.6 percent of those convicted and sentencedduring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1950 were recidivists.Congress concluded that drug addiction was increasing on thebasis of statistics showing that between 1946 and 1950 there hadbeen a 100 percent increase in the number of narcoticlaws-related arrests and that the average age of personscommitted to a Public Health Service Hospital had declined from37.5 to 26.7 years, over a five year period. Encouraged by the purported success of the Boggs Act, Congresspassed the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which further increasedthe penalties for drug violations. Among other things, this 1956Act raised the permissive maximum sentences for violations of thenarcotic possession statutes; imposed new mandatory minimumsentences and increased the permissive maximums for traffickingviolations; eliminated probation, suspension of service, orparole for all cases except those involving a first offenderpossessor; authorized FBN and Customs agents to carry firearmsand to execute and serve search and arrest warrants; made thesale of heroin to individuals under 18 years of age a capitaloffense, although the death penalty was not made mandatory butcould be imposed only if the jury specifically so directed; andmade the smuggling of marijuana a violation of the Narcotic DrugsImport and Export Act. The severe penalties imposed by the Narcotic Control Act of1956 were adopted even though Congress found that, as a result ofthe Boggs Act, "narcotic addiction and the illicit narcotictraffic [were] generally on the decline in the UnitedStates." Because the stringent penalties imposed by theBoggs Act were thought to be successful in decreasing drugaddiction, the 84th Congress concluded that the imposition ofeven more severe penalties would "be the strongest and mosteffective deterrent to narcotic addiction and illicit drugtraffic." Finally, Congress was of the view in enacting theNarcotic Control Act of 1956 that "suppression of theillicit drug traffic" would be the most importantcontribution that the Federal Government could make to thesuccessful and permanent rehabilitation of drug addicts. Congressthus sought to reduce the demand for drugs through reducing theirsupply. Public concern over the problem of drug abuse, which had beenrelatively dormant during the 1940's and 1950's, flared duringthe 1960's. The intensification of the national concern resultedin increasing pressure for Federal initiatives in the area. Inresponse to this development, a White House Conference onNarcotics and Drug Abuse was convened in 1962, which resulted inthe establishment of the President's Advisory Commission onNarcotics and Drug Abuse (Prettyman Commission) on January 15,1963. The Prettyman Commission's final report, submitted toPresident Kennedy in November 1963, included 25 recommendations,the substance of several of which were: (1) Transfer the enforcement and investigative functions ofthe FBN relating to illicit transactions in narcotic drugs andmarijuana from the Department of Treasury to the Department ofJustice; (2) Transfer the responsibilities of the FBN relating to theregulation of the legitimate traffic in narcotic drugs andmarijuana from the Department of the Treasury to the Departmentof Health, Education and Welfare; (3) Substantially increase the number of Federal agentsassigned to the investigation of the illicit importation of andtrafficking in narcotic drugs, marijuana, and dangerous drugs; (4) Transfer the responsibility for investigating the illicittraffic in dangerous drugs from the Department of Health,Education and Welfare to the Department of Justice; and (5) Strictly control, by Federal statute, all non-narcoticdrugs capable of producing serious psychotoxic effects whenabused. Within 18 months of the issuance of the Commission's finalreport, Congress adopted the recommendation regarding thediversion of "dangerous drugs" from legal channels. Theresulting Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 mandated, amongother things, record-keeping and inspection requirements fordepressant and stimulant drugs, and specifically for barbituratesand amphetamines, "throughout the chain of distribution,from the basic manufacturer to (but not including) the ultimateconsumer." The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 werepassed because of perceived serious problems associated with thediversion of depressant and stimulant drugs from licit channels: [T]estimony showed that over 9 billion barbiturate andamphetamine tablets are produced annually in the United States.It is estimated that over 50 percent, or 4 1/2 billion tablets,are distributed through illicit channels. The human toll of drugabuse cannot be measured for it affects not only the abuser buthis family and the community around him. Drug abuse is closelybound up with juvenile delinquency. It also contributes to therising crime rate in the United States. To carry out the new enforcement obligations imposed by theDrug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 another agency was created;a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) was established within theDepartment's Food and Drug Administration. The Bureau of Customs,however, retained responsibility for the enforcement of lawsrelating to the importing and exporting of depressant andstimulants drugs. With the establishment of the BDAC on February1, 1966, the Department of the Treasury's virtual monopoly of theenforcement of Federal drug laws ended. Within 16 months of the enactment of the Drug Abuse ControlAmendments of 1965 Congress passed an enlightened piece oflegislation: The Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. ThisAct did many things, including: authorizing a district court toorder the civil commitment of an individual, who was an addict,who had been charged with certain offenses against the UnitedStates, and who elected to do so, to the Surgeon General fortreatment of his addiction and rehabilitation, in lieu ofprosecution; requiring a district court to commit an individualwho had been convicted of certain offenses against the UnitedStates and who was an addict to the custody of the AttorneyGeneral for treatment and rehabilitation; permitting any narcoticaddict to file a petition with a United States Attorneyrequesting that he be admitted to a Public Health Servicehospital for treatment and rehabilitation; and authorizing theSurgeon General to establish rehabilitation andpost-hospitalization care programs for narcotic addicts and toprovide financial assistance to the States to establish similarprograms. As the House Committee on Judiciary, one of the Congressionalcommittees which reported on the proposed bill, observed, theNarcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966: . . . mark[e]d a fundamental reorientation toward the problemof narcotics addiction. The Attorney General in his testimonybefore the Committee stated that for too long the law hadstressed punitive solutions and neglected medical andrehabilitative measures. The 1966 Act embodied a proposition that had tended to beoverlooked in the past: successful treatment and permanentrehabilitation of drug users, i.e., reduction of demand fordrugs, must be an essential component of Federal law enforcementefforts. A detailed evaluation of the Federal drug strategy that wasreleased in 1979 accurately summarized what the Federal approachhad been prior to the late 1960's: Early efforts to deal with the problem primarily focused onreducing the supply of drugs, first through taxation, then byprohibition and strict legal control. The basic assumption . . .was that reducing supply and availability of drugs would lead toreduction in their use by encouraging drug-dependent individualsto detoxify, and by keeping drugs out of the hands of users. By the end of the 1950's there was a general agreement on thepart of both the public and legislators that the Federal policyof strict supply reduction by itself was not enough. During the1960's and early 1970's, as drug abuse increased and spread tonew markets, the almost exclusive emphasis on supply reductionand stiff penalties was challenged with growing frequency,leading to increased research and experimentation with treatmentfor drug abusers. Beginning in 1968, in response to rising . . . concern . . .,a variety of changes occurred in an attempt to curtail drugabuse. Despite the work of the Prettyman Commission and the enactmentof the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, public agitationconcerning crime in general, and drug abuse in particular,intensified. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson establishedthe President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administrationof Justice (Katzenbach Commission) in 1966 to undertake a"comprehensive study of the nation's crime problem and toprovid[e] recommendations to coordinate its eradication on allfronts." The Katzenbach Commission issued a report in 1967,which included a chapter on drug abuse. The substance of severalof the Katzenbach Commission's recommendations addressed both thedemand and supply of drugs: (1) Substantially increase the enforcement staffs of FBN andthe Bureau of Customs; (2) Permit courts and correctional authorities to dealflexibly with violators of the drug laws; (3) Undertake research to develop a sound and effectiveframework of regulatory and criminal laws relating to dangerousdrugs; and (4) The National Institute of Mental Health should develop acore of educational and informational materials relating todrugs. Drawing on the recommendations of the Prettyman Commission,President Johnson sent a reorganization plan restructuring theFederal drug law enforcement effort to Congress for itsconsideration on February 7, 1968. In terms that have beenrepeated often since that time, President Johnson explained thereason for the proposed consolidation of drug enforcementresponsibilities: Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcoticslaws are fragmented. * * * Neither [the FBN nor the BADC] is in the agency which isprimarily concerned with Federal law enforcement - the Departmentof Justice. This separation of responsibilities . . . has complicated andhindered our response to a national menace. Among the most significant provisions of the plan, whichbecame effective on April 7, 1968, were the following: theDepartment of Justice was given a major responsibility for theenforcement of the Federal drug laws for the first time inhistory by the creation within it of a Bureau of Narcotics andDangerous Drugs (BNDD); the FBN was abolished, and its drugenforcement duties and responsibilities were shifted to BNDD; andBDAC was also abolished, and its drug enforcement duties andresponsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice. The 1968 reorganization did not significantly affect therevenue collection functions exercised by IRS under the Harrisonand Marijuana Tax Acts or the responsibility of the Bureau ofCustoms for interdicting the smuggling of narcotics andmarijuana. The Plan that was intended to eliminate fragmentationin Federal drug law enforcement thus did not eliminate itentirely. Although neither House of Congress blocked the 1968reorganization plan, criticism of it did develop. While inagreement that merger of the FBN and BDAC would eliminatefriction and duplication of effort, Congressional opponentsexpressed skepticism that law enforcement relating to drugs andorganized crime would be in any way improved by transferring themerged entity to the Department of Justice. BecauseAdministration spokesmen had acknowledged that BDAC and the FBNhad been effective law enforcement agencies, the opponents of theplan recommended that the merged entity should instead be locatedwithin the Department of the Treasury, where coordination withIRS and Customs, both of which had drug law enforcementresponsibilities, could be better assured. That the BNDD wasapparently not to be placed within the FBI was one factor leadingthe dissenters to conclude that "greater overall efficiencyin crime enforcement" would not be achieved by the placementof the merged entity into Justice. Federal Drug Law Enforcement: From Implementation of the 1968Reorganization Plan to October 27, 1970. Two major issues during the 1968 Presidential campaign werecrime and drugs. Shortly after his inauguration, PresidentRichard M. Nixon declared war on both and formed Task Force Onein the spring of 1969 to "design programs that would have animmediate effect on the importation of heroin and other illegaldrugs." Task Force One developed and implemented OperationIntercept, the "first major interagency attempt at borderinterdiction," which involved more than 2,000 Customs, INSBorder Patrol, and BNDD agents. Because the amount of illegaldrugs seized as a result of Operation Intercept wasdisappointingly small and because the venture seriously strainedrelations between Mexico and the United States, JusticeDepartment officials concluded that successful interdictionprograms required the cooperation of source countries. As aresult, in the fall of 1969, Operation Intercept was transformedinto Operation Cooperation, which in part provided U.S. financialaid to the Mexican Government to purchase aircraft and to trainagents to interdict the flow of drugs before they reached theUnited States borders. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of1970 The year 1970 was an important one in the history of thisNation's war against drug trafficking and drug abuse. In Februaryof that year, President Nixon clarified the responsibilities ofthe various Federal agencies involved in the effort against drugtrafficking by issuing a directive announcing that BNDD"controls all investigations involving violations of thelaws of the United States relating to narcotics, marijuana anddangerous drugs, both within the United States and beyond itsborders. Several months later, the President approved guidelines,developed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of theTreasury, which increased the investigatory responsibility ofCustoms at ports and borders. However, the most significant eventin 1970 was the enactment of the Comprehensive Drug AbusePrevention and Control Act of 1970 (1970 Comprehensive Act). As of 1970, numerous Federal statutes dealt with variousfacets of the Nation's drug trafficking and abuse problems. Theselaws overlapped, were sometimes inconsistent, and required morethan a dozen Federal agencies to enforce them. In response, the1970 Comprehensive Act was passed to collect and conform"diverse laws in one piece of legislation based upon newscientific information, the restructured Federal law enforcementefforts under Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1968, and greaterinformation concerning the scope of the problem." The 1970 Act comprised four titles: Title I authorized theDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare to increase itsefforts in drug rehabilitation, drug treatment and the preventionof drug abuse. Specifically, Title I authorized the appropriationof funds for drug abuse prevention and education programs and forspecial project grants to programs designed to treat andrehabilitate narcotic addicts or drug dependent persons. As aresult of these steps, Congress provided for a "greatlyincreased Federal effort in the fields of prevention andrehabilitation" and made the National Institute of MentalHealth the agency primarily responsible for drug education andprevention activities in the Federal government. Title II of the 1970 Act, the "Controlled SubstancesAct," along with Title III, comprehensively addressed thelaw enforcement aspects of the attack on drug abuse. Among otherthings, Title II established five schedules into which controlledsubstances were and could be placed, required the registrationof, and record-keeping by, manufacturers, distributors anddispensers of controlled substances, imposed penalties forviolations of the Act, established a Commission on Marihuana andDrug Abuse, and authorized BNDD to add 300 agents to its staffduring FY 1971. Finally, Title III, the Controlled Substances Import andExport Act, governed the importation and exportation ofcontrolled substances. The Attorney General was given theresponsibility for maintaining the integrity of the import/exportregistration system that the Act created. Although primarily an effort to consolidate the myriad of lawsdealing with drug trafficking and abuse that had been adoptedover the years, Congress's authority for enacting the 1970 Actwas predicated upon its interstate commerce power and not, aswith previous narcotics laws, on the constitutional power to tax.This shift had enormous implications for the way that the Federalgovernment would and did approach drug enforcement in the future: [The Controlled Substances Act] set the stage for aninnovation in Federal drug enforcement techniques. Thatinnovation was assigning large numbers of Federal narcoticsagents to work in local communities. No longer was it necessaryto demonstrate interstate traffic to justify Federalparticipation in combating illegal drug use. Constitutional challenges to the 1970 Act that were predicatedupon the intrastate nature of the conduct prosecuted wererejected. Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1970-1980 The decade of the 1970's was an extremely significant one forthe development of Federal drug abuse policy in terms of newlaws, organizational and operational reforms, and a growingrecognition that the reduction of the demand for drugs must begiven a greater emphasis. On the debit side the extent of theNation's drug abuse problem at the end of 1980 was as great as,if not greater than, the problem in 1970. To some extent, thesituation in 1980 was attributable to the continuing andunresolved debate concerning the appropriate Federal role in thenational struggle against drug abuse and trafficking. New legislative initiatives, organizations, and operationalreforms relating to the Nation's drug abuse problem were adoptedand implemented within a relatively short period after theenactment of the 1970 Comprehensive Act. One of the mostimportant and innovative of these reforms was the establishment,by executive order, of the Special Action Office for Drug AbusePrevention (SAODAP) within the Executive Office of the Presidenton June 17, 1971. The President made the Director of SAODAP hisspecial representative with respect to all Federal drug abusetraining, education, rehabilitation, research, treatment, andprevention programs and activities (exclusive of law enforcementactivities and legal proceedings). In this capacity, the SAODAPDirector's duties included prescribing "policies,guidelines, standards, and criteria for the maximum achievementof the goals and objectives" of Federal demand reductionprograms and coordinating and evaluating all Federal drug abuseprograms. President Nixon did not neglect the supply reduction componentof the Federal drug policy. Presidential initiatives in this areain 1971 included the establishment of the Cabinet Committee onInternational Narcotics Control (CCINC) and of the NarcoticsTraffickers Program (NTP) within IRS. The CCINC, chaired by theSecretary of State, was given the responsibility for"developing a strategy to check the illegal flow ofnarcotics to the United States and coordinating the effortsundertaken abroad by involved Federal departments and agencies toimplement that strategy." The NTP was designed to function as a mechanism for disruptingdrug trafficking by having the IRS intensively investigatetop-echelon drug dealers. The IRS effectively ended the NTPsometime in 1975, both because it had a relatively low revenueyield and because IRS officials felt uncomfortable in operating aprogram whose primary objective was not tax-related. On January 28, 1972, President Nixon took another step,designed to improve the Federal government's drug law enforcementefforts by establishing an Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement(ODALE) within the Department of Justice. This office was to beheaded by a Director who would be a Special Assistant AttorneyGeneral and who would serve as a Special Consultant to thePresident concerning drug law enforcement. In this role the ODALEDirector was responsible for advising the President on improvingthe effectiveness of Federal drug enforcement and on assistingthe States and local governments in strengthening their own druglaw enforcement. The Director was also required to develop andimplement a "concentrated program" for enforcingFederal laws concerning drug abuse prevention and for cooperatingwith State and local governments in the enforcement of their drugabuse laws. Finally, to ensure that all steps permitted by lawwere taken by Federal, State and local governments and by theprivate sector to prevent drug abuse, the Director of ODALE wasinstructed to consult regularly with the SAODAP Director. Withthe establishment of ODALE and SAODAP, and the presidentialinstruction that their Directors consult, cooperate, andcoordinate, a mechanism was created within the Federal Governmentthat, at least theoretically, could have integrated Federalstrategies to reduce drug supply and demand to achieve maximumresults. That ODALE was created in early 1972, so relatively soon afterthe implementation of the 1968 reorganization plan, bespoke alack of confidence in the structure and operation of the drug lawenforcement system created by that plan. Indeed, ODALE wasestablished because of the "Administration's concern thatBNDD and Customs could not act with the swiftness and precisionthat a single agency vested with authority and power could."In performing its duties and responsibilities ODALE "wasempowered to take the lead in the Administration's 'war onheroin,' with a particular emphasis on street-leveltrafficking." Several months after the creation of ODALE, another unit, theOffice of National Narcotic Intelligence (ONNI), was establishedwithin the Department of Justice to function as a ClearinghouseOf information that would be useful in the Administration'scampaign against drug trafficking. The Director of ONNI wasinstructed to collect and provide narcotics intelligence to anyFederal, State, or local official determined to have a"legitimate official need" for the intelligence. TheONNI Director was also instructed to cooperate with the Directorof ODALE to assist the latter in insuring that all feasible stepswere taken to prevent drug abuse in the Nation. Although itsmandate did not include the independent development of narcoticsintelligence, the establishment of ONNI was the first concreterecognition by officials at the highest levels of the Federalgovernment of the crucial role that intelligence had to play insupply reduction strategies. Congress eventually responded positively to President Nixon'srequest that it enact legislation confirming his creation ofSAODAP by passing the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972(1972 Drug Abuse Office Act). This legislation was an importantevent in the history of Federal drug abuse policy: With the enactment of the [Act] Federal policy clearly calledfor a balanced response to the problem of drug abuse by adding avigorous prevention and treatment component to the existing lawenforcement effort. Although commitments to the "balanced response"enshrined in the 1972 Drug Abuse office Act have been proclaimedrepeatedly ever since, they have not generally been translatedinto action, as measured by budget authorizations andexpenditures. Congress was persuaded to enact the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Actbecause the witnesses who testified before its committees were"unanimously agreed that drug abuse in America had reachedepidemic proportions." Most of the witnesses were"generally agreed that greater emphasis on the so-calleddemand side of the problem is required, that is, on treatment,rehabilitation, research, education and training." Congressalso found that the Federal government's activities with respectto the "demand side of the drug abuse field have beencarried on by at least nine different agencies anddepartments" and that the legislation under considerationwas needed to "provide for and insure a centralcomprehensive coordination of the federal effort." Inpassing the Act, Congress concluded that the "emphasis must,indeed, be changed [to strategies to reduce demand] if there isto be meaningful progress in the effort against drug abuse." The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act did many things, includingestablishing SAODAP in the Executive Office of the President;making the Director of SAODAP responsible for, among otherthings, providing overall planning and policy, and establishingobjectives and priorities, for all federal drug abuse preventionfunctions, making recommendations to the President concerning anyFederal drug traffic prevention function, making findings andrecommendations to the President concerning the resolution ofconflicts involving drug abuse prevention or drug trafficprevention functions, and coordinating Federal drug abuseprevention functions with those of the State and localgovernments; directing the President to require development of acomprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy for alldrug abuse and drug traffic prevention functions; directing theSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants toStates submitting plans for establishing, conducting andcoordinating projects for the development of more effective drugabuse prevention functions and to make special project grants to,and contracts with, public and private entities and individualsto develop drug abuse prevention programs; and establishing aNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to administer theprograms of the Secretary of HEW relating to drug abuseprevention functions. The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act was necessary and usefullegislation, but it was based on the mistaken premise that thenation's drug abuse problem could be dealt with in a relativelyshort period of time: [I]t is the policy of the United States and the purpose ofthis Act to focus the comprehensive resources of the FederalGovernment and bring them to bear on drug abuse with theimmediate objective of significantly reducing the incidence ofdrug abuse in the United States within the shortest possibleperiod of time . . . . Consistent with this premise, Congress provided that SAODAPwas to be abolished on June 30, 1975. There appears to have been an expectation at the time that the1972 Drug Abuse office Act became effective that NIDA wouldassume many of the programmatic functions of SAODAP on or beforeJune 30, 1975, after the war against drug abuse had been won andonly "mopping-up" operations remained. This expectationno doubt was encouraged by statements made subsequent to thepassage of the 1972 Act, such as that of President Nixon inSeptember of 1973 that "[w]e have turned the corner on drugaddiction in the United States." As the historical recorddemonstrates, the expectation of quick success was unrealisticbecause of the nature of the drug problem. The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act reflected the realization thatan exclusive reliance on strategies to reduce supply will fail toachieve the ultimate objective. Such an approach disregards thefundamental economic principle, that where a demand for a serviceor commodity exists, some entrepreneur, for the right price, willattempt to supply it. There is an optimal mix of approaches toreduce demand and supply that will obtain maximum results andthus achieve the goal of that policy, i.e., the elimination ofdrug abuse. The Federal government necessarily has a paramountand continuing role in that policy, in terms of providingleadership, resources, and support to the other participants.Experience immediately following the enactment of the 1972 DrugAbuse Office Act demonstrates that although the Nation's drugabuse problem may never be eliminated, it can be reducedsubstantially if a long-term commitment of sufficient resourcesis made and unreasonable impatience for results is checked. Despite the comprehensive restructuring of the Federalnarcotics laws that had occurred in 1970, related legislativeinitiatives, and the innovations in Federal drug law enforcementrepresented by ODALE and ONNI, the Nixon Administration concludedthat Federal drug law enforcement continued to be hampered byinteragency rivalries and jurisdictional overlaps and disputes.In response, another major restructuring of the Federal drug lawenforcement machinery was announced on March 28, 1973. The NixonAdministration trumpeted the 1973 reorganization plan, which wasimplemented on July 1, 1973, as doing for the supply side of thedrug abuse problem what the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act had donefor the demand side: create an organization with the necessaryresources, breadth, and leadership capacity to act decisively. The Federal drug law enforcement structure in March of 1973was complex, as reflected in Appendix C, with no singleindividual or agency responsible for supervision of the overalleffort. The 1973 reorganization plan was designed to overcomeperceived deficiencies in existing law enforcement. The 1973 reorganization plan was motivated primarily by thebeliefs of Administration officials that the aggregation ofFederal drug law enforcement activities had "seriousoperational and organizational shortcomings" and that"enforcement work could benefit significantly . . . fromconsolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unifiedcommand." The most important innovation adopted by the planwas the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)within the Department of Justice as the "single,comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice tolead the war against illicit drug traffic." The DEA, to beheaded by an Administrator who would report directly to theAttorney General, was to be responsible for the anti-drugfunctions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgetsof BNDD, ODALE, and ONNI and those of the Bureau of Customs withrespect to drug investigations and intelligence. The plan alsoprovided that drug law enforcement research that had beenhitherto funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administrationwould be transferred to DEA. While the 1973 reorganization plan reaffirmed the jurisdictionof the Bureau of Customs to conduct investigative, intelligence,and law enforcement functions relating to the suppression of drugtrafficking at ports of entry and borders, it prohibited Customsfrom exercising those functions, as it had been previouslyauthorized to do, at locations away from ports of entry orborders. In addition, drugs, evidence, and persons seized bycustoms agents at ports of entry or borders were to be turnedover to representatives of the Attorney General. The planexplicitly provided that the Department of Justice, in additionto Customs, could perform law enforcement functions, includingthose relating to illicit drug trafficking, at the Nation's portsof entry and borders. Finally, the plan required the AttorneyGeneral to assure the maximum cooperation between and among DEA,the FBI, and other units of the Justice Department to achievecoordination of all of his drug law enforcement functions. Once established, DEA played an "increasingly crucialrole in the coordination of Federal drug law enforcement; andduring the 1970's a number of interagency efforts werelaunched." Among the coordination efforts undertaken by DEAwas the development of mechanisms to provide timely and accuratenarcotics intelligence to drug law enforcement personnel at theFederal, State and local levels. Steps taken by DEA in this areaincluded the establishment of: (1) An Office of Intelligence at DEA headquarters which,organizationally, was at the same level as its Office ofEnforcement; (2) Regional Intelligence Units (RIUs) in each of the DEAregions; (3) The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in 1974 as a borderintelligence unit, which soon grew into a"twenty-four-hour-a-day intelligence center, with worldwidecapabilities to collect, process, and disseminate informationconcerning illicit drug trafficking as the smuggling of aliensand weapons; EPIC is staffed by personnel from DFA, INS, Customs,the Coast Guard, BATF, FAA, the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI andIRS; (4) The Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System(NADDIS) and the System to Retrieve Information from DrugEvidence (STRIDE) to provide access to numerous investigativerecords of PEA and other Federal, State and local drugenforcement records; (5) In April of 1978, the National Narcotics IntelligenceConsumers Committee (NNICC), chaired by the DEA Deputy AssistantAdministrator for Intelligence and including representatives fromthe Departments of Defense, Treasury and State, and theircomponent agencies in the field, including Customs, the CoastGuard, FBI, INS, IRS, and NIDA to coordinate the collection,analysis, dissemination and evaluation of drug-relatedintelligence, both foreign and domestic, and to publish annuallya "National Intelligence Estimate on the Supply of Drugs tothe U.S. Illicit Market from Foreign and Domestic Sources." In addition to trying to improve the intelligence gatheringand dissemination functions of Federal drug law enforcement, PEAattempted to improve the task force concept in drug lawenforcement which it had inherited from ODALE. In 1974 DEAadopted the Central Tactical Units (CENTAC) program to focusenforcement resources on conspiracy investigations of high-leveldrug trafficking targets. Unfettered by normal DEA regionaloperations, centrally administered, specially funded, staffed bypersonnel from DEA, IRS, Customs, and State and local agencies,and charged with pursuing conspiracy cases under the ContinuingCriminal Enterprise (CCE) and RICO statutes, the CENTAC programdid produce relatively high arrest and conviction rates of highlevel traffickers, and accounted for 12 percent of DEA arrestsfrom 1976 to 1979 while using less than three percent of DEApersonnel. Although criticizing the CENTAC Program for notexploiting the Federal forfeiture statutes to seize the assets ofconvicted traffickers, the General Accounting office (GAO)nevertheless concluded that: Given the success of the Central Tactical units and the needfor more multi-regional conspiracy investigations, the expansionof the [CENTAC] program is warranted. GAO recommended expansion of the CENTAC program despite anearlier conclusion that the CENTAC efforts had not"achieve[d] the overall objective - complete immobilizationof the targeted trafficking organizations." The 1980 GAOreport also conflicted with: DEA officials who said the current size of the CENTAC programis optimum given existing enforcement resources, requiredcommitments, and their preference for regionally controlledinvestigations . . . . Another effort at interagency operational cooperation duringthe decade of the 1970's was the creation of three FBI-DEA forcesin Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles to "test thefeasibility of joint operations." These task forces weredesigned to combine the FBI's organized crime and conspiracycases expertise with DEA's experience in narcoticsinvestigations. This effort was probably doomed from the startbecause, although each agency was supposed to coordinate with theother, each used its own investigative techniques, personnel, andinformation sources and each maintained jurisdictional autonomy.After two years, the program was in effect disbanded, andevaluations by GAO and others attributed the failure todisagreements over investigative techniques and to restrictionson case selection. The creation of DEA by the 1973 reorganization plan and DEA'ssubsequent development of new supply reduction approaches werenot the only steps undertaken and designed during the 1970's torespond to what many had come to view as the almost intractablenational drug problem. For example, Congress passed the NarcoticAddict Treatment Act of 1974, which amended the 1970 ControlledSubstances Act to require annual registration by practitionersdispensing narcotic drugs, including methadone, for maintenanceor detoxification purposes. This legislation, which imposedstandards for the legal dispensing of drugs, was deemed necessarybecause of the increased diversion of methadone for illegal saleand use. That year also saw the passage of the Alcohol and Drug AbuseEducation Act Amendments of 1974, which extended the grant andcontract authorities of the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 forthree years and authorized the expenditure of $90 million overthose three years. The Act placed greater emphasis on the needfor prevention and early intervention programs, recognizing thecrucial role of family, peer group, school, church and othercommunity institutions in influencing young people's behavior. In enacting the 1974 Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education ActAmendments, Congress noted that most of the previously adoptedFederal programs to reduce demand had "inevitably beendirected primarily toward the person who is already in serioustrouble with alcohol and/or drugs," but that the focus ofthe Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 had been different in thatit was directed to those who had not yet experimented with drugsor to those who had just begun to do so. In passing the 1974amendments Congress applauded the focus on prevention,reaffirming the philosophy that had suffused the 1970 EducationAct: [R]eal progress in the struggle against alcohol and drug abusewill require an intensified effort to reach that far morenumerous group, those millions of young people who may be temptedto experiment with dangerous drugs or who may have already doneso. Although committed to the continuation of Federal support forlocal drug education programs, Congress was nevertheless criticalof those educational programs that were based upon informationthat was incomplete, erroneous, or designed to frighten, andthose based on accurate information that had the tendency toarouse interest in drugs and to lead to experimentation, Beforepassing the 1974 Amendments Congress received assurances from theOffice of Education within the Department of HEW that it wouldmake every effort to support only those programs which would"incorporate factual material about drugs into programswhich focus on the causes of drug use and emphasize thedevelopment of appropriate attitudes and values," ratherthan merely inform and arouse interest. The Nixon Administration opposed passage of the bill thateventually became the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education ActAmendments of 1974 because it believed that "alcohol anddrug abuse education [should] be included among the specialprojects to be funded under other education legislation and thatalcoholism and drug abuse formula grant funds to the states[should] be considered the major source of funds for localalcohol and drug abuse education programs." Congressdisagreed with the Administration's position concerningcategorical legislation relating to prevention and earlyintervention educational programs, stating that: Failure to renew a clear legislative mandate to the Office ofEducation would destroy the identity of the program at both theFederal and the State level and would cast the alcohol and drugeducation programs in the role of supplicants to those agencieswhose primary concern is not education and who are alreadybesieged by the demands of treatment programs. The ultimate result would be either the disappearance ofcommunity drug and alcohol education programs or a reversion tosome of the futile and dangerous efforts of the past. . . As noted earlier, the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act provided thatSAODAP would be abolished on June 30, 1975, with no assignment ofits policy-making and coordinative functions to any other Federalagency. On March 19, 1976, however, legislation was approved thatin effect continued SAODAP, but under the slightly different nameof "Office of Drug Abuse Policy" (ODAP). Congresscreated ODAP because: [T]here is current evidence that whatever improvement in theproblem occurred in 1973 was temporary and that the presentproblem is at least as great as at the time the original act waspassed. In approving the continuation of an executive level drugadvisor, Congress found that "drug abuse was not a crisiswhich could be rapidly solved but rather a continuing problemcalling for a continued Federal responsibility." Congressalso concluded that Federal expenditures for drug abuseprevention efforts had peaked in 1974 and then declined, despitecontinuing serious problems, due to, among other things, theanticipated end of SAODAP: It would also appear that the existence of a high-level officein the executive branch is to some extent correlated with thefiscal emphasis provided to drug abuse prevention efforts. Congress was also somewhat concerned that "unless someactive direction is taken at some high level it is probable thatin the very near future funding for drug law enforcement willagain overbalance funding for drug abuse prevention." In creating ODAP Congress required its Director to makerecommendations to the President regarding the policies andpriorities for, and objectives of, all Federal "drug abusefunctions," a term which was defined to encompass both drugabuse prevention and drug traffic prevention functions, and tocoordinate the performance of such functions by Federaldepartments and agencies. This was a significant expansion of theauthority of ODAP's predecessor, SAODAP. Despite the Ford Administration's opposition to thecontinuation of an executive-level office relating to drug abuseprevention, President Ford did not veto the 1976 amendmentcreating ODAP. However, President Ford did not staff ODAP, eventhough a specific line-item authorization had been made for it.DAP did not come into being until President Carter issued amemorandum initiating the Office on March 14, 1977. Less than twomonths after the Senate confirmation of the ODAP Director,President Carter submitted a reorganization plan restructuringthe Executive Office of the President to Congress on July 15,1977. The 1977 reorganization plan altered the structure of theExecutive Office of the President, which at the time consisted ofthe immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office,OMB, and 14 other agencies, including ODAP and the DomesticCouncil. As proposed, the plan, among other things, abolished theDomestic Council and ODAP and redesignated the Domestic CouncilStaff as the Domestic Policy Staff. The functions of ODAP and itsDirector would be transferred to the President who could thendelegate such functions. Several members of Congress, recalling that it was the needfor a high-level policy and coordinating office to oversee theactivities of more than 20 Federal agencies with significant drugabuse responsibilities that had given birth to the SAODAP/ODAPprogram, expressed grave concern about the abolishment of ODAP.President Carter assured them that the ODAP's functions would becarried on within the Executive office of the President and thatthe Domestic Policy Staff, with several of its staff membersassigned exclusively to drug abuse issues, would handle ODAP'spolicy-making and coordinative functions. With Congressionalacquiescence, the 1977 Reorganization became effective on March26, 1978, at which time a core group of ODAP staff wastransferred to the Domestic Policy Staff. Although Congress did not block the provisions of the 1977reorganization plan, members of Congress nevertheless remainedunsure whether drug abuse policy-making and coordinativefunctions could be or would be adequately performed by theDomestic Policy Staff. This uncertainty was reflected in the DrugAbuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1978, which extendedthe authorization for NIDA programs for only one year, instead ofthe previous multi-year reauthorizations, so that it couldevaluate the system created by the 1977 reorganization plan aftera relatively brief but adequate period of time. The Congressional evaluation of the operations of the drugabuse policy and coordinating system in the Executive Office ofthe President was embodied the next year in the Drug AbusePrevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Amendments of 1979.During the consideration of this legislation, President Carterassigned the Associate Director for Drug Policy of the DomesticPolicy Staff the responsibility for assisting the President inperforming the functions of ODAP, which had been transferred tothe President by the 1977 reorganization plan. President Cartertook this step because of Congressional concern that: [T]he continued coordination of drug abuse policy, required bythe 1972 Act and its subsequent amendments, became dependent uponthe continued interest . . . of the President and otherindividuals within the Executive Branch, rather than beingclearly structured by statute as had been the case prior to theimplementation of the Reorganization Plan. Because of the steps taken by the Carter Administrationincluding the revitalization of the Strategy Council, Congressresponded by legislating what the 1977 reorganization plan haddone. In addition to giving its imprimatur to the 1977reorganization plan, the 1979 legislation made authorizations forNIDA's state formula grants and special grant and contractprograms for drug education and prevention through September 30,1981. It did so because it found that the "growing extent ofdrug abuse indicates an urgent need for prevention andintervention programs designed to reach the generalpopulation." In providing for a two-year reauthorization forNIDA programs and activities, Congress rejected the CarterAdministration's proposal that state formula grants for drugabuse be consolidated with those for alcoholism and mental healthbecause: There is considerable history to suggest that earmarkedfunding for categorical programs should remain separate at theState level as well as at the national level. Within thetraditional health care delivery system, the drug and alcoholclient has not fared well. To force these systems to competeagain is to seriously jeopardize the major strides which havebeen made . . . . The Committee insists that a categoricalemphasis on drug abuse must be maintained at all levels ofgovernment. A loss of direct program emphasis would severely harmthe state focus on combatting drug abuse, and could seriouslyendanger the Nation's battle against drug abuse. The decade of the 1970's was an important one in the evolutionof the Federal drug abuse effort. It began with a comprehensiverestructuring of Federal laws relating to drugs and included amajor reorganization of Federal drug law enforcement agencies ina effort to reduce interagency rivalries and to promoteefficiency and leadership in the fight against drug trafficking.Equally important was the recognition that strategies to reducedemand must be an essential component of the overall drug abusepolicy and that the nation's drug abuse problem could not beregarded as a crisis susceptible to quick resolution. Inaddition, new laws were passed to respond to particular aspectsof the drug problem, and new enforcement approaches were tried inan effort to disrupt drug trafficking more effectively. On a less positive note, disagreements over certainfundamental issues remained unresolved at the end of the 1970's.Among these were the role of the Federal Government in drugpolicy and the appropriate balance between strategies to reducedemand and supply. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, despitelegislation, massive reorganizations, new enforcement techniques,and necessary attitudinal changes, the problems of drug abuse andtrafficking continued at high levels at the end of the decade.

The Reagan Administrationhas taken many steps designed to improve the effectiveness of theU.S. overall drug abuse policy. Reorganization/Coordination On January 21, 1982, in a major policy shift, the FBI wasgiven concurrent jurisdiction with DEA for drug law enforcementand investigation. In addition, the Administrator of DEA wasrequired to report to the Director of the FBI who was given theresponsibility for supervising generally drug law enforcementefforts and policies. In giving the FBI concurrent jurisdiction for enforcement ofU.S. drug laws, the Attorney General followed the recommendationof a committee that he had established to study the need forincreased coordination of DEA and the FBI in the drug field. Thiscommittee was headed by then Associate Attorney General RudolphW. Giuliani. According to Giuliani, the Attorney General'scommittee recommended concurrent jurisdiction because: [W]e believe we can more effectively deal with the large-scaletrafficking groups by coordinating DEA's street-level, undercoverexpertise with the FBI's ability to combat large criminalenterprises. The FBI's 20-year experience in combatting organizedcrime will also prove critical to drug enforcement. Although FBI expertise in organized crime and financialinvestigations would be available in drug enforcement work as aresult of concurrent jurisdiction, DEA would continue to functionas a "single-mission narcotics enforcement agency" thatwould "give the drug problem the kind of focus itneeds." In another action relating to the coordination of Federal drugabuse efforts, President Reagan issued an executive order on June24, 1982, directing the office of Policy Development to assistthe President in performing his duties under the Drug AbusePrevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act; designating theDirector of the Drug Abuse Policy Office within the Office ofPolicy Development as primarily responsible for coordinating,overseeing, and policy-making for all Executive international anddomestic drug abuse functions; and making the Director directlyresponsible for the activities of a drug policy staff within theoffice of Policy Development. Despite President Reagan's stated commitment to theperformance of the functions imposed upon him by the Drug AbusePrevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, Congress becameincreasingly dissatisfied with a perceived lack of coordinationof such functions. This dissatisfaction became embodied in anOmnibus Crime Bill (H.R. 3963) which included a provision toestablish an Office of Director of National and InternationalDrug Operations and Policy, which was described as follows: Similar in concept to SAODAP, the proposed agency would havebeen charged with the overall planning and coordination ofFederal efforts to control the supply of dangerous drugs. Unlike SAODAP, which had been directed by Congress tocoordinate Federal drug abuse prevention efforts, and unlikeODAP, which was enjoined to oversee all Federal drug abuseprograms, the proposed Office of Director of National andInternational Drug Operations and Policy was envisioned as amechanism for coordinating and directing Federal law enforcementoperations. While the President was considering the merits of H.R. 3963,an Administration spokesman criticized that portion of the billcreating the Office of Director of National and InternationalDrug Operations and Policy: If the czar . . . is to have the power to direct the drugenforcement operations of other Cabinet officers, the very natureof our Cabinet system of government would be drastically altered.If he is not to have such power, he could do little more thaninterfere with the existing mechanisms, which have been workingwell. Two days after this statement appeared, President Reaganpocket-vetoed H.R. 3963 and issued a memorandum of disapprovalexplaining his action: The creation of another layer of bureaucracy within theExecutive Branch would produce friction, disrupt effective lawenforcement, and could threaten the integrity of criminalinvestigations and prosecutions . . . . The seriousness of this threat is underscored by theoverwhelming opposition to this provision by the Federal lawenforcement community as well as by such groups as theInternational Association of Chiefs of Police and the NationalAssociation of Attorney's General. * * * The war on crime and drugs does not need more bureaucracy inWashington. It does need more action in the field, and that iswhere my Administration will focus its efforts. Members of Congress were not easily dissuaded from theirefforts to achieve a greater degree of coordination of theFederal drug abuse efforts. On February 7, 1984, the Senatepassed a proposed National Narcotics Act of 1984 (S. 1787),which, among other things, would have established a cabinet-leveloffice of National and International Drug Operation and Policy.Under the bill the Director of the Office was authorized to:develop, review, implement, and enforce U.S. policy concerningillegal drugs; coordinate all U.S. efforts to halt drugtrafficking into and within the United States; develop, inconcert with the Federal entities concerned with drug control,budgetary priorities and allocations; and coordinate thecollection and disseminate of narcotics intelligence. In recommending that S. 1787 be passed, the Senate JudiciaryCommittee acknowledged that the Reagan Administration hadundertaken a number of "promising initiatives" in druglaw enforcement. However, the Committee concluded that an Officeof National and International Drug Operations and Policy wasnecessary because: [T]he Committee believes the Administration's anti-drug effortfalls short in one crucial respect: the lack of centraldirection. At least 15 Federal agencies play a role in the regulation ofcommerce in dangerous drugs or in the enforcement of otherrestrictions . . . . These agencies are located in six differentdepartments. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable thatdivergences as to priorities will arise and that there will beconflicting interpretations of national policy. Indeed, nationalpolicy in such an area as drug law enforcement must becontinually reevaluated and reformulated; a one-time annualreview and the publication of a broadly-worded strategy does notsuffice. The Committee also described in some detail the role itenvisioned for the proposed Office: SOADAP was the same kind of "overlord" agency as theone contemplated by S. 1787. However, it was flawed from thebeginning in that its effective jurisdiction was limited toactivities aimed at the control of drug demand; it was not givenauthority of any substance in the law enforcement field. * * * The Committee bill draws from the SAODAP concept, but focuseson the aspects of drug control that were excluded from the formeragency's purview, i.e., the government's efforts to control thesupply of abused drugs. It is in the area of supply control, beit in foreign or domestic programs, that the Committee perceivesthe greatest current need for central direction. In recommending the establishment of an office to which theReagan Administration appeared to be implacably opposed, theSenate Judiciary Committee took pains to observe that theDirector of the Drug Abuse Policy office was not capable ofperforming the necessary coordinative functions concerningFederal drug law enforcement efforts: [U]nder questioning by several Congressmen [of the HouseSubcommittee on Crime at a February 17, 1983, hearing on thecoordination of drug enforcement efforts] it became clear thatthe director does not have the authority or stature to overseethe implementation of the Federal strategy. Anxious to reassure the Administration about the proposedcabinet-level Office, the Committee made it clear that, inimplementing the legislation, the President would have a greatdeal of flexibility; for example, the Office would not have to beestablished in the Executive office of the President, and theAttorney General could be appointed the Director of the centraldrug agency. However, the Committee was insistent that theDirector have something like a cabinet-level status because suchstatus was deemed "necessary if the office is to have theinfluence needed to impose a truce on interagency feuding, toinsure maximum participation, and to allocate budgetary resourcesfor top efficiency and economy." Despite the Administration's opposition, the Senate passed S.1787. However, Congressional conferees compromised andsubstituted a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board for theOffice of National and International Drug Operations and Policyas the means for achieving greater coordination of Federal druglaw enforcement efforts. Both the House and Senate agreed to theConference Report, and Public Law No. 98-473 was thereafterapproved on October 12, 1984. Title II of this law was entitledthe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, and Chapter XIII ofthat title was designated the National Narcotics Act of 1984. Congress established the National Drug Enforcement PolicyBoard (Policy Board) because it found that drug trafficking wasestimated to be an $80 billion a year industry; only 5 to 15percent of the drugs imported into the country were interdicted;and controlling the supply of drugs was thought to be a key toreducing the drug-related crime epidemic. The Policy Board,chaired by the Attorney General, was and is charged withfacilitating coordination of U.S. operations and policyconcerning illegal law enforcement. As Chairman of the PolicyBoard, the Attorney General was given many duties, includingadvising the Policy Board concerning drug law enforcement andacting as primary advisor to the President and Congress onBoard-developed programs. The Act, however, declares that nothingtherein authorizes the Board or its Chairman to interfere withroutine law enforcement or intelligence decisions of any agency.Finally, the National Narcotics Act of 1984 amended the DrugAbuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act to declarethat one of the duties of the White House Office of Drug AbusePolicy Board was to insure coordination between the Policy Boardand health issues associated with drug abuse. The creation of the Policy Board in January 1985 representsonly the latest compromise between the President and Congress inthe ongoing search for more effective coordination of all facetsof the Federal drug abuse effort. It remains to be seen whetheran entity like the Policy Board can effectively oversee, police,and coordinate all Federal law enforcement efforts and whethersome other mechanism is needed to impose coordination of Federaldemand reduction and supply reduction strategies. Legislative Responses to the Drug Problem In addition to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,other important legislative initiatives have been adopted inrecent years. For example, the Department of DefenseAuthorization Act of 1982 contained a provision, "MilitaryCooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Officials," whichwas intended to codify the practices of cooperation that haddeveloped between military and civilian law enforcementauthorities. The Act was also designed to improve the level ofcooperation by delineating precisely that assistance whichmilitary commanders could provide and by permitting militarypersonnel to operate military equipment that had been lent tocivilian drug enforcement agencies. This legislation was deemednecessary for the following reasons: The rising tide of drugs being smuggled into the United Statesby land, sea, and air presents a grave threat to all Americans. * * * Only through the dedicated work of all of Federal, State, andlocal law enforcement agencies can we begin to stem this tide. Infighting this battle, it is important to maximize the degree ofcooperation between the military and civilian law enforcement. Atthe same time, we must recognize the need to maintain thetraditional balance of authority between civilians and themilitary. The most important and innovative part of the legislation wasSection 374, which permits the Secretary of Defense to assignDepartment personnel to operate and maintain military equipmentthat had been made available to an agency with jurisdiction toenforce the Controlled Substances Act. This relatively simplechange increased geometrically the potential interdictioncapability of Federal drug law enforcement agencies. The year 1984 was a prolific one for legislation dealing withdiscrete areas in drug law enforcement. The Controlled SubstanceRegistrant Protection Act of 1984 made it illegal, among otherthings, to steal any quantity of a controlled substance from aregistrant. Congress also directed the Attorney General,notwithstanding the scheduling provisions of the ControlledSubstances Act, to transfer methaqualone, commonly known by thebrand name Quaalude, from Schedule II to Schedule I, with theeffect of making the prescription of methaqualone unlawfulbecause it no longer had an approved medical use. While remainingcommitted to the proposition that scheduling of controlledsubstances ordinarily should be handled in accordance with theadministrative procedures mandated by the Controlled SubstancesAct, Congress took this legislative action after determining thatcircumstances required it to do so and that the adverse effectsof the diversion of methaqualone outweighed its therapeuticusefulness. Congress also passed the Aviation Drug-Trafficking ControlAct, which amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, to, amongother things, require the Administrator of the FAA to revokeairman certificates and aircraft registrations of those convictedof violating any Federal or State law relating to controlledsubstances, except where the violations involved possessionoffenses. The Act also made it illegal for any person to serve asan airman without an airman's certificate in connection with atransportation that constitutes a Federal or State drug felonyoffense. Although the Controlled Substance Registrant Protection Act of1984, the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act, and theCongressional rescheduling of methaqualone were necessary laws,by far the most important drug law enforcement measures passed in1984 were contained in several provisions of the ComprehensiveCrime Control Act of 1984. The Act included: (i) Bail Reform Act of 1984: This Act comprises many sections,but the most important and most controversial was that codifiedin 18 U.S.C. Section 3142. Section 3142 provides that when aperson charged with an offense appears before a judicial officer,the judicial officer must order that, pending trial, the accusedbe released on personal recognizance or upon execution of anunsecured appearance bond; released upon certain listedconditions; temporarily detained to permit exclusion ordeportation if not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident;temporarily detained to permit revocation of a prior conditionalrelease; or detained. The preventive detention provision statesthat the judicial officer must hold a hearing in any caseinvolving a narcotics offense for which imprisonment for ten ormore years is prescribed to determine whether any conditions willassure the accused's appearance and the safety of any otherperson and of the community. In any such hearing the accused mustprove that there are conditions that will assure his appearanceor the community's safety, if the judicial officer finds thatthere is probable cause to believe that the person committed theoffense. (ii) Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984: This legislationmade extensive revisions to Federal civil and criminal forfeiturelaws and procedures, which had targeted the assets ofracketeering and drug trafficking organizations: Today few in the Congress or the law enforcement communityfail to recognize that the traditional criminal sanctions of fineand imprisonment are inadequate to deter or punish the enormouslyprofitable trade in dangerous drugs . . . . Clearly, if lawenforcement efforts to combat racketeering and drug traffickingare to be successful, they must include an attack on the economicaspects of these crimes. Forfeiture is the mechanism throughwhich such an attack may be made. This 1984 legislation was designed to eliminate limitationsand ambiguities that had "significantly impeded the fullrealization of forfeiture's potential as a powerful lawenforcement weapon." With respect to the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act, the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act didseveral things, including confirming the Supreme Court's decisionin Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16(1983) that adefendant's ill-gotten profits from racketeering wereforfeitable; defining the property subject to forfeiture toinclude real property; making the relation back doctrine, i.e.,U.S. interest in forfeitable property arises at the time of thecommission of the act that gives rise to the forfeiture,applicable in criminal forfeiture proceedings; and expandingpost-indictment prior restraining order authority to preserve theavailability of forfeiture assets by making an indictmentsufficient to establish conclusively probable cause that theproperty will be forfeited. The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act also amended the 1970Comprehensive Act. With respect to criminal forfeiture, the 1984Act added a new provision to the 1970 act that is applicable toall felony drug offenses, including the Continuing CriminalEnterprise offense. In virtually all respects, the drug criminalforfeiture provisions are now identical to those of the amendedRICO statute. The new drug criminal forfeiture provision alsocreates a rebuttable presumption that any property of a personconvicted of a drug felony is subject to forfeiture if thegovernment establishes by a preponderance of the evidence thatthe defendant acquired the property during the period ofviolation, or within a reasonably short period thereafter, andthere was no likely source for the property other than theviolation. (iii) Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984.This legislation generally enhanced the penalties for violationsof the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, it provided a20-year prison term and a $250,000 fine for violations involvingspecified large amounts of Schedule I and II narcotic drugs, PCPand LSD; raised the fine for violations involving all Schedule Ior II substances and enhanced the fines for violations involvingSchedule III, IV, and V substances. With respect to all doublingprovisions for recidivists in the Controlled Substances Act, the1984 legislation removed an ambiguity in the existing law byproviding that a State drug felony conviction would trigger theprovisions; it went further by providing that a Foreign drugfelony conviction would have the same effect. Finally, the 1984legislation provided that anyone who distributed controlledsubstances on or within 1,000 feet of school property could besubjected to a prison term or fine or both up to twice what isotherwise provided. (iv) Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984. Thislegislation "represent[ed] the first major updating of theregulatory provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and theControlled Substances Import and Export Act since their enactmentin 1970." In doing so, the 1984 amendments focusedprincipally on diversion of drugs of legitimate origin into theillicit market and the manufacture and abuse of new drugs, suchas controlled substance analogs. With respect to the problem ofdiversion, which Congress had attempted to address in the 1970Comprehensive Act by creating a closed system, the legislativehistory states: Diversion of legally produced drugs into illicit channels is amajor part of the drug abuse problem in the United States. It isestimated that between 60 and 70 percent of all drug-relateddeaths and injuries involve drugs that were originally part ofthe legitimate drug production and distribution chain. Also,diversion of legally produced drugs often evidences the same sortof large-scale trafficking more commonly associated with thetrade in wholly illicit drugs. * * * Unfortunately, experience under the [CSA] over the past decadehas demonstrated that the strong regulatory authority to maintaina "closed" distribution chain does not exist at thepractitioner level. Yet, it is estimated that 80 to 90 percent ofall current diversion occurs at this level. In response to this diversion problem, Congress amended theControlled Substances Act to, among other things, permit theAttorney General to deny registration to practitioners if suchregistration would be inconsistent with the public interest,authorize the Attorney General to suspend or revoke aregistration upon the recommendation of a competent stateauthority or if the public interest requires it; and authorizethe Attorney General to make grants to State and localgovernments in connection with those governments' anti-diversionprograms. With respect to the problem of the manufacture and abuse ofnew drugs, Congress found that: [T]he procedural requirements for controlling a drug under 21U.S.C. 811 have proven sufficiently time consuming that theypreclude a swift response when an as yet uncontrolled drugrapidly enters the illicit market and creates a significanthealth problem. As a result of the Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of1984, Congress gave the Attorney General emergency schedulingauthority. Under that authority, the Attorney General ispermitted to schedule a drug in Schedule I on a temporary basis,for up to one year, if he determines that such action is"necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the publicsafety." In making this determination, the Attorney Generalneed only consider the history and current pattern of abuse, thescope, duration, and significance of abuse, and the nature of therisk, if any, to the public health. The temporary scheduling maybe extended for up to six months while a rule-making proceedingis conducted for the purpose of permanently scheduling the drug.Such a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicialreview. (v) Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting ActAmendments: "Without the means to launder money, therebymaking cash generated by a criminal enterprise appear to comefrom a legitimate source, organized crime could not flourish asit now does." The 1984 amendments of the Currency andForeign Transactions Reporting Act were designed to "finetune the [then] current currency reporting law." One of thechanges adopted increased the civil penalty for violating therecords and reporting requirements of the Act from $1,000 to$10,000 for each violation and the criminal penalty from $1,000and 1 year in prison to $250,000 and 5 years imprisonment. Thesechanges were deemed necessary because: [I]t is important to recognize that [the requirements] areprimarily directed at persons who make a lucrative career in theillicit drug trade and organized crime. As such, the penaltiesare far too low to deter and punish such activity. Indeed, themodest penalties now applicable may simply be written off as acost of doing business. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 was intended to,and did in fact, provide Federal law enforcement agents withbetter tools for combatting drug traffickers. However, it isstill too early to evaluate how these tools have been used. Important legislation in the field of drug abuse since 1981has not been restricted only to matters relating to improvingdrug law enforcement. As noted previously, Congress in 1979rejected President Carter's proposal that NIDA's State formulagrants for drug abuse programs be consolidated with those foralcoholism and mental health. Instead it reauthorized the drugformula grants through September 30, 1981. In passing the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Congress reversed itself andfundamentally changed the role that the Federal Government playsin overseeing and funding of drug abuse prevention, treatment andrehabilitation programs by creating an Alcohol and Drug Abuse andMental Health Service Block Grant (ADMS Block Grant). The newprogram was designed to distribute the Federal money that hadpreviously been provided to the States through formula andproject grants and contracts. One of the principal motivations for adopting the block grantapproach was the belief that the States were in the best positionto determine the most efficacious use of Federal funds: The ADMS Block . . . [was] established in 1981 to provideState and local governments greater flexibility anddecision-making authority in focusing Federal, State, and localresources on needs and priorities they know best and in ways theybelieve are best suited to local conditions. Block grants werealso intended to eliminate duplication and overlapping ofservices and allow States to better integrate and coordinateservices funded by several levels of government. In addition to establishing the ADMS Block Grant, the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act specified how the States were to spendtheir allotment. Although requiring the States to file reportswith information permitting the Secretary of Health and HumanServices to determine whether the Federal funds provided wereexpended in conformity with the objectives of the block grant,the Act also directed the Secretary not to impose burdensomereporting requirements. The reporting requirements concerning theblock grant imposed by the Secretary were much less extensivethan those existing under the categorical programs that existedprior to the adoption of the block grant approach. The impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act has beenestimated: Since the establishment of the ADMS Block Grant, theamount of Federal money going to State drug abuse prevention andtreatment programs has declined by approximately 40 percent. Itis not possible, however, to determine what the impact of thisreduction has been because a portion, perhaps significant, of thereduction represents savings due to the elimination of overheadadministrative costs. Law Enforcement and Executive Responses to the Drug Problem. Recognizing that drug abuse and drug trafficking are seriousnational problems, which also pose a threat to national security,the Reagan Administration has taken steps since 1981 that havebeen designed to improve Federal law enforcement efforts againstdrug traffickers. Narcotics intelligence is essential to any drug lawenforcement program. In that regard, on December 4, 1981,President Reagan issued an executive order, entitled "UnitedStates Intelligence Activities," which was intended to"control and provide direction and guidance to theIntelligence Community." Among the executive order'sprovisions relating to drugs, one authorizes agencies within theU.S. Intelligence Community to participate in law enforcementactivities to investigate or prevent international narcoticsactivities and to render assistance and cooperation to lawenforcement authorities not otherwise precluded by law. Inaddition, agencies within the Intelligence Community areauthorized to collect, retain, or disseminate informationconcerning U.S. persons obtained during the course of a lawfulinternational narcotics investigation or incidentally obtainedinformation indicating involvement in activities that may violatefederal, state, local or foreign laws. Finally, the ExecutiveOrder directs that all departments and agencies involved in theU.S. intelligence effort shall cooperate to provide the Presidentand the National Security Council with information on which tobase decisions concerning the conduct and development of foreign,defense, and economic policy and the protection of U.S. nationalinterests. Whether the U.S. Intelligence Community has played or willplay the important role in the Nation's anti-drug effortenvisioned for it by Executive Order 12333 depends upon thecommitment of its constituent departments and agencies toeliminating this threat to national security. The Executive Orderwas an important event because it represented recognition at thehighest level of the Executive Branch that, without accurate andadequate strategic, operational, and tactical narcoticsintelligence, the Federal drug trafficking prevention effortwould be seriously crippled. During 1981 the deleterious effect of drug trafficking on thequality of life in Florida, and especially in South Florida, hadbecome so great that the State's citizens demanded prompt andeffective responses by government at all levels. At the Federallevel, President Reagan established on January 28, 1982, acabinet-level South Florida Task Force, also known as OperationFlorida, which was chaired by Vice President Bush, to"assist and coordinate Federal efforts with those of Stateand local authorities in order to reduce crime" and whichwas patterned after previous multi-agency efforts, such as theCENTAC program. The South Florida Task Force was intended to be a"broad, multifaceted anti-crime program," but its focuswas on interdiction and the arrest and prosecution of drugsmugglers. Assistance to the South Florida Task Force, whichbecame operational on March 15, 1982, was provided by DEA,Customs, FBI, BATF, the Marshals Service, the Coast Guard, andthe Department of Defense. One of the more significant features of the South Florida TaskForce was the creation of the South Florida Joint Task Group,which consisted of DEA and Customs personnel and which wascharged with conducting follow-up investigations of druginterdictions. In authorizing Customs agents to conduct suchinvestigations under the supervision of DEA on March 20, 1982,the Attorney General modified, albeit slightly, the structure ofFederal drug enforcement that had been established by PresidentNixon's 1973 reorganization plan. That plan had prohibitedCustoms agents from exercising investigative, intelligence, andlaw enforcement functions at locations away from ports of entryor borders. This action was in effect a recognition, longoverdue, that it was necessary, if law enforcement effortsagainst drug trafficking were to be improved, for Customs'intelligence and investigative functions to be expanded. Operations Greenback and Florida were successful in that theyforced traffickers to reduce their activities in Florida.However, the increased law enforcement pressure, as had happenedso many times in the past, resulted in the traffickers divertingdrug smuggling to Gulf and Eastern ports of entry and their moneylaundering activities to New York and the California-Mexico area.The successes achieved by the Florida multiagency operations thusexacerbated an already serious nationwide drug problem, but theyalso provided a model for responding to that problem. In 1982 theAttorney General appointed a committee to develop new approachesto the drug trafficking problem. The Committee concluded that"no single agency could cope with the problem" and that"many previous cooperative ventures, although limited inscope by comparison, provided the promise that agencies cancooperate and . . . only full-scale teamwork could meet thecrisis . . . ." The Committee's conclusions led to PresidentReagan's announcement on October 14, 1982, of the formation of 12regional Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which wereauthorized in January 1983 and became operational during thespring of that year. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program(OCDETF Program) is modeled after the South Florida Task Force,but its objectives are quite different. While the primaryobjective of the South Florida Task Force is the interdiction ofdrugs, the focus of the OCDETF Program is the leaders of largeorganizations, which control drug importation and distributionnetworks, and the disruption of those networks. The participatingFederal agencies are the U.S. Attorney's offices, DEA, FBI,Customs, BATF, IRS, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. MarshalsService. The OCDETF Program differs from previous multi-agencylaw enforcement efforts in several respects: the task forces aredirectly controlled by the Attorney General; the initial fundingwas under the control of the Attorney General; and the taskforces are to focus on only one major segment of organizedcriminal activity, drug trafficking. Because the OCDE Task Forcesare not intended to replace existing Federal enforcement effortsagainst drugs and organized crime, the work of the organizedCrime Strike Forces and the South Florida Task Force continue, asdo the efforts of the FBI, DEA, Customs, and U.S. Attorneysdirected against organized crime groups involved in drugtrafficking. Shortly after the establishment of the OCDETF Program, theReagan Administration adopted another multi-agency approach toone facet of the Nation's supply reduction efforts, interdiction,by creating the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System(NNBIS) which was to be headed by Vice President Bush. NNBIS wasgiven the responsibility for informally coordinating theinterdiction efforts of other organizations; it could recommend,but not require, that the organizations take certain actions, andit itself was not authorized to interdict drugs. When it becameoperational, NNBIS took over the interdiction coordinationresponsibilities of the South Florida Task Force. Despite theestablishment of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board in1984, NNBIS continues to operate as an interdiction coordinatingbody.

A good indicatorof the present complexity of the Federal response is the factthat 32 Federal agencies are now involved in the multifacetedeffort to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. In thischapter, the Commission describes the current anti-drug effortsof the principal Federal agencies and their roles in the nationalstrategy. The agencies are grouped by function, beginning withthose with central policy roles, followed by internationalefforts, interdiction, domestic enforcement, data gathering,intelligence, and United Nations efforts. Overall Policy The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board The National Narcotics Act of 1984 created the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board (the Board). This Cabinet-level Boardconsists of the Attorney General as Chairman and the Secretariesof State, Treasury, Defense, Transportation, and Health and HumanServices, as well as the Directors of Central Intelligence andthe Office of Management and Budget, as members. It is the latestmanifestation in the persistent effort to achieve singularity ofpurpose in the fight against drug abuse, despite the diversity ofFederal agencies involved. This fact is explicitly recognized inthe pertinent statutory language, found at 1302(b) of the Act, inwhich Congress expresses its intent to: (1) Maintain a national and international effort againstillegal drugs; (2) Coordinate fully the activities of the Federal agenciesinvolved; and (3) Charge a single, competent, and responsiblehigh-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by theAttorney General, with responsibility for coordinating UnitedStates policy with respect to national and international drug lawenforcement. This intent is based upon sweeping Congressional findings setforth in Section 1302(a) of the Act: (1) The flow of illegal narcotics into the United States is amajor and growing problem. (2) The problem of illegal drug activity falls across theentire spectrum of Federal activities both nationally andinternationally. (3) Illegal drug trafficking is estimated by the GeneralAccounting office to be an $80 billion per annum industry in theUnited States. (4) The annual consumption of drugs has reached epidemicproportions. (5) Despite the efforts of the United States Government andother nations, the mechanisms for smuggling opium and other harddrugs into the United States remain virtually intact, and UnitedStates agencies estimate that they are able to interdict no morethan 5 to 15 percent of all hard drugs flowing into the country. (6) Such significant indicators of the drug problem asdrug-related deaths, emergency room visits, hospital admissionsdue to drug-related incidents, and addiction rates are soaring. (7) Increased drug trafficking is strongly linked to violentaddiction-related crime, and recent studies have shown that over90 percent of heroin users rely upon criminal activity as a meansof income. (8) Much of the drug trafficking is handled by syndicates, asituation that results in increased violence and criminalactivity because of the competitive struggle for control of thedomestic drug market. (9) Controlling the supply of illicit drugs is a key toreducing the crime epidemic confronting every region of thecountry. (10) The magnitude and scope of the problem requires theestablishment of a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,chaired by the Attorney General, to facilitate coordination ofall Federal efforts by relevant agencies. (11) Such a Board must have responsibility for coordinatingthe operations of Federal agencies involved in attacking theproblem through the development of policy and resources, so thata unified and efficient effort can be undertaken. To accomplish the statutory purpose, S. 1304 of the Actspecifically empowers the Board to improve policy development andcoordination among Federal agencies by: (1) reviewing, evaluating, and developing U.S. governmentpolicy, strategy, and resources with respect to drug lawenforcement efforts, including the setting of budgetarypriorities and development of a national and international drugenforcement strategy; (2) facilitating coordination of all U.S. government effortsto halt national and international trafficking in illegal drugs; (3) coordinating the collection and evaluation of informationnecessary to implement U.S. policy with respect to drug lawenforcement. In furtherance of these aims S. 1306 of the Act directs theDirector of the Drug Abuse Policy Office to serve as an advisorto the Board on matters related to health issues in the drugabuse field. As a principal figure in the area of interdiction,the Vice President is included as an ex officio member. Under this scheme the Attorney General as Board Chairman, inconsultation with the other members, supervises the preparationof initiatives for consideration by the Board. The Board, underthe direction of the Chairman, then determines which items toinclude on its agenda and what priority each is to receive. Suchitems are then referred to the Coordinating Group, chaired by theDeputy Attorney General and consisting of senior officials fromthe member agencies. The Coordinating Group in turn is to submit to the Boardpractical recommendations, based on consultation with theagencies involved, for resolving drug law enforcement issues anddeveloping appropriate Federal policy. Both the Board and theCoordinating Group are supported in their efforts by a full-timeprofessional staff charged with performing necessary research,analysis, and writing. This staff is composed of individualsdrawn from various principal agencies. The intent of thismulti-agency composition at all levels, Board, CoordinatingGroup, and staff, is a reflection of the Board's intent, asexpressed in its 1985 Interim Act to Congress: This structure reflects the need for interagency participationat every level of Policy Board activity. The underlying principleis that there is a practical advantage to resolving differencesat the lowest level possible. Disagreements on issues willinevitably occur among various agency participants, but if allpoints of view are represented at each level, many differencescan be worked out by the Staff or Coordinating Group rather thanbeing elevated to the Policy Board. Section 1304(a) of the Act specifically directs the Board tofocus its work on two parts of the five-point National Strategyon Drug Abuse: drug law enforcement and internationalcooperation. In the area of drug enforcement, the Board pursuesfour principal strategies: 1) illegal drugs are to be destroyedat their source; 2) drug contraband is to be intercepted andseized en route to or at the borders of the United States; 3)drug trafficking organizations are to be identified, investigatedand prosecuted, and drug related assets seized and forfeited; and4) regulatory means are to be exercised to stem diverted drugabuse. The Board commenced its activities on April 24, 1985, almost ayear after its creation. In its first meeting, it adopted theorganizational structure described above. In the months betweenApril 1985 and the end of that year, the Board met five times andthe Coordinating Group, five times. Issues referred to theCoordinating Group during that time include "designer"drugs, efforts to improve government-wide drug seizurestatistics, and drug crisis management. Its agenda includes areport in January 1986, required by the Narcotics Act of 1984, onthe Board's achievements and the effectiveness of its policies tocombat national and international drug trafficking. It is also topublish a 1986 strategy report. Items under consideration forinclusion in the Boards agenda are: Budget Review. The Government has increased substantially theamount of resources devoted to drug law enforcement. Because ofthe numerous agencies and departments now involved in combattingdrug trafficking, the Policy Board is an ideal forum forconsidering the Government's overall drug law enforcement budget.The Board may undertake budget reviews to determine whetherresources are appropriately allocated. Consideration will also begiven to insuring proper interagency balance and the optimal useof tax dollars and resources in the drug war. Memoranda of Understanding. The Board may review the numerousjurisdictional Memoranda of Understanding between Federalagencies to determine the effectiveness of these mechanisms forinteragency cooperation. Interdiction. The Board may examine all of the interdictionprograms currently in place. Since, in the last few years, theFederal Government has made an increased effort to preventillegal drugs from entering the United States, the Board maypropose to analyze the effectiveness of interdiction as anoverall law enforcement strategy. The Board will also considerthe experience gained from the 1981 exception to the PosseComitatus Act to determine whether additional legislative actionis needed. Eradication. The Board proposes to assess the efficacy of alleradication strategies and the cost-effectiveness of eradicationas a drug law enforcement strategy. In addition, it will addresshow eradication relates to other elements of our enforcementstrategy. Because domestic marijuana reduction involves a numberof agencies, this issue is well suited to a study by the PolicyBoard and its staff. Other Issues. The Board may also refer other issues foradditional staff analysis. These might include: money laundering;financial investigative techniques, including asset forfeiture;the relationship of supply and demand reduction strategies; andthe collection and sharing of drug intelligence. The Board's vision of its role is summed up in its InterimReport: The Board is assuming the task of coordinating all drugrelated programs. To do this, the Board may develop a planningand management process for policy development and evaluation ofthe nation's narcotics law enforcement programs. White House Drug Abuse Policy Office Created within the White House by Executive Order 12368, theDrug Policy Abuse Office was established to ensure that thePresident is provided with a center for coordination andoversight of both national and international drug abuse functionsof all executive branch agencies. The role of this office hasbeen expanded to include drug trafficking issues as well. Theoffice publishes a regular report on both drug abuse and drugtrafficking, the National Strategy, which provides policydirection for all agencies involved in anti-drug efforts. As partof the White House Office of Policy Development, the White HouseDrug Abuse Policy Office provides the President with a directadvisor on drug abuse policy matters. International Efforts Bureau of International Narcotics Matters As the Federal agency responsible for coordinating the UnitedStates' drug control efforts overseas, the Department of State'sBureau of International Narcotics Matters (BINM) is pivotal inimplementing U.S. anti-drug policy on the international level.BINM attempts to encourage foreign coordination for joint illicitdrug control activities; bilateral assistance for crop controland interdiction programs in the form of equipment, training andtechnical advisory services; participation in internationalorganizations to increase drug control efforts in licit andillicit drug production countries; training programs for foreignpersonnel in illicit drug control functions to strengtheninterdiction and enforcement efforts; guidance, coordination andsupport of the work abroad of all U.S. government agenciesinvolved in drug control; and technical assistance forinternational demand reduction. BINM currently provides supportfor drug eradication efforts in 14 countries and is in large partresponsible for much of the world's crop control and eradicationefforts, described elsewhere in this report. Agency for International Development Section 126 of the Foreign Assistance Act instructs the Agencyfor International Development (AID) to "give priorityconsideration to programs which would help reduce illicitnarcotics cultivation by stimulating broader developmentopportunities." Given this mandate, AID issued PolicyDetermination No. 1 on drugs in 1982, encouraging the design ofprojects that provide economic alternatives to farmers in druggrowing areas. Overseas, AID coordinates with the StateDepartment's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. AID drug control efforts include finding a suitable mix ofsubstitute crops, assuring free market incentives, andencouraging appropriate host country pricing and marketingpolicies. AID attempts to develop and implement developmentprojects that facilitate the host government's enforcement ofexisting bans on drug production. Department of Agriculture The United States Department of Agriculture through theAgricultural Research Service (ARS) assists in the control ofillicit drug plants by providing technical information pertainingto eradication and substitute crops. Scientists in the ARSconduct research on the use of herbicides and other techniquesfor eradication, as well as the use of substitute crops forfarmers presently producing drugs. ARS scientists also provideexpert advice to the State Department and cooperating foreigncountries regarding proposed eradication programs. Potentialadverse environmental impacts are assessed prior to therecommendation of control measures, whether it be chemical,mechanical, fire, biological, or through genetic manipulation ora combination of two or more of these techniques. Scientists fromARS have been involved in drug research since 1972 and haveassisted control authorities in several drug producing countriesin the Americas and the Near and Far East. Interdiction National Narcotics Border Interdiction System The National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS)attempts to accomplish comprehensive planning in the limited areaof interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders. NNBIS was createdby the President on March 23, 1983, and is directed by the VicePresident. NNBIS' mission is to improve border interdiction byaccomplishing a threefold goal: to continue to improveinteragency coordination among law enforcement agencies; tomaximize the participation of the military services and Federalagencies involved in drug interdiction; and to increase andprovide interaction for intelligence community involvement ininterdiction efforts. Participating agencies include the U.S.Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Drug EnforcementAdministration (of particular importance is the contribution ofDEA's El Paso Intelligence Center - EPIC) the Border Patrol, theDepartment of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, theFederal Aviation Administration, the National oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, the Federal CommunicationsCommission, and the Department of State. NNBIS itself consists ofa headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. and six regionaloffices: Miami, New Orleans, El Paso, New York, Chicago and LongBeach, California. Actual interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders isaccomplished by individual agencies during single agency ormulti-agency special operations. The role of NNBIS is to providenecessary equipment, intelligence, detection and trend analysissupport. Specific NNBIS contributions to drug seizures consist ofdirect support, such as the passing of "real-time"information, general information, or regional analysis. NNBISstaffs, consisting of agency-contributed personnel in bothWashington and the regional centers, coordinate with contributingagency staffs to lay the groundwork for special initiatives,which then can proceed in a timely fashion to enhance drug lawenforcement efforts. Of critical importance in understandingNNBIS' role is the fact that the activity has no funding of itsown. It is entirely dependent upon agency contributions ofmanpower and intelligence and does not have a direct operationalauthority. It can only inform and advise its constituent agenciesconcerning opportunities for coordinated or expanded operations.Thus, criticisms of NNBIS, alleging that many seizures would haveoccurred anyway, even if NNBIS did not exist, miss the point.Individual agencies are intended, indeed mandated, to carry outtheir missions, including contraband seizures. NNBIS is intendedto supplement, not replace, those efforts. It has a steadilyimproving record of doing so, a fact recognized even by somecritics. Operation Hat Trick I In the fall of 1984 Hat Trick I, the first major coordinationeffort attempted under the NNBIS management mechanism, wasundertaken. Hat Trick I was designed to disrupt the transshipmentof the fall harvest of marijuana from Colombia, whilesimultaneously intercepting any cocaine shipped during theoperation. During the 60-day operation, an intercept line of Coast Guardand Navy ships was formed in the Caribbean to halt smugglingvessels. The Department of Defense supplemented the operationwith electronic equipment capable of detecting both aircraftwhich flew over the ships and vessels which slipped through thenet. Additionally, the Customs Service and Border Patrolincreased their efforts at and between the ports of entry to theUnited States, and the intelligence community added previouslyunprecedented support to the effort. This multi-agency approachemphasized the critical need for compatible communicationscapabilities. This lesson is being carried forward in currentoperational planning. The anticipated reaction to this operation was an attempt bythe smugglers in Colombia to stockpile shipments. To counterthis, multi-agency teams, headed by the Department of State,visited Colombia and neighboring countries to brief officialsthere about the operation and to elicit their support. TheColombian government, which had declared a "war withoutquarter" against drugs the previous year, seized theopportunity to step up efforts to destroy the marijuana in thatcountry. Colombian officials were also placed aboard U.S. CoastGuard cutters, operating off the Colombian coast to coordinatewith Colombian enforcement units. Operation Hat Trick I proceeded as expected, with massivemaritime seizures, and a significant reduction of maritime drugshipments. According to NNBIS, over 600,000 pounds of marijuanaand 6,000 pounds of cocaine were seized by U.S. agencies duringthe operation. Simultaneously, the Colombian government, througheradication and destruction of stockpiled contraband, removedover 50 percent of the fall marijuana crop from possible export. Operation Hat Trick II Operation Hat Trick I has come to be viewed as a prototypeeffort in it initiated improvements in planning, communicationssecurity, in-country efforts, air operations, intelligence andresource support. Hat Trick II, a much more ambitious operationbegun in November 1985 and still under way, is the logicalfollow-on, drawing carefully on lessons learned from Hat Trick I. Coordinated by NNBIS and consisting of the combined forces ofU.S. civilian drug enforcement agencies and all branches of themilitary, Hat Trick II involves increased land and air patrols todisrupt drug traffic into the United States. The long-term goalof the operation is to affect the worldwide availability of drugsby increasing international pressure on traffickingorganizations. It is a complex operation that tightenssurveillance along our border with Mexico and along the known airand ocean supply routes from South America and other Caribbeancountries. The United States Navy and the Coast Guard, working together,provide the primary maritime surveillance and interdiction forcesfor Hat Trick II, while the U.S. Customs Service works as thelead agency with the Navy, Air Force, Army and Marines indirecting air operations. The Customs Service and the Immigrationand Naturalization Service Border Patrol are conductingintensified operations all along U.S. land and sea borders.Through Department of State and DEA initiatives, the U.S. isworking to provide the maximum coordination of anti-drug effortsin foreign countries. Hat Trick II employs military surveillance aircraft toidentify and track smugglers and to exploit the known routestraffickers use from their source countries to their ultimatedestination. If the smugglers attempt to hide and wait in asource or transit country, the drug enforcement authorities inthose countries are prepared to seize drugs and make arrests. Animportant key to Hat Trick II lies in the ability of source andtransit countries to take advantage of the disruption the UnitedStates has caused in normal drug trafficking. Colombia, Panama,Venezuela, Jamaica and other countries throughout the region arecooperating in this international effort. Hat Trick II has contributed significantly to institutionalchange among involved agencies. For example, as a result ofplanning initiatives for Hat Trick II, the U.S. Navy has changedits policies, and Navy ships have served as platforms for asignificantly increased number of Coast Guard interdictions.Further, military radars have become a much more significantfactor in aircraft seizures. The diversions in smuggling routesand methods caused by the operation have made drug trafficking amore costly enterprise for smugglers, and secure communicationsenhancements have kept operational information away from them.Major cocaine seizures have resulted from U.S. Bahamiancooperation. The intelligence community has greatly increased itscollection and dissemination of tactical intelligence. Each lawenforcement agency has, in essence, developed specializedintra-agency operations in support of the overall Hat Trick IIeffort. Operation Blue Lightning To test the effectiveness of conducting an operation withFederal, State and local participation, as well as exercising thegrowing U.S.-Bahamian partnership against drug smuggling, a majorspecial operation, entitled "Blue Lightning," wasdevised and coordinated from the NNBIS Regional Center in Miami. Blue Lightning concentrated on two geographical areas, theBahamian Archipelago and the area West of the Bahamas up to andincluding the coast of Florida. In the Bahamas islands weretargeted as "stash sites," or drug holding areas, andunannounced sweep teams were flown in to search for contraband.The sweep teams were composed of Bahamian Police, transported byU.S. military helicopters. Efforts were coordinated by the DEAand U.S. Embassy in Nassau. The effort outside the Bahamasincluded coordinated, augmented air and sea detection capabilityup to the Florida coast. As a primary participant in the NNBIScoordinated operation, the U.S. Customs Service was requested toassume lead agency status for the portion of the operationoutside the Bahamas. Overall Blue Lightning participants included16 State, county and city law enforcement agencies, the CustomsService, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National ParkService in addition to the DEA and the Government of the Bahamas.Additionally, Bahamian personnel were assigned to South Floridafor the duration of the operation to fly law enforcement missionswith U.S. Customs. The raids by Bahamian authorities forced smugglers to movetheir drugs to the U.S. immediately, where law enforcement unitswere positioned to intercept them. Over 6,000 pounds of cocaine,33,000 pounds of marijuana, and over $1.5 million worth ofvessels, aircraft, trailers and cash were seized. Additionally,interdiction techniques were tested and refined, heightening theability to conduct coordinated international and interagencyoperations. U.S. Coast Guard Responsible in large part for U.S. drug interdiction efforts,the Coast Guard's strategy has been mainly directed towardintercepting motherships as they transit the major passes of theCaribbean. To effect this "choke point" strategy, theCoast Guard conducts both continuous surface patrols and frequentsurveillance flights over the waters of interest, and boards andinspects suspect vessels at sea. In the past major Coast Guardresources have been concentrated in the "choke points"traditionally transversed by traffickers. Cutters now morefrequently patrol the Bahamas, the eastern passes of theCaribbean, and the Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coastal areas. During the past several years the Coast Guard has increasedthe number of cutter patrol days and aircraft operating hoursdevoted to drug interdiction, increasing their ability to respondquickly to sightings and other intelligence. In addition, theCoast Guard is deploying leased Sea Based Aerostats (SBAs), whichare small tethered balloons equipped with surface search radar,tethered offshore at sufficient altitude to greatly increase itsrange. As part of a coordinated operation, surface targetinformation is paused to a command and control cutter forevaluation and deployment of other assigned units, both surfaceand air. Better intelligence remains an important factor in increasingthe Coast Guard's overall interdiction effectiveness. The mostcritical need is timely and accurate information on the number,identity, location and destination of vessels and aircraftcarrying contraband which are bound for the United States. Duringthe past two years improvements have been made in the collection,evaluation, and dissemination of intelligence. A new intelligencecoordination center in Washington, D.C. maintains a 24-hourall-source watch to exploit all intelligence systems available tothe Coast Guard, and produces intelligence tailored to the needsof operational commanders. The Coast Guard is also continuingliaison with the law enforcement community's intelligencenetwork. U.S. Customs Service The U.S. Customs Service participates in several multiagencyinvestigative programs, including the Florida Joint Task Groupand the President's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.The efforts of these two programs alone resulted in 1,194 arrestsand drug seizures of 35,702 pounds of cocaine, 132 pounds ofheroin, and 3,848,293 pounds of marijuana from FY 1952 to FY1985. Prompted by the increasing sophistication of violators ofcritical technology and trade laws, including individuals indrug-related activities, the Customs Service established anOffice of Intelligence in 1981. Customs-acquired intelligence ofnational security interest is, for the first time, actively beingdisseminated to community agencies, and the intelligencecommunity is currently developing information useful for drugenforcement. The development of secure communications facilitieswithin the Customs Service, currently underway, will furtherenhance this capability. The Customs Aviation and Marine Programs are consistentlychanged and upgraded to reflect new technologies and equipmentand improved tactics and strategy. Drug smugglers have respondedto these programs by adjusting their routes to elude theincreased effectiveness of enforcement officials. The Customs Service has developed teams of inspectors andcanine enforcement officers to more thoroughly examine persons,conveyances, and cargo determined to be high risk. These mobileteams, which use highly trained dogs to detect drugs, allowCustoms to release cargo and passengers deemed to be low riskwithout examination, thus speeding the entry of most people andcargo. The teams comprise 12 percent of the inspectionalworkforce, but have accounted for the greater proportion of thedrug seizures. During the first 9 months of FY 1985, they havebeen responsible for 66 percent (10,269 pounds) of the hashish,87 percent (876 pounds) of the cocaine, and 40 percent (243pounds) of the heroin that has been seized by inspectors. During the past three years, the Customs Service has attemptedto convince the commercial air and sea carriers of theirresponsibilities in the effort to halt drug trafficking. As partof this initiative Customs contacted the major carriers andsigned cooperative agreements with a number of them. These setout specific measures designed to prevent and detect the use ofcommercial vessels and aircraft that smuggle drugs and othercontraband. Customs works closely with carriers, to apprise themof their vulnerabilities through regular meetings; to provide atraining program on cargo, aircraft, and facility security; toperform security surveys; and to compile threat assessments. Thiscooperation between Customs and commercial carriers has led tothe detection of drugs and the transmittal of valuableintelligence to local customs officials. Department of Defense In 1981 Congress passed legislation clarifying statutoryrestrictions on the use of Department of Defense (DOD) resourcesfor law enforcement purposes. As a result, the Department ofDefense now has greater freedom to support Federal lawenforcement agencies. DOD resources play an important role in theFederal drug interdiction program by providing surveillance andsupport services, such as using aircraft to search for smugglersand Navy ships to tow or escort vessels seized by the Coast Guardto the nearest U.S. port. As of the end of September 1985, theDOD has been involved in 38 vessel seizures, and their assistancehas been invaluable during NNBIS-directed joint operations. DOD's increased involvement in drug law enforcement as aresult of amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act, has provedpivotal in many instances. In fact, the Joint Chiefs of Staffrecommended unanimously in early 1985 that the U.S. military beengaged to an unprecedented extent in fighting drug traffickingand production. It called for the implementation of a massive newprogram in which military forces would expand their presentsupportive role by becoming involved in drug interdiction, intraining Central American nation's anti-drug forces, and inproviding needed weapons and equipment. Domestic Enforcement Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program(OCDETF), comprised of 13 Task Forces nationwide, brings allFederal agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities togetherinto a coordinated effort against the largest and most importantnational and international drug trafficking rings. JusticeDepartment agencies involved in the effort include the FBI, theDEA, and the Marshals Service; Treasury Department agenciesinclude the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol,and Firearms, and the International Revenue Service. The CoastGuard has a major role in the program as well, and the Departmentof Defense offers intelligence and information on sightings ofsuspected drug traffickers heading for the U.S. by sea and air. In slightly more than two and one-half years, the Task Forcehas produced 1,721 indictments against 6,545 defendants. The TaskForce emphasis is on prosecuting and imprisoning drug kingpins,money launderers, and financiers. There is also strong focus onseizing cash and drug-related assets. In fact, the assets seizedmay soon exceed the cost of the Task Force program. The Task force Program relies largely on the ContinuingCriminal Enterprise Statutory provision and the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. Theconviction rate in cases reaching disposition is approximately 95percent. State and local officers participate in nearly one-halfof the Task Force investigations. New international law enforcement cooperation also has beenachieved, since nearly one-half of Task Force cases targetorganizations international in scope. These efforts have receivedsubstantial support from foreign law enforcement agencies, asindicated by the fact that five percent of Task Force cases nowinvolve direct participation by foreign police. This has createda new focal point for international drug investigations. Drug Enforcement Administration As the lead Federal drug agency the Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) is charged with enforcing the controlledsubstance laws and regulations of the United States. DEA alsoparticipates in non-enforcement programs to reduce the demand fordrugs. Part of the Department of Justice, DEA comprises 2,400special agents in 121 domestic field offices and 61 offices inover 40 foreign countries. DEA's primary objectives are: - To bring to bear all the Federal resources on the arrest,prosecution, and immobilization of major drug traffickingorganizations via continued coordination with other Federalagencies and the use of financial and legal tools, emergingtechnology, and sophisticated investigative techniques. - To reduce the supply of illicit drugs from source countries,thereby reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the UnitedStates and abroad via source country initiatives, assistance toforeign government, training for foreign law enforcementauthorities, and public support for successful foreign governmentendeavors. - To significantly reduce the diversion of controlledsubstances from the legitimate channels in which they aremanufactured, distributed, and dispensed through a vigorousprogram of investigations and State, local, and internationalcooperation. - To enlist the active participation of State and localgovernments and law enforcement agencies in the national drugeradication program, clandestine laboratory task forces, Stateand local task forces, and other multi-state coordinativeefforts. - To participate actively and aggressively in the Federal,State, and local effort to mobilize public support for the drugenforcement and abuse prevention program by implementingstrategies and educational programs that stimulate cooperationamong State and local criminal justice agencies, school,businesses, civic, and parent groups. - To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DEAoperations through the implementation of specific programsdesigned to enhance employee performance. Domestic Eradication Programs The DEA's Domestic Eradication/Suppression Program hasexpanded significantly since the Drug Enforcement Administrationfirst provided eradication assistance to Hawaii in 1979, andcurrently all 50 States participate in this venture. DEAencourages State and local eradication and provides training,equipment, funding and investigative and aircraft resources. In1984, with 48 States participating, approximately 3.8 millionmarijuana plants were eradicated. The Secretary of the Interiorhas also been authorized by a recent Executive Order to conductan extensive eradication program targeting marijuana plants onFederal lands. Spraying commenced on October 6, 1985. El Paso Intelligence Center The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) is the Drug EnforcementAdministration's national drug information center, withintelligence systems located at DEA headquarters, and in DEA'sforeign and domestic offices. EPIC's strategic intelligenceprogram furnishes geographic assessments, estimates, and warningsof drug availability, production, trafficking trends and routes.It distributes information to foreign, Federal, State and localagencies through numerous publications. Its operationalintelligence program directly supports investigations underwayagainst top-level traffickers and supplies information onspecific organizations and their financial assets to supportinvestigations worldwide. As appropriate, this intelligence isshared with other Federal, State and local agencies to ensure itsmaximum utilization against drug traffickers. EPIC serves as aclearinghouse for drug information collected 24 hours a day. WithDEA as its lead agency, EPIC is staffed by special agents andintelligence analysts working with personnel from the FBI,Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal AviationAdministration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, CustomsService, Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,the Departments of Defense and State, and members of the Federalintelligence community. Today all States participate in EPICthrough chartered arrangements made between DEA and theindividual States. Federal Bureau of Investigation Although DEA is nominally the lead Drug Enforcement Agency,its Director reports to the Director of the FBI. In granting theFBI concurrent jurisdiction with DEA, the Attorney General hasmandated that the FBI assume a significant drug enforcement role.He has also directed that FBI expertise in such areas asorganized crime financial investigations and white-collar crimeinvestigations be fully used in drug enforcement work. Both DEA and the FBI place strong emphasis on majordistributors and organizations involved in the manufacturing,importing, distributing and financing of illicit controlledsubstances. Conspiracy investigations (particularly theContinuing Criminal Enterprise and Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Statutes) are the focal point ofinvestigation efforts. Internal Revenue Service Within the Department of the Treasury, the Internal RevenueService (IRS) plays a critical role in U.S. drug control effortsby targeting drug traffickers' profits. IRS FinancialInvestigative Task Forces rely on the reports of financialtransactions, filed by banks and other institutions, to identifyfinanciers of criminal activities and money launderingspecialists. These reports include Currency Transaction Reportsand Foreign Bank Accounts Reports. Through these Task Forcestrace the transferrals of large sums of cash and identify theproceeds of drug trafficking. Data Gathering National Institute on Drug Abuse The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is the principalsource for current information about the effects of drug abuse.NIDA was established in 1972 as part of the Department of Health,Education and Welfare, and for its first nine years, operatedunder a broad mandate that included providing direct financialassistance for drug abuse education, training, treatment, andrehabilitation, as well as conducting research programs. With thepassage of The Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health ServicesBlock Grant in 1981, full responsibility for carrying outtreatment and prevention service functions was transferred fromNIDA to the States. Now a part of the Department of Health and Human Service,NIDA's current role in reducing demand, as set forth both in theNational Strategy and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of1983, is to develop and disseminate new knowledge about drugabuse, its prevention and treatment, and to exercise nationalleadership in encouraging and assisting the private sector, theStates, and local governments to implement and support drug abuseprevention and treatment programs in their communities. The NIDA research program has several important components.Through its epidemiological research program NIDA assesses thenature and extent of the nation's drug abuse problem and itstrends. NIDA supports two ongoing epidemiological surveys, theNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High SchoolSenior Survey. NIDA's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) monitorsinformation on the health consequences of drug use throughemergency room visit statistics and through medical examinerreports. In addition to these major efforts, NIDA provides grantsfor a number of special epidemiological studies. National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee The 11-agency National Narcotics Intelligence ConsumersCommittee consists of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service,the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury, Drug EnforcementAdministration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse, White House Drug Abuse Policy Office,Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service.This Committee was created as the primary vehicle at the nationallevel for review and dissemination of strategic intelligence. Itpublishes an annual report, the "Narcotics IntelligenceEstimate," which details the supply of drugs to the U.S.illicit market from foreign and domestic sources, and theirpatterns and rates of use. Intelligence Central Intelligence Agency Since the signing of Executive Order 12333 in December 1981,the Central Intelligence Agency has provided assistance to druglaw enforcement efforts through the collection, analysis, anddissemination of information regarding foreign narcoticsproduction. The CIA plans to upgrade its capabilities to gatherand assess drug-related intelligence over the next five years,and is currently coordinating research to develop technologieswhich can be used to better detect drug trafficking. United Nations United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control As the drug control arm of the United Nations, the UnitedNations for Drug Abuse Control was established in 1979 to assistgovernments by helping finance projects aimed at reducing theillicit supply of and demand for drugs. Projects undertaken bythe United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control include replacingillicit opium cultivation, treating and rehabilitating drugaddicts, strengthening control measures, or organizinginformation and education programs. The Fund relies entirely onvoluntary contributions, mainly from governments but also fromprivate sources. The United States has long been the primarycontributor to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. Inearly 1983, however, the Fund obtained a $40 million pledge,extending over a five year period, from the government of Italyfor coca control projects in South America. In early 1984 majordonors to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control agreedthat development assistance to narcotics growing regions shouldbe linked to government commitments to control illicit drugproduction.

These strategies, suchas source country eradication, interdiction, and domesticenforcement, are frequently attacked as expensive, too slow inproducing perceptible results, and frequently dangerous for thepublic officials charged with carrying them out. Far too oftensuch criticism seems to be the result of isolated examinationwithout regard to the programs' proper long-term goal orrelationship to strategic approaches to reduce demand. This report attempts to avoid such pitfalls, and in thischapter, examines and analyzes in its proper context, each of ourFederal efforts to reduce supply. It makes recommendations toencourage a coordinated, comprehensive effort at restricting theflow of drugs to the maximum extent possible, while complementarydemand reduction programs take hold. Legalization of Illicit Drugs The debate over strategies to reduce supply has produced awide range of proposals, including at one extreme the suggestionthat currently illicit drugs be legalized. Profits in the drugtrade are enormous, primarily because drugs are in high demandand because traffickers charge prices high enough to justify therisks involved. Proponents of legalization argue that because ofthe clear connection between illegal drug trafficking andorganized crime, making drugs legal would remove the enormousprofits in the illicit drug industry a priority. On the surface, this argument appears to have some merit.However, it omits any consideration of the health costs of drugabuse to the individual and to society, a dimension thisCommission views as fundamental. The drugs discussed in thisreport are inherently destructive to mind and body."Legalized" drugs would still alter behavior, impairproductivity and educational potential, damage vital organs, andkill. Moreover, legalization would almost certainly increasedemand, and therefore spread this destruction. Finally, thisCommission is not persuaded that legalization would result inorganized crime's abandonment of the drug business. While demandfor drugs in the United States represents a significant share ofglobal drug consumption, many other countries have a considerabledemand for drugs that would continue to be met by some or thesame organized crime groups now confronting this country. It is the position of this Commission that legalizingsubstances, which by their very nature destroy rather thanbenefit the individual and society, will not solve the problem ofdrug trafficking and is therefore not a viable option. ThisCommission is emphatic in its position that legalization of druguse is not a viable option. National Drug Enforcement Policy Board The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board ("theBoard"), presents a rare, possibly even unique, opportunityto bring focus and singularity of purpose to the Federalanti-drug effort. That fact is explicitly recognized in thelegislation creating the Board, wherein Congress acknowledgesthat for the first time, a single, competent, and responsiblehigh-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by theAttorney General, will be charged with this responsibility ofcoordinating United States policy with respect to national andinternational drug law enforcement. The sentiment is echoed by the Justice Department's ownhandbook discussing the National Narcotics Act of 1984, whichidentifies the Act as "a substantially revised version ofearlier 'Drug Czar' proposals." This Commission recognizes and has pointed out repeatedly inthis report that drug abuse, a term including all of the medical,social, and legal costs imposed on the American people by illegaldrugs, is a problem of proportions unmatched in any other area oflaw enforcement. A problem of such dimensions demands acoordinated response by the Federal government. The creation ofthe Board is a major step toward a truly unified, coordinatedenforcement effort. The performance of the Board to date has been somewhatambiguous. On the positive side, the Board has begun to meet, hasadopted an effective and comprehensive membership list for itsCoordinating Group, and has assembled a professional staff,composed of experienced and able agency representatives. It is troubling to note, however, that in light of theacknowledged urgency of the drug abuse situation, characterizedby Congress as an "epidemic," marked by"soaring" death rates and a "key to reducing thecrime epidemic confronting every region of the country," theBoard has yet to assert a clear leadership role. Instead, it hasadopted a more relaxed and collegial approach, waiting threemonths after the effective date of the Act to hold its firstmeeting. The Board began its work with a suggestion from theJustice Department that the Board's mandate is ". . . quitebroad and allows a range of possible roles - from an essentiallypassive research and analysis to active implementation of drugpolicies." This Commission notes with alarm that thiscontemplative expression does not even extend to policyformulation, which is the core of the Act's mandate. This concernis heightened by the Board's initial choice of agenda items:"designer drugs," drug seizure statistics, and drugmanagement. These topics are certainly important, but only one,seizure statistics, would have an impact on the formulation of acoordinated drug enforcement policy. Even that connection isremote. Uniform statistics are an important step towardcompilation of the reliable data base necessary to formulatepolicy and measure its effectiveness, but that is all they are.It is also troubling that the Board's first Interim Report toCongress consists almost entirely of a verbatim recitation ofportions of the 1984 National Strategy. An urgent but rational approach to the problem of drug abuseis needed. This must begin with the statement of a goal. What isthe ultimate objective of the policy Board and of our drugenforcement effort generally? This Commission is of the opinionthat the success of a national drug enforcement effort shouldultimately be measured in terms of reduced usage. The poisoningof minds and bodies is the evil we are combatting. All othertargets - manufacture or cultivation, processing, smuggling,distribution, and so on - would be of no consequence were it notfor the terrible destructive force of the use of illegal drugs.Eliminating drug use, then, must be the cornerstone of a nationalpolicy, and our national operational design - our strategy -should flow from it. It is at this fundamental level that theBoard's deliberations should begin, difficult as the dialogue maybe. A key to achieving the Board's essential singularity ofpurpose is the commitment of each Board member, on behalf of hisentire Department, to the goal of reducing drug consumption,accompanied by a resolve that no opportunity for action,particularly coordinated, multi-agency approaches, will beignored on the basis of parochial concerns. However, the use of acommittee in place of a single figure of authority runs theinherent risk of preserving interagency competition. It isencouraging to note that the Board has included as"potential items" for review total budgetary planningand administrative operations. This Commission submits thatvigorous review of the latter is urgently needed, with specialattention to what is not included in such memoranda and thereasons for such omissions. A combined and coordinated effort among the dozens of Federalagencies and offices, measured by a single standard of success,is certain to require program dislocations, reordering ofDepartmental priorities, and subordination of Departmental plansto Board direction. It will mean abandoning the "NotInvented Here" veto, which has far too often blockedinter-Departmental efforts. Cooperation is the heart of a trulycoordinated national attack on drug abuse. It will require notjust review, analysis and coordination, but initiative by theBoard to overcome unnecessary obstacles, outmoded concepts, andself-protective agency narrowness. Success will also depend uponcareful attention to long-term coordination between Federalagency operations and with State and local components, for ifexperience has shown anything in the effort against drugtrafficking, it is the resourcefulness and adaptability of thetraffickers. Successful interdiction or enforcement in one areais virtually certain to result in a relocation to a new area ofoperations. Long range planning is critical if our resources areto be used in a fashion which anticipates such movement, ratherthan reacts to it. It is neither possible nor desirable under our system of lawto invest a Board Chairman or any other "Czar" withdictatorial power to command other Cabinet members to conduct theaffairs of their respective Departments in a particular fashion.This fact is reflected in the tone of the Act, which empowers theChairman only to "advise, recommend, correlate andevaluate" and to direct action only with "theconcurrence of the head of the agency" involved. Such terms,intended to recognize the independence of the variousCabinet-level agencies, also spread among them a commonresponsibility for the success or failure of this vital task. Intelligence Accurate, timely, and complete intelligence is vital to theefficiency of United States anti-drug efforts. Strategies toreduce the supply of drugs, such as eradication, interdiction,investigations, and prosecutions are dependent on effectiveintelligence gathering. Less commonly acknowledged is thatstrategies to reduce demand are similarly dependent on suchintelligence. Adequate data is the foundation upon which focused,purposeful programs to reduce demand must be built. There issubstantial evidence to suggest that such a foundation is oftenlacking in our current approaches. Intelligence concerning both drug abuse and drug traffickingmust be shared between strategists who are working to reducesupply and demand. Evidence indicates that thorough strategicplanning, whether concerned with the reduction of demand or withattacks on supply, must carefully consider the available data onthe other side of the equation. For example, to achieve the mostcarefully reasoned deployment of resources, decisions concerningpriorities for disrupting the supply of a particular drug shouldconsider not only the geographical and political conditions insource and transit locations, but also carefully evaluate thegeographic and demographic data concerning drug consumption. Suchcoordination of data from both sides of the supply-demand dynamicis crucial to long-range planning. An awareness of traffickers'ultimate markets will facilitate anticipatory deployment ofresources. This unified theory of planning is the basis for the"all source" intelligence center discussed below. Domestic Data Collection One principal category of drug-related intelligence isconsumption and law enforcement data formally collected withinthe United States. Such data are essential to describe andmeasure the problems of drug abuse and trafficking. They are alsovital to our efforts to evaluate the effects of various effortsto reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. The reliability ofthese estimates is critical for both policy makers and drug lawenforcement officials. However, because drug trafficking and useare illicit activities, data concerning them are necessarilyestimates. Compounding this problem is the fragmentation of thecurrent system of drug data gathering. Much greater coordinationis imperative. Two primary ongoing studies are used to measure the number ofdrug users and frequency of drug abuse in the United States: thebi-annual Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the annual HighSchool Senior Survey, both sponsored by the National Institute onDrug Abuse (NIDA). The Household survey sample includes 5,000people 12 years of age or older, living in households across thecountry. The High School Senior survey questions approximately17,000 high school seniors. These surveys have been criticizedbecause they do not include information from those populationsthat are frequently involved with drugs, high school dropouts andpeople without residences. To compensate for this deficiency, ithas been proposed that these surveys oversample groups thought tobe heavy users of drugs. While these surveys provide estimates of the extent of drugabuse, they do not gather important data, such as the price andquantity of drugs purchased. Such information is crucial foreffective organized crime and drug enforcement policy planning,because it would provide information concerning the effects ofcertain enforcement actions on drug purchasing/using behavior.NIDA should amend these surveys to include questions about drugpurchases. To the extent possible, they should also be designedto determine the sources of the funds used to finance drugpurchases. Such data may be crucial to effective preventioneducation planning. NIDA provides two additional data bases of drug use in thisarea. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) collects dataconcerning drug-related emergency room visits and deaths. Thesestatistics are based on reports gathered by NIDA from one-sixthof the country's emergency rooms and two-thirds of the medicalexaminers' offices. NIDA collects information about drug users intreatment through the Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process(CODAP). Formerly, all States were required to provide such dataas a condition of Federal assistance. However, since theinstitution of block grants to partially fund State drug programsin 1982, the Federal government has not been able to compelparticipation in CODAP, and the number of participating Stateshas shrunk to approximately 15. Because of the importance of thistreatment data, the Federal government should again requireparticipation in CODAP. Much data concerning drug trafficking is gathered by the11-member National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee(NNICC) and reported annually in the Narcotics IntelligenceEstimates (NIE). This data includes estimates of the amount ofdrugs produced and entering the United States, traffickingpatterns, and prices and purity of drugs. Although the NIE claimsto be "the most comprehensive assessment prepared for theFederal Government on the worldwide illicit drug situation in1984," the report also states that, "[b]ecause of gapsin some of the data used to derive the estimates, there is a highdegree of uncertainty to the resulting estimates." In 1983 NNICC prepared a report analyzing the methodologiesused in preparing drug estimates. The report concluded that NNICCestimates are not timely, with estimates generally 18-30 monthsout of date; there is insufficient data concerning the price andpotency of drugs, in part because of inadequate input from Stateand local sources; and estimates of the total retail value ofdrugs is an imprecise measure, which should be replaced by abetter measurement of final drug sales. In addition, NNICC'smethodology has been criticized as "analysis bynegotiation," with final estimates resulting from abargaining process among the member agencies. Complaints aboutthe reliability of NIE data also result from the fact that NNICCdoes not publish the background data used to develop theestimates. Another important set of data in the drug field is theestimate of the results of drug law enforcement, including theamount of drugs and property seized, and the numbers of arrestsand convictions and sentences imposed on drug violators. Asignificant problem in generating reliable statistics in thisarea is the lack of a centralized system for collection. Becausemany agencies often are involved in the same case, the amount ofdrugs seized and other information may be reported by eachagency. According to the National Drug enforcement Policy Board, One of the principal problems encountered by the FederalGovernment in its efforts to gauge the effectiveness of itsoverall drug law enforcement program has been the lack ofcentralized statistical information on Federal drug seizures . .. Because of an undetermined amount of double and triplecounting, reliable statistics on total Federal drug seizures arenot available. In apparent response to this problem the 1984 NationalStrategy called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to developand maintain a centralized system for statistics concerningFederal drug seizures. As discussed throughout this report, asset forfeiture programsare an extremely promising source of funding for anti-drugefforts. Unfortunately, the availability and reliability ofinformation about non-drug assets seized by all levels ofgovernment is hampered by the same double counting,decentralization, and inconsistent data gathering methodologiesdescribed above. Although the Department of Justice AssetForfeiture Office was created to maintain centralized informationon forfeited assets, the office is still in the process ofdeveloping statistics for total Federal assets forfeited. A studyof State and local officials found that more than one-half ofthose surveyed could not estimate the value of property and cashobtained through forfeiture. State and local governments whichhave not already done so should establish asset managementsystems for the disposition of forfeited assets to provideaccurate estimates of their value. Drug Supply Intelligence With regard to intelligence concerning drug supplies, thisCommission is encouraged by what appears to be a growingcommitment to effective information-gathering. A number ofagencies have reported confidentially to this Commission thatboth their funding and priority determinations are giving greaterweight to effective intelligence programs. Intelligence efforts in this area take different forms,depending on the topic to which they are directed. All aresubject to the two classic categories of information gathering:human intelligence, referring to data gathered from humaninformants, and technical collection, gathered by such means assurveillance flights and satellites. In the area of croperadication, the lead agency is the State Department's Bureau ofInternational Narcotics Matters, supported by other members ofour country teams. Issues here include crop conditions, hostcountry political and military capabilities, and the role, ifany, of groups, including insurgents, opposing eradicationefforts. Interdiction efforts require tactical intelligence concerningspecific drug movements, such as the identities of thoseinvolved, shipment techniques, vessel and aircraftidentification, routes, and schedules. Also required is"strategic" information, such as shifts in processingand staging locations or in transshipment techniques. The currentexclusion of the Customs Service from foreign intelligencegathering, mandated by the 1973 reorganization plan, particularlyneeds to be re-examined. Strategic and tactical intelligence arecritical for border interdiction. Therefore the Commissionproposes that the Customs Service be integrated into the foreignintelligence process of the Drug Enforcement Administration, tothe maximum extent permitted by the Reorganization Plan currentlyin effect. Because international drug trafficking organizationsfrequently locate components of their operations within U.S.borders, domestic investigations and prosecutions are oftendependent upon effective international intelligence gathering tosupplement such domestic techniques as legal electronicsurveillance and development of informants. Effective international intelligence collection anddissemination is not necessarily a highly sophisticated process.On the contrary, it can consist of information as simple asproviding the names of suspected traffickers known to the DrugEnforcement Administration to the State Department to ensure thatconsular officers do not issue U.S. visas to such persons, orthat issuance be on a controlled basis to assist theinvestigative work of DEA. It is encouraging that the NationalDrug Enforcement Policy Board, pursuant to the Foreign RelationsAuthorization Act for 1986 and 1987, has been directed to compilea list of such traffickers and prepare guidelines forinter-agency sharing of that information. In the area of more sophisticated drug-related intelligencework DEA and the intelligence community are currently playingleading roles. The former has recently expanded its foreigndetail by ten percent, and additional expansion is prevented bylack of funding. This matter deserves careful consideration byboth Congress and the Executive Branch. In addition, thecapabilities of DEA agents presently stationed in foreignlocations are unduly and unnecessarily hampered by the"Mansfield Amendment" to the Foreign Assistance Act of1961, which restricts their activities to a secondary role. Aspart of a new expression of determination to combat internationaldrug trafficking, the amendment should be repealed. The intelligence community is not burdened by any suchill-conceived restriction. On the contrary, with regard tointernational narcotics trafficking, its mandate, found inExecutive Order 12333, is clear, direct, and sweeping: 1.4 The Intelligence Community. The agencies within theIntelligence Community shall, in accordance with applicableUnited States law and with the other provisions of this Order,conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct offoreign relations and the protection of the national security ofthe United States, including: (c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct ofactivities to protect against, intelligence activities directedagainst the United States, international terrorist andinternational narcotics activities, and other hostile activitiesdirected against the United States by foreign powers,organizations, persons, and their agents. Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has in the pastbeen criticized for failing to give sufficient priority to drugtrafficking, the Commission is satisfied that the agency iscurrently placing suitable emphasis on the issue. This is due, inpart, to the necessary Executive direction now being given to theintelligence community, and in part to the growing recognitionthroughout the government that drug trafficking in many forms andin many locations has grown to become a national securityconcern, transcending the traditional drug-related health and lawenforcement concerns, as discussed in this report. To complementthis effort, additional options are available and should bepursued. First, consistent with the direction now being provided to theintelligence community, the Department of State should vigorouslypursue a program of educating its own foreign-based personnel tothe importance being given to drug-related intelligence and tothe critical need for State Department support for such efforts.This appears to have been less than entirely adequate in allinstances. Second, the CIA's operational capabilities should befully explored to determine how the infrastructure of drugtrafficking organizations can be disrupted, consistent with theconcerns expressed in Executive Order 12333 and elsewhere.Finally, the CIA's considerable research and developmentcapabilities should be used to develop additional means forfurthering efforts directed at international drug traffickers. In connection with these contributions by the intelligencecommunity, it is encouraging to note the rapid evolution of acooperative relationship between the intelligence and lawenforcement communities. This is evidenced by the pertinentlanguage of Executive Order 12333, which provides that: 1.7 Senior Officials of the Intelligence Community. The headsof departments and agencies with organizations in theIntelligence Community or the heads of such organizations, asappropriate, shall: (g) Participate in the development of procedures approved bythe Attorney General governing production and dissemination ofintelligence resulting from criminal narcotics intelligenceactivities abroad, if their departments, agencies, ororganizations have intelligence responsibilities for foreign ordomestic narcotics production and trafficking. This direction is complemented by the inclusion of arepresentative of the CIA on the Coordinating Group of theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Defense Capabilities The intelligence community is not the only available source ofdrug-related intelligence. The Department of Defense has a widerange of facilities, equipment, and operations, which lendthemselves to effective participation. Although such a role ismost frequently discussed in connection with interdictionoperations near the U.S. border, intelligence-gatheringopportunities for Defense Department components exist muchfarther afield. Like their counterparts in the interdiction area,such efforts may be subject to Defense Department directives andpriorities, which in turn rely on a changeable definition of"national security." Nevertheless, if as a matter ofnational policy, the military view of national security drawscloser to that of the intelligence community, as expressed inExecutive Order 12333, the potential for military drug-relatedintelligence-gathering is profound. Because of the connectionbetween some drug trafficking organizations and terrorist orinsurgent groups, whatever assets are currently in place or inplanning for intelligence-gathering regarding terrorism orinsurgency could just as well function in connection with drugtraffickers. Intelligence-gathering in source and transshipment countrieswould be particularly effective in the interdiction effort, inthe opinion of former SOUTHCOM Commanding General Paul F. Gorman: I can't stress enough that it seems to me that the easy way tooperate on the [drug smuggling] pilots is down at the other end.He is at the other end of his communications tether where theairfields are much more primitive, where he is dependent on thesecartels and it's easier to penetrate. Because they occur outside of U.S. territory, such operationswould not violate the Posse Comitatus Act. In addition, with anexpanded definition of national security, such as that manifestin Executive Order 12333, the Economy Act would not be anobstacle. Such an expanded intelligence-gathering role is adesirable course of action for the Department of Defense. TheCommanding Officers of Unified Commands should be given maximumflexibility in deploying their forces. Another change in our application of military assets todrug-related intelligence is much less sweeping in concept, butnevertheless appears very useful. That is the inclusion of CoastGuard officers in our Defense Attache programs in drug source andtransit countries. This Commission has been advised that such aprogram is in process and encourages the agencies involved topursue this program with all due speed. Allied governments in affected areas could significantlyenhance the intelligence operations of our own military units.Such activities already under way and worthy of note include aregional radio communications network being set up among the drugenforcement authorities of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, andVenezuela. This network is designed to give these countries theopportunity to coordinate drug enforcement strategies and workclosely together in confronting the drug trafficking threatcommon to all. Agreements signed very recently by Brazil,Venezuela, and Colombia allow these countries to initiate jointinvestigations on their common borders, call for periodicmeetings between drug enforcement police, exchange intelligence,and solve common problems. Although such efforts must contendwith the endemic problems of corruption and organizational andnational rivalries, they are a step in the right direction. Tothe extent that United States assistance can contribute to theelimination of corruption and other systemic problems, suchassistance should be provided to promote these programs. All Source Intelligence and Operations Center Data collection is but one phase of a complete intelligenceoperation. To be effective collection should be followed bythorough and timely analysis and dissemination. This Commissiontherefore concludes that this Nation's anti-drug intelligenceefforts should be built upon an all-source intelligence andoperations center. Such a concept is described briefly above inconnection with interdiction efforts. EPIC and NNBIS togetherprovide an existing core upon which such a center could be built.EPIC has demonstrated the feasibility of joint agency operations,and NNBIS has shown that interagency operational coordination,particularly involving military components, is well withincapabilities. As a component of a comprehensive intelligence program, such acenter should be designed to collect drug-related intelligencefrom the broadest base possible, including those sovereignnations that will provide consistent, timely data on acooperative basis. In this regard, it is encouraging to note thatLatin American drug enforcement agencies are reported to beplanning to establish a regional intelligence center in astrategic location, such as Panama, in the near future. Becauseanalysis should be as complete as possible, such a center shouldinclude not only supply and transit-related intelligence, butalso counterpart demand data, including information on suchtopics as drug-related deaths and emergency room admissions. Thiswill allow a complete picture of drug distribution from one endof the chain to the other. This center would assume thefunctions, including issuing annual reports, currently undertakenby the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee(NNICC). In addition, it should integrate all financial datacurrently available to agencies of the Federal government, toenable analysts to complete their knowledge about the drug-moneycycle whenever possible. To be consistent with the rest of our national effort, such acenter should be under the general direction of the Policy Boardor its delegate, with the Vice President retaining primaryresponsibility for management and coordination of the informationrelated specifically to interdiction. Such a facility would thuscoordinate the collection, analysis, and dissemination ofintelligence, covering every topic from production andcultivation (including related political issues) to domesticenforcement and detailed patterns of domestic consumption. Itwould also provide the necessary centralized data base forthorough inter-agency coordination of operations. Given thesensitivity of many of its sources and the data receivedtherefrom, the functions and output of such a center would, ofcourse, require physical and communications security. Theresources and expertise of the National Security Agency withregard to operational and communications security is an extremelyvaluable national asset, which should be exploited to the fullestextent possible in this connection. As this Commission has soughtto demonstrate repeatedly, drug traffickers have regularly andsuccessfully sought to penetrate law enforcement communications.The equipment available for such purposes is readily available.Communications security thus requires very careful attention inthe planning and design of all anti-drug operations andfacilities.

Interdiction, just one of thesesub-components, presently consumes one-third of the entireFederal drug abuse outlay for the fiscal year. Measured just interms of outlays designated for law enforcement activities,interdiction's portion swells to almost one-half of the Federalfunds being spent to combat drug abuse. By Commissioncalculation, Federal funds devoted to interdiction have increased100 percent over the last five years. Despite this massive dedication of funds, drugs of primarilyforeign origin - cocaine, heroin, and marijuana - continue to bewidely available in this country. Many observers, including someleading drug enforcement officials, readily acknowledge thatinterdiction can only serve a limited role in increasing risks tosmugglers while this government pursues other programs. FrankMonastero, former Assistant Administrator for Operations of theDrug Enforcement Administration, summed up this view in a recentinterview: [Interdiction] is important, but it is the least effectivething you can do . . . it's like the patrolman on the beat . . .It is preventing [some drugs] from getting into the trafficking,and that's something. But we can continue that ad infinitum. Ifwe don't do something at the source or don't do something beforethat or don't do something at the end of the trail in theprevention area, we will never change the situation. It is the view of this Commission that interdiction is notgoing to end drug use or availability in this country. It will,however, continue to discourage some potential smugglers. Thisdeterrent effect is often overlooked or denied by many critics,but not by smugglers themselves. According to Adler B. Seal, anexperienced drug smuggling pilot, in response to a questionconcerning the difficulty of recruiting smuggling pilots: Well, it used to be easy. However, now it has become a littleless attractive for some of the younger pilots. Some of the olderpilots, as myself, have been indicted. We've been cognizant of law enforcement techniques and theimprovements in it; and the younger pilots are seeing thenewspaper reports of the older pilots and the amount of time thatthey are being convicted on and serving, and it's not asattractive a proposition as it used to be. Successful interdiction not only discourages some new membersfrom joining smuggling enterprises, but also encourages somealready in the field to get out of it. This was confirmed by thefirsthand experience of smuggler Seal: I think that the more flights that are interdicted, the wordgets around. For instance, I have absolutely - or had in my capacity - nodesire whatsoever to go into and would do anything to stay out ofthe south Florida area simply due to the fact that that is wherethe concentrated interdiction efforts are being made due to theVice Presidential Task Force, which has been highly publicizedand which has taken its toll on the paranoia of the drugsmuggler. It also appears to this Commission to be consistent with theview of the Commissioner of Customs, William von Raab: We are always asked what is a good measure of success againstsmuggling. It is always quoted in terms of how much we seize. I have always maintained that a good measure of success is toreach a point at which a pilot doesn't want to fly into theUnited States anymore; and I have always suggested that there maybe a percentage. For example, if he has a one-out-of-ten chance of gettingcaught, he might run in; but certainly if he had anine-out-of-ten chance of being caught, he's not going to do it. In summary, this Commission recognizes that interdiction isand should continue to be a vital component of our Nationalstrategy, as a complement to other approaches to reduce drugsupply. Any analysis that defines success in the area ofinterdiction as apprehending all, or nearly all, smuggled drugsis unrealistic and counter-productive. To the extent that is avery costly approach, additional expenditures must be weighedvery carefully, particularly if they have the effect of reducingfunds available for other efforts to reduce supply and demand.There are, however, improvements to our interdiction effortswhich can be made without any significant increase in funding.These steps, which generally involve reordering of priorities orredefinition of interagency responsibilities, are discussedbelow. It is crucial to note that the single most important need inthe interdiction field is leadership. If innovation and increasedcommitment are to be pursued successfully and expeditiously, bothby foreign governments and agencies of our own, a strong leaderorchestrating a single comprehensive plan is the key. That roleto date has been played by the Vice President, and it is one inwhich he should continue. The weight of his office has producedresults when other officials might have been ignored. While theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board necessarily includesseveral Cabinet-level officers, they serve as peers. Only theVice President brings to the interdiction effort sufficient rankto lead them. His central role should be preserved and promotedwithin the context of the National Drug Enforcement PolicyBoard's leadership in drug enforcement. Recognition by the Boardof the Vice President's leadership in interdiction activitiesholds the promise of singularly promoting success in that keyarea, preserving the momentum and continuity of existinginteragency interdiction efforts, and putting to rest theconfusion that has already begun to surface concerning the VicePresident's relationship to the Board. Air Interdiction The United States Customs Service has the lead responsibilityfor air interdiction. To combat drug smugglers, some of whom havethe most sophisticated and expensive communications andnavigational equipment available today, Customs has increased itsairborne capabilities significantly in the recent past. At thetime of this report, the Service had just received $11 million ina supplemental fiscal year 1985 appropriation for its airoperations, bringing the agency's total fiscal year budget forair operations to $55.4 million. Customs' most significant need,apart from more aircraft and more sophisticated electronics, isthe support of other Federal agencies with related jurisdictions. One example of the need for support is on the diplomaticfront. Customs has for some time found itself frustrated by itsinability to pursue suspected smuggler aircraft into Mexicanairspace after detection on the American side of the border.Although this has been the subject of numerous diplomaticdiscussions, there has been little progress to date. Giving thismatter an extremely high priority in our bilateral negotiationswith Mexico is the type of assistance another agency, in thiscase the state Department, can and should provide to Customs inrecognition of the critical importance of the fight against drugsmuggling. Another Customs' Services critical need is intelligence, bothtactical and strategic. While "cold hits" -apprehension of smugglers in a random, uninformed basis - have animportant role to play in deterring smugglers by their veryrandomness, intelligence is the key to effective interdiction.According to former Drug Enforcement Administrator FrancisMullen, every major seizure of drugs from South America made byhis agency has been made on the basis of prior intelligence, andit is no less critical to the Customs Service. While the topic ofintelligence-gathering is the subject of a separate analysis inthis report, it is important to note in connection with thisdiscussion on inter-agency support that Customs and the DrugEnforcement Administration have made considerable progress in thearea of information sharing. Customs has for some time had ananalyst stationed in DEA's Office of Intelligence, and a programis currently underway to place Customs intelligence analysts incountry teams abroad to analyze data gathered by DEA. Thisprogram should be pursued aggressively. Simultaneously, theCustoms Service should scrutinize its Customs Attache program todetermine to what extent it can play a larger role inintelligence-gathering concerning smugglers. With its closeliaison with host government customs officials, this program maybe of particular significance with regard to smuggling involvingcontainerized and other commercial cargo. As interdictioncapabilities improve in the areas of pleasure craft and generalaviation, it is almost certain that commercial cargo will be usedincreasingly for concealing illicit drug shipments. This hasalready been observed in some cases. Such a Customs effort wouldbe complemented by the private sector initiatives Customs hasbeen able to bring about, such as the agreements now in effectwith the Airline Transport and International Airline TransportAssociations. An active intelligence gathering role for Customs is nowblocked by the 1973 Reorganization Plan. The current recognitionby Customs and DEA of the former's need for time-sensitiveintelligence is of vital importance however, and should beactively cultivated by the two agencies and the Policy Board.That this would require modification or elimination of certainprovisions of the 1973 Reorganization Plan should not be anobstacle. The area of inter-agency support currently in need of the mostattention is the relationship between the Customs Service and theFederal Aviation Administration (FAA). The latter, which hasprimary jurisdiction over entry into United States air space,maintains a number of programs, which lend themselves to supportof Customs operations. While the FAA has to date givensignificant support to Customs in a number of instances, more isneeded. To this end, the Customs Service has recently proposedomnibus legislation, currently entitled the Customs EnforcementAct of 1985, which contains provisions that address suchsensitive topics as restricted entry points and minimum altitudesfor air entry. Among other things, this Act would require allvessels and aircraft entering the United States to reportimmediately for Customs inspection, and would increase the finesfor failure to report entry. Fines would also be substantiallyincreased for smuggling controlled substances, and suchviolations would be punishable by imprisonment. All assets seizedby Customs, including planes, vessels, and cash, would be subjectto forfeiture. The Act would prohibit airdrops to vessels, makeit unlawful to operate an aircraft without lights, and prohibitthe installation of all illegal fuel tanks in planes. Inaddition, commercial carriers would be subject to more stringentregulations under the Act. While this legislation may beunpopular with private aviation, it is a collection of importantanti-smuggling measures which go directly to some of the mostfrequently encountered drug smuggling techniques. It is worthy ofsupport. Similarly, proposals advanced by both Customs and DEA thataircraft identification numbers, now required to be twelve incheshigh and displayed on the fuselage or tail, be displayed on anupper and a lower wing surface as well are entirely consistentwith anti-smuggling requirements. DEA pilots have been fired uponfrom the ground as they tried to fly low enough to read tailnumbers. Although the FAA has stated that an increase in requirednumber size has no "aviation safety basis," it is thisCommission's position that needless exposure of Federal agents tohostile fire should be considered an "aviation safety"concern sufficient to justify remedial action. Again, reportsthat a change in required number size or location would be veryunpopular with the general aviation community seem frivolous inthe context of issues as grave as those under discussion here.There are a number of additional aviation-related proposals beingadvanced by Customs today, concerning such matters as pre-filingof "border flight plans," advanced notice of entry intoU.S. air space, and improvements in pilot identificationcertificates, which appear to this Commission to be worthy ofadoption, absent some compelling opposition. There are other promising areas for Customs/FAA cooperation.Customs reports, for example, that the FAA, in undertaking itslong-term buildup of the approach radar system, is workingclosely with Customs to accommodate the latter's needs. This isto be encouraged, particularly by the Policy Board, which hasboth Customs and the FAA on its Coordinating Group. One legal issue which would benefit from careful analysis bythe Board is the extent to which current asset forfeitureprovisions need revision to enable seizure of aircraft and otherequipment which is rented or leased by traffickers for thepurpose of avoiding forfeiture. Another area worthy of study is the extent to which Customs'air interdiction capabilities could be enhanced by Coast Guardaviation components. Although such a concept might be contrary toexisting understandings, it would be a grave omission ifsubstantial Coast Guard aviation assets were overlooked,particularly at a time when fiscal considerations threaten theCustoms air operations budget. Maritime Operations In the area of maritime interdiction, the Coast Guard servesas lead agency. Its success has been remarkable and is limitedonly by shortages in resources. New tactics and innovative formsof assistance by the Navy have significantly improved the CoastGuard's capabilities. There is no question that not only maritimetraffickers but air smugglers as well are intimidated by theseaborne detection capabilities of Coast Guard vessels. Inasmuchas the most critical limitation on Coast Guard capabilities isthe lack of budgeted resources, the single most pressing concernis the augmentation of the Coast Guard budget to permit moreextensive participation in interdiction operations. A proposal,which has surfaced annually but to no avail as yet, is theimposition of user fees for various Coast Guard services nowprovided to the boating community gratis. As with the aviationcommunity in connection with the FAA discussed above, there isconsiderable opposition to maritime measures that wouldinconvenience the user community or cost it money. However, giventhe inescapable facts of the drug invasion this country isexperiencing, the nominal costs of various user fees would seemto be a small price for boaters to pay as their contribution towhat must be seen as a national effort to defeat a deadly enemy. In-shore operations of the Customs Service bolster Coast Guardmaritime interdiction operations. Having received over $12million for maritime operations in its fiscal year 1985supplemental appropriation, Customs has begun to get fast, stateof the art pursuit boats in the water off the coast of Florida.These have been used to great effect, and more such craft shouldbe deployed. One innovation for which the Customs Service and theleadership of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System(NNBIS) are to be commended is the highly effective integrationof State and local authorities in the recent operation "BlueLightning." It is clear and has been stressed throughoutthis report that comprehensive, coordinated multi-agencyoperations are absolutely essential to effective anti-drugprograms. On the Federal level, this typically means"horizontal integration," i.e., the careful combinationof equal Federal agencies. Blue Lightning is a fine example ofthe equally important concept of "verticalintegration," the well-planned and complementary cooperationof Federal, State, and local resources aimed at a specifictrafficking activity. The Customs Service and NNBIS arerightfully proud of this accomplishment and are encouraged topursue similar successes in operations to come. Consolidated Efforts The evolution of interdiction in recent years has been in thedirection of consolidation of intelligence and operations. Thisis a trend characteristic of anti-drug efforts generally, and itis a proper response to the breadth of the drug smugglingsituation. In the area of interdiction, the most prominent jointefforts in addition to NNBIS are the National Drug EnforcementPolicy Board (the Board) and the El Paso Intelligence Center(EPIC). All are described in detail elsewhere in this report. The following is a proposed realignment of theseorganizations, based on this Commission's review. First, our proposal recognizes the leadership role of theBoard. That important topic is the subject of a separate analysisin this report. Within the Board and as a part of its coordinatedprogram, we propose the combination of the functions of EPIC andNNBIS into a single, all-source intelligence facility. In thecritical early stages of designing and implementing such anoperation, the Vice President's leadership will be invaluable.The combined intelligence center will incorporate the input ofall intelligence-gathering components at the Federal level,including those sources already feeding into EPIC and NNBIS, aswell as new sources still to be developed, as outlined below. The present duplication between the various functionsperformed by EPIC and NNBIS has been acknowledged by suchauthorities as David Westrate, Assistant Administrator forOperations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the parentagency of EPIC. Although it is true there are certain functionsbeing performed by each of the two activities, which are notduplicated by the other, this should not prevent effectiveintegration of their functions. Everywhere in the current Federalresponse, we find a movement toward consolidation andcoordination. Intelligence and planning should not be exceptions. A combined all-source intelligence center would require atleast two features not found in either NNBIS or EPIC. One is aphysically secure headquarters facility. EPIC is presentlylocated in a private office building in El Paso. It has neitherthe space nor the necessary physical security to accommodate thecomprehensive input advocated here. NNBIS headquarters is in theOld Executive Office Building in downtown Washington, and itsregional facilities are located in various Federal buildingsaround the country. While such quarters might provide adequatephysical security, they are not equipped to provide for the scopeof the proposed undertaking. A secure facility with sufficientphysical dimensions is crucial, as are secure communications withparticipating agency and military headquarters. Ft. Bliss, Texas,is a potential site, as it provides the necessary physicalsecurity and is located near the present EPIC facility. This andsimilar locations should be considered. The second requirement of the facility proposed here isenhanced intelligence input. Thorough, "real-time"intelligence is absolutely vital to effective interdiction, andit is almost as critically important to other areas ofenforcement operations as well. The importance of intelligence issuch that it is treated as a separate topic below. At this point,it is sufficient to note that the design of a new center mustfrom the very outset include the most thorough provisions for themaximum intelligence contribution permitted by law and physicaland technological capabilities. Military Support for Interdiction Perhaps the single most valuable development in the area ofinterdiction in recent years has been the assistance rendered bycomponents of the Department of Defense. Such activities wereconstrained somewhat by the Posse Comitatus Act until certainexemptions to the Act were passed in December 1981. Since thattime the assistance rendered by the military has growndramatically. In calendar year 1984 the military providedassistance to interdiction efforts worth $100 million by Pentagoncalculations. Such assistance is typically in the form of aerialsurveillance, transport of enforcement personnel, and loans ofequipment and personnel as permitted by law. The role of the Defense Department has become steadily moreactive, more innovative, and more flexible. The quality andquantity of such assistance, however, continue to be limited bythe constraints found in the Posse Comitatus exemptions: militaryassistance to law enforcement cannot include direct participationby military personnel in arrest or seizure activities, and it canbe provided only if it does not affect military preparedness.Furthermore, law enforcement authorities will be required by theEconomy Act to reimburse the Department of Defense for assistanceprovided, unless such assistance is incidental to existingmilitary operations or provides "equivalent training."Reimbursement may also be waived, if such waiver does notadversely impact military preparedness. In this regard, as inother, the Department of Defense has been increasingly flexible.One example of this is the expanded delegation of authority towaive reimbursement, as found in the January 2, 1985,modifications to the applicable Departmental directive. Anotheris the increasingly positive liaison role being played by theDepartment of Defense Task Force on Drug Enforcement. There are grounds for concern that the military's rolecontinues to be too narrowly defined. There appears to be afundamental misconception at the very top of the Departmentconcerning the permissible scope of the military's role. Writingto the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in June1985, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stated that directmilitary participation in drug seizures outside United Statesterritory would do violence to "the historic separationbetween military and civilian spheres of activity . . . one ofthe most fundamental principles of American democracy. ThisCommission has been unable to find the basis for such a"fundamental principle" of co-equal "spheres ofactivity." The fact is that the military, rather than beinga parallel entity, has traditionally been subject to thedirection of the civilian "sphere." Indeed, themilitary's Commander-in-Chief is a civilian. The Posse ComitatusAct does no more than prohibit use of military forces to enforcecivilian laws on the territory of the United States. TheConstitution was in existence for approximately a century beforesuch a law was passed by Congress. The Act has been amended oncesince then, and it can be amended again if appropriate.Furthermore, there is nothing in the laws of the United Statesforbidding an active enforcement role by the military outsideUnited States territory, except the requirement of reimbursement.This in turn hinges upon the definition of "militarypreparedness." However, nowhere in the debate over themilitary's role in this area has this Commission found adiscussion of this term. The definition of the military's rolehas been left to the military itself, which, through the JointChiefs of Staff, has declared that the military shall be preparedto serve national security by providing: a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile ordestructive action from within or without, overt or covert. As described in Chapter 3 of this report, international drugtraffickers have regularly formed alliances with insurgent andterrorist forces in certain countries. In a few instances thesealliances may actually threaten friendly governments. In manymore countries such a combination at least drains resources fromconstructive goals and inhibits efforts to build or maintain astable democracy. Even where the threat is more remote, it isclear that the smuggling techniques in use are the very same onesthat are or could be used to move personnel, weapons, and othersupplies for insurgent groups. For these reasons alone, theactivities of traffickers should bring them squarely within thenational security concerns of the Department of Defense. Thisfact has already been recognized by the Vice President, who hasstated clearly that "success against drug smuggling isintimately tied to the continuation of freedom and democracy inthe hemisphere." Recognition of this fact would permit theDefense Department much greater latitude in conducting militaryoperations aimed at disrupting trafficking organizations.Examples of such programs include a wide range of activities,such as expanded and focused intelligence gathering, securityassistance to receptive host governments, expanded deployment oftethered aerostat radar sites, and joint research and developmentbetween military and law enforcement agencies to provide greateroperation compatibility. Beyond threats to friendly democracies, international drugtraffickers should be considered a threat to our nationalsecurity because they comprise a direct attack on the physicaland social well-being of our country. The costs of this invasion,which comes by air, sea, and land, is thoroughly documented inthis report. Recognition of this attack as a ". . .destructive action from without . . ." which is within themeaning of the Joint Chiefs' definition, would bring theDepartment of Defense squarely into the war in which we presentlyfind ourselves. This may be further than present policy makersare prepared to go, but it is surely time to bring the issue intothe debate so that it can be decided on the basis of what isactually permitted or proscribed by the laws and Constitution ofthe United States. Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions Domestic investigative and prosecutive activity is only onefacet of drug law enforcement. As with all other approachesdesigned to reduce the supply of drugs, proper assessment oftheir effectiveness requires that realistic goals be established.As this report has demonstrated, it is unrealistic to expect thatdomestic law enforcement alone will solve, or even substantiallyreduce, the Nation's drug abuse problem. Rather, its goal must bea more limited one: to increase the arrests and successfulprosecutions of drug traffickers, whether they be importers,wholesalers, or retailers, and those who assist them, includingpilots, bankers, and attorneys, and the forfeiture of theirproperties accumulated from criminal activity. The attainment of this objective would contribute to theultimate national policy goal of eliminating drug use in severalways. First, it would directly reduce the supply of drugs byremoving from the illicit drug market those drugs that are seizedalong with the arrested traffickers. Second, it would reduce thesupply of drugs indirectly by disrupting the networks that makeit possible to distribute drugs efficiently. Finally, thetraffickers would likely raise the price of their product toreflect the increased risks, which theoretically should cause areduction in the overall consumption of drugs. In a recent study prepared by the Rand Corporation the authorsconcluded that prevention programs, not intensified domestic lawenforcement, were the best approach to control adolescent druguse. The Commission agrees with the Rand Corporation'sconclusions concerning adolescent drug use and believes that theyare equally valid with respect to adult drug use. However, suchconclusions should not be interpreted as a call for a reductionin domestic law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.Without effective domestic law enforcement, the drug abuseproblem, and its concomitant organized crime effects, would beimmeasurably worse. Although domestic law enforcement has a limited, albeitessential, role to play in the national effort against drugabuse, the Commission has concluded, on the basis of itsinvestigations, hearings, and study, that changes in focus andattitudes and a rearrangement of priorities must be undertaken toachieve the maximum effect of domestic law enforcement. Beforediscussing these matters, it is necessary first to address twofundamental issues: (1) Do organized crime policy and drug abusepolicy conflict? and (2) What, if any, should be the level ofinteraction and cooperation between Federal law enforcementagencies on the one hand and State and local agencies on theother? Professor Mark H. Moore, a former Special Assistant to theAdministrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, hasdescribed the objectives of U.S. organized crime policy asfollows: [T]o suppress the provision of illegal goods and services thatconstitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violenceand corruption that is more characteristic of organized crimegroups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent theemergence of very large, durable organizations with welldeveloped capacities for violence and corruption. This Commission believes that the Nation's drug policy musthave as its goal the elimination of illegal drug use. Domesticlaw enforcement contributes to this goal by reducing the supplyof drug in the illegal market and by increasing the prices ofdrugs that remain available for purchase. It has been suggestedthat the pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, without regard forits impact on organized crime, may exacerbate the country'sorganized crime problem by enriching organized crime groups,eliminating their competitors, and encouraging traffickingorganizations to become organized crime groups if they are notalready. Although agreeing that such a concern is legitimate,this Commission has concluded that drug and organized crimepolicies do not inherently conflict. Indeed, there issubstantial, if not complete, overlap in the goals of the twopolicies because, as the Commission has found, drug traffickingis a principal activity of organized crime groups. In light ofthis, the Commission recommends that targeting high-levelorganized-crime trafficking groups, whether they be foreign,multinational or domestic, should be the top priority of Federaldomestic law enforcement. As Professor Moore has stated: What is not in conflict, however, is the need of both drugabuse policy and organized crime policy to develop and usetactics that are successful in attacking large, entrenchedcriminal organizations. This is useful to drug policy, andessential to organized crime policy. The Commission is aware that some commentators have criticizedthe Federal Government's bias in favor of enforcement againsthigh-level dealers to the virtual exclusion of lower- orstreet-level enforcement. However, the Commission'srecommendation that targeting organized crime trafficking groupsshould be the top priority of Federal domestic law enforcementshould not be construed to mean that lower-level enforcement isnot useful and therefore has no place in the Nation's drugpolicy. On the contrary, such lower-level enforcement isessential to achieve the goal of eliminating drug use for severalreasons. As discussed earlier, the arrest of the customers ofdrug retailers may result in a direct and immediate reduction inthe demand for drugs. In addition, successful enforcement effortsdirected at lower-level dealers will reduce the supply of illegaldrugs and raise the price of drugs available for purchase, thusresulting in lower drug consumption. Finally, lower-levelenforcement operations are useful in providing information thatwill be invaluable to those involved in investigating high-levelorganized crime trafficking groups. The absence of vigorouslower-level domestic law enforcement could encourage organizedcrime groups to remain in drug trafficking, and quite possiblespawn more such groups. High-level enforcement efforts could becrippled, if not completely undermined, by a lack of acomplementary, lower-level effort. A fundamental question remains: Which agencies should beresponsible for the various facets of domestic law enforcement?The investigation of high-level organized crime traffickinggroups, whose activities are generally regional, national orinternational in scope, is expensive, time consuming, andrequires special skills and sophisticated tools. The Federalgovernment, through its agencies, is best equipped to undertakesuch investigations. State and local agencies, because of theirunique knowledge of local conditions and expertise in therequired techniques, are more qualified to conduct lower-leveldomestic law enforcement, including street operations andinvestigations of certain smaller and geographically-restrictedtrafficking organizations. The conclusions and recommendations set forth in the precedingparagraph are not intended to suggest that Federal domestic lawenforcement and that of State and local agencies should becompletely separate and independent. The drug problem facing theUnited States is a national one, and the efforts of all lawenforcement agencies must be coordinated and interrelated to someextent, if we are to deal successfully with the problem. Therequired level of cooperation in some instances may be more thanthe routine exchange of drug intelligence or the suppression ofinteragency rivalries and jurisdictional disputes. In thisregard, the Commission endorses generally the view expressedrecently by a Federal prosecutor concerning drug enforcementefforts in New York City: [O]ne can not compartmentalize the narcotics enforcementeffort, and leave the streets entirely to state and localenforcement and the conspiracy cases entirely to the federalgovernment. While each may have a primary area, each must do someof both. The ideal combination may be some federal prosecution ofstate and local arrests, and a significant state and localparticipation in joint Task Forces, aimed at dismantling of drugnetworks through the conspiracy law. Examples of successful joint ventures involving Federal, Stateand local personnel include the Organized Crime Drug EnforcementTask Force Program, Operation Pressure Point, and the New YorkDrug Enforcement Task Force, which was formed in 1970. Theseprograms can serve as useful models for any future cooperativedomestic law enforcement arrangements that might be needed. Federal Domestic Law Enforcement As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission hasconcluded that the tools and techniques needed to permit Federallaw enforcement agents to prosecute their portion of the waragainst drug traffickers successfully are for the most partcurrently available. The need is not for sweeping new legislativeinitiatives but for further changes in attitudes and a greatercommitment to cooperation and coordination among the Federalagencies involved in drug law enforcement. Balkanization andjurisdictional disputes between agencies are the most seriousobstacles to success in the struggle against drug trafficking.The personnel of each Federal agency involved in domestic lawenforcement, from the chief executive to the newest employee,must understand that their agency alone cannot solve the Nation'sdrug problem. Acceptance of this reality will go a long way ineliminating the destructive competition that in the past hashampered Federal law enforcement. As discussed above, the Commission has concluded that thetargeting of high-level organized crime trafficking groups shouldbe the top priority of Federal drug law enforcement efforts.Because of the sophistication and complexity of suchorganizations and their operations, the Federal response must beequally sophisticated and complex. The Reagan Administration'sestablishment of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task ForceProgram (OCDETF Program) in late 1982 was an attempt to create amechanism for attacking high-level organized crime traffickinggroups; by their own account, the multiagency Task Forces,drawing on the resources of a broad spectrum of Federal, Stateand local agencies, have achieved an encouraging degree ofsuccess. The success that has been achieved was not the result ofthe development of new techniques but of the efficient use ofexisting ones: The OCDE Task Force Program can lay claim to no new inventionsin the fields of investigative and prosecutorial techniques. Itcan, however, be justifiably proud of its creative utilization ofexisting tools. The Commission applauds the OCDETF Program and those whodesigned and have implemented it. It strongly favors thePrograms's continuation and expansion, to the extent that it isdesirable and feasible to do so, for several reasons: the Programhas resulted in the elimination of interagency disputes to asubstantial extent; the disruption of large and sophisticatedtrafficking groups requires large, efficient and stronglysupported enforcement organizations; and multiagency task forcesare particularly suited to use the Federal conspiracy, RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Continuing CriminalEnterprise (CCE), and forfeiture statutes to the maximum andoptimum extent possible. In addition, the different investigativetechniques used by the participating agencies increases theprobability of successful infiltration of traffickingorganizations. However, the effectiveness of the OCDETF Programcould be enhanced if the following changes were made. In creating the OCDETF Program, its designers concluded thatto insure the maximum support of the participating agencies, aconsensus-based decision-making process was necessary. In thisregard, no single agency was designated as the lead Task Forceagency. Although participants in the OCDETF Program have beenable to reduce interagency competition and conflict to asubstantial and significant extent, the Commission believe thatfurther improvement is both desirable and feasible. Suchimprovements would flow naturally from a renewed, unambiguouscommitment to the Program and its goals by participatingagencies. Increased cooperation and coordination might alsoresult, if DEA or the FBI were designated as the lead Task Forceagency, or if the United States Attorneys were given greaterauthority with respect to the operations of the Task Force. TheCommission recommends that those in charge of the OCDETF Programshould consider whether a lead agency should be designated or aU.S. Attorney be given greater authority to achieve even greatercoordination of effort. Law enforcement agencies that participate in the OCDETFProgram have other missions in the struggle against drugtrafficking. For this reason, each "agency must balance itscommitment to the Task Force concept with its fundamentalmission. Because the targeting of high-level organized crimetrafficking groups should be the top priority and because theOCDE Task Forces are the best available devices for infiltratingand disrupting such groups, the Commission is concerned that, inallocating manpower and other resources between the program andother missions, the participating agencies should not shortchangethe Task Forces in any way. The top echelon of each participatingagency must be strongly committed to the OCDETF Program and itsgoals and must be actively involved in assuring its success. Therequired commitment and involvement are not satisfied byabdicating responsibility for insuring the success of the programto those heading field offices. Indifference at the headquarterslevel will be reflected eventually in field offices. To signal their commitment to the program and to encouragetheir best agents to participate in it, the top executives ofeach participating agency should adopt an unambiguous policy thatsalary increases and career advancement within the agency for anagent who participates in an OCDE Task Force will not beadversely affected in any way by that participation. Such apolicy would require that the evaluation of an agent assigned toa Task Force be based not on such criteria as the number ofarrests or cases made or the amount of drugs seized. Evaluationsshould assess that agent's qualitative performance in complexfinancial and conspiracy cases, which may last more than twoyears and which may result in the arrest of few, albeithigh-level and important traffickers. The OCDETF Program is only one facet of the Federal effortagainst drug trafficking. The effective functioning of the otherfacets of Federal domestic law enforcement, i.e., Organized CrimeStrike Forces, the South Florida Task Force, the FBI, DEA,Customs, and U.S. Attorneys, is also essential if the Nation'sdrug problem is ever to be contained and eventually eliminated. That the OCDE Task Forces are and should be primarilyresponsible for disrupting high-level organized crime traffickinggroups does not mean that the other Federal efforts should bedevoted to, or focused upon, lower -or street-level traffickersor purely local drug problems. For the reasons discussed above,these enforcement concerns are rightfully and almost exclusivelythose of State and local law enforcement. However, there will becases against organized crime trafficking groups that will bedeemed inappropriate for OCDETF treatment, and these will thenhave to be handled by some other Federal agency; this is alsotrue with respect to large trafficking organizations that are notorganized crime controlled and that may or may not bemulti-jurisdictional. As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission hasconcluded that the non-OCDETF Program segments of Federaldomestic drug law enforcement are for the most part functioningwell and that the variety of investigative techniques that theseagencies bring to the Federal effort to reduce the supply ofdrugs is a great benefit. The use of financial expertise,undercover, sting and reverse sting operations, informants,electronic and other kinds of surveillance, preselected targetand target of opportunity approaches to initiatinginvestigations, and buy-bust transactions are all useful ways ofinfiltrating trafficking organizations. However, the Commissionis concerned that the healthy competition among enforcementagencies that the current organizational structure is supposed toencourage often degenerates into jurisdictional conflicts thatharm the overall Federal effort against traffickers. This willcontinue to occur unless top agency officials instill in theiragents and employees the sense that genuine cooperation andcoordination with other agencies are essential to the ultimatesuccess of the Nation's drug effort. In this regard, the NationalDrug Enforcement Policy Board has an important and unique role toplay insuring that healthy and constructive competition does notbecome destructive and petty conflict. The Board could take one important step to eliminatejurisdictional disputes, as well as to avoid duplication ofinvestigative efforts and to provide maximum safety to drugagents. This would be to require the establishment of a systemwhereby an agency would file a report with a central reportingrepository, once it has opened an investigation of an individualbelieved to be a part of a trafficking operation. If two or moreagencies were investigating the same individual, they would benotified of that fact, and they would be required to decide,after negotiations, the best way for conducting theinvestigation, a single agency or an ad hoc task force. Such asystem would work at its optimal level only if all lawenforcement agencies, including State and local units,participated. The Commission believes that such a reporting andcontrol system is highly desirable and, because of existingtechnology, feasible. The Commission also believes that thissystem could be incorporated easily into the all-sourceintelligence and operations center, recommended elsewhere in thisreport. As result of the 1973 reorganization plan, the Customs Servicewas prohibited from conducting investigative, intelligence, andlaw enforcement functions, relating to the suppression of drugtrafficking, at locations away from ports of entry or borders.This aspect of the plan has been controversial and as elicitedmuch criticism on the ground that is weakened the "Nation'scapability to interdict the flow of narcotics into the UnitedStates." The Commission has no objections to that feature of the 1973reorganization plan that created a lead agency in Federal druglaw enforcement, and indeed believes that it remains a validconcept today. However, the Commission has concluded that it isan appropriate time to study whether the functions of the CustomsService with respect to drug trafficking should be expanded toinclude investigative, intelligence, and law enforcementfunctions within this country, beyond the borders and ports ofentry, where appropriate and subject to the oversight andsupervision of the lead agencies. In this respect, the Commissionnotes that the 1973 reorganization plan was modified somewhatwhen, on January 5, 1984, the Attorney General signed the"Request for Assistance and Authorization Respecting DrugEnforcement Activities of Certain Customs Officers in DomesticDrug Investigations." This action granted authority to theDEA Administrator to endow specific Customs agents, for adesignated period of time, with the power, among others, toconduct investigative, intelligence, and law enforcementfunctions relating to drug trafficking. Because this arrangementappears to have worked well, a broader expansion of Customs'functions may be warranted at this time in an effort to improvedomestic law enforcement. In addition to the attitudinal and organizational mattersdiscussed above, the Commission proposes substantial expansion ofthe use of one particular investigative technique because of themagnitude of illicit drug production in this country. All of thePCP (phencyclidine), almost all of the methamphetamine, and anestimated 80 percent of injectable amphetamine availableillicitly in the United States in 1984 were produced in domesticclandestine laboratories. In addition, an increasing amount ofcocaine in being processed in this country. In fact, the numberof cocaine laboratories seized by law enforcement authorities inthe United States between 1983 and 1984 nearly doubled. To combat both the domestic and foreign production of illicitdrugs, law enforcement officials have, in some instances,targeted the chemicals used to manufacture the drugs. Forexample, through its "Operation Chem-Con," DEA tracksthe movement of chemicals used to process cocaine from theprincipal manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to their finaldestinations. According to the chief of the DEA's cocainesection, Johnny Phelps: Through cooperation gained by DEA from the world's etherindustry and foreign law enforcement elements, we now havevoluntary restrictions on sales to known trafficking groups andare able to seize shipments of chemicals after purchase causinggreat financial losses to cocaine producing consort[ia]. In addition to the voluntary compliance of chemical companiesin Operation Chem-Con, reporting requirements are sometimes usedto control chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs.Piperidine, a chemical used to manufacture the hallucinogen PCP,is subject to reporting requirements under the ControlledSubstances Act. The provision requires that any person sellingpiperidine report to the Attorney General information concerningthe sale, including identifying information about the purchaser,and the quantity, form and intended use of the piperidine. Thissystem has worked well and permits DEA to investigate anysuspicious sales of piperidine. Since 1984 DEA has seized fourclandestine PCP laboratories and has located at least ten otheroperations, which obtained chemicals for PCP manufacture byposing as legitimate businesses. Chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs can be regulatedin the same manner as controlled substances. Under the ControlledSubstances Act, the Attorney General may place an immediateprecursor in the same schedule as the controlled substance forwhich it is a precursor. Although the regulation of chemicals used to manufactureillicit drugs can thwart efforts to produce these drugs and canhelp law enforcement officials to locate clandestinelaboratories, several factors limit the effectiveness of suchapproaches. First, many of these chemicals have widespreadlegitimate uses in industry, and tracking their sales would beimpractical. Even tracking a limited number of these chemicalswould be costly, requiring adequate computer resources andindividuals to review and analyze chemical sales information.Second, controls on chemicals may have only short-term effects.In the case of the reporting of piperidine, both use of PCP andclandestine laboratory activity appeared to decline from 1979 to1981. However, by 1982, trafficking in and abuse of PCP hadincreased. Third, some chemicals can be obtained illicitly. Forexample, a shortage of P2P (phenyl-2-propanone), which is used tomanufacture methamphetamine, resulted from the placement of P2Pin Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Traffickersresponded by increasing illicit manufacture of P2P in 1982. Despite these limitations, controlling a limited number ofthese chemicals has merit. The United Nations InternationalNarcotics Control Board has identified the following chemicals assuitable targets for control: ether, used to process cocaine;acetic anhydride, (heroin); P2P, (methamphetamine); ergotamine(LSD); anthranilic acid (methaqualone); and piperidine (PCP).This United Nations Board has called on countries in whichillicit drug manufacture occurs to impose a licensing system andquotas for supplying and importation of these chemicals. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission recommends that DEAshould determine which chemicals currently used to manufactureillicit drugs should be subject to reporting requirements orplaced in a schedule of the Controlled Substances Act. Thisreview should included a consideration of which drugs are mostabused, which have the most serious consequences, and whichprecursor chemicals are essential to the production process. Inaddition, DEA should identify the resources needed for thecomputerization, analysis and follow-up of reports concerningchemicals selected for monitoring. The Commission's final recommendations concerning Federaldomestic law enforcement relate to the Federal agents andemployees who are most involved in the Federal effort againstdrugs. This country owes these agents the greatest possibleamount of protection and assistance against the vicious andruthless participants in organized crime traffickingorganizations. As the testimony of drug pilot Adler Barriman Sealbefore this Commission revealed, because of the massive amountsof money involved, high-level traffickers are able to procure anduse the products of the latest technological advances tofacilitate their trafficking operations. Drug agents must also begiven access to such state of the art equipment and weapons. Inthis regard, the research and development operations of Federaldrug law enforcement agencies should work closely with fieldagents to produce the equipment and tools needed to defeat drugtraffickers. Finally, this Commission has made several recommendationsdesigned to improve Federal domestic law enforcement. However,the men and women involved in the day-to-day effort against drugtrafficking have the most incentive and are the best qualified tooffer suggestions as to how to improve domestic law enforcement.These "experts" should be encouraged to makerecommendations and should be rewarded for the ones that aresuccessful. State and Local Domestic Law Enforcement The role of State and local agencies in the national campaignagainst drugs has been described above: they have the primaryresponsibility for lower- and street-level enforcement because oftheir proximity to the affected areas and because they possess orcan adopt the tools necessary for carrying out their mission. Thesuccessful accomplishment of the mission of State and local lawenforcement agencies is a desirable end, in and of itself,because harassment and disruption of drug retailers and smalleror geographically-restricted distribution networks could lead toa reduction in the supply of drugs, an increase in the price ofthe drugs remaining in the marketplace, and discouragement ofnon-drug users from experimenting with drugs. Successfulcompletion of this mission will also permit State and localauthorities to provide Federal law enforcement agencies withinformation that will be invaluable to the latter in infiltratingand disrupting high-level organized crime and other largetrafficking organizations. The leaders of State and localagencies must constantly reiterate to their agents that theirefforts cannot be viewed in isolation and that they are part ofmuch larger national campaign against drugs. Such indoctrinationwill result in the kind of cooperation and coordination essentialto the success of the overall national effort. Effective State and local domestic drug law enforcement willundoubtedly require increased expenditures, including theexpansion of prison facilities. Although the drug problem isquite correctly denominated a National one, its devastatingeffects are most pronounced at the State and local levels.Therefore, the Commission recommends that State and localgovernments determine what is necessary to permit their lawenforcement agencies to carry out their drug mission successfullyand do all they can to convince their citizens that any requiredincrease in expenditures is absolutely essential. Such a campaignwill be considerably more palatable if it includes a largesegment of funding from seized drug revenues and assets, asdescribed below. The Commission has concluded that if a State is serious aboutresponding to the drug problem within its jurisdiction it mustprovide its law enforcement agencies with certain tools that areavailable to their Federal counterparts. The Commission thereforerecommends that those States, which do not already have suchstatutes, consider enacting legislation patterned after thefollowing Federal statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984, theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act;statutory use and derivative use immunity for witnesses;statutory criminal and civil forfeiture provisions; theContinuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) statute; Title III of theOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (electronicsurveillance); and the Currency and Foreign TransactionsReporting Act. In addition, the Commission recommends that, whereappropriate, States consider adopting statewide grand juries,with public reporting authority, to improve their investigationsof drug trafficking organizations and eliminating accomplicecorrobation statutes or rules. Although the Commission iscognizant that there may be legitimate State constitutionalobjections to the adoption of some provisions and devices, theCommission nevertheless believes that each has increased theeffectiveness of Federal domestic law enforcement and wouldsimilarly increase the effectiveness of State and local lawenforcement agencies in infiltrating and disrupting traffickinggroups. Foreign Assistance Because the majority of drugs consumed in the United States isproduced abroad, a primary component of our national strategy isinternational cooperation to control drugs. A prerequisite ofthis strategy is the cooperation of drug producing andtrafficking nations. While this has proved difficult or evenimpossible in some situations, due to the political, economic orsocial instability of some drug producing countries,international cooperation can contribute to our national effortto reduce drug consumption. The United States provides various forms of assistance toother countries to help them in their anti-drug efforts,including both economic and military aid. According to the 1984National Strategy For Prevention of Drug Abuse and DrugTrafficking, the objectives of the U.S. international strategyare: . . . strengthening U.S. efforts to assist foreign governmentsin stopping the production and transportation of illicit drugsand improving interdiction efforts in transit nations;encouraging and assisting governments of producer nations toundertake crop control programs as the most effective means ofcurbing production; developing innovative mutual assistancetreaties with foreign governments, directed at facilitatingjudicial actions against the drug trade, seizing assets derivedfrom drug trafficking, eliminating banking procedures which hideillicit drug transactions, and extradition and other legalarrangements; encouraging other nations to support internationalnarcotics control programs, financially and with other resources,including developmental assistance linked with crop control andcooperative law enforcement efforts; encouraging internationalorganizations and development banks to link their assistance withnarcotics control objectives, where appropriate; and curtailingthe diversion of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from legitimateinternational commerce. Indications are increasing that the concern over drug-relatedproblems is becoming universal. This growing concern is duelargely to recognition by governments in both developed andless-developed countries, that the illicit production,trafficking and abuse of drugs pose serious problems to theirnations' development, their societies, and in some cases, totheir national security. The multiple effects of drug traffickingare increasingly felt in Latin America, Southeast Asia, andSouthwest Asia. These effects include crime, corruption, economicdestabilization, political manipulation, and epidemic drug abuse.Much of the increased anti-drug activity in South Americancountries in the past two years correlates directly to theemergence of domestic drug problems in those countries, and theirawareness of their own vulnerability to the myriad problemsrelated to drug abuse. At a time when drug traffickers rule segments of somecountries, and dominate local economies in others, an increasingnumber of nations are realizing that passivity is not the answer.This realization is encouraging efforts for more cooperation withthe United States in its multilateral enforcement and demandreduction programs. Reduction in the demand for drugs in theUnited States and abroad is beginning to be perceived by drugproducing and trafficking nations as a vital component in thefight against drug abuse. It is an objective that has greaterlong term potential for producing action by source nationgovernments than do efforts perceived as benefiting the UnitedStates exclusively. The Commission recognizes the importance of existinginternational drug control efforts. Because drug trafficking andproduction are threats to the stability of existing democracies,a primary goal of the United States and its allies should be toenhance the security of drug producing and transshipment regions.Because some source countries are promoting drug control in theinterests of their own national security and public welfare moreactively than they have in the past, it is an opportune time forthe United States to intensify its international drug controlefforts. The success of these efforts requires the political andfinancial support of a much broader coalition within theinternational community. The United States offers assistance to numerous countriesaround the world with drug abuse and trafficking problems,primarily through the Department of State's Bureau ofInternational Narcotics Matters, the Agency for InternationalDevelopment, and the United States Information Agency. The UnitedStates currently supports crop eradication programs in 14countries and is working to develop such programs in severalothers. These control efforts are vitally enhanced by the publicadareness programs sponsored by the Department of State, theAgency for International Development, and the United StatesInformation Agency. There has been an ongoing debate in this country concerningthe wisdom of making foreign assistance, both general anddrug-related, conditional on the progress of drug controlefforts. Proponents of utilizing existing authority to suspendaid to any nation not taking steps to control drug productionclaim that the United States should employ this leverage as afinal step in forcing nations to stop drug production. Opponentsfeel that sustained aid is necessary to achieve U.S.-supporteddrug control objectives and that an aid cut-off might undermineother U.S. interests in some cases. The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board is now in a centralposition in this area, as in all others in the anti-drug effort.It should carefully evaluate the data used in the President'sannual decision whether to suspend aid to drug producing ortransshipment countries, and make a suitable recommendation tothe President for his ultimate decision. Extradition and mutual assistance treaties can also contributeto international drug control efforts by enhancing diplomaticinitiatives and providing leverage in United States' foreignpolicy decisions. Clauses in several existing treaties areparticularly innovative and worthy of inclusion in futureagreements. The willingness of a country to engage in andactively implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistancetreaties should be a primary consideration in ultimate U.S.policy decisions regarding foreign assistance to a country, andshould be weighed in the deliberations of the President and thepolicy Board described above. The Department of State, in conjunction with the Department ofDefense, should continue its program of expanded economicassistance with emphasis on assisting those foreign governmentsmaking concerted efforts to control their drug problems. At thesame time, a recognition that drug trafficking has become anational security issue should lead to the availability and useof security assistance funds. The effectiveness of suchassistance is, of course, dependent upon the political will ofthe host government. To encourage this, the United States shouldraise the drug issue to the highest level possible in bilateralrelations with producer and trafficker nations. Similarly, theUnited States should raise the drug issue in terns ofinternational security with its industrialized allies. Thisshould occur not only in the United Nations, but also on abilateral and multilateral basis. This would provide incentive inurging those nations to increase their assistance and cooperationwithin the region and in urging those nations to raise the issueas a high priority in their bilateral relations with the producerand trafficking nations. In addition to these efforts to reduce the supply of drugs,international efforts to reduce the demand for drugs are animportant component of U.S. strategy. The United States should,therefore, continue to help producer nations develop preventionand education programs aimed at drug abuse within the producerand trafficker nations. Indications are overwhelming that the world community ingeneral realizes the dangers inherent in drug use. In the past,many nations regarded drug abuse as aberrational social behavior,and relegated governmental reaction, if there was any at all, tolaw enforcement or social/health ministries. As internationalawareness of the actual nature and scope of the threat of drugabuse increases, however, nations are placing the issue where itbelongs: within the realm of national security. Source Country Crop Control Strategies to control drug trafficking and drug abuse in theUnited States have traditionally included measures designed toeliminate illicit drug supplies at their source. These"source country eradication" measures, primarily themanual elimination or uprooting of illicit drug crops and the useof herbicides to kill illicit plants, remain a central focus ofthis country's anti-drug efforts. The 1984 National Strategy forthe Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking clearly statesU.S. policy in this regard: Fundamental to the overall supply reduction effort iseliminating illegal drugs as close to their source as possible.The major gains will be realized in the longer term reduction inthe availability of illicit drugs. Since 1978 the Department of State's Bureau of InternationalNarcotics Matters (BINM) has had primary responsibility foroverseeing and implementing foreign drug production controlefforts. BINM provides bilateral assistance for crop control andinterdiction programs in drug source countries in the form ofequipment, training and technical advisory services. BINM'sstated objective is: to control production simultaneously in all key sectors ofillicit drugs exported to the United States so that significantand lasting reductions in availability are achieved . . . .Preventing cultivation and destroying illicit narcotics at theirsource will prove to be the most effective means of reducingavailability. . . . BINM's first priority is on crop control -government bans on cultivation production, enforced by manual orchemical crop eradication. In a successful crop control system drugs would be stopped attheir source, thereby alleviating the "chain reaction"associated with drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country.In fact, crop reduction efforts have at best enjoyed limitedsuccess. Despite the fact that nearly all drug producing andtransit countries are signatories to a 1961 agreement thatrestricts production and distribution of certain drugs to onlymedical and scientific uses, drug production has escalated inmost source countries in the past 20 years. Increased productionhas resulted in decreased prices and wider availability of mostillicit drugs in the United States. Accordingly, domesticconsumption of many drugs has increased. The effectiveness of efforts to control illicit drug crops insource countries is inherently limited. First, many sourcecountry governments are not motivated to reduce crop production,either because the profits obtained from the illicit crops areessential to the economic and/or political stability of thecountry, or because they view drug consumption as an exclusivelyAmerican problem. In addition, many drugs that are illegal in theUnited States are traditionally consumed in milder forms bysource country natives and are viewed as necessities of life oran essential part of their culture. Secondly, in many cases farmers do not have an easilyavailable alternative crop. In any case, an illicit drug crop canprovide a farmer with far more income than any legitimate cropand is therefore likely to be selected above any other crop forcultivation. Third, the governments in many producing areas are weak and donot exert control over growers. The Thai and Burmese governmentshave long been fighting insurgent groups in the NorthwestFrontier Provinces, where most of the Golden Triangle opium isgrown. The Peruvian government has had little effective controlin remote coca producing regions controlled by that country'sShining Path Guerrillas. Even where governments aggressivelypursue crop eradication programs, difficulties are sometimesoverwhelming. Fourth, some major source countries are controlled bygovernments hostile to the United States, who while adoptingpolicies to reduce domestic consumption, have no hesitation aboutimportation of illicit drugs to the United States. Because manysource country governments are politically and economicallyunstable, United States diplomatic relations with even nonhostilesource country governments are often very complex. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the set of sourcecountries is not fixed. When a crop is successfully reduced inone country, production begins or increases in another country.New producers constantly emerge. This shifting has been observedrepeatedly throughout the history of source country controlefforts, even where the United States has claimed major croperadication successsses. This has been the most serious obstacleto total crop reduction efforts. U.S. and Mexican efforts provide an example. The croperadication program conducted in the mid-1970's in Mexico isoften cited as a successful model. Through the program, theUnited States supplied equipment, herbicide and funds for theeradication of opium poppies, primarily in Northern Mexico. WhileMexican heroin production declined after the program'simplementation, heroin production in and export from the GoldenTriangle and the Golden Crescent accelerated, and within fiveyears, total heroin available in the United States reached levelsequal to those attained before the Mexican eradication program.Mexican heroin production has increased every year since 1980,and in 1984 that country provided an estimated 21 percent of thetotal U.S. supply. Despite the limitations of source country control programs,the efforts to reduce international illicit drug crops areessential to the overall U.S. drug strategy. Implementedselectively and judiciously, crop control programs couldeffectively reduce the availability of targeted illicit drugs inthe United States, if only on a temporary basis. As viewed by theSelect Committee on Narcotics, Effective action in relatively few countries, against theproduction and trafficking of opium, heroin, coca, cocaine,marijuana and hashish would have a great impact on the drug abuseproblem in the United States by dramatically curtailing suppliesavailable to users and potential users . . . The United States, through the Department of State, shouldfocus crop control efforts in those countries where political andeconomic climates will make the success of crop eradicationprograms probable. Particular crop control opportunities couldbest be determined if the State Department established a cadre ofprofessional drug officers. Currently, international drugprograms are often managed by contract personnel or by ForeignService Officers not especially interested in drug issues.Narcotics Assistance Unit positions within the Foreign Serviceoften remain unfilled for long periods of time because ForeignService Officers often view them as a detriment to their careers.The absence of a specialized drug group within the ForeignService structure thus impacts negatively on the overallinternational drug effort. The Department of State shouldrecognize Narcotics Assistance Unit positions as priorityassignments, and integrate them into the career advancementstructure. BINM should also examine the possibility of introducing sourcecountry farmers to more imaginative and feasible alternatives toillicit drug cultivation. The available options are currentlylimited to cultivating licit replacement crops but could possiblyinclude the mining of indigenous minerals and the introduction oflight industry to a traditional growing region. Finally, the importance of international crop controls in thecontext of the overall drug reduction strategy should bereevaluated. The limitations inherent in these programs, themajority of which are beyond the control of the United States,make them a less likely success than other strategies discussedelsewhere in this report. In addition, the problems associatedwith international controls, most notably the relentless shiftingof drug crop cultivations to non-targeted countries, underscoresthe ultimate importance of reducing the demand for drugs in thiscountry. History has shown that as long as consumer demand for anillicit drug is strong, some country, somewhere, will become asource country.

While this seems plausible,a review of the 75-year history of these efforts reveals thatthey have not reduced social, economic or crime problems relatedto drugs. Despite continuing expressions of determination,America's war on drugs seems nowhere close to success. Now morethan ever, drugs present problems of vast proportions. This does not suggest that efforts to reduce supply, such ascrop eradication, border interdiction, and prosecution, havefailed. To the contrary, they have achieved a measure of success.In 1983, for example, authorities estimated that approximately 10percent of the drugs destined for illicit markets wereinterdicted. Crop eradication programs were significantlyexpanded in Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine isprocessed and nearly one-half of the marijuana consumed in theUnited States is grown. In addition, indictments and convictionsof some of the world's most notorious traffickers have beenobtained in recent years. Despite these efforts, American consumption of cocaineincreased an estimated 12 percent and dangerous drug useincreased an estimated 15 percent between 1983 and 1984. Cocaine,heroin, amphetamine, and methamphetamine-related deathsincreased, as did cocaine, PCP, and methamphetamine-relatedemergency room visits. In short, strategies to reduce supply are "working"by some standards, but only to a limited degree. Although some inherent factors limit the effectiveness ofthese tactics, the overwhelming and continuing demand for illicitdrugs among Americans is the primary cause of their limitedsuccess. Millions want illicit drugs and are willing to violatethe law, spend billions of dollars, and in many cases risk theirlives to obtain them. Supply Versus Demand Although the supply of and demand for drugs have often beenconsidered separate issues, by both the public and privatesectors, they are in fact inseparable parts of a single problem.The success of supply efforts are related to commitments made toreduce the demand for drugs through drug abuse education,treatment, research, vigorous enforcement of drug abuse laws, andeffective sentencing. Drug supply and demand operate in aninterrelated and dynamic manner. The strategies employed to limiteach should be similarly connected. The national fight against illicit drugs relies on twofundamental strategies: organized crime policy and drug abusepolicy. Organized crime policy targets specific criminal groupsand seeks to destroy those already in existence and prevent theemergence of new ones. In contrast, drug abuse policy attempts toreduce drug use and its associated adverse effects.Theoretically, organized crime policy and drug abuse policy canconflict. Reducing the demand for drugs advances the goals ofboth organized crime policy and drug abuse policy. Asignificantly smaller drug market, which would likely result froma substantially reduced demand for drugs, would attack organizedcrime groups by limiting the huge profits currently available indrug trafficking, while simultaneously reducing the number ofdrug users, the goal of drug abuse policy. A clear example of the relationship of supply and demand isprovided by the case of heroin trafficker Cecily Lermusiaux, whowith several associates, moved heroin into an area of Las Vegaswhere its use among "middle to high-class whites" waspreviously unknown. In a scheme which began with the distributionof free samples of heroin, Lermusiaux's independent heroinbusiness generated a profit of several million dollars inapproximately six years. The demand for drugs is also widely recognized as the fuelthat the illicit drug industry needs to operate. According toColombian President Belisario Bentancur: In the world war against narcotics, we need the commitment ofthe consumer nations to attack the traffic with the same vigor wehave shown. We can make all the sacrifices possible, but if thereis enormous demand, production will never be completelyeradicated. This sentiment has been echoed by the other side of the law.Carlos Lehder, who heads one of Colombia's most notorious cocainecartels, sees the American demand for drugs as the driving forcebehind the "bonanza" of drug trafficking: The demand for drugs in the United States is so great that theproducer countries like Colombia play a really tiny role comparedto the total consumption of the United States. Tactics to Reduce Demand Efforts to reduce demand are not hampered by internationalpolitical complications, or other factors that limit theeffectiveness of tactics to reduce supply. This Commission is ofthe opinion that since reducing demand is the single policyoption pursuable entirely within our own borders, it deservesgreater attention. More successful tactics to reduce demand may in the long-rundecrease the need for current high levels of funding forapproaches to reduce supply. A significant reduction in thedemand for drugs as a complement to aggressive enforcementefforts is likely to make drug trafficking less lucrative fororganized crime and thus prompt many organized crime groups todrop out of the drug business. According to analyst Mark Kleiman: Demand reduction is clearly the strategy of choice withrespect to its effects on organized crime . . . anything thattends to depress demand will reduce both trafficking-relatedancillary crime and the level of drug enforcement resourcesneeded to attain any given level of reduction in drugconsumption. Skeptics have argued that past tactics to reduce demand havenot been successful. However, the history of drug abuseprevention and treatment programs has been relatively short. Itwas not until the upsurge of drug use in the 1960's that theseprograms developed. Some early prevention approaches wereill-conceived. For example, they often presented informationabout drugs without persuasive arguments to deter their use, andother programs used exaggerated information. Such programs havebeen criticized for unintentionally encouraging experimentationwith drugs or squandering the credibility of anti-druginformation. The most recent and effective drug abuse educationand prevention programs focus on the psychological andsociological factors that contribute to the onset of drug use.Drug education programs must be continually evaluated andimproved to keep pace with changing drug abuse patterns. In a model program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA) used the strategy of the anti-smoking campaigns of thelate 1970's, which many feel were effective, to develop its"Just Say No" campaign against drug use whichrecognizes the impact of social pressure. NIDA seeks to showadolescents through a music video, television commercials, andother media that they can turn down drugs by simply saying"no" to them. While it is difficult to measure precisely the effectivenessof such anti-drug advertising, it is clear that the media canhelp shape attitudes. Just as beliefs about cigarette smokinghave changed in recent years, so too can attitudes about drugs.Anti-drug advertising has an advantage over the anti-smokingcampaigns: drug dealers cannot openly advertise their product.According to the New York advertising firm of Trout and Ries, Unlike cigarette manufacturers, drug producers and sellerscannot use advertising to promote a fashionable image for theirdrugs. Quite the opposite, the government can use advertising tomake drugs less and less fashionable to use. This, if Americaruns true to form, will dramatically reduce demand. When it's'out' in America, it doesn't sell. Reducing the demand for drugs requires a long-term commitmentbecause it takes time to change attitudes. This commitment mustbe made by Federal, State, and local governments and the privatesector. Each must unequivocally reassert that any and all illicitdrug use is unacceptable in light of the effects of drugs onindividuals, families, communities, and governments. It is onlyin this context that a war against drugs that seeks to limit boththe supply of and demand for drugs can be effective. Federal Government Federal Priorities Three of the five elements of the current National Strategyfor Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking are directed toreduction of demand: drug abuse prevention, medicaldetoxification and treatment, and research. The importance of reducing demand has, in addition, been,publicly acknowledged by leading law enforcement officials.According to Attorney General Edwin Meese III, for example: All the enforcement efforts that we can try in this country,all the police agencies in this nation and worldwide will neverbe able to stem the supply of drugs in this nation until we havefirst decreased the number of users and have decreased the demandfor these drugs. John Lawn, administrator of the Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA), concurs: Were we [DEAl to increase dramatically in size, the drugproblem would continue to exist until we could do something aboutdemand reduction. While the importance of strategies to reduce demand has beenacknowledged, it is reduction of supply that has consumed thebulk of the Federal drug abuse budget. This may be due, in part,to the fact that certain enforcement operations are inherentlymore expensive, and they are exclusively a Federal function. Inaddition, primary responsibility for developing and maintainingprograms to reduce demand has been shifted to the States and theprivate sector. The concept of our current National Strategy, assigningcomplementary roles to the Federal government, on the one hand,and State and local governments and the private sector, on theother, is commendable for its recognition of the unique roles ofeach component. However, the adoption of this coordinatedapproach carries with it the responsibility for ensuring that thecomponents perform in a truly coordinated and complementaryfashion. There is insufficient evidence today that thisresponsibility is being met. Moreover, in precisely the same waythat approaches to reduce supply recognize a unique Federalcapability, there are certain functions in the area of demandthat, by their nature, can only be performed by the Federalgovernment. The Federal government's exclusive role in reducingthe demand for drugs includes providing national coordination inthe conduct of research, gathering nationwide data, anddeveloping and disseminating standards for drug prevention andtreatment programs across the country. Current budgetary figures reflect the emphasis on drug lawenforcement. while programs to reduce demand at one time receivedthe larger share of the Federal budget, the focus on enforcementhas increased dramatically during the last decade. For example,between fiscal year 82 and 86, Federal funding for drug abuseprevention has decreased by 5 percent, while Federal funding fordrug law enforcement has increase by 70 percent. For fiscal year1986 Federal expenditures on drug law enforcement constitute 84percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget outlay of $1.7billion. Interdiction alone consumes 38 percent of this budget.In the same year Federal funding for drug abuse preventionconstitutes one percent, treatment and rehabilitation 6 percent,and research 4 percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget. In addition to this funding the Federal government providesfunding to the States for drug abuse prevention and treatmentthrough the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grants.For fiscal year 1986 between $65 and $244 million is madeavailable to the States for drug programs. However, prior to 1981under the formula grant program, 40 percent more funds wereavailable to the States for these purposes. A thorough review ofthe current budgetary allotments for anti-drug efforts, nowcontemplated by the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,should be placed at the top of the agenda of the Boardimmediately. This Commission concludes that such a review willindicate that greater Federal resources should be devoted toprograms to reduce demand, and that the Board should pursueappropriate action without hesitation. Asset Forfeiture Expanded efforts to reduce demand would, of course, requireadditional funding at all levels. A particularly promising sourceof such funding is the considerable amount of money and propertyobtained annually through forfeiture and seized by lawenforcement officials. In 1984 Federal agencies obtained anestimated $400 to 450 million through the forfeiture and seizureof drug traffickers assets. Rudolph Guiliani, U.S. Attorney forthe Southern District of New York, observes: The drug dealers are just about paying for the drug lawenforcement, and hopefully we can get them to pay for drugeducation. Under current policy, the Federal government channels allseized and forfeited assets into Federal, State, and local lawenforcement agencies and the Department of Justice AssetsForfeiture Fund. Presently, no portion of these funds is used forFederal drug demand reduction programs, such as prevention,treatment, and research. However, pending legislation is beingconsidered that would direct use of portions of the AssetsForfeiture Fund for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture fundderived from drug cases should be devoted to programs to reducedemand in whatever proportion is indicated by the Policy Board'sbudgetary review. Funding to reduce demand should include aresponsible contribution to the States for their own programs inthis area. However, any funding directed to the States should bemade contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, andafter a reasonable grace period, funding should be denied to anyState failing this requirement. Failure to enact State electronicsurveillance measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with theproceeds thereof directed to anti-drug programs, shouldconstitute per se failure. Research Because data concerning drug abuse are in many instancesrelatively incomplete, and in all cases, subject to change basedon new discoveries, continuing research is a fundamentalcomponent of any drug strategy. Recent discoveries concerningcocaine provide an example. The 1967 President's Commission onLaw Enforcement and Administration of Justice reported thatcocaine did not "create tolerance or physicaldependence;" however, research during the 1980's showed thatcocaine does, in fact, create tolerance and some argue, physicaldependence. Despite this increased understanding about cocaine,many experts, such as Dr. Arnold Washton, argue that researchabout the effects of cocaine is still in its "infancy." Continuing research is required not only by the complex natureof drugs and their effects on the human mind and body, but alsoby the constantly shifting patterns of drug abuse. While heroinhas traditionally been the most frequently encountered drug ofabuse among individuals in treatment programs, cocaine nowfollows closely behind and has, in fact, overtaken heroin as theprimary drug of abuse by those in treatment in 18 States. Whilerequests for treatment by cocaine users are estimated to haveincreased by as much as 600 percent in the last three years,research about cocaine and its effects has not kept pace withthis growing problem. The development of new drugs, such ascontrolled substance analogs, presents another compelling needfor continuing research. Data Collection and Dissemination As part of its research responsibilities, NIDA supports twocontinuing epidemiological surveys, the National Household Surveyon Drug Abuse and the High School Senior Survey. While these twosurveys provide valuable information about the extent of druguse, neither NIDA nor any other agency systematically collects ordisseminates information about the thousands of drug abuseprograms. State governments, which disbursed 46 percent ($642.5 million)of the funding for alcohol and drug abuse prevention andtreatment services in fiscal year 1984, do not systematicallyreport to the Federal government about these programs. This lackof data is due primarily to the absence of any statutoryrequirement for such reporting, and is a major obstacle toeffective drug policy planning. The States should be required toreport to the National Institute on Drug Abuse information abouttheir prevention and treatment programs. With this information,and reports obtained from private programs, NIDA will be betterable to identify the best prevention and treatment programs andto develop and disseminate standards and guidelines for suchprograms to the States. The States should, in turn, provide thisinformation to all groups engaged in prevention, treatment, andrelated research. Guidelines Because the Federal government does not systematically collectand evaluate information about drug abuse prevention andtreatment programs, it cannot develop substantive guidelines forsuch efforts. The history of drug abuse prevention hasdemonstrated that certain approaches are considerably moreeffective than others. Some have even unwittingly encouragedexperimentation with drugs. As an increasing number of school andcommunity-based prevention programs are created, the need forguidelines for drug abuse programs is particularly acute.Officials at NIDA acknowledge that many programs use outdatedfactual information and philosophies; however, the Federalgovernment is in a unique position to establish and disseminatesuch guidelines to improve both State and private sector drugabuse programs. Its current failure to do so is a majordeficiency in the campaign against drug abuse. In addition to contributions to reducing the demand for drugsthrough research, data collection and dissemination, and theformation of guidelines, the Federal government should provide anexample of the unacceptability of drug use. The President shoulddirect the heads of all federal agencies to formulate immediatelyclear policy statements, with implementing guidelines, includingsuitable drug testing, expressing the utter unacceptability ofdrug use by Federal employees. Government contracts should not beawarded to companies which fail to implement drug programs,including suitable drug testing. State and Local Governments State and local governments are key components in the nationalcampaign against drug abuse. Their unique capabilities in thearea of reducing demand include State-sponsored media campaignsagainst drug use, prevention and education programs in theschools, drug treatment programs, more vigorous enforcement ofState drug laws, and the inclusion of mandatory treatment or jailsentences, as appropriate, for those individuals convicted ofpossession of drugs. Because the nature of drug use tends to varyamong different geographical areas, State and local governmentsare best positioned to tailor techniques to reduce demand to suittheir particular drug problem. Drug Education The public school systems of State and local governmentsprovide an appropriate forum for drug abuse prevention programs.Consistent with identified measures of success, State governmentsshould establish credentialing standards for prevention andtreatment programs. They should further require that allelementary, junior high, and high schools within the Stateinclude drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,designed in a manner consistent with such credentialingstandards. State funding should be made available to assure theproper training of educators assigned to such programs. Combining prevention programs, clear school policies about theconsequences of drug use, increased discipline, and higheracademic standards has been demonstrated to be effective. Forexample, Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia implementedsuch a program in the late 1970's in the face of "pooracademic performance . . . student apathy . . . disciplineproblems . . . class cutting and open drug use on campus."By the early 1980's, performance on standardized tests improvedsignificantly and "the use and possession of drugs on campus[had] all but disappeared." Every employer, public andprivate, and public education institutions at all levels shouldhave clearly-stated policies prohibiting drug use, possession ofdrugs, or being under the influence of drugs on their premises.The consequences of violating these prohibitions should beclearly explained. Law Enforcement A critical part of a national campaign to reduce demand isvigorous enforcement by State and local governments of their lawsregarding the possession of controlled substances. The Departmentof Justice Uniform Crime Report for 1984 states that 552,552arrests were made in 1984 by State and local police agencies forpossession of drugs. Given that in 1984 there were estimated tobe 20 million monthly marijuana users, over four million monthlycocaine users, and approximately 520,000 heroin addicts, it isclear that the statistical probability of arrest for possessionwas and is quite low. This low probability of arrest vitiates inlarge part whatever deterrent value laws against drug possessionand use may have. In addition to increasing the likelihood of arrest for drugpossession, punishment for those convicted of such offenses canbe more effective. Drug users are not "victims" whobear no responsibility for their actions. Imprisonment forrecidivists provides both deterrent value and an opportunity tobreak the cycle of drug use. Uniform and rational sentencing fordrug offenses is essential. Such a system should provide asentence of probation and a fine for a first offense involvingpossession of drugs. The terms of probation should include arequirement to remain drug-free, to be verified through periodicdrug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs shouldresult in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment, if appropriate,or fines or all three. The results of random drug screeningshould be used in considering parole in cases of both drugpossession and trafficking. Society's commitment to the unacceptability of illicit druguse is properly expressed in vigorous enforcement of the lawsregarding possession of drugs and sentencing of recidivist usersto jail terms and mandatory treatment. Such a national commitmentis in conflict with various States' relaxation of criminalpenalties for the possession of marijuana. Because such measureswere based on limited information and popular misinformationabout the effects of marijuana, it is appropriate for thoseStates that reduced these penalties during the 1970's toreconsider these laws. This reconsideration is warranted,especially in light of a Federal campaign against marijuanasmuggling and the considerable evidence that a substantial shareof marijuana trafficking is dominated by organized crime groups,which are both ruthless and involved in smuggling other drugs. Inaddition, the sale of drug paraphernalia undermines this Nation'santi-drug efforts. States that have not already done so shouldenact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drugparaphernalia. Reducing demand and increased enforcement of drug possessionlaws will undoubtedly place a greater burden on our courts andwill generate the need for more jail cells and treatmentfacilities. The accompanying increase in expenditures, however,could be met in part with funding extracted from the illicit drugindustry itself. All 50 States currently authorize forfeiture ofassets in connection with drug trafficking and manufacturing,making available millions of dollars in cash and property eachyear to State governments. The Private Sector: Attitudes and Actions The hostess who is certain enough of her own unwillingness totolerate pot smoking in her home doesn't need to call the cops tokeep her guests from lighting up. "Great scent. Lousy name." - Advertising Age, atrade journal commenting on "Opium," a popular perfumemarketed by Charles of the Ritz, a subsidiary of SquibbPharmaceuticals. Drug abuse is fundamentally a social problem, which cannot besolved by the government alone. Federal and State governments cansupport drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, conductresearch, enforce drug laws and provide leadership in the fightagainst drug abuse and drug trafficking. However, not untilpublic and individual attitudes change will illicit drugs and theorganized criminal groups that traffic in them be eliminated.Individuals need not accept drug use in their midst. There is no"right" to use drugs. Government efforts to combat drugtrafficking and drug abuse are a vital effort, but they areultimately only a holding action, while consensus continues tobuild among individuals concerning the utter unacceptability ofdrug use. Despite this growing consensus, a profound disparity existsbetween principle and practice. Popular entertainment aridadvertising, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, regularly reflectsand even promotes the view that the use of illicit drugs isglamorous, exciting, and sophisticated, or at least harmless andamusing. The illusion that drug use is glamorous is regularly, ifsomewhat indirectly, reinforced by revelations that drug use iscommonplace among celebrities in the sports and entertainmentworlds. In August 1985, for example, the New York Times reportedcocaine's alleged use by players on virtually every team in themajor leagues, prompting the Commissioner of Baseball to declaredrug use the "number one" problem facing the game. It is even possible to find purportedly responsible groupsurging not only recognition but acceptance of drug use as afeature of daily life. An article in the January/February 1984issue of Social Work, the journal of the National Association ofSocial Workers, prescribes the following for adolescent marijuanause: Use should be moderate . . no more than four to five jointsper week seem advisable. Such acceptance of drug use may be shared by many who resignthemselves to the fact that drug abuse is inevitable. Such a viewreflects a failure of will on the part of the American public.American society may view drug use in the abstract as wrong, andmany People agree that heroin addicts who commit additionalcrimes to support their drug habits should be jailed. However,many people react with ambivalence to the drug use in theirmidst. Even while the United States government spends almost abillion and one-half dollars on drug law enforcement, threatensto cut off foreign aid to drug producing countries, andextradites and imprisons foreign nationals on traffickingcharges, we appear to lack the same degree of resolve to holdthis country's drug users, as well as those who directly orindirectly promote drug use, accountable for their actions andthe consequences thereof. While attitudes are ultimately an individual matter, actionsneed not be. It is in combination with others that privatecitizens have been most effective in combatting drug abuse. Asdiscussed earlier, athletes, entertainers, manufactures,advertisers and media can promote drug use by their individualexamples or by favorable portrayals of drug use. However, theseelements of society also have the power to shape different publicattitudes about drug use by presenting the truth about drugs. Themedia and entertainment industries should carefully review theirportrayals of drug use and its consequences and ensure theiraccuracy. Efforts to combat drug abuse can also be successful in theworkplace. Many businesses across the country have EmployeeAssistance Programs (EAPs), which seek to prevent drug abuse atthe worksite and which offer treatment and referrals. Inaddition, many businesses now test employees or prospectiveemployees for drug use. According to a survey of 100 Fortune 500companies, two-thirds refuse to hire job applicants who fail suchtests, 25 percent fire employees and 41 percent require treatmentfor employees who fail. Drug testing protects businesses, whichlose billions of dollars each year in reduced productivity as aresult of drug use, employees, and the public. Drug testing incertain "critical positions," such as in thetransportation industry, law enforcement, and education isparticularly important. In addition to efforts in the workplace to combat drug abuse,health professionals, such as physicians, nurses, psychologists,and social workers can help identify and treat drug users.However, currently formal training in the diagnosis and treatmentof drug abuse is limited. Health professionals should bethoroughly trained to identify and counsel drug abusers. Decisions to use or not to use drugs are ultimately derivedfrom values that are best inculcated and reinforced in families,churches, civic organizations, schools and local communities. Theefforts of organizations, which seek to help families preventdrug use, such as the National Federation of Parents forDrug-Free Youth, are essential to the fight against drug use anddrug trafficking. First Lady Nancy Reagan has made an importantcontribution to this effort to reduce the demand for drugs.Relying on the task force approach which law enforcementofficials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,civic organizations, and business associations should formcommunity task forces in every community across the country toprovide a unified front against drugs.

The ultimate goal of the Nation's drug policy is theeffective suppression of drug abuse in the United States. Whileefforts to reduce the supply of drugs in this country, such asinterdiction and source country crop controls, indirectly advancethis goal, efforts to reduce the demand for drugs can make a moredirect contribution. For this reason, the Nation's drug policymust emphasize more strongly efforts to reduce the demand fordrugs. 2. Because drug trafficking and abuse are the most seriousorganized crime problems in America today, they must be addressedat the highest levels of government. Therefore, the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board (Board), under the direction of theAttorney General, is and should continue to be responsible forthis country's drug policy. The mandate of the Board should beinterpreted, or expanded if necessary, to require the Board tocoordinate carefully efforts to reduce both drug demand andsupply to achieve this ultimate goal. The Board should evaluateall programs undertaken pursuant to the national drug strategy interms of their contribution to this goal. In recognition of thescope of the problem of international drug trafficking and theextended national effort needed to combat it, the AttorneyGeneral, as Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement PolicyBoard, should depart from the current formulation of a NationalStrategy on an annual basis, directing instead the formulation ofa long range national offensive against drug supply and demand,including long term funding proposals. Such a program shouldinclude an appropriate role for State and local agencies as acomplement to Federal efforts. State and local police agenciesshould be trained and equipped to perform such a role. 3. The rigorous pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, asproposed in this report, will not undermine its organized crimepolicy. Indeed, the goals of the two policies substantiallyoverlap and therefore both can and must be implementedsimultaneously and aggressively. 4. The cost of this Nation's anti-drug efforts can besubsidized to a great extent by the seizure and forfeiture ofdrug traffickers' assets. That portion of the Federalgovernment's asset forfeiture fund derived from drug cases shouldbe devoted exclusively to anti-drug programs. Such a fundingmechanism should be made permanent through law, and the currentceiling of $10 million should be eliminated. In the annualCongressional appropriations process, these funds should beallocated to participating agencies according to Congressionalfindings, just as if the funds were appropriated. 5. Because of the international dimensions of drugtrafficking, the United Nations, in performance of its leadershiprole in the international community, should sponsor the draftingand promotion of a model International Controlled Substances Act,identifying each and every drug which is trafficked to thedetriment of any single member nation. This model act should beaccompanied by a Model Mutual Legal Assistance and ExtraditionTreaty, embodying the recognition that international drugtrafficking is a matter of profound international concern. In thespirit of international cooperation, the Attorney General, asChairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board, shoulddirect the creation of bilateral working groups, modeled on thepresent Italian-American Working Group. Interdiction 1. Within the overall structure of the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board (the Board), the Vice President's roleas leader and coordinator of interdiction efforts should berecognized, maintained, and strengthened. 2. A proper and realistic goal of our interdiction effortsshould be the maintenance of persistent pressure on drugtraffickers, both as a deterrent and as a symbol of nationaldetermination. Operational and policy decisions should reflectthat measure of su cess and specifically reject any lessrealistic or effective goal. 3. Both Congress and the Board should carefully evaluate thetechnical capabilities and equipment of drug smugglers. To theextent that law enforcement agencies' capabilities and equipmentare inferior to those of drug traffickers, immediate steps shouldbe taken to rectify the situation. 4. All Federal agencies having any responsibility for theregulation of air, sea, or land travel into or out of the UnitedStates should review their policies and practices and ensure thatno purpose other than the promotion of public safety is givenpriority over the effort to combat drug trafficking. To this end,the proposed "Customs Enforcement Act of 1985" shouldbe enacted promptly. 5. The Policy Board should carefully examine the regulatorypractices of the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly inthe field of aircraft modification, to determine whetherpossibilities exist for more aggressive anti-smuggling efforts.In addition, the Policy Board should carefully monitor the designof the Federal Aviation Administration's approach radar system toensure that interdiction capabilities and opportunities aremaximized. 6. Diplomatic initiatives should be pursued immediately tofacilitate Customs pursuit of suspected airborne drug traffickersinto Mexican air space. Such efforts should be given the highestpriority in our bilateral relations with Mexico, including theWestern Hemisphere discussions agreed upon between the Presidentsof the United States and Mexico on January 3, 1986. 7. The Policy Board should thoroughly evaluate expanded use ofCoast Guard aviation capabilities in drug interdiction. 8. Congress should give careful consideration to user fees asa means of supplementing the Coast Guard's budget. Fees should godirectly to the Coast Guard's budget rather than the generalTreasury. 9. Both the Policy Board and the Department of Defense shouldcontinue to examine Navy assistance to Coast Guard interdictionoperations, with a view to expanding such assistance whenever andwherever possible. Such expansion should be facilitated byadoption of the broader military view of national securityadvocated in this report. 10. Monies from the proposed permanent asset forfeiture fundshould be made available to the Customs Service for theacquisition of necessary equipment, including but not limited tothe type of fast patrol boats recently deployed in Operation BlueLightning. 11. Joint Federal-State-local interdiction operations, such asOperation Blue Lightning, should be refined and used whereverfeasible and desirable. Intelligence 1. The Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensurethat data concerning all aspects of both drug supply and demandare adequately collected, analyzed, correlated and disseminated. 2. The Federal electronic surveillance statute should beexamined and amended to reflect existing technology. ExistingState laws should be similarly studied and changed wherenecessary. Those States still without a statute permittingcourt-ordered electronic surveillance should immediately enactone, consistent with current technology. 3. The "Mansfield Amendment" to the ForeignAssistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291 (c)(l)) should be repealedin its entirety. The concerns addressed by that legislationshould be incorporated in agency guidelines which providenecessary flexibility while embodying the limits of permissibleU.S. agency conduct. 4. Data relating to assets forfeited to Federal, State andlocal jurisdictions should be collected, analyzed, anddisseminated by the all source intelligence center discussedelsewhere in this report. 5. Because of the importance of information about individualsin drug treatment programs, the Federal government should againrequire the States to participate in the Client Oriented DataAcquisition Process. 6. Both the Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High SchoolSenior Survey should over sample populations thought to be heavydrug users. In addition, because questions about the nature ofdrug transactions, e.g., the price paid and purity and quantityof the drug purchased, could provide important information forpolicy makers and enforcement officials, such questions should beadded to the Household and High School Senior Surveys. Combined Intelligence and Interdiction 1. The Policy Board should take immediate steps to ensure thatthe law enforcement and intelligence communities are thoroughlyfamiliar with each other's needs and capabilities. 2. Every agency involved in the interdict ion of drugshipments or the apprehension of drug traffickers should haveready access to all necessary intelligence gathered in source andtransshipment countries. To the extent that this requiresexpansion or modification of existing practices, the Policy Boardshould ensure that such change is pursued immediately. Inparticular, the critical nature of real-time intelligence toeffective Customs operations at the border must be recognized,and the Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensurethat, under current Federal organization, such information fromall sources is being provided. 3. To the extent that the intelligence community under thecurrent Federal structure needs direction from the highest levelsof government concerning aggressive anti-drug actions, includingoperations against the infrastructure of foreign drug-traffickingorganizations, such direction should be provided immediately. 4. The "all-source intelligence and operationscenter," now being considered by the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board, should be pursued aggressively andexpeditiously. It should combine in a physically secure facilitythe functions now being performed by EPIC and NNBIS, retainingthe current Vice Presidential direction and regional structure ofthe latter for interdiction functions. Ft. Bliss, Texas, andsimilar locations should be considered as possible sites for thecenter. Its design, giving due consideration to the protection ofcivil liberties, should provide specific roles for all pertinentDepartment of Defense components and for all members of theintelligence community, to the fullest extent Permitted byExecutive Order 12333, The design should also incorporatespecific foreign intelligence-gathering functions for other U.S.Agencies, in order to maximize the acquisition of both strategicand tactical data. Each Participating agency should be requiredto present to the Policy Board its specific operationalguidelines for providing time-sensitive data to the center. Thecenter should also Include a uniform national system forgathering and analyzing drug related data on various categoriesof information, including arrests, seizures, convictions,sentences, forfeitures, emergency room admissions, and deaths. Asimilar system of compiling and analyzing financial data gatheredby all members of the intelligence community, as well as thatcontained in all financial records now required by law to be keptby any Federal agency, should also be included as an Integralcomponent of the center. Both data bases should be compiled andmaintained in a fashion that provides reliable, constant, anduniform tracking, retrieval, and compilation for the purpose ofcharting trends and profiles, as well as support for specificoperations whenever Possible. Access to all data compiled shouldbe available to appropriate State and local agencies, in additionto Federal components, subject to Procedures necessary to ensurethe integrity of the information-sharing process. 5. Joint enforcement and intelligence operations by source andtransshipment countries should be encouraged, and careful,resourceful analysis should be given to identify means of U.S.funding of such operations. Consistent with other recommendationsin this report, participation in such operations by Americancomponents should be promoted. 6. The Department of State should stress to Chiefs of Missionat principal reporting posts and to all other cognizantDepartmental personnel the high priority attached to acoordinated narcotics intelligence and interdiction strategy. 7. All necessary steps should be taken to ensure that Consularofficers can and do deny U.S. entry visas to individualssuspected of drug trafficking. Subject to the informing agency'ssafeguards of reliability, information provided by any agency ofthe United States, without further corroboration, should besufficient to require such denial under the pertinent statute, 8U.S.C. Section 1182 (a)(23). The Policy Board should promptlyestablish guidelines for similar information-sharing on agovernment-wide basis. 8. Both Congress and the Executive Branch should closelyexamine the operations and cost effectiveness of drug-relatedintelligence-gathering abroad. When and where justified by suchan examination, resources available for such operations should beexpanded. Particular attention should be paid to the criticalneed for adequate foreign intelligence by the Customs Service inperforming its border interdiction function. 9. Coast Guard officers should be thoroughly integrated intothe Defense Attache system. 10. The definition of "national security" nowemployed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as their starting point inmission determination is: A collective term encompassing both national defense andforeign relations of the United States. Specifically, thecondition provided by: a. a military or defense advantage over any foreign nationalor group of nations, or b. a favorable foreign relations position, or c. a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostileor destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. The Joint Chiefs should be instructed by the highest levels ofgovernment, through a National Security Decision Directive or byother appropriate means, that "hostile or destructive actionfrom within or without, overt or covert," as used in thisdefinition, shall include the airborne, amphibious, and overlandinvasion of this country by drug smugglers. This policy isalready followed by the intelligence community, pursuant toExecutive Order 12333. All Department of Defense and componentoperational decisions concerning interdiction of drug smugglersshould be made accordingly. 11. For the purposes of intelligence-gathering missionplanning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be given directionfrom the highest levels of government that the DefenseDepartment's definition of "foreign hostile action" isto be brought into accord with the view expressed in ExecutiveOrder 12333, as described in the preceding recommendation. 12. Consistent with the foregoing definitions of"national security" and "foreign hostileaction," Department of Defense policies and practices, suchas existing interpretations of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. Section1535, and exemptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, 10 U.S.C.Section 371 et al., should be thoroughly re-examined. Unitplanning and deployment should be adjusted accordingly. 13. The Posse Comitatus Act, IS U.S.C. Section 1385, and its1981 exemptions, now found at 10 U.S.C. Section 371 et seq,should be consolidated in Title 18. The consolidated statuteshould include a statement of purpose reflecting the view ofnational security advocated here and promoting an accordinglyexpansive interpretation of the statutory language, subject tosuch limitations as are necessary to protect civil liberties. 14. The Policy Board, in accordance with Executive Orders12333 and 12472, and with applicable National Security DecisionDirectives, if any, should coordinate with appropriate agenciesand departments to ensure that a secure and interoperable,interagency communications capability is available fordrug-related intelligence collection and dissemination in supportof interdiction and other anti-drug activities. The resources andexpertise of the National Security Agency should be fullyexploited to this end, and operational and communicationssecurity should be given a high priority in the training andoperating procedures of all pertinent agencies. Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions 1. Domestic drug law enforcement efforts directed athigh-level trafficking groups should be supplemented by andintegrated with enforcement efforts directed at lower-leveltrafficking groups and street-level drug activity. Unless thenecessary supplementation and integration occur, the enforcementeffort at all levels will be undermined. 2. Although the enforcement efforts of Federal and State andlocal law enforcement agencies cannot and should not becompletely independent, these agencies nevertheless have primaryareas of responsibility. The Federal law enforcement agenciesshould concentrate their efforts on infiltrating and disruptinghigh-level organized crime and other large traffickingorganizations. State and local law enforcement agencies on theother hand should focus their resources on street-level drugactivity and on smaller and geographically-restricted traffickingorganizations. 3. Although Federal, State and local agencies have primaryareas of responsibility, the drug problem is a national one thatrequires extensive and genuine coordination and cooperation amongall agencies. Those in charge of the agencies involved indomestic drug law enforcement must constantly instill In theiragents the need for such coordination and cooperation, especiallywith respect to the exchange of drug intelligence. Jointoperations, such as Operation Pressure Point, the New York DrugEnforcement Task Force, and the Organized Crime Drug EnforcementTask Force Program, have fostered this required spirit ofcooperation and coordination, and they should be undertakenwhenever appropriate, provided that they do not interfere with anagency's primary mission. 4. The sophistication of high-level trafficking groupsrequires an equivalent Federal response. Because of the varietyof investigative techniques used by participating Federalagencies and their unique ability to exploit such tools aselectronic surveillance, the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (RICO), the Continuing Criminal Enterprisestatutory provision (CCE), forfeiture, and currency transactionsreports, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)Program is the Federal mechanism that is best equipped to respondto and disrupt high-level organized crime trafficking groups. Itsoperation should be supported strongly and its scope should beexpanded wherever feasible and desirable. 5. Because the OCDETF Program has been operational for morethan two years, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board shouldconsider whether a lead Task Force agency should be designated.As an alternative, the U.S. attorneys Involved should be givengreater policy authority with respect to the participatingagencies In order to improve still further the coordination thathas been achieved by the consensus-based decision-makingapproach. If the latter approach is taken, the Board must takesteps to ensure uniform policies and priorities are recognized byall United States Attorneys involved. 6. The heads of the agencies participating in the OCDETFProgram must continually and unambiguously reiterate their totalcommitment to the success of the program. One simple way they cando so is to ensure that their agents involved in the Program arenot affected adversely in any way with respect to careeradvancement by their participation therein. 7. The components of Federal domestic law enforcement otherthan the OCDE Task Forces should focus their resources onorganized crime trafficking groups that do not qualify for OCDETFprogram treatment and on other large trafficking organizations,which may or may not be multi-jurisdictional. 8. To eliminate jurisdictional disputes between the Federalagencies involved in domestic law enforcement, to avoidduplication of investigative efforts, and to increase the safetyof drug agents, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board shouldestablish a system whereby agencies would be required to filereports on whom they are investigating. If more than one agencyis investigating the same individual, the agencies involved wouldbe required to negotiate and to determine the best way forproceeding with the investigation, subject to uniform PolicyBoard guidelines. Such a reporting and control system should beincorporated into the "all source intelligence andoperations center" recommended elsewhere in this report. 9. It is an appropriate time to consider whether the missionof the Customs Service with respect to drug trafficking should beexpanded to include intelligence and law enforcement functionsbeyond the borders and ports of entry within this country, whereappropriate, subject to the lead responsibility of the DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA). 10. DEA should determine which chemicals currently used tomanufacture illicit drugs should be subject to reportingrequirements or placed in a Schedule established by theControlled Substances Act. This review should include aconsideration of which drugs are most abused, which have the mostserious consequences, which precursor chemicals are essential tothe production process, and which chemicals could feasibly beregulated. In addition, DEA should identify the resources neededfor the computerization, analysis, and follow-up of reportsconcerning chemicals selected for monitoring. 11. The research and development operations of Federal druglaw enforcement agencies should work closely with their fieldagents to produce the equipment and tools necessary to defeattraffickers. The expertise of the Central Intelligence andNational Security Agencies should be called upon to the fullestextent possible and proper in this regard. 12. Although the drug problem is a national one, its immediateeffects are felt most at State and local levels. To respondeffectively to the drug problem, State and local jurisdictionswill have to increase expenditures for such critical resources asprison facilities, increased manpower, and sophisticatedequipment. 13. States must provide their law enforcement agencies withcertain tools available to their Federal counterparts. ThoseStates, which do not already have such statutes, should considerenacting legislation patterned after the following Federalstatutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984; the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; statutory use and derivativeuse immunity for witnesses; statutory criminal and civilforfeiture provisions; the Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE)statute; Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe StreetsAct of 1968 (electronic surveillance); and the Currency andForeign Transactions Reporting Act. States should consideradopting statewide grand juries in order to improve theirinvestigations of drug trafficking organizations, as well aseliminating accomplice corroboration statutes or rules. Foreign Assistance 1. Because drug trafficking and production are threats of suchmagnitude to the stability of existing democracies, a primarygoal of the United States and its allies should be to enhance thesecurity of drug producing and transshipment regions. 2. As a part of its international responsibilities, theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board should participate in thePresident's annual decision whether to suspend aid to drugproducing or transshipment countries. The Board should examinethe drug control efforts made by each foreign nation and make asuitable recommendation to the President for his ultimatedecision. 3. The willingness of a country to engage in and activelyimplement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance treatiesshould be a primary consideration in the ultimate U.S. policydecision regarding foreign assistance to that country. 4. The Departments of State and Defense should continue theirprograms of economic and security assistance with emphasis onassisting those foreign governments making concerted efforts tocontrol their drug problems. 5. The United States should continue to help producer andtrafficking nations develop prevention and education programsaimed at drug abuse within these countries. Source Country Crop Control 1. In light of restrictions inherent in international cropcontrol efforts, the Board should initiate a thoroughcost/benefit analysis of the entire history of those efforts bythe United States. If justified by such an analysis, theDepartment of State, through its Bureau of InternationalNarcotics Matters (BINM), should initiate or intensify cropcontrol and plant eradication programs selectively andjudiciously in those countries where the political and economicclimates make it probable that crop eradication programs willsucceed. 2. The Department of State should establish and present to thePolicy Board a specific formula for triggering the cut-off offoreign aid provided for in the "Diplomacy AgainstDrugs" amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. 3. Narcotics Assistance Unit positions must be recognized bythe State Department as priority Foreign Service assignments. TheState Department should establish a select group of professionalNarcotics Officers to fill those positions, and should ensurethat those positions are fully integrated into the careeradvancement structure within the Foreign Service. 4. BINM should expand the range of possibilities underconsideration as alternatives to illicit drug cultivation forsource country farmers and include such options as mining,petroleum production, and light industry, where feasible. Reducing Demand for Drugs 1. A thorough review of the current budgetary allotments foranti-drug efforts, now contemplated by the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board, should be placed at the top of theagenda of the Board immediately. If that review indicates thatgreater Federal resources should be devoted to programs to reducedemand, the Board should pursue appropriate action withouthesitation. 2. A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiturefund, derived from drug cases, should be devoted to programs toreduce demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the reviewrecommended above. Funding to reduce demand should include aresponsible contribution to the States for their own programs inthis area. However, any funding directed to the States should bemade contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, andafter a reasonable grace period, as determined by the Board or byCongress, funding should be denied to any State failing thisrequirement. Failure to enact State electronic surveillancemeasures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the proceedsthereof directed to anti-drug programs, should constitute per sefailure. 3. The President should direct the heads of all Federalagencies to formulate immediately clear policy statements, withimplementing guidelines, including suitable drug testingprograms, expressing the utter unacceptability of drug abuse byFederal employees. State and local governments and leaders in theprivate sector should support unequivocally a similar policy thatany and all use of drugs is unacceptable. Government contractsshould not be awarded to companies that fail to implement drugprograms, Including suitable drug testing. No Federal, State, orlocal government funds should go directly or indirectly toprograms that counsel "responsible" drug use or condoneillicit drug use in any way. Laws in certain States which"decriminalized" the possession of marijuana constitutea form of such condonation, and should be reconsidered. 4. States that have not already done so should enact andenforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia. 5. The States should be required to report information abouttheir prevention and treatment programs to the National Instituteon Drug Abuse. With this information, and reports obtained fromprivate programs, NIDA will be better able to identify the bestprevention and treatment programs and to develop and disseminatestandards and guidelines for such programs to the States. TheStates should, in turn, provide this information to all groupsengaged in prevention, treatment, and related research. 6. Consistent with identified measures of success, Stategovernments should establish credentialing standards forprevention and treatment programs. They should further requirethat all elementary, junior high, and high schools within theState Include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,designed in a manner consistent with such credentialingstandards. State funding should be made available to assure theproper training of educators assigned to such programs. 7. Every employer, public and private, and public educationinstitutions at all levels should have clearly-stated policiesprohibiting drug use, possession of drugs, or being under theinfluence of drugs on their premises. The consequences ofviolating these prohibitions should be clearly explained. 8. Government and private sector employers who do not alreadyrequire drug testing of job applicants and current employeesshould consider the appropriateness of such a testing program. 9. State and local law enforcement authorities should enforcemore vigorously the laws prohibiting possession of drugs, andState legislatures should ensure that enforcement agencies havethe necessary resources to do so. Such resources can be funded inlarge part, if not entirely, through effective asset forfeitureprograms. 10. Uniform and rational sentencing for drug offenses isessential. Such a system should provide a sentence of probationand a fine for a first offense involving mere possession ofdrugs. The terms of probation should include a requirement toremain drug-free to be verified, if necessary, through periodicdrug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs shouldresult in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment or fines or allthree. 11. The media and entertainment industries should carefullyreview their portrayals of drug use and its consequences andensure their accuracy. 12. Health professionals should be thoroughly trained toidentify and counsel drug abusers. 13. Relying on the task force approach which law enforcementofficials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,civic organizations and business associations should formcommunity task forces to provide a unified front against drugs. Conclusion The recommendations made here have not been reachedcarelessly. They are the result of months of concerted researchand analysis, documented in the body of the report. Although somerecommendations reach to the most fundamental levels ofgovernment agency operation and community life, they have beenpresented only after consideration of every identifiable option. The depth of concern expressed in this report is not theresult of any preordained strategy. Rather, it reflects thisCommission's recognition, based on objective evidence, that weare confronted with a national crisis. Every course of action,including a failure to act at all, has a natural consequence. Therecommendations made here are those actions deemed most effectivein promoting a national campaign against drugs at all levels ofsociety.
