ETL's Ocean Remote Sensing Division works with the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy to see if Cold War air-defense radar systems can be adapted to remotely monitor ocean-surface winds and currents over data-sparse ocean areas that would otherwise require thousands of widely dispersed in-situ instruments. This page shows some results of our tests. Contents How does over-the-horizon radar work? What ocean properties can OTH radar measure? How far can OTH radars see? Synoptic and mesoanalysis over the tropical Atlantic Can OTH radars track tropical storms and hurricanes? Tracking Hurricane Claudette Surface currents in the Florida Straits Surface currents in the Western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico The first dual-OTH-radar surface current map! Can OTH radar data be merged with satellite data? What OTH radar data are available now? Other applications of OTH radar How does over-the-horizon radar work? Over-the-horizon (OTH) radars were developed to detect military targets far beyond the optical horizon. They use 5-28-MHz radio waves, which reflect from the ionosphere, reaching up to 3,500 km in one "hop." Properties of the ocean surface are extracted from the minute amount of energy scattered by the sea surface back to the radar. To find out how we extract ocean-surface properties from what the military discards as "sea clutter," see our THEORY PAGE. What ocean properties can OTH radar measure? In order of increasing difficulty, Surface wind (Bragg-resonant wave) direction Radial surface currents Sea state (eg., rms wave height) Surface wind speed Dominant wave period Dominant wave direction Non-directional (scalar) ocean wave spectrum Combined swell and wind-wave spectrum How far can OTH radars see? Using one ionospheric reflection, an OTH radar normally covers the range interval between about 500 and 3,500 km. This experimental surface wind-direction map, which covers about 40-million square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean, was made in about three hours with the three Air Force OTH-B radars on the California-Oregon border. Only direction is indicated here; wind speed was not measured. Mesoscale structure of surface cyclones, anticyclones, and fronts is clearly resolved. Synoptic and mesoanalysis over the tropical Atlantic NOAA adapted the Air Force OTH-B radars in Maine to map surface wind streamlines in the hurricane breeding grounds of the tropical Atlantic. Tropical waves crossing the Atlantic can be seen in detail not available with any other sensor. Under favorable conditions, such waves develop into tropical storms and hurricanes. Working with NOAA's Hurricane Research Division, we provided these experimental maps to the National Hurricane Center for 40 days during the 1994 hurricane season. Take a look at a 19-day MOVIE LOOP of OTH-B streamline maps. (192K GIF) This is not a model -- it's real data! See Young et al. [1996] Can OTH radars track tropical storms and hurricanes? This surface wind direction map was made in less than one hour with the Air Force OTH-B radar in Maine, just as Hurricane Andrew was heading toward its devastating encounter with the South Florida coast. 1996 ROTHR Surface Wind and Current Maps of Hurricane Hortense. Tracking Hurricane Claudette The OTH-B radar in Maine captured five images of the surface wind-direction pattern associated with 1993 Hurricane Claudette, which just missed Bermuda. Eye locations derived from these radar images are compared here with the official National Hurricane Center track for the storm. See [Georges and Harlan, 1993] for more details. Surface currents in the Florida Straits This map of the radial component of ocean surface currents was made using the U.S. Navy Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) to the north in Virginia. Currents flowing toward the radar (that is, nearly northward) are colored red and orange. Currents flowing away from the radar are colored green and blue. Surface currents in the Western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico This map of radial currents made by the Texas ROTHR (to the northwest) shows details of the Atlantic Western Boundary Current as it flows through the Yucatan Passage, makes a 180-deg turn in the Gulf of Mexico (the Loop Current) and flows eastward into the Florida Straits. Bifurcations and eddies in the western Caribbean reveal the influence of bottom topography. The first dual-OTH-radar surface current map! This test, performed by simultaneously illuminating the Florida Straits with both the U.S. Navy ROTHR radars in Texas and Virginia, reveals the structure of the Florida Current, and ancilliary flows, with 10-km resolution [Georges et al., 1996] Can OTH radar data be merged with satellite data? The color strips show 24 hours of ERS-1 scatterometer coverage over the North Atlantic. Wind speed is color coded, with orange indicating highest speeds. The OTH-B wind directions for the same day are superimposed, filling in the gaps in the satellite data [Georges et al., 1996]. Data merged by Paul Chang at NESDIS. What OTH radar data are available now? NOAA's tests with the Air Force and Navy radars have so far been for research and demonstration purposes only. Therefore, only archival data are available. The Air Force has deactivated its OTH-B system and now maintains the six East Coast and West Coast OTH-B radars in a state called �warm storage,� which preserves the physical and electrical integrity of the system and permits recall, should a need arise. The incremental cost of operating the East Coast OTH-B system for environmental research and services is about $1.0M to $1.5M per year [Georges, 1995]. The environmental monitoring aspects of the system are unclassified. Similar coverage in the eastern Pacific could be obtained at about the same cost. The two U.S. Navy ROTHRs are presently in full-time military service, but occasional brief environmental-monitoring tests are permitted. See 1996 ROTHR current maps. Other OTH radars in France, Australia, and Russia could be adapted to environmental monitoring.

An HF radar system that maps surface currents was conceived and developed in this laboratory 20 years ago. It was known as CODAR (Coastal Ocean Dynamics Applications Radar). By 1984, the Codar Transition Engineering Program, supported by the NOAA National Ocean Service, had resulted in a commercial product. Descendents of that system are now on the market that have been tested in many different coastal settings. Although reliable current maps can be produced under certain conditions, tests have shown that these radars' performance can be degraded by obstacles in their field of view and in the vicinity of the radar antennas. Therefore, questions remain that undermine confidence in all HF current-mapping radars and stand in the way of their operational acceptance. We have undertaken a new program to re-evaluate this technology and to establish guidelines by which confidence in their measurements can be assessed in practice. Specifically: Under what conditions can we expect a surface-wave radar to produce reliable current maps? What specific precautions must be taken during radar deployment and operation to ensure reliable current measurements? What quality controls can be built into radar-derived currents? How reliable are measurements made with a compact antenna compared with those obtained using a real aperture array? What are the barriers to operational use of such systems by NOAA and others? How does an HF Current-Mapping Radar Work? Two shore-based radars, spaced about 30 km apart, illuminate a common ocean surface area using line-of-sight and groundwave propagation. Typical frequencies used are 12 and 25 MHz. Each radar measures the Doppler shift of echoes from Bragg-resonant ocean waves, typically 6-m long (see illustration). Surface currents that transport the waves impose an extra Doppler shift that is proportional to the radial current component. By combining the information from two radars, current vectors can be mapped with nominal 1-km resolution over coastal areas of a thousand square kilometers or more. The current map shown here was acquired during the Coastal Ocean Probing Experiment (COPE) off the Oregon coast.

Yet, deep-ocean currents and temperature structure affect not only long-term global and regional climate, but also interannual weather patterns and the distribution of nutrients upon which all marine life depends. NOAA's job is to understand and forecast these influences. Because the ocean is practically opaque to all electromagnetic waves, the job of remotely probing the vast ocean interior falls upon the science of acoustic oceanography. Why sound? Two properties of sound transmission in water make it especially suitable for remotely sensing the ocean interior. First, variations with time of the speed of sound in water (which is five times faster than in air) depend mainly on the water's temperature. Second, the ocean's sound channel conducts low-frequency sound over global distances. The Challenge: Acoustic oceanography has been issued an urgent challenge - to find out if there is any long-term trend in deep-ocean temperatures that might be traced to a human-induced greenhouse effect. The moderating effect of the oceans on global warming is a critical uncertainty in our understanding of how the climate machine works. A program called Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) is now carrying out long-range acoustic measurements in the ocean to learn more. ETL's Ocean Remote Sensing Division addresses some of the theoretical problems that must be solved before these and other acoustic measurements in the ocean can be correctly interpreted. Monitoring Heat Flux Through the Fram Strait Greenhouse warming in the Arctic is expected to be 3 to 4 times that at lower latitudes. ATOC-ARCTIC is a program to monitor acoustically the net heat flow between the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait, between Greenland and Spitzbergen. Containing currents that flow both into and out of the Arctic Ocean, the Strait is a crucial region to monitor for the effects of climate change. A monitoring scheme is being designed that will transmit low-frequency acoustic signals across the Strait to measure the average temperature, and acoustic scintillation techniques will measure transverse current. Propagation modeling, already underway, shows the acoustic environment to be very complex with strong mode coupling. A vertical parametric array will be required to obtain fine depth resolution. For further information, contact Prof. Konstantin Naugolnykh at knaugolnykh@etl.noaa.gov Propagation Modeling Using Three-Dimensional Ray Tracing We have developed a general-purpose ray-tracing computer program, called HARPO. Under conditions where ray theory is valid, it can simulate underwater acoustic propagation, including the computation of acoustic travel time, for model oceans whose temperature and currents vary in three dimensions. This FORTRAN program for several platforms, including PCs, is described by Jones et al. and can be downloaded from our FTP site. Ocean Acoustic Tomography Inversion Ocean acoustic tomography is a method for estimating the temperature and current structure inside a volume of ocean by measuring acoustic travel times along various paths through the volume. There are several mathematical methods for "inverting" the travel-time measurements to obtain interior structure. Some assume a "background" structure and use the measurements to determine deviations from the assumed background. These inversion methods are called "perturbative," and their results are sometimes sensitive to details of the assumed background model. One inversion method developed in ETL is "nonperturbative," that is, it does not assume a background structure. The technique, based on Abel transforms, is described by Jones et al. The inversion program can be downloaded from our FTP site.

For example, inferringnear-surface wind speed and direction from microwave radars and radiometersrequires understanding how the surface roughness is affected by the localenvironment, particularly by windspeed and air-sea temperature difference.One effective method for studying surface roughness is by measuring thespatial and temporal variations of glint patterns (light specularly reflectedfrom the surface). To remove ambiguities that arise with natural lightsources, we use lasers to produce the glints. How does it work? Specular reflectionsfrom a light source in a known position tell us the slope of a small pieceof the ocean surface. By recording the angular positions of glints as wescan a narrow laser beam over the surface, we can map out the slope distributionfor a region of ocean surface. Doing this for many scans produces surface-slopestatistics. Similarly, images of a surface region illuminated by a broadlaser beam tell us how the slopes are distributed. Two-dimensional slopestatistics can be obtained by averaging many sequential images. Glint Measurements at Sea We tested two prototypelaser-glint instruments for three weeks in September 1995 on the ScrippsInstitution of Oceanography's FLoating Instrument Platform (FLIP).The FLIP was moored approximately 20 km west of Tillamook, Oregonduring this time, as part of the Coastal Ocean Probing Experiment (COPE).Laser-glint data were collected along with long-wave height, wind speed,air-sea temperature differences, and other meteorological and oceanographicparameters. In thisphoto, the laser-glint instrument package is the black box suspended fromthe boom on the starboard side of the FLIP. For details, see the instrumentpage or the data page.

Gases and clouds in theatmosphere, the ocean, and nearly everything else around us emits infraredradiation. Infrared radiometers are passive sensors that emit noenergy of their own, but instead measure the "brightness" ofthe naturally occurring infrared radiation in the environment. Spectral,angular, or other variations in this brightness can then be used to tell usthe amount of atmospheric constituents, the physical properties of clouds, or the roughness of the ocean surface. How does Infrared Radiometry work? All objects at temperatures above absolute zero radiateenergy because of molecular and atomic motion. The brightness of such "blackbodyradiation" depends on temperature and electromagnetic wavelength.As temperature increases, blackbody radiation moves to shorter wavelengths.For example, at 300 K (roughly room temperature) an object radiates maximumenergy at a wavelength of 10 µm, whereas at 6000 K (such as oursun) an object radiates maximum energy at a wavelength near 0.5 µm.Therefore, an infrared radiometer operating at wavelengths near 10 µmis good for measuring the "brightness temperature" of typicalterrestrial objects. The brightness temperature is equal to the physicaltemperature for a perfect blackbody (an object with 100% absorption), butis less than the physical temperature for an object with lower absorption. Infrared Spectro-Radiometry Wehave developed a multi-channel spectro-radiometer for measuring spectraof atmospheric emission. This instrument is based on a commercial FourierTransform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer. It measures emission over the frequencyrange of approximately 500 cm-1 (20-µm wavelength) to2000 cm-1 (5-µm wavelength) in steps of 1 cm-1.We are using these emission spectra to improve radiative transfer models,to quantify the effect of water vapor on climate, and to investigate theradiative properties of clouds. Our measurements recently resulted in creation of a new model (CKD_2.1) for the water vapor continuum in the atmospheric transmission window near 10 microns. The new model was created by Dr. S.A. Clough of AER, Inc. The improvement made by this model is equivalent to the radiative effect of doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Many atmospheric radiative transfer codes, including Lowtran/Modtran, Fascode, and LBLRTM, now use the new continuum model. You can find out more about the FTIR instrument and the FTIR data. Single-Band Infrared Radiometry Wealso use commercial radiometers that measure the radiance integrated overa particular spectral band. Typically, these radiometers have a filterthat limits the spectral band to some portion of the 8-12 µm "window,"where the atmospheric emission is relatively low. Such radiometers areuseful for measuring the brightness temperature of the atmosphere, of clouds,or of the ocean surface. We are experimenting with using these radiometersto measure the polarization of emissions from a rough ocean surface, which might be useful for measuring sea-surface roughness orfor determining wind speed and direction.

Active sensors send out a beam of acoustic or electromagnetic energy and measure how the medium perturbs it. Passive sensors emit no energy of their own. By listening at microwave frequencies, it is possible to measure the roughness of the ocean surface or moisture content of the atmosphere. Ground-based, airborne, and space-based microwave radiometers are used in climate and atmospheric modification studies, cloud physics, and ocean-surface sensing. How does Atmospheric Radiometry work? Atmospheric radiometers measure the emissions of the atmosphere itself. For example, a microwave antenna pointed into the air receives an abundance of thermal radio emissions from the atmosphere's various constituents. Each constituent possesses a unique emission spectrum that corresponds exactly to its absorption spectrum. Radiometers "listen" at frequencies selected to best sort the constituents out. Measuring Integrated Water Content By monitoring microwave emissions from the zenith at 23 and 31 GHz, it is possible to measure both the total water-vapor content and the liquid-water content of a vertical atmospheric column. Because the 23-GHz channel is near a water-vapor emission line, the vapor emission is about twice as strong as for liquid water. At 31 GHz, on the other hand, the ratio is roughly inverted. Thus, a dual-frequency radiometer provides the information required to solve two equations for the two unknown quantities. An airborne two-channel microwave radiometer This instrument, operating at 23.87 and 31.65 GHz, was designed at ETL to provide a detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of cloud liquid forresearch in meteorological areas such as cloud physics, climatology, severe storms,and aircraft icing. A modified antenna system permits measurements of microwave radiance over ocean and land. The instrument can look upward, downward, or cycle between upward and downward. The system has been designed to operate oneither the NOAA P-3 or the King Air aircraft, shown here. For more information, contact Leonard Fedor, lfedor@etl.noaa.gov How does Ocean-Surface Radiometry work? The brightness temperature of the ocean surface at microwave frequencies is observed to increase with ocean-surface roughness. Empirical calibration of microwave emissivity permits estimates of ocean-surface wind speed, within certain limits. The Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) on the DMSP military satellites uses this principle to map ocean surface wind speeds globally. Recent polarimetric and multi-look tests with airborne radiometers at various angles of incidence on the ocean surface show promise for determining surface-wind direction, as well.

Since the required number of in-situ instruments would be impossibly expensive to deploy and maintain, remote sensors that could do the job from satellites are being developed. Prototype passive (radiometric) and active (radar) ocean sensors have already been placed in orbit by several nations. However, preliminary results from these instruments reveal gaps in our understanding, both of the detailed structure and dynamics of the ocean surface itself, and the physics of how electromagnetic waves interact with it. Because the desired sea-surface properties cannot be measured directly by radars, and because the scattering of radar signals is determined almost entirely by sea-surface roughness, the first problem is to find out what statistical properties of sea-surface roughness are most closely related to wind and fluxes. This problem lies in the realm of hydrodynamics, and is under study in another related ETL project. The second problem is to find out how these statistical properties of the sea surface can be extracted from backscattered radar echoes. Before this inverse problem can be solved, however, the direct problem (what is the scattering from a sea-like surface?) must first be well in hand. What is the Direct Scattering Problem? The main reason this problem has not yet been satisfactorily solved is the very complex nature of the sea-surface roughness. The short, centimeter-scale waves that are responsible for backscattering microwave radar signals are superimposed on a continuum of longer waves, ranging in scale from tens of centimeters to hundreds of meters, which travel in various directions. Even numerical solutions of this statistical problem in three dimensions are beyond the abilities of today's computers. To simplify the problem, "two-scale" or composite-surface models have been tried. This approach combines two "classical" methods of wave-propagation theory: the method of small perturbations and the semi-classical approximation. However, in addition to lacking the necessary accuracy for quantitative predictions, this method uses a somewhat arbitrary scale-dividing parameter that makes the solution of the inverse problem ambiguous. Many important characteristics of scattering, such as polarization, angle, and dependence of cross sections on wind speed, cannot be accounted for over realistic ranges of parameter values. A more accurate theory is required that is free of fitting parameters. For a long time, no solutions to this problem were known. During the last decade, a number of new "unified" theories were advanced, in particular by D. Winebrenner and A. Ishimaru (the "phase perturbation approach"), M. Milder ("operator expansion"), E. Bahar ("full-wave approach"), and A. Fung and K. Chen ("integral equation model"). Numerical simulations have shown that these approaches extend the utility of "classical" methods significantly. However, validity regimes of these approaches are not always clear, and their applicability to real sea roughness is not well established. What have we done? The method developed at ETL uses surface slope as a small parameter. (Sea roughness slopes usually do not exceed 0.1-0.2.) A. Voronovich uses the "small-slope approximation," and V. Tatarskii uses the "quasi-slope expansion." The small-slope approximation was recently generalized to incorporate the case of multiple reflections ("non-local small-slope approximation"). The quasi-slope expansion was developed by V. Tatarskii and M. Charnotskii in "tilt-invariant" form, which is not restricted to small slopes and is associated instead with small roughness curvatures. Present research areas These methods now have to be applied to realistic models of the sea surface, i.e., ones that are expressed in terms of a wave directional spectrum. The problem here is that the "unified" models require subtle statistical characteristics of the sea waves that are not easily calculated for non-Gaussian height distributions. Now, a statistical model of sea surface roughness is being developed by V. I. Tatarskii and V. V. Tatarskii, which will permit calculation of the required statistical functions from empirical information about sea-wave spectra. This model is being tested in numerical simulations. We are also working on the problem of scattering at small grazing angles of incidence, which is important practically but difficult to treat theoretically. Present models disagree greatly with observations, possibly because diffraction by long ocean waves is being ignored. Preliminary calculations suggest that such effects may be important for grazing angles less than about 20 deg.

The Plan will be prepared by an international team of 15 invited scientists headed by Ola Johannessen and Konstantin Naugolnykh. Anyone interested in a copy of the completed plan should contact Dr. Naugolnykh at knaugolnykh@etl.noaa.gov. August 29, 1996 Scientists from ETL's Ocean Remote Sensing Division and the Radar Meteorology and Oceanography Division will participate an experiment to measure the radiative properties of water vapor and to compare several state of the art remote-sensing instruments that measure water vapor. This campaign is sponsored by the Department of Energy and will be conducted at their facilities near Lamont, Oklahoma, from September 10 - 30, 1996. ETL instruments involved in the experiment are three Water Vapor Radiometers and a scanning temperature-profiling radiometer. - Contact: Ed Westwater August 29, 1996 Scientists from ETL's Ocean Remote Sensing Division will participate in the Labrador Sea Experiment in January, 1997. This experiment was organized by the Office of Naval Research and will focus on the response of microwave polarimetric radiometers to high sea conditions during high winds. ETL's 37 GHz polarimeter will be flown on the NASA P3 as a part of this experiment. Other participants in this experiment include scientists from Georgia Institute of Technology, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the University of Massachusetts. - Contact: Leonard Fedor June 12, 1996 Dr. Konstantin Naugolnykh was elected a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America at the Saint LouisMeeting in November of 1995 for contributions to nonlinear acoustics. Dr. Naugolnykh is with the Universityof Colorado CIRES program working with NOAA/ERL/ETL. May 1, 1996 Scientists from the Ocean Remote Sensing Division are participating in the Combined Sensor Program (CSP) cruise out of Samoa. This cruise, brought together for the first time a complete suite of ship-borne remote sensing systems in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The purpose of this cruise is to study air-sea interaction and the radiative properties of the tropical atmosphere. The cruise occurred during March and April, 1996 aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Discoverer. Scientists from NOAA/ETL were joined in Pago Pago, American Samoa by scientists from numerous national labs and universities to set up instruments on the ship. The cruise followed a route from American Samoa, NW to 2 South, W to Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, and back to Honolulu, Hawaii. A concentrated period of data collection occurred in the vicinity of Manus Island, for intercomparison with island-based instruments at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site. The objective of the comparison is to determine the effects, if any, of the island on radiation measurements.

The main contribution to sea clutter is Bragg-resonant scattering by surface gravity waves. For example, a 20-MHz radar sees only the 7.5-m-long ocean waves that travel exactly toward and away from the radar. The spectrum of the sea echo at HF exhibits a surprisingly simple structure: two sharp Doppler-shifted lines, one positively shifted echo from the Bragg-resonant waves traveling toward the radar, and a negatively shifted line from those receding from the radar. The exact shifts and relative magnitudes of these lines permit us to extract information about surface winds and currents. How is surface wind direction determined? Directional wind-wave energy is known to fall off monotonically with the angle from the wind direction, so that significant wave energy travels at large angles with the wind, even nearly upwind. OTH radar samples this directional spreading pattern at two angles 180 deg. apart. These examples show the Bragg-line ratio resulting from winds blowing along and transverse to a radar radial. Other directions produce intermediate ratios, permitting extraction of the direction, although with a left-right ambiguity with respect to the radar radial. How are surface currents measured? Radially traveling gravity waves Doppler-shift the backscattered radar energy by an amount proportional to their phase velocity. If surface currents transport the gravity waves, an extra Doppler shift is added that is proportional to the radial component of the surface current. OTH radars have to use special processing to remove biases in its current estimates that are caused by ionospheric motions. See our publications for more details.

Background The U.S. Air Force's over-the-horizon-backscatter (OTH-B) air defense radar system is by several criteria the largest radar system in the world. It was developed over the last 25 years at a cost of $1.5 billion to warn against Soviet bomber attacks when the planes were still thousands of miles from U.S. air space. Six one-million-watt OTH radars see far beyond the range of conventional microwave radars by bouncing their 5-28-MHz waves off the ionosphere, an ionized layer about 200 km above the earth. With the end of the Cold War, just months after their deployment, the three OTH radars on the West Coast were mothballed, but the three radars in Maine were redirected to counter-narcotics surveillance. In 1991, NOAA recognized the vast potential of these military relics of thecold war for environmental monitoring and asked the Air Force's permission to lookat the part of the radar echo that the Air Force throws away -- the ocean clutter. NOAA's tests showed that this clutter can be processed to extract ocean surface wind direction over huge, data-sparse ocean areas -- vital information that affects climate and the ocean's circulation. Tropical storms and hurricanes were tracked, and a system for delivering radar-derived winds to the National Hurricane Center was developed. The combined coverage of the six OTH-B radars is about 90 million square kilometers of open ocean where few weather instruments exist. Recent tests have also demonstrated OTH radars ability to map ocean currents. Whereas OTH radars map surface wind directions on demand over large, fixed ocean areas, active and passive microwave instruments on board several polar-orbiting satellites measure wind speeds along narrow swaths determinedby their orbital geometries. Satellites, however, do not measure winddirections very well. The capabilities of ground-based and satellite-based ocean-wind sensors thus obviously complement each other. The two products have been merged for the first time here. Our experimental online data sets are the products of ongoing tests of OTH radar's enviromental monitoring capabilities. They are provided, with the usual caveats, for use by the research community and for evaluation by operational weather forecasters. The cost of converting the OTH-B radars to this kind of ocean-monitoring service is less than 1% of their cost. For more information, see the following papers: Georges, T.M. and J.A.

To perform ICSI, the wife undergoes a normal IVF (invitro fertilization) cycle. However, when it is time tofertilize the eggs, instead of placing them in a petri dishwith the husband's semen and waiting for them to fertilize, aspecial technique is followed: A single sperm is drawn from the semen specimen into avery thin-tipped pipette, and the tip of the pipette is theninserted into the egg. The sperm is then released directlyinto the egg. Each egg harvested from the wife can be fertilized inthis manner, and thus several embryos can be returned to theuterus, increasing the chances of pregnancy. Return to home page .

This is a highly successfultreatment option, as it involves treating a wife - who, inmany cases has no fertility problems - with a donor who hasbeen tested and found to be of optimum fertilitypotential. Couples choose this option in a number of circumstances:when the husband is found to have a very low sperm count butthe couple does not wish to undergo the more involved routeof in vitro fertilization; when the husband has undergonevasectomy and has been advised -or chooses - not to attemptreversal; or when the husband is a carrier of a geneticcondition which makes conception of a biological childinadvisable. At the Fertility Institute of Boca Raton, the couple canchoose a donor from lists that provide full descriptions ofthe donor. Complete medical histories are also available. Wework only with well-established, highly reputable nationalsperm banks where the donors undergo strict testing. After deciding to schedule artificial insemination, thewife undergoes a basic fertility evaluation. The couple thenchooses a donor and orders their specimens. The wife monitorsher monthly cycle to pinpoint the time of ovulation, and isinseminated here in our office. (It is a simple process, notmuch different than having a pap smear). If pregnancy is notestablished on the first attempt, the process can berepeated. Donor insemination is done in full confidentiality.Neither the donor nor the sperm bank know the identity of thecouple, and the couple will never know the identity of thedonor. The decision of whether or not to tell the child howhe/she was conceived is a personal one, and resources areavailable to help the couple make this importantdecision. DONOR EGG IVF Couples choose donor egg IVF when the wife is unable toproduce eggs of her own; for example, if she has had herovaries removed surgically, has experienced prematuremenopause, or simply has reached a point in her reproductivelife when her ovaries are no longer producing viable eggs.Occasionally, a couple may also choose this route because ofa genetic condition which makes it inadvisable to use thewife's eggs. The donor can be anonymous or may be a relative of thewife. The Fertility Institute of Boca Raton's anonymousdonors are women who have completed their families and wishto donate eggs as an act of kindness. They are reimbursedonly for the time they devote to the process. We carefullyscreen them medically and psychologically, and the couple isprovided with a complete description of the donor. After the couple undergoes a brief screening and testingprocess and is matched with a donor, the donor's eggs arefertilized in our laboratory with semen provided by therecipient husband, and the resulting embryos are transferredto the recipient wife's uterus. Two weeks later, a pregnancytest is done to determine whether or not pregnancy has beenestablished. Because only donors with proven fertility are chosen,studies have found that pregnancy rates are even higher withdonor egg IVF than with conventional IVF. Return to home page .

Gymnema sylvestre is a woody, vine-like plant which climbson bushes and trees. The medicinally active parts of the plant are the leavesand the roots. It came to be known as "destroyer of sugar" because,in ancient times, Ayurvedic physicians observed that chewing a few leavesof Gymnema sylvestre suppressed the taste of sugar. That is, sweet foodsno longer tasted sweet, but rather became almost completely tasteless. Inlater generations, clinical tests showed that regular use over a periodof three to four months helped to reduce glycosuria, or the appearance ofcarbohydrates in urine. Recent clinical trials conducted in India have shownthat an extract of Gymnema sylvestre is useful in both insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in certain specific types of non-insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus (NIDDM). As a result of these clinical tests and years of successful treatments,Gymnema sylvestre is used today for treating diabetes mellitus. In reducingthe symptom of glycosuria, the dried leaves are used in daily doses of threeto four grams for a period of three months or more. Studies conducted in India as early as 1930 showed that the leaves of Gymnemasylvestre cause hypoglycemia in experimental animals. This state of hypoglycemiais explained on the assumption that the drug indirectly stimulates the insulinsecretion of the pancreas, since it has no direct effect on the carbohydratemetabolism. How Gymnema sylvestre Works Recent pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that Gymnema sylvestreacts on two sites: First, the taste buds in the oral cavity; Second, the absorptive surface to the intestines. The structure of those taste buds which detect sugar in the mouth is similarto the structure of the tissue that absorbs sugar in the intestine. Theimportant active ingredient of Gymnema sylvestre is an organic acid called"gymnemic acid." The gymnemic acid is made up of molecules whoseatom arrangement is similar to that of glucose molecules. Those moleculesfill the receptor locations on the taste buds for a period of one to twohours, thereby preventing the taste buds from being activated by any sugarmolecules present in the food. Similarly, the glucose-like molecules inthe gymnemic acid fill the receptor locations in the absorptive externallayers of the intestine, thereby preventing the intestine from absorbingthe sugar molecules. It has also been noted that Gymnema sylvestre takes away the bitter tasteof bitter substances, such as quinine, in much the same way that it affectsthe sense of sweetness associated with candies and other sweet foods. However,it has no effect on pungent, salty, astringent or acidic tastes. Therefore,if you are eating an orange within two hours after chewing Gymnema sylvestreleaves, for instance, you would taste the sourness of it but not the sweetness. Practical Uses The benefits of Gymnema sylvestre are two-fold: 1 ) By suppressing the taste of sweet foods, the desire to eatthem is also suppressed. Picture a luscious-looking large piece of chocolatecandy, which you know, despite the tempting look, is not sweet. Why botherto eat it? It is important to remember that this effect of Gymnema sylvestre'swill last for only one to two hours. If you are using the herb to breakthe sugar habit, then it would be wise to take some Gymnema sylvestre beforesocial events or other times when you might be tempted to dive into thetray of sweets. 2 ) Gymnema sylvestre significantly reduces the metabolic effectsof sugar by preventing the intestines from absorbing the sugar moleculesduring the process of digestion. Because there is a change in the absorptionof sugar, there is a consequent change in the blood sugar level. Types of Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by a deficiency in the productionof insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. There are two types of diabetes,Type I and Type II. Type I diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood andinvolves such a severe depletion of insulin that it must be taken by injectioneveryday. Type II diabetes is usually diagnosed in adulthood, and most oftencan be managed with diet and oral medication rather than insulin injections. Symptoms of diabetes include increased frequency of urination, increasedand often extreme thirst, increased appetite, weight loss, irritability,and fatigue. Excessive bedwetting is a classic sign of diabetes. These symptomsusually appear over a period of about three weeks. Short-term complications of diabetes include episodes of both very low andvery high blood sugar. Diabetes can also lead to long-term complications. These include changesin vision, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and nerve problems. Carefultreatment of diabetes, conscientious compliance with treatment, and regulardoctor appointments can help prevent complications from development. Treatment of Diabetes with Gymnema sylvestre Trials under experimental and clinical conditions have shown significantresults in the treatment of diabetes with Gymnema Sylvestre. Remarkably,unlike insulin or oral hypoglycemic suphonylurea compounds, the hypoglycemiceffects of Gymnema sylvestre are seen in only a small percentage of thediabetic patients. For most people, blood sugar lowers to normal levels;it does not lower to a point below normal blood sugar levels. This can happenin a small number of patients, however, because the mechanisms of the diabeticsyndrome vary with different patients. In recent years IDDM has been observedto have entirely different pathophysiology and clinical course from NIDDM.The studies have suggested that Gymnema sylvestre may be useful in certainspecific types of NIDDM, in addition to its general usefulness in IDDM. The safety of Gymnema sylvestre has been demonstrated by the fact that ithas been safely and successfully used for more than 2,000 years in traditionalAyurvedic medicine. Other Uses of Gymnema sylvestre Snakebite is treated by dusting the wound with powdered root, or applyinga paste of the root powder to the wound. Fever is treated with an oral administration of half an ounce to anounce (1 part in 10) of leaves. Swollen glands are treated with an external application of trituratedleaves mixed with castor oil. Examining Label Claims Today, the active ingredients are extracted and produced in capsules andtablets and available worldwide. This is a very welcome circumstance, but,like all herbal products on the shelf, there is a variety of potencies amongthe different brands. Unfortunately, there are some ambiguities in the productnomenclature. Some products are said to contain 85 percent gymnemic acid,but the "85 percent" refers to the extraction efficacy, and notthe percentage of gymnemic acids. In fact, in all Gymnema sylvestre extracts,gymnemic acid occurs in crude form along with other constituents. Therefore,it is recommended to take in tea form forbest results. Conclusion By virtue of its non-toxic nature and sweetness-suppression activity, Gymnemasylvestre can play a significant role in the treatment of various conditionscaused by excessive sugar intake. More commonly seen conditions are diabetes,obesity, hypoglycemia. The combination of Gymnema sylvestre with other drugsand therapies can make the treatment more effective. This combining, andall herbal treatments for conditions such as diabetes, should be done withthe advice and consultation of a holistic physician. As discussed, thereis a variety of strengths and qualities among Gymnema sylvestre productson the shelves. Since it works the same way on sweet taste sensors as itdoes in the intestine, you should be able to detect the difference betweeneffective and ineffective Gymnema sylvestre by its effect on sweet taste.

Rosen and Harold A. Rosen, announced today the first successful road test of its experimental hybrid-electric powertrain for automobiles. This historic road test makes Rosen Motors the only company to have demonstrated the viability of using a flywheel-turbine combination to power an electric automobile. The Rosen TurboFlywheel (RTF) powertrain has the potential to simultaneously provide unusually long range, nearly zero emissions and sports car-like acceleration, a combination of characteristics that neither the internal combustion engine nor a battery-powered electric drivetrain can offer. “To us, this demonstration is akin to the first flight of a jet aircraft: proof that our technology works and the first major step to building a superior mode of transportation,” said Dr. Harold Rosen, president and chief executive officer of Rosen Motors. “This is a milestone in automotive history,” said Benjamin M. Rosen, chairman of Rosen Motors. “Our hybrid-electric powertrain, in contrast to some other hybrid-electric concepts under investigation by automobile manufacturers, is not simply a ‘range extender’ for a battery-powered vehicle. Instead, it is an innovative system that will also sharply cut fossil fuel consumption and measurably improve the performance of the 21st century automobile.” The dramatic road test was performed on Sunday, Jan. 5 at the Willow Springs racetrack in the Mojave Desert near Edwards Air Force Base. For the initial proof-of-concept, Rosen Motors tested the RTF powertrain in a converted 1993 Saturn vehicle. The powertrain consists of four major elements: a turbogenerator, a flywheel motor-generator, an electric drive motor and an electronic control system. The turbogenerator, which uses unleaded gasoline as its fuel, produces cruising power for the vehicle. The flywheel, via its motor-generator, supplies surge power for acceleration and recovers power from regenerative braking for later reuse. The electronic controller provides the “brains” and the power switching for the system. Development efforts are continuing at Rosen Motors to improve the design and characteristics of the RTF powertrain. Road testing of a more advanced design of the RTF powertrain, to be housed in a luxury sports sedan, is expected to begin in late 1997. Future Rosen-powered cars, depending on their weight and aerodynamic characteristics, are expected to obtain more than double the gasoline mileage of today’s cars and to provide vehicle acceleration from zero to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. In addition, future versions of Rosen-powered automobiles are projected to produce tailpipe emissions that are no greater than those caused by the emissions due to recharging battery-powered vehicles from fossil-fueled power plants. Benjamin M. Rosen and his brother, Dr. Harold A. Rosen, started Rosen Motors after each had many years of success in technology venture capital and communications engineering, respectively. Ben Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer and co-founder of Sevin Rosen Funds, a venture capital firm, was listed by Computerworld magazine in 1992 as one of 25 people in the computer industry who “changed the world.” Harold Rosen, a pioneer in communications technology, is recognized as the father of the geostationary communications satellite, the world’s first practical commercial communications satellite. He has won numerous prestigious engineering awards in many countries, including the Draper Prize in 1995, the world’s top award in engineering. Ben and Harold Rosen are also founding directors of Capstone Turbine Corporation, which supplies the gas-turbine generator, one of the key elements of the Rosen Motors powertrain. Capstone Turbine is a developer of small gas turbine-driven electric generators (turbogenerators) for both vehicular and stationary power. Privately funded Rosen Motors develops hybrid electric powertrains for automobiles and flywheel systems for stationary power applications.

The Rosen TurboFlywheel simultaneously promises unusually long range, nearly zero emissions and sports car-like acceleration, a combination of characteristics that neither conventional internal combustion-powered cars nor battery-powered cars can offer. "We have the key to the 21st century automobile," said Benjamin M. Rosen, co-founder and chairman of Rosen Motors. "This `mean, lean and green™' powertrain is the first major shift in automobile technology since the invention of the internal combustion engine." "We are the leader in developing the world's first practical solution to the most challenging problems confronting automobile manufacturers: how to meet stringent future clean air laws around the world and significantly improve fuel efficiency without sacrificing performance," said Harold A. Rosen, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Rosen Motors. In fact, the Rosen approach will enhance performance substantially in terms of acceleration and range. The Rosen powertrain is currently being tested in a passenger car on a dynamometer. Ultimately, Rosen Motors expects that cars powered by the Rosen TurboFlywheel will produce emissions that are no greater than those caused by battery-powered cars recharged by fossil-fuel-burning utilities. Yet these Rosen-powered cars, depending on their weight and aerodynamics, will enjoy a range of 45 to 80 miles per gallon. In addition, they will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. "One of the most extraordinary aspects of this powertrain is the simplicity it will bring to the car. The turbogenerator has only one moving part, eliminating the need for a conventional radiator and a mechanical transmission. It's also maintenance-free, except for the need for an occasional air filter change," said Harold Rosen. The Rosen hybrid electric powertrain is not simply a range extender for a battery-powered vehicle, but selects the ideal blend of flywheel and turbine-generated power for the optimal driving of a gasoline-fueled car. The flywheel produces surge power for acceleration and absorbs energy from regenerative breaking for later reuse. In today's vehicles, all the energy used in braking is irrevocably lost to heat. The TurboFlywheel powertrain will not compromise the comfort or convenience of today's automobiles. This sets apart the Rosen technology from many other proposed "clean" or "high efficiency" engines that often burden cars with cramped passenger cabins, heavy batteries, multi-hour recharging times and the need for nonstandard fuels. The Rosen system will also enable consumers to use existing gasoline stations just as they do now. "Consumers around the world will be able to drive super clean cars as soon as the first Rosen-powered autos are available," said Harold Rosen. "You just fill it up with unleaded gasoline from your neighborhood gas station and go." Benjamin M. Rosen and his brother, Dr. Harold A. Rosen, started Rosen Motors in 1993 after each had many years of success in technology venture capital and communications engineering, respectively. "We wanted to help change the world just one more time," said Ben Rosen.

The Rosen Motors powertrain replaces the conventional internal combustion engine with an innovative lean, green and powerful hybrid-electric system. The principal objectives are to decrease fossil fuel consumption and eliminate polluting emissions, while at the same time to enhance automotive performance. Success in meeting these goals will translate into financial rewards for our team members and investors. Rosen Motors hopes to have the same dramatic impact on the automobile that jet engines have had on the airplane and air travel, which previously relied on noisy, inefficient and short-range propeller/reciprocating engines. Historical Perspective The internal combustion engine: The first successful vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine was developed in Germany 110 years ago. Greatly improved versions of this engine are still used to power the world's automobiles. The technology and performance have been enhanced, but the basic principles of the internal combustion engines are the same as those employed in 1886 despite many improvement efforts over the years, including the Wankel (rotary) and Orbital engines. Alternative technologies: There have been experimental attempts to use turbines that drive the vehicle wheels mechanically. More recently, scores of companies have been exploring battery-powered electric vehicles. None of these nonconventional approaches has met with commercial success. Whether for technical, performance or cost reasons, companies have found it extremely difficult to compete with the inexpensive, reliable and well-performing internal combustion engine that continuously gets better and cheaper. Indeed, these engines have the advantage of a cumulative industry expenditure measuring in the hundreds of billions of dollars and production experience totaling billions of units. Societal Forces: The auto industry prefers evolutionary rather than revolutionary change. If it were not for the advent worldwide of two societal forces for change -- resource conservation and emissions reduction -- internal combustion engines would be with us for generations to come. Starting in California and spreading rapidly around the globe, regulators and legislators are demanding that the autos of the future consume far less fossil fuel and produce radically lower exhaust emissions. Even though autos today are vastly more fuel efficient and cleaner than their predecessors of 20 years ago, smog problems in the world's major metropolitan areas persist. In addition, oil imports by the leading industrial nations are increasing, with the attendant national security and balance of payments issues. The challenge to the auto industry for the 21st century is clear: make cleaner, more fuel efficient cars. The solution, however, is not as clear. While internal combustion engines are leaner and cleaner than they once were, they will not enable us to realize the desired goals of 80 mpg and near-zero emissions in comfortable "people-sized" passenger cars. The most commonly proposed solution to the problem is the battery-powered electric vehicle. But this "solution" presents tradeoffs that render battery-powered Electric Vehicles (EVs) unacceptable replacements for today's passenger cars. First, these EVs don't eliminate emissions, they simply transfer the emissions to the fuel-burning powerplants that supply the electricity to recharge the batteries. The vast majority of these utilities burn fossil fuels. Other shortcomings associated with battery-powered vehicles are: intolerably long recharging times (measured in hours), very short range, poor cold-weather performance and expensive battery replacements every year or two. Adding to the range problem are the batteries' heavy weight and inefficiency in regenerative braking (recovering energy normally lost to heat during deceleration). The Rosen Motors Solution The Rosen Motors powertrain radically changes the belief that societal goals can only be achieved by an unacceptable trade-off. Whereas "lean and green" have always implied poor performance and econobox-cramped space, there is now the prospect of a full-size car with fuel economy of 45 to 80 mpg, nearly zero emissions, and the acceleration of a sports car: zero to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. When the Rosen Motors powertrain-equipped car is produced in automotive volumes, this solution will be available at a reasonable cost. Range: Depending on the vehicle's weight and aerodynamics, the Rosen Motors-powered car will be able to get 45 to 80 mpg in a mixed urban-highway cycle -with air conditioning, with a heater, and with the comfortable interior space of a people-sized car. For example, the driver of a sports sedan with a 20-gallon fuel tank can enjoy driving up to halfway across the country without refueling. This significantly exceeds the 70-90 mile range estimated for the new GM battery-powered EV1. Emissions: The gasoline-burning turbogenerator, employing a catalytic combustor, reacts at a temperature well below that at which nitrogen oxides are created. (Internal combustion engines burn fuel at much higher, NOx-generating temperatures.) Other pollutants (carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons) are produced in much smaller quantities than in an internal combustion engine. Performance: In our prototype version to be tested in late 1997, the flywheel and turbogenerator will combine to provide peak power to the drive motor of 180kW, or 240hp. This power, combined with the torque characteristics of the electric drivetrain, will produce acceleration of zero to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. In future four-wheel drive versions, we anticipate accelerations of Ferrari proportions: zero to 60 mph in four seconds. (No, this is not your father's Oldsmobile.) Other Rosen Motors Powertrain Advantages: Rosen Motors eliminates the mechanical transmission found in conventional autos. In a Rosen Motors-powered car, the driver enjoys a continuously variable electronic transmission (no gears shifting). Other advantages include elegant simplicity (the turbogenerator has only one moving part), very high reliability, elimination of water-cooling for the heat engine (turbogenerator), and virtually maintenance-free operation. What Car Owners Demand: Our market research indicates that in the U.S. market, all other things being equal, consumers would prefer an environmentally friendly car to a polluting one. They would also prefer a high-gasoline mileage car to a gas guzzler. However, if performance is degraded, creature comforts are sacrificed, or prices are unreasonably high, the market potential shrinks drastically. In foreign markets, particularly in Europe and Japan where the green movement is much stronger and where fuel prices are high, the market potential is larger. Leadership: Rosen Motors is several years ahead of any major American or foreign competitor in turboflywheel hybrid electric powertrains. We intend to have automobiles powered by the Rosen Motors powertrain in volume production and on the road in customer hands within six years. The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, a joint effort by the U.S. government and the Big Three, has goals similar to those of Rosen Motors, but does not plan a prototype until approximately 10 years, with production some unspecified time later. Marketing Strategy: Rosen Motors plans to supply complete powertrains to the world's automobile manufacturers. The closest analogy to this business strategy lies in the personal computer business, where one company sources 90 percent of the world's PC manufacturers with the computer's seminal component, the microprocessor. In addition, we are formulating plans to produce a "limited-edition" series of vehicles on a more aggressive timetable. This program, if implemented, would involve upgrading an as yet unspecified production luxury vehicle with a Rosen Motors powertrain and selling it at a premium price. We anticipate a relatively small market of early adopters, consisting primarily of environmentally responsible consumers and auto enthusiasts. Besides generating early revenues for Rosen Motors, this program would serve to enhance public awareness and to expedite cost reduction. Stationary Flywheel System In addition to the vehicular systems, Rosen Motors plans to introduce an advanced flywheel system for a stationary market. This system will be used to reduce fluctuations and improve quality in commercial electric power systems. It is expected to be employed as a standalone system or in combination with turbogenerators. This stationary flywheel will be almost identical to those used in our automotive powertrains. Stationary market sales will provide us with early production experience and accelerate our path down the cost learning curve. Management The principal corporate officers of the company are: Mr. Benjamin M. Rosen, Chairman Dr. Harold A. Rosen, President and Chief Executive Officer Mr. William Grayer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Ms. Deborah R. Castleman, Vice President, Marketing Mr. Scott B. Pano, Vice President, Engineering Financing Other entrants into this field, both large and small, have sought and received government (taxpayer) funds for their development efforts. By contrast, Rosen Motors is entirely privately financed. From inception in mid-1993 through the end of 1996, $13 million of private capital will have been invested in Rosen Motors. Another $10 million -$15 million is committed for 1997 development needs. Employees The founding team of engineers and scientists comes from Southern California's aerospace and electronics industries. Rosen Motors currently employs 60 people full-time and five as technical consultants. Of these, 55 are engineers or technical personnel. Facilities The company is located in a 25,000-square foot leased facility in Woodland Hills, California. When manufacturing space is required beginning in 1998, the company will probably lease or build a new facility at a location to be determined. Web services provided by CMI, Inc.

But this one source of power creates undesirable compromises: high-power engines provide high acceleration but poor fuel economy, while low-power engines provide better fuel economy but poor acceleration performance. In addition, noxious emissions are an unavoidable byproduct of operation. In stark contrast to the internal combustion engine, the Rosen Motors hybrid electric powertrain offers the capability to obtain simultaneously high acceleration, high fuel economy, and nearly zero emissions. The Rosen Motors powertrain consists of a turbogenerator, a flywheel motor-generator, an electric drive motor, and an electronic control system. The heat engine for the powertrain is a gas turbine, which powers a generator (together, referred to as a turbogenerator). It is used to satisfy the relatively low average power demands of the vehicle, while the flywheel driven motor-generator is used to supply the surge power demands of the motor vehicle, as well as to recover power from regenerative braking. In the Rosen Motors hybrid electric powertrain, only the electric drive motor connects directly to the drivetrain of the vehicle. Unlike many other hybrid concepts, it is not simply a "range extender" for a chemical battery-powered vehicle. Rather, the electronic controller dynamically selects the blend of flywheel-generated and turbine-generated power that provides the optimum vehicle performance at all points in the driving cycle. Turbogenerator The turbogenerator is the fuel burning engine of the powertrain. It burns unleaded gasoline in its catalytic combustor, producing virtually zero pollutants. The rotor of the generator, the compressor wheel, the turbine wheel and the shaft comprise the rotating group. This rotating group, the single moving part of the turbogenerator, is supported by self-pumping air bearings. The cooling for the turbogenerator is provided by the inlet air flow, so there is no need for liquid cooling. The turbogenerator requires no lubrication and no regularly-scheduled maintenance, except for occasional changings of the air filter. A recuperator is used to improve the efficiency of the turbogenerator. The turbogenerator itself is controlled by feedback loops to the speed and inlet temperature that corresponds to its highest efficiency for the particular power demand. The turbogenerator for the Rosen Motors powertrain is supplied by Capstone Turbine Corporation, which also builds turbogenerators for stationary power generation. In the current Rosen Motors experimental vehicle, the turbogenerator provides up to 24 kilowatts of electrical output at 30 percent thermal efficiency. A turbogenerator having a maximum power output of 45 kilowatts will be used in future Rosen Motors powertrains. Flywheel The flywheel-motor-generator combination provides surge power for the hybrid electric vehicle and provides energy storage that allows for regenerative braking. It performs these functions with more efficiency, at a much lower weight and with a much longer useful life than chemical batteries. The flywheel rotating assembly consists of a carbon filament-wound composite cylinder and ring, a titanium hub and a steel shaft. The rotor of the motor-generator and the rotating elements of the flywheel magnetic bearing assemblies are mounted on the shaft and supported by the magnetic bearings. Due to the extremely high speeds at the surface of the cylinder, the rotating assembly must be contained in a vacuum enclosure. The continuously evolving residual gases from the enclosure are pumped by a molecular drag pump into a second higher-pressure chamber containing molecular sieves. The stator of the flywheel motor-generator is cooled by passing coolant through a jacket which surrounds the stator. (This liquid also cools the stators of the magnetic bearings.) The rotor of the motor-generator is cooled by radiation, primarily to the stator. The spin axis of the rotor is controlled to a vertical orientation. The vacuum housing is supported by a two-axis gimbal system, which isolates the rotor from vehicular angular motions. The vacuum housing is surrounded by a containment system which prevents escape of the rotor material in the unlikely event of an accidental burst of the flywheel rotor. The flywheel is designed for a long self-discharge time, on the order of a thousand hours (about six weeks). In the event the flywheel is allowed to run down after long storage without recharge, it can be recharged by the turbine. (In the case of a discharged flywheel, the turbine itself would be started by the 12 volt battery.) At its maximum charge, the flywheel can store one kilowatt-hour of energy, of which 80 percent is available over the flywheel operating speed range of 28,000 - 62,000 RPM. (The flywheel quiescent speed -- not braking or accelerating -- is about 55,000 RPM.) The flywheel motor-generator can deliver or accept energy at a maximum rate of 120 kilowatts. Larger power outputs may be used in future Rosen Motors powertrains. Rosen Motors has seven patents pending, and one patent issued in regard to various aspects of its flywheel motor-generator design. Drive motor The drive motor(s) delivers torque (through a fixed gear reduction) to the drive wheels in response to the positions of the accelerator and brake pedals. It also responds to the position of the hand lever, which is used to select forward or reverse. The field current of the drive motor is adjusted to obtain optimum performance for any driving condition. The electronic controller provides a pulse-width controlled signal, whose magnitude depends on the desired speed and torque to the drive motor. The characteristics of an electric drivetrain and the use of a fixed gear reduction result in a vehicle acceleration as smooth -- i.e., no gears shifting --as that obtained with a continuously variable transmission. Moreover, maximum torque is provided by the drive motor instantaneously. This, in conjunction with the high power flywheel, results in the extraordinarily high acceleration characteristics of the vehicle. Electronic controller The electronic power control consists of the logic, power electronics and software which control the three motor-generators (associated with the gasoline turbine, flywheel and drive motor, respectively) in the starting, accelerating, cruising, braking, hill climbing and hill descending operations of the motor vehicle. The control of the motor-generators is designed to provide excellent fuel economy, high acceleration capability, and minimum use of the friction brakes. This control is effected by varying the duty cycle of the pulse-width modulator outputs. These outputs switch the inverter-rectifiers on and off to synthesize the sinusoidal waveforms for the three motor-generators, all of which (generally) operate at different rotational speeds. Each of the powertrain's motor-generators is connected to a separate inverter-rectifier. The inverter-rectifiers are Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules. The inverter-rectifiers are in turn connected to a common 400 volt d.c. bus. When the motor-generator is in the motor mode, the inverter-rectifier acts as an inverter to power the motor; when in the generator mode, the inverter-rectifier acts as a rectifier to charge the bus. The turbogenerator and flywheel are controlled during normal driving with feedback loops, while the drive motor torque responds directly to the driver input through the accelerator pedal. The parameters for these control loops are designed to maintain the flywheel speed, bus voltage, turbine temperature and turbine speed within their respective operating ranges, while providing smooth response to driver input. Rosen Motors has one patent pending on its electronic controller. Web services provided by CMI, Inc.

"In addition," Irwin continues, "we'll focus the resourcesof our Tribal Gaming Academy on the process of equipping tribal members toassume total control of casino operations.

S. Supreme Court's Seminole Decision Seminole Decision could be the victory that lost the war by Charles J. Irwin, Esq. General Counsel, Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. andTribal Gaming Management, Inc. as published inthe Gaming Industry Newsletter, June 21,1996 Critical for an analysis of how the recent decisions of the U. S. SupremeCourt affect gaming in Indian country and throughout the nation is anunderstanding that Indian reservations are on federal trust land. The only lawsare federal or tribal. States have no jurisdiction over Indian reservations,unless specific jurisdiction is specifically authorized by Congress. Accordingly, unless prohibited by federal law, each Indian tribe ornation, as a sovereign nation, can decide for itself what gambling may beconducted on that reservation. When the state of California sought to preventthe Cabazon tribe from conducting high stakes bingo on its reservation in the1980's the U. S. Supreme Court held that California did not have that power. In response to the Cabazon decision, Congress passed the Indian GamingRegulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA), and attempted to balance the interest between thestate and tribal sovereignty. The law states: "Indian tribes have theexclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands, if ... notspecifically prohibited by federal law, and is conducted in a state which doesnot, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gamingactivity." IGRA established three classes of gaming. Class I, traditionalIndian games, was left unregulated. Class II, including bingo, lotto, pull tabsand non-banking card games, was placed under federal supervision by the NationalIndian Gaming Commission. Class III, includes all other forms of gaming. To provide states with the opportunity to have input in the establishmentof Class III gaming IGRA provided that gaming could only be offered to thepublic on Indian lands in a state that "permits such gaming for any purposeby any person, organization, or entity ... " and then only in conformancewith a tribal/state compact entered into by the tribe and the state. Respondingto tribal concerns that a state may not negotiate in good faith if requested,IGRA provided the tribes with federal court jurisdiction to enforce "goodfaith", and established the Secretary of the Interior as the ultimatearbiter and regulator if an agreement could not be reached on a compact. In September 1991, the Seminole Tribe of Florida sued the state and itsgovernor in federal court, alleging refusal to enter into negotiations for atribal/state compact. Florida moved to dismiss the suit on ground that suitagainst the sovereign state of Florida was barred by the 11th Amendment to theU. S. Constitution, which states in part: "The judicial power of the UnitedStates shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commencedor prosecuted against one of the United States ... " The 11th Circuit Court felt that the suit by the Seminoles against thestate of Florida wads barred by the 11th Amendment. The Court's decision alsoaddressed the question of remedies available to the tribe when its judicialremedy is barred: "The answer gleaned from the statute, is simple ... Thetribe may file suit in the District Court. If the state pleads an 11th Amendmentdefense, the suit is dismissed and the tribe ... then may notify the Secretaryof the Interior. ... The Secretary then may prescribe regulations governingClass III gaming on the tribe's lands. This solution conforms with IGRA andserves to achieve Congress' goals. The Seminole Tribe petitioned the U. S. Supreme Court for centiorari onthe main question, and the state of Florida cross petitioned, seeking reversalof the 11th Circuit's substitute remedy. The U. S. Supreme Court hold that suitagainst the state of Florida saying: "Notwithstanding Congress' clearintent to abrogate (in IGRA) the states' sovereign immunity, the Indian CommerceClause does not grant Congress that power, and therefore (IGRA) cannot grantjurisdiction over a state that does not consent to be sued." On the question of substitute remedy, the court merely noted that: "Wedo not here consider, and express no opinion upon the portion of the decisionbelow that provides a substitute remedy for a tribe bring suit." However,one week later on, April 15, 1996, the Supreme Court denied the cross-petitionof the state of Florida, leaving in place the lower court's substitute remedy. If the Secretary of the Interior meets his responsibility to the tribes ascarved out by the 11th Circuit, the State of Florida, and all states similarlysituated may have won the battle which lost the war, since a refusal tonegotiate or waive the state's immunity may lead to the imposition of a tribalregulatory system with no input from the state. President Clinton has onseveral occasions pledged his support of tribal sovereignty to Indian leadersfrom around the country. This offers an opportunity for his administration todemonstrate its good faith. If Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt does not respond to the suggestedsubstitute remedy, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which has a host ofregulatory amendments ready for introduction, will undoubtedly try its hand atsalvaging the situation. Meanwhile expect a rush on the capital by tribes thathave been stalled by their respective state governments. In apparent recognition of that fact the Secretary has published advancenotice of a proposed rulemaking, requesting public comments to the Bureau ofIndian Affairs by June 21. 1996. If neither the Secretary nor Congress responds, the result would be astalemate that could be interpreted as a revision to the tribes' basic sovereignrights. Although the Supreme Court has held that a state can not berequired to negotiate, any state that fails to waive its 11th Amendment rightsand negotiate, could find itself on the outside looking in. by Attorney Charles J. Irwin, June 1996 * Resident Partner, Atlantic City Office of Graham, Curtin & Sheridan,P.A. * General Counsel of Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc.and Tribal Gaming Management ,Inc. A Discussion of the Seminole Decision by The United StatesSupreme Court Providing More Questions Than Answers by Charles J. Irwin, Esq., General Counsel, Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. andTribal Gaming Management, Inc. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, passed by Congress in response to thedecision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Cabazon v. California, recognizes theright of Indian tribes to conduct Class III gaming activities on theirreservations under certain conditions and the Act provided two mechanisms forestablishing the parameter within which Class III gaming can be offered by anIndian Casino. The first mechanism is via a tribal/state compact, negotiated by the tribeor nation with the State, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Regulatory parameters can also be established by a regulation, prescribedby the Secretary of the Interior when efforts to obtain a tribal/state compactare unsuccessful. Congress could have recognized the right of tribes to conduct Class IIIgaming without State involvement, just as they did for Class II gaming. However,when the legislation was being formulated, States were insisting that some statecontrol over gaming activities conducted within the borders of their State wasnecessary. Tribal representatives urged that since their operations were onfederal trust land, the State should have no jurisdiction. Once the compromiseof a negotiated tribal/state compact was introduced, there was a need to answerthe question, "Suppose the State refuses to negotiate, or does notnegotiate in good faith?" Congress, in its wisdom, responded that Class III gaming would be lawfulonly if it is conducted: (a) By a "recognized" tribe; (b) in accordance with a tribal resolution or ordinance, approved by theNational Indian Gaming Commission; (c) in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization or entity; (d) "...in conformance with a Tribal-State Compact entered into bythe Indian tribe and the State under paragraph (3) that is in effect". Section 2710(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides that upon receipt of a requestfor compact negotiations from a tribe, "...the State shall negotiate withthe Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact." (Emphasisadded). In an attempt to satisfy the concerns of the tribes, Congress made theState's obligation to negotiate in good faith judicially enforceable in Sections2710(d)(7)(A)(i) and (B)(i) as follows: "(A)(i) The United States District Courts shall have jurisdictionover any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failureof the State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose ofentering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct suchnegotiations in good faith.... "(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described insubparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on thedate on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiationsunder paragraph (3)(A)." In September 1991, the Seminole Tribe sued Florida and its governor forrefusing to enter into negotiations for a Tribal-State compact. Florida's motionto dismiss the Seminole suit as violating the State's sovereign immunity fromsuit was denied by the Federal District Court. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and heldthat the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution barred the Seminole suit againstthe State. The Eleventh Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed toextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of theUnited States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of anyForeign State." The U.S. Supreme Court in the case at hand held (5 to 4) that: "Notwithstanding Congress' clear intent to abrogate the States'sovereign immunity, the Indian Commerce Clause does not grant Congress thatpower, and therefore Section 2710(d)(7) cannot grant jurisdiction over a Statethat does not consent to be sued. We further hold that the doctrine of Ex parteYoung, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), may not be used to enforce Section 2710(d)(3)against a state official." Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down the tribal right to forcethe State to the bargaining table to compact, what mechanism, if any, isavailable to establish legal regulatory guidelines for Class III gaming? There may be situations where the State will willingly waive its immunityfrom suit in order to obtain, through negotiations, accommodations from theapplying tribe or nation. In such cases, great care must be taken to guarantee avalid waiver and to minimize and neutralize third party legal challenges to theprocess. If, however, the State stands on its constitutionally guaranteed immunity,what mechanism is available to the tribe? The Eleventh Circuit answered that question in its decision below asfollows: "The answer, gleaned from the statute, is simple. One hundred andeighty days after the tribe first requests negotiations with the state, thetribe may file suit in the District Court. If the State pleads an EleventhAmendment defense, the suit is dismissed, and the tribe, pursuant to 25 U.S.C.2710(d)(7)(B)(vii), then may notify the Secretary of the Interior of the tribe'sfailure to negotiate a compact with the State. The Secretary then may prescriberegulations governing Class III gaming on the tribe's lands. This solutionconforms with IGRA and serves to achieve Congress' goals, as delineated inSection 2701-02." However, when the U.S. Supreme Court considered the decision of theEleventh Circuit, they did not specifically adopt the above language. Instead,the Court in what at first glance almost appears to be an afterthought, includedas a footnote at the end of the majority decision, said. "FN18 We do not here consider, and express no opinion upon, thatportion of the decision below that provides a substitute remedy for a tribebringing suit..." Did the Court ignore the question of a substitute remedy because themajority was not unanimous on that question? If so, perhaps the answer will comein a separate decision. Presently pending before the Court is a cross-petition filed by the Stateof Florida which seeks to have the U.S. Supreme Court specifically overrule theEleventh Circuits' outline of an alternative procedures. That petition is pending at this writing. Perhaps the Court will respondto that petition, or by denying it, leave in place the Eleventh Circuitposition. It is also possible that the Court decided to leave the resolution of thequestion of alternative procedures for Congress to resolve through amendinglegislation. It is a long standing tradition of the Court not to provide answersunless compelled to do so by the central issue of the case, and the presentCourt seems sensitive to the philosophy of separation of powers. Until either the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress speaks on this issue, thelaw within the Eleventh Circuit will be as announced and tribes who have beenunable to negotiate compacts may act accordingly. Whether a tribe now has a compact in place, is presently negotiating acontract, is in the Court attempting to resist legislative attempts to overturna compact negotiated with a governor, or is about to otherwise seek to pursueClass III gaming, a whole new series of questions, including those relating towaiver, State Court jurisdiction, Justice Department enforcement procedures andstanding of third parties to challenge existing compacts are now upon us. This statement seeks to direct attention to some of the new problemscreated by Seminole case.

S. Supreme Court's Seminole Decision Building Your Tribal Gaming Commission A Nuts-n-Bolts Plan For Appointing New Gaming Commissions andFilling Vacancies on Old Ones by: Charles J Irwin, General Counsel &Arthur E, Irwin, President of Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. (TGCA)and Tribal Gaming Management, Inc. (TGM) May1995 Seven decades of business and community service have taught us thesecret of building any group for success. It's not the secret of finding theperfect person for each job. It's the secret of blending people together who are(as a group) most likely to become an effective team. As we help tribes build their new Tribal Gaming Commissions, that is thegoal we recommend. And as Tribes ask us to search among candidates forCommission membership, we often begin the process by applying a Five PointSelection Guide that focuses on areas we consider to be most important: (1) maturity and experience moving groups toward common goals, (2)personal achievement as an indication of self-motivation and the ability to getthings done, (3) the ability to organize complex thoughts and expressopinions clearly, (4) a positive attitude, and (5) strong commitmentto building a better Tribal future. Those most qualified, according to these key measures, then enter a poolof final candidates that we draw from as we assemble our recommendations for theTribe's 1st Gaming Commission. Building the right team can mean the difference between an effective &independent group contributing to successful Gaming operations, while standingfirm as a strong defender of Tribal Sovereignty; or a disorganized Commissionthat obstructs an important Tribal venture. Tribal leadership usually defines the Commission's structure by passing aTribal Ordinance dealing with, among other things: · the authority and responsibility of the Commission, · thenumber of Commission members, · requirement that some (or all)Commissioners be members of the Tribal Council, · length ofappointment, and · a provision for alternate members. Next, they publish a call for candidates that includes basic requirements,like age and Tribal membership. Those who respond are asked to complete a long application form thatcontributes to the process in several ways. First, it provides enoughinformation about the candidate to identify those who should be givenpreliminary interviews. Second, it captures the information needed to perform abackground investigation prior to issuing each Commissioner's Gaming License.And finally, the application itself is lengthy enough to discourage those whoare not serious candidates. Applications are reviewed and screened for completeness as they arereceived. Missing or incomplete data is flagged so that it can be provided laterif needed. About 20 candidates are invited for formal interviews. At this point, a process begins which is much like that of building astone wall, a wall like those common throughout New England. First, just as the best stones are chosen long before they are carefullyfitted into the wall, the most qualified candidates are carefully chosen usingthe Five Point Selection Guide presented above. Usually, we find more excellent candidates then the tribe needs. And, justas the stones not used in today's wall are saved for future projects, thosetalented people not asked to serve at this time, become a pool of talent that'savailable for the future. Some will join the Commission at a later date. Somewill fill other key gaming positions as they become available. Some will servethe Commission as members of the Commission Staff. And those qualified candidates that appear most likely to work welltogether right from the start ... those candidates who, as a group, possess theability to grapple with complex administrative and policy issues in an efficientway ... those candidates will be the ones recommended for appointment to the 1stTribal Gaming Commission. Someone with skill but light experience, for instance, might make anexcellent addition to the Commission two years from now. At that point;Commission procedures will have been established, other Commissioners will havegained veteran status, and the Commission may well be seeking a new generationto lead it into the future. Appointing the first commission, after all, is only the first step, on oneof the many paths. One of the later steps, that can be equally important, comes when it istime to fill a vacancy on the Commission. Often the easiest way is to find acandidate with similar strengths (and weaknesses) as the Commissioner beingreplaced. That's often the easiest way, but not usually the best. We recommend that you focus on the opportunity to examine the group as awhole, and re-structure the Commission (as necessary) to meet the challengesthat lie ahead. An often rewarding approach, is to think once again about the process ofbuilding that stone wall. Mentally remove each of the stones. Examine them oneat a time, and then fit them back together, along with the new Commissioner, asa restructured team. To give an example: some Commissions ask their members to become familiarwith all gaming operations, but at the same time, very familiar with onespecific area. Each Commissioner is asked to become almost an "in-houseexpert". Under the kind of restructuring plan we recommend, a Commissioner who hadbeen a major resource when Table Games were discussed; might, for instance, beasked to focus on the procedures to be followed by Casino Inspectors. Someoneelse would be assigned to Table Games. By introducing this kind of change, you strengthen your Commission inthree ways. First, it gains the enthusiasm and talents of the new Commissioner.Second, seasoned Commissioners bring their experience to bear on old issues, butfrom a slightly different point of view. And finally, learning is fun for mostof us, and the veteran Commissioners will probably feel a surge of motivationand job satisfaction as they begin to explore interesting new areas. And, of course, don't forget the advantages of cross-training. It's an oldfashioned idea, but cross-training generates new benefits wherever it's used.

S. Supreme Court's Seminole Decision Building Your Tribal Gaming Commission A Nuts-n-Bolts Plan For Appointing New Gaming Commissions andFilling Vacancies on Old Ones by: Charles J Irwin, General Counsel &Arthur E, Irwin, President of Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. (TGCA)and Tribal Gaming Management, Inc. (TGM) May1995 Seven decades of business and community service have taught us thesecret of building any group for success. It's not the secret of finding theperfect person for each job. It's the secret of blending people together who are(as a group) most likely to become an effective team. As we help tribes build their new Tribal Gaming Commissions, that is thegoal we recommend. And as Tribes ask us to search among candidates forCommission membership, we often begin the process by applying a Five PointSelection Guide that focuses on areas we consider to be most important: (1) maturity and experience moving groups toward common goals, (2)personal achievement as an indication of self-motivation and the ability to getthings done, (3) the ability to organize complex thoughts and expressopinions clearly, (4) a positive attitude, and (5) strong commitmentto building a better Tribal future. Those most qualified, according to these key measures, then enter a poolof final candidates that we draw from as we assemble our recommendations for theTribe's 1st Gaming Commission. Building the right team can mean the difference between an effective &independent group contributing to successful Gaming operations, while standingfirm as a strong defender of Tribal Sovereignty; or a disorganized Commissionthat obstructs an important Tribal venture. Tribal leadership usually defines the Commission's structure by passing aTribal Ordinance dealing with, among other things: · the authority and responsibility of the Commission, · thenumber of Commission members, · requirement that some (or all)Commissioners be members of the Tribal Council, · length ofappointment, and · a provision for alternate members. Next, they publish a call for candidates that includes basic requirements,like age and Tribal membership. Those who respond are asked to complete a long application form thatcontributes to the process in several ways. First, it provides enoughinformation about the candidate to identify those who should be givenpreliminary interviews. Second, it captures the information needed to perform abackground investigation prior to issuing each Commissioner's Gaming License.And finally, the application itself is lengthy enough to discourage those whoare not serious candidates. Applications are reviewed and screened for completeness as they arereceived. Missing or incomplete data is flagged so that it can be provided laterif needed. About 20 candidates are invited for formal interviews. At this point, a process begins which is much like that of building astone wall, a wall like those common throughout New England. First, just as the best stones are chosen long before they are carefullyfitted into the wall, the most qualified candidates are carefully chosen usingthe Five Point Selection Guide presented above. Usually, we find more excellent candidates then the tribe needs. And, justas the stones not used in today's wall are saved for future projects, thosetalented people not asked to serve at this time, become a pool of talent that'savailable for the future. Some will join the Commission at a later date. Somewill fill other key gaming positions as they become available. Some will servethe Commission as members of the Commission Staff. And those qualified candidates that appear most likely to work welltogether right from the start ... those candidates who, as a group, possess theability to grapple with complex administrative and policy issues in an efficientway ... those candidates will be the ones recommended for appointment to the 1stTribal Gaming Commission. Someone with skill but light experience, for instance, might make anexcellent addition to the Commission two years from now. At that point;Commission procedures will have been established, other Commissioners will havegained veteran status, and the Commission may well be seeking a new generationto lead it into the future. Appointing the first commission, after all, is only the first step, on oneof the many paths. One of the later steps, that can be equally important, comes when it istime to fill a vacancy on the Commission. Often the easiest way is to find acandidate with similar strengths (and weaknesses) as the Commissioner beingreplaced. That's often the easiest way, but not usually the best. We recommend that you focus on the opportunity to examine the group as awhole, and re-structure the Commission (as necessary) to meet the challengesthat lie ahead. An often rewarding approach, is to think once again about the process ofbuilding that stone wall. Mentally remove each of the stones. Examine them oneat a time, and then fit them back together, along with the new Commissioner, asa restructured team. To give an example: some Commissions ask their members to become familiarwith all gaming operations, but at the same time, very familiar with onespecific area. Each Commissioner is asked to become almost an "in-houseexpert". Under the kind of restructuring plan we recommend, a Commissioner who hadbeen a major resource when Table Games were discussed; might, for instance, beasked to focus on the procedures to be followed by Casino Inspectors. Someoneelse would be assigned to Table Games. By introducing this kind of change, you strengthen your Commission inthree ways. First, it gains the enthusiasm and talents of the new Commissioner.Second, seasoned Commissioners bring their experience to bear on old issues, butfrom a slightly different point of view. And finally, learning is fun for mostof us, and the veteran Commissioners will probably feel a surge of motivationand job satisfaction as they begin to explore interesting new areas. And, of course, don't forget the advantages of cross-training. It's an oldfashioned idea, but cross-training generates new benefits wherever it's used.

S. Supreme Court's Seminole Decision Seminole Decision could be the victory that lost the war by Charles J. Irwin, Esq. General Counsel, Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. andTribal Gaming Management, Inc. as published inthe Gaming Industry Newsletter, June 21,1996 Critical for an analysis of how the recent decisions of the U. S. SupremeCourt affect gaming in Indian country and throughout the nation is anunderstanding that Indian reservations are on federal trust land. The only lawsare federal or tribal. States have no jurisdiction over Indian reservations,unless specific jurisdiction is specifically authorized by Congress. Accordingly, unless prohibited by federal law, each Indian tribe ornation, as a sovereign nation, can decide for itself what gambling may beconducted on that reservation. When the state of California sought to preventthe Cabazon tribe from conducting high stakes bingo on its reservation in the1980's the U. S. Supreme Court held that California did not have that power. In response to the Cabazon decision, Congress passed the Indian GamingRegulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA), and attempted to balance the interest between thestate and tribal sovereignty. The law states: "Indian tribes have theexclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands, if ... notspecifically prohibited by federal law, and is conducted in a state which doesnot, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gamingactivity." IGRA established three classes of gaming. Class I, traditionalIndian games, was left unregulated. Class II, including bingo, lotto, pull tabsand non-banking card games, was placed under federal supervision by the NationalIndian Gaming Commission. Class III, includes all other forms of gaming. To provide states with the opportunity to have input in the establishmentof Class III gaming IGRA provided that gaming could only be offered to thepublic on Indian lands in a state that "permits such gaming for any purposeby any person, organization, or entity ... " and then only in conformancewith a tribal/state compact entered into by the tribe and the state. Respondingto tribal concerns that a state may not negotiate in good faith if requested,IGRA provided the tribes with federal court jurisdiction to enforce "goodfaith", and established the Secretary of the Interior as the ultimatearbiter and regulator if an agreement could not be reached on a compact. In September 1991, the Seminole Tribe of Florida sued the state and itsgovernor in federal court, alleging refusal to enter into negotiations for atribal/state compact. Florida moved to dismiss the suit on ground that suitagainst the sovereign state of Florida was barred by the 11th Amendment to theU. S. Constitution, which states in part: "The judicial power of the UnitedStates shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commencedor prosecuted against one of the United States ... " The 11th Circuit Court felt that the suit by the Seminoles against thestate of Florida wads barred by the 11th Amendment. The Court's decision alsoaddressed the question of remedies available to the tribe when its judicialremedy is barred: "The answer gleaned from the statute, is simple ... Thetribe may file suit in the District Court. If the state pleads an 11th Amendmentdefense, the suit is dismissed and the tribe ... then may notify the Secretaryof the Interior. ... The Secretary then may prescribe regulations governingClass III gaming on the tribe's lands. This solution conforms with IGRA andserves to achieve Congress' goals. The Seminole Tribe petitioned the U. S. Supreme Court for centiorari onthe main question, and the state of Florida cross petitioned, seeking reversalof the 11th Circuit's substitute remedy. The U. S. Supreme Court hold that suitagainst the state of Florida saying: "Notwithstanding Congress' clearintent to abrogate (in IGRA) the states' sovereign immunity, the Indian CommerceClause does not grant Congress that power, and therefore (IGRA) cannot grantjurisdiction over a state that does not consent to be sued." On the question of substitute remedy, the court merely noted that: "Wedo not here consider, and express no opinion upon the portion of the decisionbelow that provides a substitute remedy for a tribe bring suit." However,one week later on, April 15, 1996, the Supreme Court denied the cross-petitionof the state of Florida, leaving in place the lower court's substitute remedy. If the Secretary of the Interior meets his responsibility to the tribes ascarved out by the 11th Circuit, the State of Florida, and all states similarlysituated may have won the battle which lost the war, since a refusal tonegotiate or waive the state's immunity may lead to the imposition of a tribalregulatory system with no input from the state. President Clinton has onseveral occasions pledged his support of tribal sovereignty to Indian leadersfrom around the country. This offers an opportunity for his administration todemonstrate its good faith. If Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt does not respond to the suggestedsubstitute remedy, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which has a host ofregulatory amendments ready for introduction, will undoubtedly try its hand atsalvaging the situation. Meanwhile expect a rush on the capital by tribes thathave been stalled by their respective state governments. In apparent recognition of that fact the Secretary has published advancenotice of a proposed rulemaking, requesting public comments to the Bureau ofIndian Affairs by June 21. 1996. If neither the Secretary nor Congress responds, the result would be astalemate that could be interpreted as a revision to the tribes' basic sovereignrights. Although the Supreme Court has held that a state can not berequired to negotiate, any state that fails to waive its 11th Amendment rightsand negotiate, could find itself on the outside looking in. by Attorney Charles J. Irwin, June 1996 * Resident Partner, Atlantic City Office of Graham, Curtin & Sheridan,P.A. * General Counsel of Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc.and Tribal Gaming Management ,Inc. A Discussion of the Seminole Decision by The United StatesSupreme Court Providing More Questions Than Answers by Charles J. Irwin, Esq., General Counsel, Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. andTribal Gaming Management, Inc. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, passed by Congress in response to thedecision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Cabazon v. California, recognizes theright of Indian tribes to conduct Class III gaming activities on theirreservations under certain conditions and the Act provided two mechanisms forestablishing the parameter within which Class III gaming can be offered by anIndian Casino. The first mechanism is via a tribal/state compact, negotiated by the tribeor nation with the State, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Regulatory parameters can also be established by a regulation, prescribedby the Secretary of the Interior when efforts to obtain a tribal/state compactare unsuccessful. Congress could have recognized the right of tribes to conduct Class IIIgaming without State involvement, just as they did for Class II gaming. However,when the legislation was being formulated, States were insisting that some statecontrol over gaming activities conducted within the borders of their State wasnecessary. Tribal representatives urged that since their operations were onfederal trust land, the State should have no jurisdiction. Once the compromiseof a negotiated tribal/state compact was introduced, there was a need to answerthe question, "Suppose the State refuses to negotiate, or does notnegotiate in good faith?" Congress, in its wisdom, responded that Class III gaming would be lawfulonly if it is conducted: (a) By a "recognized" tribe; (b) in accordance with a tribal resolution or ordinance, approved by theNational Indian Gaming Commission; (c) in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization or entity; (d) "...in conformance with a Tribal-State Compact entered into bythe Indian tribe and the State under paragraph (3) that is in effect". Section 2710(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides that upon receipt of a requestfor compact negotiations from a tribe, "...the State shall negotiate withthe Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact." (Emphasisadded). In an attempt to satisfy the concerns of the tribes, Congress made theState's obligation to negotiate in good faith judicially enforceable in Sections2710(d)(7)(A)(i) and (B)(i) as follows: "(A)(i) The United States District Courts shall have jurisdictionover any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failureof the State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose ofentering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct suchnegotiations in good faith.... "(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described insubparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on thedate on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiationsunder paragraph (3)(A)." In September 1991, the Seminole Tribe sued Florida and its governor forrefusing to enter into negotiations for a Tribal-State compact. Florida's motionto dismiss the Seminole suit as violating the State's sovereign immunity fromsuit was denied by the Federal District Court. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and heldthat the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution barred the Seminole suit againstthe State. The Eleventh Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed toextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of theUnited States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of anyForeign State." The U.S. Supreme Court in the case at hand held (5 to 4) that: "Notwithstanding Congress' clear intent to abrogate the States'sovereign immunity, the Indian Commerce Clause does not grant Congress thatpower, and therefore Section 2710(d)(7) cannot grant jurisdiction over a Statethat does not consent to be sued. We further hold that the doctrine of Ex parteYoung, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), may not be used to enforce Section 2710(d)(3)against a state official." Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down the tribal right to forcethe State to the bargaining table to compact, what mechanism, if any, isavailable to establish legal regulatory guidelines for Class III gaming? There may be situations where the State will willingly waive its immunityfrom suit in order to obtain, through negotiations, accommodations from theapplying tribe or nation. In such cases, great care must be taken to guarantee avalid waiver and to minimize and neutralize third party legal challenges to theprocess. If, however, the State stands on its constitutionally guaranteed immunity,what mechanism is available to the tribe? The Eleventh Circuit answered that question in its decision below asfollows: "The answer, gleaned from the statute, is simple. One hundred andeighty days after the tribe first requests negotiations with the state, thetribe may file suit in the District Court. If the State pleads an EleventhAmendment defense, the suit is dismissed, and the tribe, pursuant to 25 U.S.C.2710(d)(7)(B)(vii), then may notify the Secretary of the Interior of the tribe'sfailure to negotiate a compact with the State. The Secretary then may prescriberegulations governing Class III gaming on the tribe's lands. This solutionconforms with IGRA and serves to achieve Congress' goals, as delineated inSection 2701-02." However, when the U.S. Supreme Court considered the decision of theEleventh Circuit, they did not specifically adopt the above language. Instead,the Court in what at first glance almost appears to be an afterthought, includedas a footnote at the end of the majority decision, said. "FN18 We do not here consider, and express no opinion upon, thatportion of the decision below that provides a substitute remedy for a tribebringing suit..." Did the Court ignore the question of a substitute remedy because themajority was not unanimous on that question? If so, perhaps the answer will comein a separate decision. Presently pending before the Court is a cross-petition filed by the Stateof Florida which seeks to have the U.S. Supreme Court specifically overrule theEleventh Circuits' outline of an alternative procedures. That petition is pending at this writing. Perhaps the Court will respondto that petition, or by denying it, leave in place the Eleventh Circuitposition. It is also possible that the Court decided to leave the resolution of thequestion of alternative procedures for Congress to resolve through amendinglegislation. It is a long standing tradition of the Court not to provide answersunless compelled to do so by the central issue of the case, and the presentCourt seems sensitive to the philosophy of separation of powers. Until either the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress speaks on this issue, thelaw within the Eleventh Circuit will be as announced and tribes who have beenunable to negotiate compacts may act accordingly. Whether a tribe now has a compact in place, is presently negotiating acontract, is in the Court attempting to resist legislative attempts to overturna compact negotiated with a governor, or is about to otherwise seek to pursueClass III gaming, a whole new series of questions, including those relating towaiver, State Court jurisdiction, Justice Department enforcement procedures andstanding of third parties to challenge existing compacts are now upon us. This statement seeks to direct attention to some of the new problemscreated by Seminole case.

Advanced Relative Strength Moore Inflation Predictor� (MIP) Gold Relative Strength Gold vs. Bond Ratio NYSE (RSI) NYSE Moving Average US Dollar (RSI) The Beginning Investor Franklin Global Health (FXGHX) CPI-U Inflation Rate Data Fidelity Electronics (FSELX) Advanced RelativeStrength Several months ago I covered the basics of using the RelativeStrength Index. Since this is such an important tool in analyzingthe future movements of a stock or fund. This month we'll coversome of the more advanced uses of Relative Strength. Relative Strength is charted on three lines—the top lineis at the 70% mark and signifies being over bought (i.e.,too high) the middle line is at the 50% point and signifiesmoderate valuation and the bottom line is at the 30% mark andsignifies oversold. This Benham 2020 Bond Chart shows several typical patterns.Point “A”, however, is a very unusual formation. It isa series of peaks well above the overbought line. Normally, whena market is strong it takes several succeedingly lower peaks towork out the strength as we see in points “H” &“I”. In addition, it would usually take quite a bit oftime to work out the strength involved in the “A”formation. So the drop to “D” is actually quite asurprise. Some may theorize that the drop to “D” wasnecessary to counteract the extreme overbought condition of somany peaks above the line. In hindsight we can see that the RSIpeaks “B” and “C” were signaling the dropahead because although the RSI was making lower peaks the pricepeaks were level. During the period of “B-D” we werebullish on the Bond market and were severely reprimanded byseveral subscribers for our bullish stance. As we can see itactually took more than the point “D” low to work outthe strength of point “A”. In actuality, points“F-I” were the “Lower Highs” leading to theend of the cycle. The RSI peaks contained in line “H” are lower highswhile the Price peaks are Higher Highs. This negative divergencebetween them signifies the beginning of the end. The true endcomes as the peaks of “I” do not even reach theoverbought line as we saw in “B” and “C”. The reverse of “H” and “I” is“J” with a “positive” divergence between theRSI and Price valleys. This type of divergence is referred to aspositive since they indicate an upturn is at hand, while a“negative” divergence indicates a downturn is coming.Some authors refer to both as negative simply indicating a lackof correlation between the two lines. Looking back at the RSI valleys I would have expected themid-April valley to have been the final downmove because itdidn't cross the oversold line. But in true contrary fashion themarket gave us one more low before bottoming. As we can see, boththe Price and RSI lows in June and July have been higher lows. The final confirmation that the Price is beginning to rise isthe RSI peaks at “K.” Each is a higher peak signalingbuilding strength which should culminate with a peak or peaksabove the overbought line and then a peak or peaks not quitereaching the overbought line as in “B-C”. Although we have spent almost four months now in basebuilding, at this point, unless the situation changesdrastically, I do not see the strength necessary to move us abovethe December highs. But we can easily regain 1/3 to 2/3 of theloss giving us a 5%-10% gain from here in the next couple ofmonths. At that point we must begin watching the Gold vs. Bond Ratiofor the proper point to return to holding Gold. Gold Relative Strength The Gold RSI has shown many of the same patterns as those ofthe Bond RSI. Peak “1” is similar to Peak “A”although not as strong. Peak “2” contains both “B& C” and is the “lower highs” signaling adecline. Valley “3” is a poor signal (since it neverreached the oversold line) but it does indicate strength since itwas only a small decline with a quick rebound. Peaks “4” and “5” are another example of“negative” divergence and lower highs. Peaks“6” and “7” simply confirm the weakening ofthe price but show the weakness much more clearly than the priceitself. Point “8” is obviously indicating a bottom but waseven stronger than “D” since the RSI never returned tothe oversold line. The converse of this may be true for thecurrent situation in bonds. Since the rise is bouncing along andrising very slowly we will probably have a relatively anemic risein Bonds. Line “9” is another negative divergence with line“10” confirming the decline. Line “11” is apositive divergence indicating we are on the verge of anotherrise. The depth of the pullback to come will indicate thestrength of the coming rise. The advantage of RSI is that it gives us an early indicator ofturning points. The weakness of RSI is that it often indicates acoming turn way too early. For instance “G” could havebeen interpreted as a sell signal and the whole length of“J” could be a buy signal. This is why we combine RSIwith our Gold vs. Bond Ratio and moving average. This way RSI andthe MIP gives us the early warning and the confirmation comesfrom the moving average and the Gold vs. Bond ratio. NYSE (RSI) The New York Stock Exchange gives us a good look at theoverall stock market January through May showed us a negative divergence with asevere deterioration since May. In last month's issue we warnedthat if the coming peak remained below the overbought line wecould be in for a correction. Coincidentally, that peak wasoccurring just as you received that issue around July 1st and aswe can see it peaked around 60% and the market has dropped 6.37%since then. U.S. Dollar (RSI) The Dollar RSI chart shows a series of divergences. In early1995 we had a positive divergence at “a” then anegative divergence and accompanying fall at “b”,positive at “c” with a long rise and negative at“d” and we are currently showing weakness. Historicallyspeaking the Dollar is at about mid-point of its value over thelast ten years so it is neither over nor under priced but at thispoint based upon RSI. I would prefer to be in Swiss Francs ratherthan in Dollars. Franklin GlobalHealth (FKGHX) Franklin Global Health can be considered a proxy for theentire Health industry and as we can see, although the pricecontinued to make higher highs this year the RSI was making lowerpeaks signaling weakness in the market. As this is being writtenthe market is in the midst of a rout—falling 17.3% from thepeak two months ago. At this point Health has given up almost all of this yearsgains. This is exactly why it is important to time the market.The Hotline has been covering the RSI for various marketsincluding Health, Energy, Electronics, NASDAQ, NYSE in additionto Gold and Bonds. For the last month or so I have been sayingover and again that all of the above markets with the exceptionof Bonds has been showing signs of extreme weakness! I hope youhave taken that advice to heart and lightened up on stocks overthese months. With Health in extreme oversold territory this is not the timeto sell. It is quite possible that because of the depth of therecent plunge in RSI that the price will continue down for a bitlonger while RSI makes higher lows. When the RSI bounces up andthe valley does not cross below the 30% line we will have a shortterm buy signal in Health. This is projected in thecircle—this is not actual and it may take some time tooccur! Fidelity Electronics(FSELX) Electronics is also very oversold. We may see a peak abovemidpoint then a pullback to just above oversold in the RSI. Thiswould be a good buy point. Several months ago the establishmentwas gung-ho on Internet Stocks. They became so extremely overbought that when reality sunk in and most of the new stocksstarted trading below their IPO's (Initial Public Offerings)initial prices. Now the market has sold off not only the newissues (without current earnings) but also the establishedelectronics giants. An interesting stock is Advanced MicroDevices (AMD). It competes with Intel as a computer chipmanufacturer. AMD, however, does not advertise. (The computermanufacturers know who AMD is so why advertise?) AMD simplyproduces good chips less expensively. They were late coming outwith a Pentium class chip which has depressed their price evenmore than the average Electronics stock. But AMD has released onenow along with a top-of-the-line sound chip. AMD is now tradingat around $11 with a 52 week high of $36 and a P/E of 11.7 . Whenthe earnings from the new chips come on line I wouldn't besurprised to see it back up to $30! This is a possible triplewithin 18 months. Another stock that has been extremely depressed from pure hypeis ValuJet. Sure they had a crash, all airlines do, and if youwatch their stock it always bounces back. Just look at US Airafter its crash. It fell to a low of $4. Less than two yearslater it reached $20! 500% in two years isn't bad! Remember at $4the establishment was talking about it going to zero! ValuJetalso fell to about $4 but has already returned to about $11.(Watch TWA.) Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) This month we have made some minor cosmetic changes to the MIPchart.. We have changed the word “Median” to “MostLikely” showing its significance. We have also removed the“you are here” arrow and replaced it with a verticalline to separate the actual data from the projected. The government stated that this month's CPI-U rate was 2.8%actually it was 2.75% but the Bureau of Labor Statistics roundsto one decimal place. This month's increase was a slim .06% if weAnnualize this number (i.e., assume the same rate ofincrease for 11 more months). We would have annual inflation ofless than one percent (.77%)! Last year around this time we had amonth of zero inflation. As we can see from the MIP chart,inflation has really been pretty flat even with all the inflationhype in the news. This explains why our Gold vs. Bond Ratio hasbeen favoring Bonds. Based upon the new data we have postponedthe expected rise in Gold to October although we may have aslight rise in the numbers next month. The rise actually is amere statistical anomaly with the zero falling out of thecalculation next month. If we have anything greater than zeroinflation this month the rate has to go up. If next month is thesame as this month (.06%) we will follow the extreme low line. Gold vs. Bond Ratio This months ratio chart includes two lines: one at .55 and theother at .60. This zone is a key target zone for bottoms. Overthe last six years (since 1990) there have been 15 significantbottoms in the ratio. About half (7) of these were minor corrections and they endedabove or at the 60% line. While five ended within this zone andonly three ended below the zone. The significance of this is that we are currently well withinthe possible range for the end of this down move so we must becautious and watch our moving average carefully for signs of theend of the down move. The last low was actually one of thedeepest lows. At this point we really aren't showing signs of leveling offyet and the other signs, i.e., the MIP and RSI, stillallow for a couple of months favoring Bonds. So we will stillhang tight but we need to begin watching carefully NYSE Moving Average Last month I included a big article about the advantages ofusing the moving average on the overall stock market.Unfortunately, the moving average line did not show up on theprinted copy. The lower line on the chart entitled “TheAdvantages of Switching” was only the NYSE, the average linedid not print. Little did I know how timely that article wouldbe! The NYSE has just crossed below its six month moving averagefor the first time since February 1995! As you can see in thechart below we have had five signals since January 1994. Over thelast 30 years the average was 1 � switches per year orapproximately 1 every nine months. Since we have not had a switchsignal since February 1995 we were over due for one. The first signal on this chart would have kept us out of themarket about 6 months and although the market was relatively flatby being out we would have been ahead by earning interest duringthat period. The second signal was a poor signal and would have had us inthe market for about 3 months with little or no gain (althoughwell selected stocks may have out performed the market). Thethird signal would have had us out during another level periodsafely earning interest. The fourth signal would have had us inthe market for all of “one of the biggest Bull marketsever”. Now as we can see the signal is saying we are in foranother level or dropping period. The six month moving averagehas done quite well over time and we must ignore it at our ownrisk. If we want to take a bit more risk and wait, the finalconfirmation will be when the one month moving average crossesdown through the 6 month average. Once again we must be very cautious only hold stocksthat are extremely undervalued! Extreme Caution is still warranted with the RSI indicatingshort term weakness and the Moving average showing long termweakness. Timothy McMahon Editor The Beginning Investor An Introduction to FTF Reading The MIP Chart The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is an extremelyaccurate predictor of inflation. It accurately forecastsdirection changes a year in advance. The vertical axis is the inflation rate (in percent) while thehorizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chart is the historical Consumer PriceIndex (CPI). The right side is the predicted CPI. The right side consists of several diverging lines starting atthe vertical line. The lines are labeled as to likeliness ofpredicting the future of the CPI with likely highs and lowsdiverging from the most likely and extreme highs and lows furtherout. By focusing on the most likely line you can easily seechanges in the direction of the CPI index. An increase in the CPI usually translates into an increase inGold and Gold Stocks. A decrease in the CPI index usuallyindicates a decrease in Gold and an increase in Bonds, Utilitiesand other interest sensitive instruments. CPI UP = GOLD UP CPI DOWN=BONDS UP CPI Data- By annualizing the CPI Data from various time spans we can getan idea of the likely range over the next year's time frame. Keepin mind that 1 and 2 month rates have very little long-termsignificance. The Basic Portfolio The simplest portfolio uses the Benham Family. We chose Benhamfor 3 reasons. It has a good Gold Fund. It has a long-term Bond Fund that moves rapidly and provides the greatest upside potential during up moves. It has several alternatives for parking funds during periods of uncertainty. Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham GoldEquity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. Volatility Our greatest ally and biggest foe is volatility. We rely uponlarge changes in the prices of our funds during relatively shortperiods of time. This can result in short term losses if weswitch directions too early. This is referred to as "drawdown" i.e., in the long run we made money but in themean time our account showed a temporary paper loss. Someinvestors have difficulty handling large draw downs. They shouldfollow the conservative approach. Diversification All investors should diversify by investing a portion of theirportfolio using several other investment approaches includingwell selected individual securities, mutual funds and otherappropriate investments. Our goal is to maximize overallportfolio performance with a minimum of risk. New Money Any funds recently freed up should follow the "NewMoney" indicator. Insurance Gold Every investor should have a portion (usually 10-15% or 1years living expenses) of their assets in Gold and/or Silver(coins and/or bullion). This should be considered insuranceagainst market chaos and is not an investment. The cost of thisinsurance is the missed interest. Relative Strength Relative Strength Indices (RSI) provide advance warning ofprices that are very overbought (too high) or very oversold (toolow). Certain patterns also indicate a coming increase ordecrease in prices. Relative Strength is very sensitive and oftenprovides very early signals (sometimes too early). Ratios A ratio is simply one item divided by another. By tracking aRatio we can watch both items of the Ratio simultaneously. Whenthe ratio is rising Item 1 is outperforming Item 2. By switchingbetween the items we can profit continuously. It doesn't matterwhether one item is rising, or both items are rising or falling.as long as we increase the number of shares we hold with eachswitch. In the long run we will multiply our wealth Moving Averages A crossing of an average is a significant event. By definitionit always signifies a change in the overall direction of the baseindex. By following its signals we can avoid most protracted downperiods and significantly increase our overall return.

McMahon Volume 1, Number 4 Editor In This Issue . . . Figures Don't Lie? Relative Strength The Moore Inflation Predictor Relative Strength of Benham 2020 Current Positioning Relative Strength of Invesco Strategic Gold The Beginning Investor / The ABCs of Investing RSI Microsoft Charts Relative Strength Relative Strength ofBenham 2020 Last month our insert mentioned the weakening of the overallstock market as indicated by the Relative Strength Index. Thismonth I would like to tell you a little about how this indexworks. There are at least two methods of calculating“Relative Strength”. The first type is a more literalapproach to the term Relative Strength in that it compares theperformance of one stock or fund with the performance of anotherstock, fund or index. This comparison gives you its RelativeStrength (i.e. which fund is stronger). This is not the RelativeStrength about which I am speaking. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) I am using was developed byJ. Welles Wilder, Jr. primarily for use in trading options buthas been adapted for use in Mutual Funds. It is called a momentumindex and it is calculated by determining an exponential movingaverage of upticks versus an average of the downticks. Generally,this is calculated over a relatively short period of time like 14days. When graphed this index is plotted on a range of zero to100% with lines at the 30%, 50%, and 70% marks. When the indexcrosses above the 70% line it is said to be overbought (i.e. toohigh) and when it crosses below the 30% mark it is oversold (i.e.too low). In the Benham 2020 chart we have the price chart on top andthe corresponding Relative Strength chart below. As we can seefrom this chart occasionally a fund can remain in the overboughtrange for quite some time as indicated by the “A”. Justprior to the “A” circle corresponds with the buy signalgenerated by the MIP for May of this year. Technically, wewouldn't count this as a sell signal until it dropped out of thehigh strength area in early June. Although the MIP generates its signals approximately six totwelve months in advance the Relative Strength index works indays rather than months. Prior to the “A” zone the RSI never really generateda good buy signal at all. It simply stayed in the upper half,although the MIP had generated a buy. At point “B” Ipublished our first issue and issued a buy signal for 2020 sincethe MIP still had a couple of months to go. I didn't expect theall out buy generated at point “C” since BTTTX had beenin the upper half all year. “C” occurred so quicklythat a monthly newsletter is unable to work with it at all. Atpoint “D” both the MIP and the RSI generated a sell for2020 and a strong confirmation has occurred at “E” (bycrossing above and then below the 70% line). So although 2020 hasmoved above our sell point, it is in the high risk zone and notworth the risk for such a few points. It is much too high towarrant remaining in Bonds. RelativeStrength of Invesco Strategic Gold Now let us look at the Gold side of the equation. On theInvesco Strategic Gold Chart we see a strong buy signal in earlyFebruary at point “A”. The MIP was flat through Marchand issued a small buy signal for the period of March throughMay. By combining the two signals (MIP & RSI) we would havebought at the end of February. The tricky part comes when we geta sell signal at the end of March. Although we have seen a nicegain the MIP says we still have a month to go. Once again the MIPproves correct and we get another sell at the end of April atpoint “B” as it crosses below the 70% line. Thiscorresponds with the MIP sell and the Benham 2020 Bond priceexplosion on the previous chart. Line “C” is in a sharprise which is not confirmed by the RSI in circle “B”.Another confirmation of the sell signal. At point I was writingthe August issue trying to estimate the best switch point andexpecting the drop to point “E” to occur much morequickly. So, although subsequently September saw a sell signal forBonds, the Buy signal for Gold did not occur until early Octoberwith a confirming Sell in Bonds. As I said in the August issuewhen I issued the switch signal, I would prefer to be a littleearly rather than a little late. Although, It may be a little nerve racking at first until therise materializes often the first leg up is the most explosiveand has the biggest gain (as we saw last month in my currencyarticle and as we can see in the May price of BTTTX). We now haveconfirmation that we are on the right track, so just hold on (orfor you procrastinators, jump aboard) for the ride. At this pointBonds are still a sell and Gold is still a Buy. At this point thebest buy will occur as the Relative Strength turns up again.Which I hope, for the sake of all our ulcers, will occur beforeyou receive this. This difficulty in timing illustrates the need for more up tothe minute advice , such as a weekly hotline. I am currently tornbetween resisting the extra work, expense and time limitationsinvolved and the need to provide more timely advice. RSIMicrosoft Relative Strength of Microsoft Microsoft has shown great strength this year by remaining inthe upper half. The closest thing to a buy signal occurred atpoint “A” in late January and another one now inOctober at point “B”. Unfortunately, if we were usingstrictly Relative Strength we would not get many good signals forMicrosoft. The blow off in July was signaled by being in theoverbought range but so was March, April, and May . If the risein October - November does not exceed the peaks in August andSeptember that would be a bad signal. So we need a close abovethe 99 3/8 close of 8/22 or at least above 97 5/8 to keep therally alive and preferably above the July high of 109. Today10/24 the close was 97 1/2 if it retreats from here withoutclosing above 97 5/8 that will be a bad sign and we will closeour MSFT position. If, however, as we expect, it closes above 993/8, all systems are go we would continue to hold on until theRelative Strength crosses above 70% and then turns below. Figures Don't Lie? There is an old saying, “Figures don't lie but Liarsfigure”. Most of us have come to the conclusion at one timeor another that statistics can be made to say most anything wewant them to. Simply by presenting the numbers in the right lightor by looking at the right portion of the data we can skew theresults. This is one reason that it is very important for us tobe sure that the source of our CPI data is accurate. A couple ofmonths ago, we noted that the government was reporting a .2% risein the “seasonally adjusted” CPI data while the actualdata was telling us there was a .2% decline. Now, according to the October 2nd Wall Street Journal, congressis coming to the conclusion that “The consumer priceindex... overstates the true increase of the cost ofliving.” My personal guess would be that the opposite isprobably true since they are constantly tinkering here and there.But if the above is any indication, the seasonal adjustments maybe the problem. Congress is coming to the conclusion that “Theconsumer price index... overstates the true increase of the costof living.” However, Congress has its own reasons for wanting to lower theCPI index, i.e. for every percent that the CPI drops it savesbillions in “cost of living adjustments” that are tiedinto almost everything. With this in mind I sincerely doubt thataccuracy in reporting is their primary concern. I believe theywill probably vote to fudge the numbers as a much easier way tocut the budget than cutting Social Security. Although CPIadjustment will have the same effect, most people won't realizeit until they find their checks aren't going as far as they usedto. In addition CPI adjustment will also cut wage increases forunion and non-union workers whose contracts are tied to the CPI. How this will affect our MIP calculations is uncertain at thispoint. Probably, it will only create a temporary dislocation whenthe change is actually put into effect. But if they phase it inthe dislocation could last longer. At this point I do not knowhow they arrived at the conclusion that the CPI is off by 1% orhow they plan to correct it. Will they just subtract 1% from theactual number? I doubt it. They probably will change thecomposition of the index. Again! I have heard it said that the only way we can get a true feelfor how much our cost of living is increasing is to keep track ofour own personal index. If I buy bread, milk, premium gasoline,steak and lobster every week and you buy potato chips, beer,regular gas, hamburger and cigarettes we have different costs ofliving. But in addition to having different costs of living, ourcost of living may change at different rates. Generally speakingour “true cost of living” is based upon what we buyevery month, i.e. food, gas, heat or A/C, rent or mortgage, etc.While food and gas can change quite rapidly, generally,electricity and our mortgage are quite stable (unless we move).So our personal price index should be relatively stable but itwould be interesting to see how well it correlates to thegovernment's numbers. An advisor once suggested that people should actually tracktheir personal CPI. We could make a list of items we buyregularly and track their price monthly. I would be interested inhearing from anyone who is doing that currently to see how itrelates to the government's CPI index. The Moore InflationPredictor Last month I warned you that the stock market looked weak andthat we should expect a flat to slightly down trend for theSeptember CPI numbers. Both have proven correct. The MIP is atrock bottom. We are looking for a sharp upturn in the Octobernumbers due to be released Mid-November. Hopefully, gold willbegin it's upturn before then but it may wait for the CPIrelease. I think these numbers will be a surprise to mostanalysts who have begun to expect the steady decline we have seenover the last several months. This up tick should last throughDecember-January and provide a nice profit in Gold, Gold Stocksand Precious Metals Mutual Funds. This uptick may also correspondwith the lackluster performance in the overall stock market. Ifthat is the case, then we should expect the stock market torebound beginning in early 1996. However, these sharp increasesand declines should prove profitable for our switching portfoliono matter which way the overall stock market goes.CPI-UInflation Rate Data Through September 1995 SPAN RATE ANNUALIZED 12 Month Growth 2.54% 2.54% 10 Month Growth 2.34% 2.81% 8 Month Growth 1.93% 2.89% 6 Month Growth 1.19% 2.38% 4 Month Growth .66% 1.98% 2 Month Growth .46% 2.76% 1 Month Growth .20% 2.40% This Section is a new feature designed to give some basicinformation about the Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) and theoverall market climate to New Investors or simply a quickoverview for you seasoned investors. Also this feature will tellyou what to do with any “New Money” you may have justfreed up. Disaster Insurance- A portion of your total portfolioshould be held in tangible assets not in paper. These should bein your possession, well hidden, for times of emergency. Theseare not for speculation and should be purchased during buysignals for Gold Stocks and Gold Mutual Funds. Between Tenpercent (10%) of your total portfolio and one year's livingexpenses should be in Gold and Silver coin. This is insuranceagainst personal and large scale disasters and bears a certaincost (as does any insurance). In this case the cost is loss ofinterest. If you fear possible Government confiscation (again)you should hold collectable quality Gold coins (MS-60 or above),preferably sealed and graded by PCGS. Current Positioning Interest / Inflation Direction Turning Up Gold Stocks / Gold Mutual Funds Buy Bonds / Bond Mutual Funds Sell Utilities / Utility Mutual Funds Sell New Money Invest in Gold Mutual Funds Projected Reversal Point (Switch Back to Bonds) Late December to Early January CPI Data- By annualizing the CPI-U Data over varioustime spans we can get an idea of the likely range over the nextyear's time frame. Keep in mind that 1 and 2 month rates havevery little long-term significance. The Beginning Investor The Basic Portfolio- For simplicity this portfolio willstay with the Benham Family. We have chosen Benham for tworeasons. 1) It has a good Gold Fund. 2) It has a long term BondFund that is usually the most volatile (i.e. provides thegreatest upside potential during up moves) 3) It has severalalternatives for parking funds during periods of uncertainty. Seethe following article for information on how to set up an accountand minimum investment information. New Money- Any funds recently freed up should be placedin Benham's Gold Equity Index Fund.

Why Switch? Benham Gold RSI Timing—The Better Way Platinum vs. Gold The FED NYSE RSI Quotes of the Month US Dollar Index RSI The Moore Inflation Predictor Microsoft Update The Gold vs. Bond Ratio The Beginning Investor Relative Strength Index (RSI) Reading the MIP Chart Benham 2020 RSI CPI-U Inflation Rate Data WhySwitch? Suppose 30 years ago you were given $20,000. . . . . . Being a Farsighted individual you invested in the stockmarket. Today you'd be rich—right? WRONG! The truth is you'd be worse off than if you hadinvested the same amount in T-Bills! How can this be? Aren't we in the biggest Bull market ever? The reason is simple. Bear markets can wipe out years of gainsin months! If you lose 20% on a $10,000 investment one year(bringing it down to $8,000). You need a 25% gain the next yearjust to break even! ($2,000 is 25% of $8,000.) To make mattersworse, now you have not earned a cent on your money in two years! As we can see from this chart, even with the explosive growthof the last few years, buy and hold doesn't work. Nomatter what the brokerage industry and the establishment newsmedia tell us, since 1966 the stock market has not even kept upwith T-Bills! BUT WAIT—The truth is even worse! After adjustingfor inflation we see the true picture (see the chart on the nextpage), the stock market not only didn't keep up with T-Bills, butfor the entire period from 1966 through 1992 you would not haveearned a single cent after inflation. To add insult to injury—that is before taxes! After youpay taxes on the imaginary (inflation) gains you would have atremendous LOSS! So what can we do? Isn't this the only game in town? Timing—The Better Way The chart on the next page shows the results if you hadfollowed the most simple switching technique available, themoving average. By selling your stocks whenever the stock price fell below the6 month moving average and buying T-Bills, you could improve youroverall performance by almost 30%. Yes, your total assets are almost 1/3 larger byfollowing the most basic timing method available. By Simply: looking at the newspaper once a month calculating the average price over the last six months Checking which was higher—the average or the current market price. Switching your investments an average of 1 � times per year You could increase your total assets by almost 1/3 ! This simple timing method allows us to avoid the latterportion of dips and level periods. This is the most simple timing method available. If you wereable to use more advanced techniques, such as our RelativeStrength Index and Ratios, you could increase your holdings evenmore! Since this is such a powerful and universally applicabletechnique, beginning next month we will be including the movingaverages for the NYSE. Currently the Index is well above itsmoving average as we can see in the Advantages of Switchingchart. TheFED The Fed chided Clinton for trying to influence it with hispublic remarks against raising rates. The Fed said the remarkscould only be harmful because they might spook the market intothinking the Central Bank could be pressured into acceptinghigher inflation. The Central Bank also indicated that they didnot feel inflation pressures were building yet but that "weare getting close." (This is what we have been saying forthe last month or so.) The PPI declined .1% in May but Bond investors are followinglabor markets and ignoring the facts that although energy pricesrose 2.4% in March and 2.8% in April they fell .6% in May, Foodprices also remained level in May. Quotes of the Month "With the economy expected to expand at about 2.5% thisyear we are close to the limit before inflation kicks in."according to the Chicago Federal Reserve Chairman. "We seem to be getting growth without inflation, whichmost economists find terrific but baffling" said the chiefeconomist of Scudder, Stevens and Clark of New York. It amazes me that these supposedly educated economists somehowbelieve that growth in the economy creates inflation. It is notbaffling at all. Basic economics tells us that the GNP could double and notcause a single bit of inflation as long as the money supplyincreased less. The whole key to price inflation is when themoney supply expands faster than the GNP. Unfortunately, the money supply is much more difficult totrack than the available M1, M2 and M3 numbers would lead you tobelieve. There is a vast quantity of unreported greenbacksfloating around the world. Fortunately, they usually have verylittle effect upon our economy. It is only as they move back herethat they affect our prices. It seems simple enough that if there are 10 items in our“economy” and $10 to spend on them, the average priceper item will be $1.00. If the “economy” expands to 20items without a corresponding increase in the money supply youget deflation not inflation as the average price becomes 50. If, however, the money supply doubles, then you get inflationas prices go to $2. Naturally, the actual situation is much morecomplex especially with the FED constantly adjusting interestrates, etc., but I would think the basics would still apply. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) This month the inflation rate was almost exactly the same aslast month—down .01%). The MIP is predicting a flat tomoderate rise for the next few months with a much sharper rise inthe CPI-U numbers in the fourth quarter. This should result in anincrease in the price of Gold and a decrease in Bonds. The Gold vs. Bond Ratio Last month, I said the 8 week crossing is rarely a falsesignal. And on the rare occasion that it does retrace almostalways the true crossing occurs shortly ther?after. Well, we aredefinitely on the down hill side now. The four and eight week averages have turned down, the ratiois firmly below both averages, and the four week crossed belowthe eight week average giving us our final confirmation. We willcontinue in bonds until the averages level out and we get theratio crossing through the 4 week average to the upside. Relative Strength Index(RSI) The RSI is a moving “momentum” index that calculatesthe exponential moving average of upticks versus downticks. Thisis graphed on a range of 0-100% with dotted lines at 30%, 50% and70%. At 70% the index is “overbought” (i.e., toohigh) and below 30% it is oversold (i.e., too low) extremeoverbought and oversold situations usually require some time towork themselves out. See October 1995 FTF for detailedinformation on Relative Strength patterns and signals. Benham 2020 (RSI) The Bond relative strength index is in the lower half showingsigns of gaining strength. This is good for bonds. As we can seethe RSI bottomed in late February and tested the oversold lineseveral times each while making lower lows in the price. The RSI,however, was not making lower lows. This divergence is typical ofbottoms. With the most recent bottom in the RSI being only in the40% range we are seeing signs of strength emerging. Depending onwhether the rise shows enough strength to cross the overboughtline, or only touch it will determine how long the uptrend willlast. Benham Gold (RSI) We have had a 14.2% drop in the price of Benham Gold from ahigh of $15.77 on February 5th to the low of $13.33 on June 17th. With the RSI in extreme oversold territory some may see arepeat of point “A” in the making. Even though ourGold/Bond ratio is favoring Bonds the trend for inflation isdefinitely up. Cautious investors may wish to begin buying the dips inGold in case we get a repeat of last year's meteoric rise withoutanother major test of the oversold line. The normal rise pattern should be the reverse of the“B”, “C”, “D” pattern, with severaltests of the oversold line with very little overall pricemovement, before the actual rise begins. However, Gold oftenreacts more violently than we would expect for other items. Bonds are showing the beginnings of strength and shouldcontinue to rise for a while. The Gold/Bond Ratio has turned tofavor Bonds while Gold is extremely weak. Those who wish to buyinto this weakness may begin to phase a small portion of theirfunds into Gold. But we expect Bonds to outperform Gold for thenext couple of months. Platinum vs. Gold The Platinum/Gold Ratio rose imperceptibly this month butremains in the range where Platinum is undervalued compared toGold. For those who would like to begin accumulating metals youmay consider Lydenburg Platinum (LYDPY). Recently trading at aprice of $16� up from $13. In the last three years it has tradedas high as $23 and as low as $10 NYSE(RSI) The New York Stock Exchange Relative Strength Index is showinga “negative divergence” in the trend lines (i.e.,one is going up while the other is tending down). This is anegative indicator. Point “C” indicates a reversal isat hand. Hopefully, it will lead to higher highs. But with thelast peak barely above the 70% line, our peaks are gettingweaker. If we see another peak like points “A” and“B” below the overbought line and no crossings abovethe line we would be due for a correction. We hope this is just“Summer Doldrums”. For the very short term we should see another upward pushtesting or crossing the overbought line. If that is strong enoughto break the down trending RSI the Bull can continue. U.S. Dollar Index (RSI) The Dollar is also showing signs of negative divergence withpoint “A” and “B” performing weaker thanprevious peaks. This upthrust may be the final push for theDollar. It is possible we have seen the top for the Greenback. Microsoft Update Back in our August 1995 issue we began coverage of Microsoftwith the following highlighted quotation “I believeMicrosoft will trade up to its old highs and above within monthsof the release of Windows 95 in Late August.” By thetime that issue reached you Microsoft was trading in the Low90's. The “old highs” mentioned were at $110. In thesame issue we said “Plan on taking Profits when Microsoftreaches $120.” MSFT is now trading at $121 so it is timeto consider taking those profits. It took a couple of months longer than expected but for thoseof you who followed that advice and bought at $92 you are upabout 35% in 10 months! There were opportunities to buy at lowerprices along the way but to buy at those points takes apsychological will of steel. Often when it is most difficult tobuy is when we should be buying. We also offered a trading strategy for Microsoft as it tradedin a wide range from $90-$100. It was possible to buy at $90 andsell at $100 several times in a three or four month period givingus another way to pick up 30% on Microsoft in the last year! Two other interesting High Tech stocks are Iomega (IOMG) andSyquest (SYQT). Both manufacture hardware for backing up computerhard drives. Earlier this year both traded in the single digits.Then Iomega announced a breakthrough technology supposed torevolutionize the industry. Iomega stock shot up to $55 with aP/E of 200+ while Syquest fell to around $4 with a P/E of 2! Thisis a perfect example of market stupidity! Syquest is stillundervalued at $9. While Iomega is still overvalued at $30 (P/Eof 188). I would not be surprised to see them both trade at $18within the next year. Timothy McMahon Editor The Beginning Investor Reading The MIP Chart The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is an extremelyaccurate predictor of inflation. It accurately forecastsdirection changes a year in advance. The vertical axis is the inflation rate (in percent) while thehorizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chart is the historical Consumer PriceIndex (CPI). The right side is the predicted CPI. The right side consists of several diverging lines starting ata "You are here" arrow. The median line is the mostlikely prediction for the future of the CPI with likely highs andlows diverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. By focusing on the median line you can easily see changesin the direction of the CPI index. An increase in the CPI usually translates into an increase inGold and Gold Stocks. A decrease in the CPI index usually indicates a decrease inGold and an increase in Bonds, Utilities and other interestsensitive instruments. CPI UP = GOLD UP CPI DOWN=BONDS UP CPI Data- By annualizing the CPI Data from various time spans we can getan idea of the likely range over the next year's time frame. Keepin mind that 1 and 2 month rates have very little long-termsignificance. The Basic Portfolio The simplest portfolio uses the Benham Family. We chose Benhamfor 3 reasons. It has a good Gold Fund. It has a long-term Bond Fund that moves rapidly and provides the greatest upside potential during up moves. It has several alternatives for parking funds during periods of uncertainty. Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham GoldEquity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. New Money Any funds recently freed up should follow the "NewMoney" indicator. Volatility Our greatest ally and biggest foe is volatility. We rely uponlarge changes in the prices of our funds during relatively shortperiods of time. This can result in short term losses if weswitch directions too early. This is referred to as "drawdown" i.e., in the long run we made money but in themean time our account showed a temporary paper loss. Someinvestors have difficulty handling large draw downs. They shouldfollow the conservative approach. Diversification All investors should diversify by investing a portion of theirportfolio using several other investment approaches includingwell selected individual securities, mutual funds and otherappropriate investments. Our goal is to maximize overallportfolio performance with a minimum of risk. Insurance Gold Every investor should have a portion (usually 10-15% or 1years living expenses) of their assets in Gold and/or Silver(coins and/or bullion). This should be considered insuranceagainst market chaos and is not an investment. The cost of thisinsurance is the missed interest. Relative Strength Relative Strength Indices (RSI) provide advance warning ofprices that are very overbought (too high) or very oversold (toolow). Certain patterns also indicate a coming increase ordecrease in prices. Relative Strength is very sensitive and oftenprovides very early signals (sometimes too early). Ratios A ratio is simply one item divided by another. By tracking aRatio we can watch both items of the Ratio simultaneously. Whenthe ratio is rising Item 1 is outperforming Item 2. By switchingbetween the items we can profit continuously. It doesn't matterwhether one item is rising, or both items are rising or falling.as long as we increase the number of shares we hold with eachswitch. In the long run we will multiply our wealth.

Since there are nonaturally existing 100% true opposites I prefer the term ratioinvesting. By this I mean we track the ratio of the first item tothe second by dividing one by the other and then chart the ratio.By looking at the graphical representation, we can see that whenthe chart is rising, item “A” is out performing item“B” and the reverse is true when the chart is falling. The primary pair that we watch is the Gold vs. Bond Ratiobecause Gold tends to rise with inflation while Bonds tend torise with disinflation. In addition, Bonds rise as interest ratesfall and Gold rises as interest rate rise. One reason we payparticular attention to this ratio is the excellence of our MooreInflation Predictor (MIP). since it predicts turning points sowell we can gauge when to expect a turn in the inflation/interestrate trend and begin watching the more precise (short term)timing indicators such as the Relative Strength Index and MovingAverages. An interesting Ratio we have not looked at before is betweenEnergy and Transportation. It would seem obvious that risingenergy costs would decrease the profitability of transportationcompanies. Thus causing their stock prices to fall. This shouldmake this a prime candidate for an opposite pair ratio. In actuality, the pair has a correlation of .369. Acorrelation of 1.0 would mean that they always moved in the samedirection. A correlation of negative one (-1.0) would mean theyalways move in opposite directions. This .369 means that about athird of the time they move in the same direction. This isprobably due to the fact that when the overall stock market isrising or falling both funds are carried along. On page one we have included a chart of the ratio of FidelitySelect Energy vs. Fidelity Select Transportation. This is a veryeasy ratio to trade Since it is in the same Fund Family. As we can see the period from 1989 to 1992 could have beenvery profitable for switch traders. During 89-90 energy pricesrose significantly. During 91-92 while Transports rose Energyfell. With perfect 20-20 hindsight we can choose the followingportfolio. On February 23,rd 1989, Fidelity Select Energy (FSESX) wastrading at $7.36 while Fidelity Select Transportations (FSRFX)was trading at $7.80. The ratio of Energy divided by Transportswas point 0.94 or 94%. Assuming we bought 100 shares of FSESX itwould have cost $736. On September 24, 1990, 9/24/90 Energy hadrisen to $13.71 while Transports fell 75 to $7.05 bringing theratio to a high of 1.94. At this point we could sell our 100 shares of Fidelity SelectEnergy for $1371 for an 86% profit in 19 months. We would swapfor Transports buying almost 195 shares. Eighteen months later Energy had returned to $8.02/share whileTransports had gone to $11.63. The ratio at this point was a low.69. Here we could exchange our Transports for Energy again andget $2267.85 or 282.77 shares of Energy. Switch trading can be considered a bit more risky than“buy and hold” but as we can see the potential profitsare also much greater. In dollar terms our $736 Tripled in threeyears while those who followed the buy and hold strategy forEnergy earned a total of 8.9% or about 3% per year and Transportsearned 49% or about 16% per year Since the funds tend to move ins opposite directions a trulyconservative person could buy some of each thus guaranteeing hisprincipal but limiting any chance for gain to those periods whenboth funds were rising. The key to ratio investing in cyclical funds like Gold andBonds is not the dollar price but multiplying your shares, sinceoften volatile shares will return to their previous prices. So aslong as we are multiplying the number of shares we own we willeventually profit. This would be important if both sides decreased., then as longas the ratio moved in our favor we would have more shares andeventually we could sell them at a profit. In the case of Energy and Transports, however, both funds haveincreased and the ratio has remained relatively flat so itwouldn't matter much which fund you were in. The key to remember, though, is that we are trying to multiplythe number of shares we have. In the long run we will alwaysprofit if we watch the ratio and multiply our shares. Moving Averages The chart on this page shows Franklin Growth Funds vs.Franklin Gold Funds. By using the 4 week and 8 week movingaverages it is easier to spot a change in direction in thetrends. Growth vs. Gold is another good pair since they also tendto move in opposite directions. The correlation of these twofunds is .001 almost exactly zero (i.e. neither negative norpositive). The major theory of moving averages is that since the averagetakes longer to change direction than the stock, fund or ratioitself. So, when the ratio crosses through its moving average itis signaling a change in direction. For instance, at peaks themoving average starts leveling off and eventually the ratiocrosses down through it. The ratio will always cross through ashort term average before a longer term one and finally the shortterm average will cross through the longer average. At this pointthe ratio direction is well established and is set up for achange in the opposite direction The difficulty comes when we get “whipsawed” i.e.the ratio crosses through the average in one direction and thenthe other. This happens primarily at peaks and troughs but mayalso occur during long up-trends and down trends. We are less likely to receive whipsaw signals when usinglonger averages but we also miss a bigger portion of the move.The least amount of whipsawing occurs if you wait for the shortterm average to cross the longer term average. Naturally at thispoint we have also missed a good portion of the initial move.This would not be too bad if the initial move started slowly andthen gained momentum but that is rarely how the stock marketbehaves. It seems that often the biggest moves are immediatelyafter a change in direction. The biggest problem with using moving averages is when we tryto outguess the signals and ignore one because we assume it willbe a whipsaw anyway. We need to act upon every signal. The best approach is to choose an average that fits yourpersonality (shorter for risk takers and longer for conservativeinvestors) and follow all the signals without consideration forbrokerage fees! In the long run it will be much more profitable. The Budget Surplus? April showed a “Budget Surplus” up 45.6% on themonth from one year ago, according to Treasury Departmentfigures. This was due to “unexpectedly strong taxreceipts,.” Unexpected by whom? We told you several monthsago that a weak dollar would increase U.S. business revenue!Naturally, increased revenue means increased tax receipts, whichsounds a bit like “Supply Side Economics” to me. For the first 7 months of the fiscal year revenues were up 23%over last year while expenditures were up “only” 13.2%.Personally, I think Government growth of 13% under a“conservative” congress is almost treason, especiallywhen inflation was under 3%! (Where did the 10% increase inFunding go? And what happened to the “Peace Dividend”?) Since revenue growth exceeded expenditure growth by 10% no onewill pay attention to the 10% spending increase. But next yearcongress will probably increase expenditures by 15% rather thanuse the money to reduce the deficit. The FED and Interest Rates The Fed decided not to adjust interest rates at its May 21stmeeting. And surprisingly enough this may have been the bestpossible scenario for Bonds. Normally, a cut in the interest rate would spur Bond prices.But in this perverse market, inflation jitters are gripping Bondtraders. Their fear is that a cut in rates would cause inflationto re-ignite. Thus causing the Fed to have to raise rates and thevalue of Bonds to fall. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) The MIP, however, is indicating that inflation may be in theworks, confirming what the Bond traders fear. We appear to be infor inflation through next January. However, the proof of thepudding is in the eating so we need to look carefully at theratio chart itself. We need to be alert for a return to theupside So according to these traders raising rates is bad for Bonds(as usual) and lowering rates is bad for Bonds! As we have seenin the past few months Bear Market mentality has over taken Bondtraders. Everything is bad for Bonds --this is usually a signthat the bottom is at hand and a good contrarian would buy withboth hands. It is quite possible we have seen the bottom of thisBond cycle. The Gold vs. Bond Ratio As we can see the ratio made a top at .7485 and has declinedthrough its four week moving average and has just crossed its 8week moving average. The 8 week crossing is rarely a false signal. I have circledthe only three cases on this chart. As we can see the first twowere followed shortly by another crossing which turned out to bethe true crossing signal. The final confirmation of a change in trend is the crossing ofthe short term average through the longer term average.Unfortunately, by that point usually a big move has alreadyoccurred. At point “C” we see a situation where themajority of the move was already over. If that is the case with the third circle, the most recentcrossing is the Bond buy signal we have been waiting for. Unfortunately, with the MIP indicating inflation in the nearfuture the rise in Bonds may be relatively small. Similar to therise in Gold following the first circle (i.e., from .5852to .6500.) Although this was the smallest signal on the chart itstill represented an 11% total move in about 2 months. This chart looks much more like a top than a bottom and as wesaid earlier, we need to follow every signal generated. So we areat this point expecting a flat to declining Gold price and arising Bond price for the short term. We will however be watching closely for an upward crossingback through the moving average- -signaling the end of the Bondphase and a rise in Gold. Relative Strength Index(RSI) The RSI is a moving “momentum” index that calculatesthe exponential moving average of upticks versus downticks. Thisis graphed on a range of 0-100% with dotted lines at 30%, 50% and70%. At 70% the index is “overbought” (i.e., toohigh) and below 30% it is oversold (i.e., too low) see October1995 FTF for more detailed information on Relative Strengthpatterns and signals. Benham 2020 (RSI) Bonds have been bouncing in the oversold range for a couple ofmonths now but have been making higher lows on the RSI. Note the negative divergence between the actual price and theRSI. This last bottom did not cross the 30% line. Combined withour other indicators this should be the bottom for Bonds for awhile. Compare this with the negative divergence last summer.Although the actual price low was about the same in July as inAugust, the RSI showed much stronger action. Similarly, the final price peak in January was almost as highas December's peak but the RSI, did not even reach the 70% line.It is possible we will see one more drop toward the 30% lineending midway (around 40%) similar to last August but it shouldbe a higher low.. Benham Gold (RSI) Gold Relative Strength is showing weakness with the mostrecent peak not reaching the 70% overbought line. By comparing the current situation to the peaks of Junethrough September, 1995, we can see that we are in a positionmuch more similar to August or September than to October. We have not exceeded the high made in early February and RSIhas made progressively lower highs. We hope to see a nice dropinto Oversold territory (� la October 1995) providing us a goodentry point for the next rise in Gold, due later this year. Platinum vs. Gold The metals ratio has fallen a bit from last month to 101.9from a high last May of 114.6. Slightly favoring Platinum overGold. A ratio above 110 makes Platinum over priced relative toGold while under 105 moderately favors Platinum. A ratio under100 strongly favors Platinum. (See the March 1996 issue for moreinformation on this ratio) Coincidentally, often when the Platinum Gold ratio is at itslowest Gold is also making its low. Consequently, we may be luckyenough to see a ratio below 100 at the same point we get a buysignal for Gold. This would provide us an opportunity to get intoPlatinum shares at an extreme bargain. U.S. Dollar Index (RSI) The Dollar index has regained its losses and returned to thelevels of December 1994 (as indicated by the dotted line). Butthe RSI is not making new highs, or more precisely, is notreaching old highs. So, we may be nearing an end to the gains inthe Dollar. The low Dollar of 1995 was good for our balance oftrade and consequently our budget deficit and fortunately theclimbing Dollar has not yet reached levels where businesses needbe overly concerned but I don't think our Government would likethe Dollar to get too much higher. NYSE Index (RSI) The New York Stock Exchange Index is still moving up strongly.Since early 1995, every pullback to midpoint on the RSI has beena buying opportunity, but lately the drops have been lower andthe moves have been more volatile. The one good indicator is thatthe index has moved out of its trading range and made a new high.It is still a bit too early to tell but we would hope the RSImakes it to its old highs before taking a breather on this chartit is almost there but not quite.

I do notrecall having seen this type of analysis done elsewhere but thechart is definitely revealing. While contemplating different ways ofanalyzing the stock market data, I began thinking about how weanalyze interest rate data and realized that we could apply someof the same analyses to the stock market. When we look at the stock market data we typically look at theindex itself. We see it rising or falling but we don’t getan accurate picture of how much it is actually rising or falling. However, when we look at inflation data we typically ignorethe index itself and concern ourselves more with the rate ofchange since last year. We say inflation is up 2.88% since lastyear and don’t really care what the actual index is. Sincewe at Financial TrendForecaster specialize in tracking and predicting theinflation rate, you our subscribers should be much more familiarwith the Consumer Price Index than the average person—sohere is a brief quiz: Without looking at the back page—Islast month’s Index? (on a 1982-1984 basis) A) 471 B) 157 or C) 1057 The correct answer is B), however, if you answered A) you werecorrect on the 1967 basis (i.e., something that cost $1.00in 1967 will cost $4.71 today). The point is that we are notusually concerned with the actual index—simply with how muchit has increased since last year. The same should be true of the stock market. Do we really careif the market is at 360 or 4900 or 20,000? Actually that dependson whether we are looking at the NYSE, the Dow or the Nikkei Dow.In the final analysis the actual number itself is meaningless.What really matters is the rate of change over the last day,week, month, year or over the period you have been holding it. Our NYSE Rate of Change Chart (ROC) calculates the increase(or decrease) in the NYSE Index over the past year and figures itas a percentage of the previous year’s index. If"A" represents last year’s index and "B"represents this year’s index then the formula for any annualrate of change is (B-A)/A. Several previously difficult to discern factors become readilyapparent when looking at this chart. The first is that there have been several brief periods whenit was possible to earn 30-40% returns or more. There have also been years when it was possible to lose30-40%. With a bit of thinking we can see that as a market risesrapidly the rate of return also rises rapidly, but as the marketlevels off the ROC begins to fall. This is a veryimportant concept to keep in mind. If the market rises 10% thefirst month and then stays flat, the longer the flat period laststhe lower the total return. Obviously, a year long flat periodresults in a zero return for that year (as represented by thehorizontal center line). The ROC chart makes it easy to see when the rate of return isfalling. This does not mean that you are losing money, simplythat you are earning less. This could mean that the market hasleveled off, that it is not growing as fast as it was, or, ofcourse, that the market is actually falling. The opposite situation is where the market has been flat forthe last 11 months and is now up 10% this month. Obviously, asthe rate of return is increasing we want to be in the market.This particular situation would be signaled by an upturn in aline that was approaching zero. Another factor to keep in mind is that in order to compoundyour gains you have to take them. If you make 20% one year andloose 20% the next, you have done worse than break even. You haveactually lost! (100 plus 20%= 120 but 120 minus 20% is only 96.)So over the two year period your total return is a negative 4%. Therefore, by following the ROC chart we can easily tell whenthe market is producing a positive return and when it is losingground. The ROC makes it especially easy to spot marketreversals. In a nutshell—when the ROC is rising (even from belowzero) we want to be in the market and we want to be out when itis falling. A fall from above zero indicates a market that hasrisen in the recent past but is now flat or falling. A fall belowzero is a declining market. A rise from below zero indicates a reversal from a decliningmarket. Remember in order to earn the 30% at the peak you have tohave been in the market for the entire previous year. In the RSI chart we see the NYSE in a sideways channel sinceJanuary, consequently the ROC has been falling and has evencrossed below its 12 month moving average. Since it has movedfrom the bottom of the channel to the top the return is stillabout 10% but we would not want to ride it down to zero! NYSE (RSI) and MovingAverage The relative strength is very close tooverbought again indicating another peak may be in the making. Inaddition, the overhead resistance of the channel should stop thecurrent rebound unless the market finds a lot more strengthsomewhere. The key we need to watch at this point is how high theRSI goes—will it just touch the over bought line andreverse? Or ... will it barely cross or ... strongly cross? If itdoes not cross, it will show a definite weakening of the overallmarket setting up for a big decline. However, if it replays lastSeptember—we would be in for more growth. This is not verylikely since the peaks have been getting progressively lower. The NYSE is above its moving average buthas tested both the 1 month and 6 month averages (see circles).This increased volatility is a sign for caution but the movingaverage has not yet flashed a sell signal. The combined ROC, RSI and moving average signals indicatecaution and that the return is declining. Once again, weare probably within 10% of the top. NASDAQ (RSI) The NASDAQ is currently overboughtsignaling a decline in the short term as we can see at point"A". Unless we get another double top in the RSI a`laApril-May 96, The market itself is probably making a lower highsignaling longer term weakness. Gold Relative Strength Despite all the talk and worry aboutinflation resuming Gold has done very poorly this year with themarket peaking the first week of February. Both representativesfor the FED and Treasury Secretary Rubin himself have been sayingfor months that inflation was not a problem. The market has beendisregarding their comments since they often prove to be smoke.But recently their comments have been on target. We have seen the RSI making lower peaks and it has just brokendown through its 3 month support line. However, RSI will probablymake a higher low just touching the 30% oversold line with theprice not breaking below July’s low. This would set thestage for the rebound due around October’s end. Our onecaution is that Rubin has said recently that the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) may be selling Gold soon to finance areduction in debt for "some of the world’s poorestnations." Bond Relative Strength Bondslatest plunge almost to the oversold line has provided theopportunity for a final bounce up to overbought. This willprobably be our exit signal and should correspond withGold’s plunge to oversold. This peak should exceedAugust’s peak and take BTTTX into the $23-24 range. Gold vs. Bond Ratio The ratio hasbeen favoring Bonds for the last few weeks. Last month Imentioned there was a distinct possibility of a"whipsaw" effect. As predicted it has crossed backbelow the 4 week moving average giving us that whipsaw. We havenot yet crossed the 8 week average but the timing of the crossingwill probably correspond with the ratio turning up favoring Gold,thus giving us another whipsaw in the opposite direction. It isunfortunate that we could not play this most recent rise. Eventhough both RSI and the moving average predicted it, it wassimply too short a move for a monthly newsletter or even for theweekly hotline. As we said last month the best we can hope for isto average into Gold at a good price. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP)� The MIP was righton the money again this month with a predicted very slight downtrend. Next month should be flat to slightly down and thefollowing month should be down a bit steeper. That will beOctober’s data which will be released in November. Thecoming uptrend will still only last about 3 months but at thispoint it looks fairly steep providing a short term profitpotential. There are two outside factors (which Dr. Moore referred to asAbnormally Severe Market Aberrations) that may affect theoutcome. The first is the possible IMF Gold Sales which couldflatten out this entire peak. The second would be an increase intensions with IRAQ which could aggravate the increase andmultiply the profit potential of Gold. Both of these factors areoutside the scope of technical analysis but we should be aware oftheir effects and be prepared for those possibilities. Platinum and Silver Ratios Platinumis still undervalued compared to Gold while Silver has moved downfrom overvalued to a more reasonable valuation. Silver may stillmove lower so our preference for the metals would be Platinumfirst, Gold second and Silver third. Commodity traders interestedin trading the spread would want to be long Platinum and shortSilver or possibly Gold. Health Relative Strength Ourproxy for the health industry, Franklin Global Health, aftergiving a good buy signal in mid-July, has risen nicely and is nowpeaking just above overbought (see circle). It is losing strengthas the lower peaks in the RSI indicate (see trendline). If thisis the final portion of this up thrust, the price has not madenew highs and we are probably in for a sizable decline. If,however, we see a drop in the RSI to halfway to the midpoint andthen another rise to overbought—as in March and April, wecould extend the Bull market a bit more. Transportation RelativeStrength FidelitySelect Transports provides our most interesting relative strengthchart this month. As we can see, it entered deep into oversoldterritory in July and did not have the strength to muster arebound above midpoint. In September it once again crossedoversold but by a much smaller margin. This provides a goodpositive divergence between lines "A" and"B". All that is necessary is a strong break throughline "C". Transports are dependent on Energy (seeEnergy RSI). Some of the recent weakness may be the result of themarket's inflation fears and tensions in the mid-east. But ...based strictly on RSI Transports look promising. Energy Relative Strength Energywas in an up-trend from November, 1995 - April, 1996, however,since then it has been basically sideways. Our RSI signaledoversold in late October and gave declining overbought signalsuntil May (the first circle) The following circles were allweaker and were the process of working out the strength exhibitedDecember - April. Of course we could see a couple of more spikesup (especially if Mid-East tensions accelerate), but the energyparty looks to be ending. In our August Energy section wementioned Clinton might pick a war with IRAN. That was nota misprint. It just happened that IRAQ provided a moreconvenient and palatable target at the time. Their loss—Mr.Clinton’s gain. U.S. Dollar RelativeStrength The Greenback has moved from mid-pointlast month to overbought this month without making new highs orcrossing the overbought line. This is not good news for theDollar. Although it did cross through downtrend line"A," it was stopped by flatter line "B" andnow faces resistance from steeper line "A". The RSI hasbeen making lower highs and this most recent push may be theresult of the recent action in Iraq. Overall the Dollar islooking weak. Fidelity Select ElectronicsRelative Strength Electronics is back to its old highs of ayear ago and is once again in overbought territory. Once again wemust watch the RSI for the next few weeks to determine whetherthis is true strength like March-August, 1995, or the end likeMay, 1996. It is probably the latter but since we have just comeoff an oversold point like July it is possible to go either way. Overall Indicators Overall the market looks more like a top than a new buyingopportunity. Most charts are in overbought territory with theexception of Transportation. The ROC is headed down and themoving average has been crossed downward twice in recent months.All the pieces continue to point toward caution. Updates In January our Aggressive Portfolio gave a buy signal forindividual Bonds based upon the RSI at the time. Ann Taylor(AAN.F) recently traded at $96.25 up from $83 in January. This isan increase of 16% in 8 months. This is in addition to theapproximately 9% you have earned in interest payments. A niceannualized 37.5%. Hechinger on the other hand is "only"up about 10% and has yielded about 10% interest for an annualized30%. Other recommendations: July’s AMD @ $11 is currently $143/8 and Valujet (VJET), which we recommended at $11, but by thetime you got the newsletter you could have bought it for $9.50,is currently at $12 1/8. Iomega (IOMG), which we projected would fall from $30 in Juneis currently $15 for 50% profit in three months! And is below ourtarget of $18 so you should take profits. However, its P/E isstill about 50 so it is still overpriced! The only loser on the list is June’s Syquest (SYQT) whichhas become even more of a bargain by falling from $9 to $6 3/8,.even though electronics as a whole are over bought.

The Big Picture Platinum and Silver Ratios Signs of a Top The NYSE RSI and Moving Average Gold (RSI) Energy Relative Strength Bond Relative Strength Health Relative Strength Gold vs. Bond Ratio Transports, NASDAQ and Electronics The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) U.S. Dollar (RSI) The Big Picture When I was first learning to drive, a bus driver friend said,“Always Watch the Big Picture.” By this he meant thatwhen driving we must be aware of what is ahead of us on the roadboth short and long range, what is beside us and may run acrossthe road, and what is coming up behind us to cause us trouble. The same is true of the stock market. We must be aware of longand short term trends, events happening around the world that mayimpact our investments and what things may be sneaking up behindus. Having grown up on Long Island, New York, I often think ofthe stock market as a giant traffic jam. Everyone is trying toget ahead as fast as possible. Obviously, the best approach is tofind the fastest moving lane and get in it. But as those of youwho have spent any time in traffic know, the fastest moving lanemay change a mile up the road so we must be prepared. Those tunedinto the traffic helicopter are the best prepared. At Financial Trend Forecaster we feel our job is to be thehelicopter to help keep you informed of “The BigPicture”. That is why we include such diverse things asCurrencies, Gold, Bonds, Inflation, large capitalization stocks(NYSE) and smaller stocks (NASDAQ) and various ways of looking ateach including Relative Strength and Moving Averages. If we understand the overall scheme of things and know that“x” should happen and how to profit when itdoes, then we just patiently wait for our opportunity to profit.Patience is rewarded perhaps because it is so difficult topossess. It has been said that developing a system and doggedlysticking to it is one of the best ways to profit in the stockmarket. Unfortunately, this is not the glamorous type ofinvesting many market participants are looking for. They want hottips and fancy stocks with good stories. But if you wantprofit—following the boring system month in and month out isthe best way to get it. The only other necessary ingredient is to avoid loss. One ofAmerica's all time best investors Warren Buffett has one rule:“Never Lose Money.” That may sound simplistic but it isnot so simple to put into practice. How, you might ask, can we always avoid loss? Unfortunately,very few have mastered the technique of never taking a loss, ifthey had they could be as rich as Mr. Buffett. There are,however, several steps we can take: Don't get caught up in emotion. Logically analyze the market and invest where the risks are smallest and the rewards are greatest (i.e., where the risk/reward ratio is greatest) Always exit the market early. Experts like Mr. Buffett often leave the market well before the top. By getting in within 10% of the bottom and getting out 10% before the top they take their 80% out of the middle! By doing this they avoid the high risk areas and preserve their capital for the next buying opportunity. Also, psychologically speaking, by avoiding the loss they are less “gun shy” about jumping back in when everyone else is devastated because they lost their shirt and want nothing to do with the market. This is easier said than done. At market tops everything is roses and why get out when things have been so good? 3) Have preset statistical models to base your actions on,so you don't rely upon emotion. A good example is our movingaverage. When the average says it is time to exit, do it! Thisway we may leave a bit on the table but we haven't taken a loss.Some investors believe that leaving something behind is the sameas taking a loss (i.e., they didn't get out at the top sothey made a mistake). This is a very dangerous philosophy becauseit causes us to overstay our welcome and usually involves abigger loss in the long run. No one can be exactly right everytime so it is better to err on the side of caution. Markets oftenlose gains that took years to accumulate in months or even weeks.So, a short delay in exiting often means the difference between again and a loss. Signs of a Top Now that we know what we should be doing when the “BigPicture” indicates a top is at hand, what are the road signsof an impending top? There are several and some are quite vagueincluding the “feel” of a top. What does a top feellike? New investors have come out of the woodwork. People who have never invested before think they can get rich by following their broker's advice. (Remember if that were true your broker would be getting rich off the market rather than off commissions.) TV Commercials refer to the stock market off handedly as the way to get rich. The kid who mows your lawn and the cashier at the grocery store have a broker. “Everyone” knows the market goes up and the unthinkable is a 10% decline. Investment newsletters proliferate. Multitudes of companies without a single product on the market yet are having IPO's (initial public stock offerings) that make new millionaires of their Presidents/CEOs. (e.g. Internet stocks). Based upon these criteria I have seen 5 of the above in thelast couple of months, only #3 is lacking but I have heard ofsimilar occurrences. More concrete signs of tops are: 1) increased volatility, 2)increased daily volume, 3) crossing down through the movingaverages, 4) long periods with the Relative Strength index aboveor well above the overbought line followed by dips down throughthe overbought line, 5) Markets not reaching old highs, etc. Taken as a whole these signs, both concrete and based upon“feel”, indicate that we may very well be within 10% ofthe top. I have begun taking some chips off the table in mypersonal portfolios. Those positions that have not performed well during a strongbull market probably will not do better as the market weakens(unless they were chosen as insurance against market weakness).It is probably a good time to review your portfolio and begincleaning house. Selling poor performers into whatever strengthremains is much better than selling into weakness as the marketbegins declining. What to do with our winners is more difficult. Since the NYSEindex has crossed back up through its 6 month moving average wehave an indication of increased volatility but not a clear sellsignal. This, however, is a warning signal which usually occurswithin 10% of the top, so cautious investors may want to considerselling some of the winners, too. Selling half of any winnersthat have doubled would be prudent at this point. We do not havean all out sell signal yet but caution is definitely warranted. Fortunately, our gold/ bond ratio will continue to oscillatewithout regard to what the stock market is doing so we mustcontinue to watch for the switch point. Gold (RSI) The Gold Relative Strength index has made progressively higherlows, from below oversold in June to just touching oversold inJuly to just below midpoint in August. These are definitelysignals of building strength and as I have said on the Hotlinesince early July it may be prudent to begin phasing into gold Bond Relative Strength Bonds are showing weakness with the most recent up move noteven crossing the over bought line. Peak “B” looksominously similar to the first half of peak “A” exceptit occurred below the line rather than above it. To get a goodsell signal we should have a move above the over bought line,although a really weak market could end without it. Gold vs. Bond Ratio The Gold vs. Bond ratio has moved up sharply this weekindicating Gold has been out performing Bonds recently. Duringthe prior month however, the ratio has been flat within the rangeI mentioned last month as the most common range for reversals.The recent uptick is primarily a result of the recently releasedCPI data. This, however, has resulted in the ratio crossingupward through its 4 week moving average (see circle“A”). It has also been strong enough to cross upwardthrough its 8 week moving average. Technically, we have a buysignal for Gold. So both the ratio and RSI favors a switch toGold at this point. However, this causes a dilemma since the MIPis predicting a down turn next month. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) Last month's most likely line was right on the nose with themost recent inflation rate coming in at 2.95%, not thegovernment's rounded 3%. As we said last month the numbers almosthad to go up since a zero was falling out of the calculation. Themarket, however, does not understand this statistical anomaly andhas taken this increase as a confirmation that inflation isincreasing and an excuse to buy Gold. As we can see from thechart, though, the next three months will most likely be downwith the highest extreme being basically flat. This shouldprovide an opportunity to get into Gold at cheaper prices thanthose currently available. The up move following this declinelooks fairly steep at this point but short lived. The MIP is primarily a long term predictive (leading)indicator while the RSI is a short term predictor and the ratiois based exclusively on prior events and is therefore a laggingindicator. Normally, what that would mean is that the MIP would signal achange in direction, which would later be confirmed by the RSIand finally by the Ratio moving average. What has happened thispast month, however, is that a short up move was predicted by theMIP confirmed by the RSI and finally by the Moving average. Sofar everything is as expected. But since the up move was of suchshort duration the MIP is now predicting a down move which“should” be followed by confirmation in the Movingaverage (probably looking much like a whipsaw). However the RSImay be indicating the overall building strength which willculminate in the Gold up move later this year. What does all this mean for our investments? Well, a stricttechnician would follow the moving average and RSI indicators andswitch into Gold and take a chance on being whipsawed out. A gambler would hold out hoping the coming drop would wipe outthe gains that Gold is currently making and provide a betterentry point (which is a distinct possibility). But I believe arational cautious individual would begin phasing funds into Goldusing some sort of cost averaging system. Since we are looking at a flat period of 3 to 4 months (whichmay see Bonds moving primarily sideways anyway) you may divideyour bond holdings at this point into four parts and move � intoGold Funds now and � in each of the next three months ondeclines in the price of Gold. This way you should get in at afairly good average price. Platinum and Silver Ratios Since we are considering moving back into Metals we need tolook at the ratio of Gold to Platinum and also to Silver. As wecan see here Platinum is undervalued compared to Gold, whilesilver is overvalued (and has been for a couple of years). ButSilver is not as closely linked to Gold as Platinum so the ratiois not as reliable. Based upon this chart we probably want tohave a portion of our funds in Platinum to get a little extrabang for our buck. As it returns to more normal valuations itshould appreciate a bit faster than Gold. Similarly, we wouldwant to avoid Silver Stocks as they should under perform Gold. The NYSE RSI and MovingAverage The NYSE Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hoveringaround the 60% mark for the entire month of August. The markethas not been showing much strength although it has regained about2/3 of last month's loss but it has met a lot of resistance. TheNYSE briefly crossed below both its 4 week and 6 month movingaverage and was even confirmed by the 4 week crossing downthrough the 6 month but as we can see in the circle it hascrossed back up through both in typical whipsaw fashion. Theincrease in volatility that this whipsaw indicates along with theflattening of the 6 month average indicates that the end isprobably near and we should begin looking to the exits asmentioned in the lead article. Energy Relative Strength As our proxy for all Energy Stocks, Fidelity is looking a bitweak with what looks like the start of a peak at point“A” being lower than point “B”. Also if“A” is peaking below the overbought line we aren'tseeing much strength here so the only hope for energy stocks isthe rumored war Clinton is going to start with Iran to getreelected. It sounds like a long shot but time will tell. If awar does materialize it would also be good for Gold and bad forthe Stock market. At this point it is only a rumor but it pays tofactor the possibility into the “big picture.” Health Relative Strength The very deep plunge in the health RSI last month is stillscary. Usually, a plunge of that depth will be followed byseveral more tests of the oversold line with the price of thefund reaching lower lows with every test. The sideways movementat midpoint rather than a strong move to the upside as in May of95 also suggests weakness. Transports, NASDAQ andElectronics Both Transports and Electronics are showing the same typepattern as Health as is the entire NASDAQ but their plunges inJuly were not quite as weak. as health. Due to space limitationswe will only show Transports but if you note the similarity withhealth you will see the unfolding pattern that is beginning togrip the entire market. U.S. Dollar (RSI) The Dollar Relative Strength Index also bottomed in July notquite as badly as the stock markets but significantly enough forconcern about the greenback's safety in the coming months. Youwill note the decided downtrend in both the Dollar index and theRSI. I believe caution is also warranted in the Dollar. BeContrary Remember: It only pays to be a contrarian at tops and bottoms(i.e. reversal point) when the market is trending upstrongly and down strongly everyone knows about it. Knowing whento exit the party is the hard part! Do yourself a favor and takesome chips off the table.

U.S. Dollar Index Benham 2020 RSI Microsoft Update Benham Gold RSI Gold Bond Ratio NYSE Indes RSI The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Platinum/Gold Ratio U.S. Dollar Index Back in our July issue we said “The Dollar is now atthe low end of it's range and we expect a rebound over the nextfew months”. As we can see from the attached chart,almost from that moment our prediction began materializing.During the following six weeks the dollar rose from 81 (point A)to 87.05 (point B). In the following month our lead articlediscussed how to profit from currency fluctuations. In that article I said that the Dollar has been in a primarydowntrend for the last ten years but was in the process of takinga temporary break to the upside. Betting against the dollar infavor of the Mark, Yen and Swiss Franc in the long term isgenerally a safe bet. But in the short run we were due for acorrection. In our September Issue I showed you the Multi-currencysandwich in which you buy one currency and sell (short) another.That is exactly what the “Big Boys” did in August. Theyborrowed Yen and bought U.S. Treasury Notes. This is exactly whatcaused the rapid rise of the Dollar and put a cap on the price ofYen. The reason I am recounting all this again is because of itseffect on our current situation. We must remember that we are nowin a very integrated global market where actions in Japan oftenaffect how markets in New York react. The “Big Boys”were short Yen and Long Treasuries. At some point they had tocover their shorts (preferably before the Yen rose). This isexactly what has been happening over the last few months! Thishas pulled Billions of Dollars from the US T-Bond market and putit back into Yen. The effect of this overhead selling pressure is that wheneverT-Bonds showed any signs of strength it was pushed back downagain. So even though our positions in Bonds should havetheoretically been profitable, the currency market has beenrobbing our profits. As we can see from the chart, Points “B” and“C” corresponded with over-bought conditions on theRelative Strength Index (RSI) and the Dollar dropped shortlythereafter. We are currently at point “D” and are onceagain overbought and expecting a short term drop in the Dollar.If it crosses through its support line we can expect it to resumeits 10 year downtrend. But we may see another bounce off itssupport line and another testing of its upper resistance line. The peaks appear to have an approximately two month cycle andthe support and resistance are converging so we should be tradingin a relatively narrow range until we get a breakout in onedirection or the other. [Top of Page] Microsoft Update In our August issue I said that I expected Windows95 to bevery profitable for Microsoft and that it would trade above itshighs of 110. At the time it was trading in the low 90's with aP/E of over 40. (P/E is price divided by earnings—a measureof the value of each share. Low P/E's, <10, are generallyconsidered a bargain.) As of this writing it is trading around113 with a P/E of 35.9. The P/E dropped primarily due to theincrease in earnings from Windows95! Had you purchased MSFT atthat recommendation and held it until now you would be up about21 � % in 8 months! In our December issue we covered the cyclical nature ofMicrosoft suggesting that you could buy it on dips to the 90range and sell around 100. Since December there has only been onesuch dip which could have yielded you better than 10% in 6 weeks! Microsoft is still acting cyclically, although in a higherrange, but is nearing the top of an eight week cycle so cautionis advised. Note: 16 week peaks are marked with an arrow, eight weekpeaks are marked with an “8”. [Top of Page] Gold Bond Ratio [Top of Page] The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) The MIP is showing only a slight incline through June althoughthe investment press has begun zeroing in on inflation as thenext big news. The current increase in the price of Grains andOil has caught their attention although Gold has been downsignificantly. There is still quite a bit of evidence that long terminterest rates are still too high but our MIP is showing signs ofinflation on the horizon. It is very possible that bothBonds and Gold will begin to rise in the short term. If the Fedcuts interest rates again to bring Long Term Rates in line, Bondsmay benefit while at the same time grain and commodity pricesincluding oil are putting upward pressure on inflation. This is a perfect example of where we need to watch our Bondvs. Gold Ratio very carefully. Lately we have had severaldownward breaks through the moving average which is typical of aratio that is relatively flat (usually at turning points). So wemay continue to see alternating crossings through the averageuntil a trend in one direction or the other materializes. At this point Bonds have crossed the four week moving averageagain and has bounc the eight week average. An 8 week crossing ismuch less likely to get “whipsawed”. Theoretically,Bonds should out perform Gold for the next few months but we needto keep one eye on the ratio and the other on the exits. Since February the following commodities are basically flat (i.e.,although they have been volatile they have gone nowhere) Lumber,Cotton, Cocoa, Broilers, Coffee, Milk, and Sugar. These basicstaples among others have not shown signs of inflation yet andEggs are down as much as Gold. Gold and the previously mentioned commodities peaked inFebruary so we must be careful listening to the establishmentpress. Oil and Grains may be signaling the coming increase butthe MIP is telling us the real inflation is not in store untilthe second half of 1996 and the Gold/Bond ratio chart is sayingthat for the short term Bonds should out perform Gold. Probablywhen the press decides there was nothing to the rally it willbegin in earnest. [Top of Page] Benham 2020 (RSI) At this point Bonds are still in the oversold range on theRelative Strength chart (but rising) so we are still expecting arise into the overbought side before a reversal. [Top of Page] Benham Gold (RSI) Gold, however, is also entering the oversold side settingitself up for a potential rise before too long. Gold ought to approach the extremely oversold line before weconsider another buy signal. So here we have Bond's strengthrising and Gold's strength falling in typical opposite pairfashion. We want to continue holding Bonds until that situationreverses. [Top of Page] NYSE INDEX (RSI) The Relative Strength Index made one dip into oversoldterritory as a result of the almost 2.9% drop earlier this month.This could be considered the drop we were expecting and a buysignal but the overall pattern suggests that we might be in foranother dip. If so it should take the RSI below the extremelyoversold line. If we are in for inflation later this year, it will probablybring higher interest rates and pull some capital from the StockMarket. There are still opportunities in select situations but cautionis advised.

Earn Interest on Your Gold! Benham 2020 RSI The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Benham Gold RSI The Budget and Government NYSE Indes RSI Gold vs. Bond Ratio The Beginning Investor Earn Interest on YourGold! Last month we discussed the ratio of Gold vs. Bonds. As wesaw, the ratio is often a better indicator of the true value of acommodity than its price in dollars.Last month we discussed theratio of Gold versus Bonds As we saw the ratio is often a betterindicator of the true value of a commodity than its price indollars. This month I woulde like towill take a look at the ratioof Gold to Platinum. Since 1990 the ratio has stayed in aelativelynarrow range— primarily between .95 and 1.15. As wecan see from the following chart there have been two instances(circled) in the last five years where Platinum has actually soldfor less than Gold. . On January 1, 1992, Platinum reached a lowof 95.7% of the price of Gold and on July 1, 1993, the ratioreached a low of 98%.On January 1 1992 Platinum reached a low of95.7% of the price of Gold and on July 1,1993 the ratio reached alow of 98%. In the first instance, it tookin less than nine months for theratio to reached above 110% (point “A”) and in thesecond it only took one month! (point “B”) There areseveral ways to profit from this ratio. The first assumes thatyou will always be holding either Gold or Platinum. This is anexcellent strategy for multiplying our emergency Gold holdings. As I have said many times, we should be holding a portion ofour total assets in precious metals as a hedge against crisis.These include those created by governments such as war,inflation, and bond defaults. It also includes those created byterrorists, oil companies, etc. Our first method of profiting is to watch the ratio and toswitching a portion of our assets from Gold to Platinum wheneverthe ratio crosses below 105%. Should the ratio go below 100% wewould add to our Platinum position. We would then switch backinto Gold whenever the ratio crossed above 110%. Should the ratiogo below 100% we would add to our platinum position. A goodguideline would be to switch half50% of our gGold to pPlatinumbelow 105% and the other half50% below 100%. If the ratio movessignificantly above 110% we could use options to increase ourprofit (seesee method #2). Let's suppose we followed this strategy in January of 1992with Gold at $353, Platinum at $338 and the ratio at 95.7%.Let'ssuppose we had followed this strategy in January of 1992 withGold at 353, Platinum at 338 and the ratio at 95.7%. We couldhave sold 10 ounces of Gold for $3530. With that we couldpurchase 10.44 ounces of Platinum. On August 1, just eight monthslater, the price of gGold had fallen to $342 but Platinum hadrisen to $384.50. At this point our 10.44 ounces is worth$4014.18 and we can exchange it for 11.74 ounces of gGold. Indollar terms we would have made 13.7%. As I have said before,even if Platinum had fallen in price it is the ratio thatcountsbecause since we increased the ounces of Gold we held.Incidentally, in this instance we would have increased our Goldholdings by 17.4% instead of “just” 13.7%. If we followed this strategy in July, 1993, we could have soldour 10 ounces of Gold for $3920. and bought 10.18 ounces ofPlatinum. oOne month later Gold had fallen to $375 and Platinumhad risen to $416. iIf we cashed in at that point we would havereceived $4235 which we could have exchanged for 11.29 ounces ofGold. wWith perfect hindsight we can see that at that point weshould have sold the Platinum for cash and held it a month andbought gGold at $355! However, foresight is never quite as goodas hindsight. If we ignore the one month exchange and wait untilthe two month point, we have a good example of why we need towatch the ratio and not the price.However, had we missed the onemonth exchange and waited until the two month point we have agood example of why we need to watch the ratio and not the price.At this point Gold is selling for $355 and pPlatinum is $360. soThethe ratio is still 107% and falling so we should still switchto gGold at this point. oOur 10.18 ounces of Platinum is worth$3664.80 or 10.32 ounces of Gold. sSo even though the Platinum wewere holding fell in price, we still increased our holdings! By December the ratio was once again at 95.8%— with Goldat $382 and Platinum at $366 —so we could exchange our 10.32ounces of Gold for 10.77 oz.unces of Platinum. tThis we wouldhave held for a year and a half until May, 1995, when the ratiowas 114% with Gold up a mere $7 and Platinum at $446. aAtt thispoint our 10.77 ounces of Platinum was worth 12.35 ounces ofGold! In this way rather than our Gold “insurance policy”resulting in a loss of interest it is earning us interest. The second method of using the ratio is using futures oroptions. WheneverWhen ever the ratio is trending down you wouldbe long Gold and short Platinum. This can be done several ways, e.g.,by buying a Gold Call or contract and selling a Platinum Call orContract or by buying a Gold Call and Buying a Platinum Put.Thiscan be done several ways i.e. by buying a Gold Call or contractand sell a Platinum call or contract or by buying a Gold Call andBuying a Platinum Put. These are called covered Contracts orSpreads. They involve a lot less risk than “Naked”Contracts and require a much smaller outlay (or margin). Thereason for the minimized risk (and cost) is that they tend totravel in the same direction so your losses on one are covered bythe gains on the other. In our case where our Platinum fell inprice our gGold Contract would have increased in value. The final use for the Platinum Gold Ratio is in deciding whatto buy. If we are buying additional metals for our insuranceposition or if we are buying metals stock in our MIP strategy wecan use the ratio to decide which is preferable.If we areplanning on buying additional metals for our insurance positionor if we are buying metals stock in our MIP strategy we can usethe ratio to decide which is preferable. If the ratio is risingwe would buy Platinum or Platinum Stocks and if it is falling wewould buy Gold or Gold Stocks. As of March 22, 1996, the ratio had just crossed below 105%and looked as iflike it might be turning up. So if we follow theplan outlined in our first method we should be switching aportion (perhaps half) of our holdings into Platinum. Should the ratio resume it's downward motion below 100% wewould switch the remainder of our Gold into Platinum. When theratio moves above 110% we should switch back to Gold. I will beadding this ratio chart to our regular features. Caution: A key factor in profiting from thisratio is to not pay too high a premium to the dealer. You shouldalways compare prices and shop dealers. Often one will have asurplus while the other has a shortage. This can result in pricedifferences of as much as 10% (either doubling or eliminatingyour profit). Silver and Gold Report (SGR), P.O. Box 109665, Palm Beach, FL33410, regularly publishes a listing of price comparisons ofvarious dealers. In addition they warn of unscrupulous practicesand vendors. Their newsletter is highly recommended. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) Our Moore Inflation Predictor looks very much different fromlast month for several reasons. The first reason is that duringthe month of March the Bureau of Labor Statistics released twosets of Consumer Price Data.The first reason is that during themonth of march two sets of Consumer Price Data were released. TheJanuary data was released in early -in March rather thanmid-February due to the second government shutdown. Then tTwoweeks later they released the February data was released. sSothis chart actually combines changes that normally would bespread over two charts. But even that does not completely explainthe major differences that exist between the two charts. During normal periods we could skip a month and never noticeit, because the chart is so accurate over a 6 month time frame.During this period, however, the December index showed adeflation while January showed double growth. This is what may have happened: Due toBecause of thegovernment shutdown some pencil pushers at the Bureau of Laborstatistics got behind in their work so they fudged some of thenumbers. This resulted in a false deflation in the Decembernumbers. When the actual index was calculated for the month ofJanuary, it revealed that the index had not fallen at all, butnow was two months higher than at the end of November (see indexnumbers on last page).When the actual index was calculated forthe month of January it revealed that the index had not fallen atall but now was two months higher than at the end of November. This is similar to what happens occasionally when our electricmeters are read only every other month. During the estimatedmonth our bill may appear extremely high or low but the followingmonth when the company reads the actual numbers our bill is onceagain correct.During the estimated month our bill may appearextremely high or low but the following month when the actualnumbers are read our bill is corrected. In the case of the CPI, though, the market participants are soshort-sighted, they forget that the previous month was down. Theyseem to think that since the monthly inflation is reading twiceas high as before that inflation has risen dramatically.In thecase of the CPI though- The market participants are so shortsighted, they forget that last month was down and think thatsince the monthly inflation is reading twice as high as lastmonth that inflation has risen dramatically. Consequently, themarket has bid up Gold and trashed bBonds. I believe that the market was a bit premature in signaling thedeath of bBonds. Unfortunately, this unique twist of the numberscombined with the uncertainty surrounding the budget process hasreally done a number on Bondsbonds. The CPI has registered asingle down month so far and we are expecting at least two morewhich ought to pull Bondsbonds out of their slump. After that thecurrent MIP chart is projecting a fairly steep rise. If the risein the CPI materializes as depicted by the median line (which isusually the most likely) we would see a very steep rise in Goldprices later this year. Normally, I put a great deal of faith in the MIP'sprojections., hHowever, due to the skewing of the recent numbersI am not so sure that the rise will be as steep as currentlyprojected. However, even if the actual CPI only follows thebottom line we are still in for a fairly steep rise in Goldprices due to the October- January climb. When we allow for theusual lag this ought to result in a steep climb in Gold pricesbeginning November- December and ending around next March. As it appears right now the window of opportunity for Bondsshould be ending around June or July. Hopefully cCongress and thePresident will get their act together before then. From thatpoint on we may stick with Gold for the remainder of the year ortry to play the decline from August through October.From there onwe may stick with Gold for the remainder of the year or try toplay the decline from August through October. But we willdefinitely need to wait for more data before making any firmcommitments. The Budget and Government As of this writing the congress is proposing a one weekextension of the temporary funding. Which would extend it untilMarch 29th. It appears that the extensions are getting shorterand Clinton has threatened not to accept any more short termextensions. I really don't see how he has much choice. What canhe say? Close down the Government again, I'm not taking the moneyyou're giving me. I think he may have realized what I have beensaying all along. The temporary extensions are really the same asa budget cut since they use lower numbers than would probablyappear in a “real” budget. So as far as the Republicansare concerned no budget is as good as the budget cuts they areafter. They just budget the money one month at a time and theyhave strict control over what they fund and what they don't! Interestingly enough, now they are talking about giving upsome of that control to the President. The Presidential line itemveto which has languished in both the Senate and House for monthssuddenly found new life when Dole essentially clinched theRepublican nomination. The reason of course is that now Dolewants it, previously the Republicans did not want to give it toClinton and the Democrats fought it for years. It appears that itactually stands a chance of passing and Clinton wants it, so itwill not be Vetoed. I think it is a good thing, it does not letthe President change matters of policy but it does let him reduceor eliminate (but not raise) funding for individual programs. Itcould go a long way toward reducing the budget deficit and porkbarrel projects. It could face Constitutional challenges but 43of the 50 states have similar provisions for their Governor andthese have withstood the challenge. Incidentally the Republicansmay attach it to their budget proposal as a carrot to get thePresident to agree! Gold vs. Bond Ratio As we can see from the current Ratio Chart the ratio hasleveled off, i.e., points “A” and “B” arevirtually equal. At this point this looks like a toppingformation. My only concern on a technical basis is the fact thatpoint “B” was higher than point “A”, eventhough it was very marginal. The pattern would be much clearer ifit was marginally lower rather than higher. Point “C” actually crossed below the moving averagegiving us a buy signal which only lasted two days as it crossedback above the average. This is a classical “whip-saw”as discussed last month. Point “D” came to rest on theaverage but bounced back above. What really matters is whether the ratio makes a new high ordrops below the moving average. By the time you read this we mayhave our confirmation. Please check the hotline for the currentstatus. Benham 2020 (RSI) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Benham 2020 (see chartabove) has bounced around the oversold line all month (circled).The RSI line is also showing divergence with the price indicatingthat Bonds are very ripe for a rebound. Primarily the Governmentshenanigans have pushed Bonds well below where they should be. Benham Gold (RSI) In a perfect world the Bond rally would have coincided withthe Gold decline beginning at point “A”, but for thelast month both Bonds and Gold have been in decline (and thestock market hasn't done that well either). This has resulted ina relatively flat (though volatile) ratio over the last month. As we can see the (RSI) is hovering in mid-range and is notgiving us any signal after the circled sell signal. The Budget and Government As of this writing congress is proposing an extension of thetemporary funding until March 29th. It appears that theextensions are getting shorter and Clinton has threatened not toaccept any more short term extensions. I really do not see how he has much choice. What can he say?“Close down the Government again. I'm not taking the moneyyou're giving me.” I think he may have realized what I havebeen saying all along. The temporary extensions are really thesame as a budget cut since they use lower numbers than wouldprobably appear in a “real” budget. As far as the Republicans are concerned no budget is as goodas the budget cuts they are after. They just budget the money onemonth at a time and they have strict control over what they fundand what they don't! Interestingly enough, now they are talkingabout giving up some of that control to the President. The Presidential line item veto which has languished in boththe Senate and House for months suddenly found new life when Doleessentially clinched the Republican nomination. The reason, ofcourse, is that now Dole wants it. Previously the Republicans didnot want to give it to Clinton and the Democrats have fought itfor years. It stands a good chance of passing and Clinton wants it, so itwill not be vetoed. It could go a long way toward reducing thebudget deficit and pork barrel projects. It does not let thePresident change matters of policy but it does let him reduce oreliminate (but not raise) funding for individual programs. It could face Constitutional challenges but 43 of the 50states have similar provisions for their Governors and these havewithstood the challenge. Incidentally, the Republicans may attachit to their budget proposal as a carrot to get the President toagree to their budget! NYSE INDEX (RSI) Due to the importance to the overall market and all ourinvestments, this month we have added another new chart basedupon the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the overall New YorkStock Exchange Composite Index. We choose the NYSE because it isa broad based index giving us a much better indication of theoverall market than an index like the Dow. Even though the index itself has stayed in the same range forthe last month it is developing a very weak pattern. The threepeaks over the last month appear almost level but they areactually volatile lower highs. The first was at 351.70 (the alltime high) the second was at 350.94 and the third was at 350.75. The relative strength index shows a much different picture asthe relative strength drops drastically. This alone should be considered a caution signal! The RSI index was in extremely overbought territory and hascrossed downward through the overbought line which is a sellsignal. Combined with the market volatility and the divergence inthe RSI peaks vs. the Index peaks we have a very negativesituation. Unless the index makes a new high soon, I would not besurprised to see a 10% correction in the next couple of months. Timothy McMahon The Beginning Investor Reading The MIP Chart The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is a predictor ofthe inflation rate for the coming 12 months. It is extremelyaccurate over a six month time frame and accurately forecaststurning points out to the 1 year mark. The vertical axis is the inflation rate in percent while thehorizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chart is the actual historical ConsumerPrice Index (CPI-U). While the right side is the predicted CPI-U. The right side consists of several diverging lines starting ata "You are here" arrow. The median line is the mostlikely prediction for the future CPI-U with likely highs and lowsdiverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. By focusing on the median line you can easily see futureturning points in the CPI-U index. An increase in this index usually translates into an increasein the price of Gold, Gold stocks and other precious metals andcommodities. A decrease in the CPI-U index usually indicates a decrease ininflation hedges and an increase in Bonds, Utilities and otherinterest sensitive instruments. CPI UP = GOLD UP CPI DOWN. = BONDS UP CPI Data- By annualizing the CPI-U Data from various time spans we canget an idea of the likely range over the next year's time frame.Keep in mind that 1 and 2 month rates have very little long-termsignificance. The Basic Portfolio- For the simplest portfolio stay with the Benham Family. Wehave chosen Benham for three reasons. It has a good Gold Fund. It has a long term Bond Fund that is usually the most volatile (i.e. provides the greatest upside potential during up moves) It has several alternatives for parking funds during periods of uncertainty. Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham GoldEquity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. New Money Any funds recently freed up should follow the "NewMoney" indicator. Volatility Our greatest ally and biggest foe is volatility. We rely uponlarge changes in the prices of our funds during relatively shortperiods of time. This can result in short term losses if weswitch directions too early. This is referred to as "drawdown" i.e. in the long run we made money but in the meantime, our account showed a temporary paper loss. Some investorshave difficulty handling large draw downs. They should follow theconservative approach. Diversification All investors should diversify by investing a portion of theirportfolio using several other investment approaches including-well selected individual securities, mutual funds and otherappropriate investments. Our goal is to maximize overallportfolio performance with a minimum of risk. Insurance Gold Every investor should have a portion (usually 10-15% or 1yrsliving expenses) of their assets in physical Gold and/or Silver(coins and/or bullion). This should be considered insuranceagainst market chaos and is not an investment. The cost of thisinsurance is the missed interest. Relative Strength Relative Strength Indices (RSI) provide advance warning ofprices that are either very overbought (too high) or veryoversold (too low). Certain patterns also indicate a comingincrease or decrease in prices. Relative Strength is verysensitive and often provides very early signals (sometimes tooearly).

The Beginning Investor Right on Target Current Positioning The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) CPI-U Inflation Rate Data Reading the MIP Chart Charts Right on Target Our predictions in last month's issue were “ontarget” on several counts. The first was the Federal ReserveBoard of Governor's (Hereafter referred as FED) lowering of keyinterest rates. As predicted the FED lowered rates by 1/4 of apercent at their January meeting, although the meeting lastedlonger than we expected. As expected this resulted in a surge inbond prices. Gold also surged there after a week on Budget fears as we saidit might. Gold will continue to remain volatile until a budget isfinally in place. Every rumor that a budget compromise is at handwill deflate the price of Gold while every rumor to the contrarywill give the yellow metal a strong boost. Also right on target was our prediction of Treasury SecretaryRubin's expansion of the Treasury's borrowing power. Right onschedule he created $19.7 Billion. This time the slight of handwas accomplished by tapping the Civil Service Retirement Fund for$6.4 Billion, siphoning $3.9 Billion from the currencystabilization fund and $800 million from early payments by thepost office. The final $8.6 Billion came from “The FederalFinancing Bank exchanging assets for Treasury securities,” i.e.,monetizing the debt. This slight of hand was one of Dr. Moore'spet peeves. He was fond of saying the FED is a private bank notat all “Federal” and the “assets” are not anymore real than the paper they were exchanged for. At this point we don't know how many more tricks Rubin has uphis sleeve, but at some point all he will have left up his sleeveis his arm! Let's hope a budget compromise is at hand beforethen.. With both Bonds and Gold surging, the thought that must remainupper-most in our minds is the performance of the ratio ofGold to Bonds. This concept was referred to by Dr. Moore as“opposite pairs.” The concept is of primary importance in our investmentstrategy so I have included a chart of this ratio here. I havealso decided because of its extreme supreme importance to ourinvestment strategy that it will be a regular part of comingissues. As we can see from point “A” through point“C” the ratio was in a basic uptrend. An interestingpoint to note is that through the months of November and Decemberboth Gold and Bonds were performing well (i.e. rising) atfirst glance that may seem inconsistent to our basic premise of“opposites”. Obviously, Gold and Bonds do not have a true 100% negativecorrelation. In actuality, the average gold and bond mutual fundsover the last 8 years have had a negative .17 correlation. Thismeans that about 58.5% of the time they react oppositely but41.5% percent of the time they travel in the same direction! Atfirst this may appear to invalidate our opposites theory but thisis why we must focus on the ratio! By using the MIP we can predict which factor should beoutperforming the other and by combining other indicators werefine the timing for the switch point. Remember, in the market there are very few natural absolutes.The only truly negative correlation's are “artificial”such as those created by the Rydex funds, in whichwhere one issimply a mirror of the other. I was recently asked by asubscriber why we don't use such funds. There are severalreasons,. The main ones are the high minimum investmentrequirements and the extreme timing accuracy needed (which wouldbe virtually impossible in a monthly newsletter). As I mentioned several issues ago our major concern is tocontinually compound the number of shares we own. To do this wewant to be in the fund that is performing the best of our pair.Suppose we switched into Gold funds at point “A” whenthe ratio is .47 and into Bonds again at point “C” withthe ratio at .64. In this one single round trip we would havebeen able to increase our share holdings by about 36%. This wasaccomplished in a couple of short months! This is based strictlyon the ratio and it does not matter whether one rose while theother fell or whether both rose or both fell. All that matters isthat we have increased the number of shares that we own. The reason the actual price does not matter in the short runis because in the long run both bonds and gold tend to be flat!It may seem to be a bit contradictory but it is true. The major point most “gold bugs” rely upon is thatgold tends to retain its value in times of inflation (and atother times as well). Bonds on the other hand lock in a fixednumber of dollars which the purchaser is guaranteed at some pointin the future. Both these are signs of stability(In the longrun)! (In the long run.) However, in the short term, however, theratio gets extremely out of whack. When this happens, we have theopportunity to compound the number of shares we hold and awaitthe eventual return to normalcy. Over the last 5 years the ratio has been as high as 1.25 andas low as .456 , but overall it has reversed direction manytimes. Since, our major consideration is timing those reversals, Ihave been working on developing a more conservative approach totracking the trend. Our Relative Strength Index (RSI) has a “hairtrigger” and is usually quite early in predicting turns. Itsignaled a turn in the making in early January. This is anexcellent early warning system but we must combine it withother indicators to consistently profit from the reversals.Without charting the actual ratio it is extremely difficult tosee where we stand. So in addition to the “early warning system” of RSI,I am going to be including the “Late warning system” ofthe moving average (see chart on page 1). By definition when theactual price (in this case the ratio) crosses through its movingaverage a change in direction is signaled. By definition this alwayshappens after the turn has occurred. As we can see at circle “B” if we rely strictly uponthis crossing we have missed a portion of the up move. Thecrossing, however, is a good confirmation that the direction hasin fact switched. Unfortunately, moving averages are not perfect., as we can seein the weeks following point “B,” we received several“whipsaw” signals, signaling several reversals. Thesewhipsaws can be reduced by using a longer term moving average. but However, the longer the average the larger the portions ofthe move to be missed. For our purposes the 4 week averageappears to be fairly good when combined with the Moore InflationPredictor (MIP). In the November - December period, for instance,we would ignore the whipsaws because the MIP had not turned yet. In future issues I will be basing the Conservativeapproach which will rely Portfolio more heavily upon the movingaverage while the more aggressive approach Portfolio will relymore upon the RSI,. Both will still rely heavily upon theextremely accurate MIP for overall timing indications. Turns usually occur when the price (ratio) is at an extremedistance from the moving average, such as we see at both points“A” and “C.” I fully expected point“D” to cross the average but a final spike in goldprices combined with a drop in Government Bonds (probably due tomarket and budget worries) caused a bounce off the average. The ensuing rise appears to be ending, so by the time you readthis we may have a downward moving average penetration and if soit will be noted on our Hotline [(804) 929-6732]. I firmly believe the addition of the ratio chart and movingaverage will greatly enhance our performance over the comingmonths and conservative investors still have time to make theswitch to bond funds. Truly conservative investors should waitfor the penetration confirming the change in trend direction. TheBond (see Back Page) Relative Strength Index (RSI) iscurrently indicating a very strong buy signal. The Moore InflationPredictor As we can see, the MIP shows we have a long way to go down ininterest rates over the next few months. The shutdown of theGovernment shutdown during December and January may have skewedthe figures a bit because of the significant decrease in themoney being pumped into the economy by government employees. Baring an “accident” like a major outbreak of war orbudget battles we should continue to see bonds perform well forthe next several months. Our term, coined by Jim Moore, for these“accidents” is Abnormally Severe Market Aberrations(ASMA's).(ASMA's). As investors we must watch the news for these ASMA's and tryto determine the eventual effect of them upon our investments. At this point many market participants seem to believe thatBudget battles are good for Gold (and to the extent that theylead to market uncertainty they are) but that is only a shortterm effect. In the long term having no budget is actuallyrestrictive on the money supply and has the exact oppositeeffect. The reason for this is simple,: when no budget is passedcongress eventually funds “essential” operations. Bydefinition essential operations are less than the total so somefunds are not spent. The other option often chosen when there isno budget is to fund all operations at last year's levels.This has historically been less than the proposed budget. and sonot having a budget is actually zero inflation from last year. If politicians really wanted to balance the budget all theywould have to do is use the previous year's budget over and overuntil it finally balanced. In effect that is what we have so farthis fiscal year (i.e. since October). This defacto fiscal restraint has already significantlyimpacted the CPI calculations and should result in somesignificant increases in bonds over the next few months. Inaddition, however, we will probably see some erratic behavior inthe price of gold as uncertainty in the market sporadically rearsits ugly head. The almost 1% drop in the projected median CPI will result ina significant rise in bonds over the next six6 months. At thispoint a 30% gain in bonds is not hard to foresee. As we can see from the CPI-Data chart on the following pageboth November and December 1995 actually had Deflation(i.e. prices actually fell) rather than simply rising at a slowerrate. Deflation is wonderful for bonds because in addition toappreciation, you actually get paid in dollars that have greaterpurchasing power than current dollars! Timothy McMahon The Beginning Investor Reading The MIP Chart The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is primarily apredictor of the inflation rate for the coming 12 months. It isextremely accurate over a six month time frame and accuratelyforecasts turning points out to the 1 year mark. The vertical axis is the inflation rate in percentage termswhile the horizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chartis the actual historical Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). While theright side is the predicted CPI-U. The right side consists of several diverging lines starting ata “You are here” arrow. The median line is the mostlikely prediction for the future CPI-U with likely highs and lowsdiverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. By focusing on the median line you can easily see futureturning points in the CPI-U index. An increase in this indexusually translates to an increase in the price of gold, goldstocks and other precious metals and commodities. A decrease inthe CPI-U index usually indicates a decrease in inflation hedgesand an increase in Bonds, Utilities and other interest sensitiveinstruments. CPI Data- By annualizing the CPI-U Data from varioustime spans we can get an idea of the likely range over the nextyear's time frame.

We have chosen Benham for three reasons. 1) It has a good Gold Fund. 2) It has a long term Bond Fundthat is usually the most volatile (i.e. provides the greatestupside potential during up moves) 3) It has several alternativesfor parking funds during periods of uncertainty. Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham GoldEquity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. New Money- Any funds recently freed up should followthe “New Money” indicator. Volatility- Our greatest ally and biggest foe isvolatility. We rely upon large changes in the prices of our fundsduring relatively short periods of time. This can result in shortterm losses if we switch directions too early. This is referredto as “draw down” i.e. in the long run we made moneybut in the mean time, our account showed a temporary paper loss.Some investors have difficulty handling large draw downs. Theyshould follow the conservative approach. Diversification- All investors should diversify byinvesting a portion of their portfolio using several otherinvestment approaches including- well selected individualsecurities, mutual funds and other appropriate investments. Ourgoal is to maximize overall portfolio performance with a minimumof risk. Insurance Gold- Every investor should have a portion(usually 10-15% or 1yrs living expenses) of their assets inphysical Gold and/or Silver (coins and/or bullion). This shouldbe considered insurance against market chaos and is not aninvestment. The cost of this insurance is the interest missed.

Bonds Fund Analysis Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Corporate Bonds Bond Fund Rankings Charts Bonds It is time for us to look at Bonds as our investment vehicleof choice for the next several months. There are two basic waysfor us to invest in bonds. The first vehicle is bond mutual funds and the second isindividual bonds. Naturally, mutual funds diversify our risk bybuying many bonds and offering us the opportunity to purchase ourbonds in any dollar amount. But there are advantages topurchasing individual bonds. Individual bonds allow you to lock in a yield for a guaranteedtime period. They also eliminate management fees. The thirdadvantage is that you can tailor your portfolio to meet your ownspecific needs. A subdivision within both investment vehicles is corporate vs.government bonds. This of course pertains to who issues the bondand really has little effect upon the bond as an investment. Inrecent years government bonds have yielded less than corporatebonds. This is primarily because during this century governmentshave been considered better risks than individual corporations. This was not always the case. In the 1700's with revolutionseverywhere the French government (among others) actually had avery difficult time getting anyone to loan them money at anyinterest rate. In fact their credit was so bad the only way theycould raise money was to sell the Louisiana Territory to theUnited States. Before we go any further we should discuss the basics ofbonds. The first thing to consider when choosing a specific bondis the current yield. Current yield is the amount of income (inpercent) that a bond generates. The second most important factor is the yield to maturity(YTM) i.e. the current yield plus any annualized capitalappreciation or depreciation until maturity. Other factorsinclude: Maturity (expiration) date; Face Value (generally $1000but for some perverse reason it is listed as 100) and coupon rate(face interest rate). The original purchaser of a single bond with a coupon rate of9.5% would have paid $1000 and received $95 interest in the firstyear (probably paid semi-annually). What if at the end of theyear interest rates have fallen so that the market feels thatthis bond should only be yielding 9%? Since the coupon rate isfixed by contract the only way to decrease the yield is for theowner to charge more than $1000 for the bond This is called apremium. To yield 9% this bond must sell for $1055.55, which is theinterest paid divided by the current yield ($95/.09). Put anotherway Current Yield = Interest Paid divided by Current Price($95/$1055.55). In addition to trading at a premium, Bonds can trade at adiscount. This happens when current interest rates are higherthan they were when the bond was issued. In the previous example,if the prevailing rate is now 10% but our bond is still payingonly $95 the current price would have to be ($95/.10) or $950. Strictly speaking, if we don't hold our bond until maturity itdoesn't matter whether we buy it at a premium or a discount; uponsale we will receive the current market value for that type andgrade of bond. If an AAA bond is yielding 10% we will get 10% whether we endup receiving $1055.55 for it or $950. The only time a discount isbeneficial is if we hold it to maturity. If we buy the bond for$950 and two years later it matures and we get $1000 for it ourtotal yield is increased by $50. This is called yield to maturity(YTM). To calculate YTM on relatively short bonds we can simplydivide the extra appreciation received by the number of years thebond was held and come up with a close approximation for the trueYTM. In this case we would divide the $50 by 2 and get an extra $25per year. Therefore, our YTM would be ($95+$25)/$950 or 12.6%. Ifour bond matured in four years, the YTM would be[$95+($50/4)]/$950 or 11.31%. Naturally, the longer untilmaturity the less difference between YTM and current yield. If we bought our bond at a premium we simply change the plusin the formula to a minus. If purchase price is $1055.55, thecoupon rate is 9.5%, and we have 5 years until maturity, we wouldhave a YTM of [$95-($55.55/5)]/$1055.55 or 7.95%. We want to hold bonds when interest rates are falling, so inaddition to receiving the interest on them we can also sell themfor more than we paid for them (As we saw in the first example). The risk that interest rates might go against us is called“market risk.” The only other risk involved is that theissuer might go bankrupt and not be able to pay off the bonds(security risk). In normal economic environments, that risk isvery small even on very poorly rated bonds. But it does happen,so we wouldn't want to put all our nest egg into a singlepoorly-rated bond. Diversification is one of the benefits of afund. Holding bonds with a near maturity is another way oflimiting risk. Moore Inflation Predictor(MIP) We will not be able to present the MIP this month. The CPI-U data or December is delayed this month due to thepartial government shut down. It is due to be released February1st. However, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is due tomeet again January 29th, and we are trying to get this issue toyou before that meeting. Last month the MIP projected that December might be slightlyup but the first six months of 1996 would be down with theprojected Median ranging from about 2.75% in December down toslightly above 2% in June of 1996. The FED generally likes to keep the Discount Rate 2% above theCPI-U rate. With the current discount rate at 5.25% and thecurrent CPI-U at between 2.5 and 2.75%, the FED could lower ratesas much as � of a percent just to get it within the currenttarget range. I don't necessarily expect that much all at once but I doexpect several lowerings between now and June! Remember--by June the Discount rate should be between 4 and4.25% or a total cut of between 1-1.5%. This means bonds ought to soar between now and June. Thismeteoric rise may begin with the January 29th meeting so beprepared! Bond Fund Rankings The following table shows the best performing bond fundsduring the last 12 months. (These are not the results for 1995, perse, but for the 12 months prior to today. These results arevery similar to those of calendar 1995). As usual one of the mostvolatile funds is Benham 2020 (BTTTX). With 48.6% appreciation ithas definitely done well-- but being comprised of zero couponbonds there is no current income. The only fund performing better was Morgan Stanley EmergingMarket Debt Fund (MSIEX). Its annual appreciation was onlyslightly better than BTTTX but because of the distributions of15.6% it had a whopping 70% total return!!! Unfortunately, the fund is designed primarily for institutionsand has a $500,000 minimum investment requirement. On our January 12th Hotline we recommended closing our goldand silver positions and buying Benham 2020 as of, Tuesday,January 16th. The Hotline also recommended diversifying yourgovernment bonds because of the uncertainty associated with thefederal government. The treasury will be bumping into the debt ceiling again inFebruary but Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin still has quite afew tricks up his sleeve. Republicans had hoped to use the debt ceiling to pressure thePresident but Rubin's sleight of hand tricks defused most of thepressure last time around and he will probably do it again. The Republicans have threatened Rubin's impeachment (whichtriggered the last drop in T-bond prices) so at this time theT-Bond market has more risk from his impeachment than from theFebruary ceiling. FundAnalysis GT Global (GHIBX) invests 65% in Bonds of Emerging Markets (i.e.all countries except the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, NewZealand and Western Europe). 35% may be allocated between stocksof emerging markets. and/or debt and stocks of developedcountries. Scudder Emerging Market Fund (SCEMX) invests 50% in ForeignGovernment debt. 65% of all funds will be in Emerging Marketsdebt, stocks and governments (some of which may overlap the 50%). Loomis Bond Fund (LSBDX) is much more stable i.e. lessvolatile than the other top performers and invests 65% in Bondswhich may be convertibles, Preferred Stock, etc., some of whichmay be foreign. 35% may be in securities below investment grade. These three funds all seem to provide a certain amount ofdiversification for our portfolios. In normal circumstances allthree would be considered more risky than U.S. Government bonds(security risk) but by being less volatile they may have lessmarket risk. Often diversification can lower overall risk eventhough the individual issues included may be higher risk. Corporate Bonds Although individual corporate bonds may carry a bit more risk,they can be tailored more closely to your individual needs. Bycarefully choosing maturity dates we can customize our portfolioto our view of the future of interest rates. Since the MIP gives us a good picture of the future ofinterest rates we can carefully choose our maturities and evenlock in our profits. For instance, if we see an increase in interest rates dueseveral months in the future, we can buy bonds that mature in twoor three years and lock in the current rate (by holding them tomaturity). Even though theoretically the price of the bondsshould decline because the prevailing interest rate is rising,short term bonds are guaranteed to be worth 100 at maturity. If we are willing to accept a bit more risk in our portfoliowe can often improve our performance dramatically. Standard &Poors considers any bond rated below BB to be speculative. Theirratings are (from highest to lowest) AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC,CC, and C. The letter “D” signifies that the bond iscurrently in default. Each rating may be modified by the additionof a + or -. For our short term purposes I generally consider the followingfactors. The first is Current Assets minus Current Liabilities.If this number is positive the company can meet its currentobligations. If this number is negative we probably would notwant to hold these bonds to maturity. Often, though, even inbonds rated “C” the remainder (of A minus L) is largeenough to pay off the entire bond issue (or at least a largeportion of it). These companies are not going to default any timesoon. The next thing I look at is Total Debt as a percent ofCapitalization. In other words, what is the ratio of stock todebt. A company with more debt than stock (i.e. the ratiois 100 or above) may be high risk. As long as the ratio is below 100 stockholders would have toloose all their money before bond holders loose a cent. Sobondholders are very unlikely to loose if they hold the bond tomaturity. A low risk company might have 40% Debt while a highrisk company has over 100%. So as far as we are concerned as long as the company can covercurrent liabilities and a significant portion of the bond issueout of current assets and cover all long term debt bycapitalization there is very little short term risk (if we buybonds that are going to mature in the next couple of years). If we want to assume a bit more risk we can follow the aboverules but purchase bonds that mature further out. Naturally, thebonds that should appreciate most from a decrease in marketinterest rates are the longest term bonds. The following list includes high yield bonds, some of whichare trading at their lows for the year and/or a significantdiscount. As you can see some have had significant fluctuationduring 1995 offering the opportunity for significant appreciationin addition to the current yield. If Ann Taylor returns to 100 from its current 83 you make not17% but 17/83 or 20.48% plus the interest of 10%. If you holdWaxman till 1999 you are guaranteed 23% per year. Eagle is up3.75% since December. In many ways if you do your homeworkindividual bond issues offer greater potential than individualstocks. Our Aggressive Portfolio “B” will sell the GoldStocks on January 29th and buy 50% Ann Taylor and 50% Hechinger. Note: These bonds are simply samples please be sure they areappropriate for your personal portfolio. Portfolio “C”should short interest rates.

A Guaranteed Trend Trading Cycles The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Long Term Cycle Charts Trading Cycles Everything in life involves cycles—the seasons, the moon,and the Stock Market. The regularity of it all occasionallyamazes me. Some stocks tend to be more cyclical than others. Youwould expect a swimsuit manufacturer's business to be cyclicalbut this may or may not translate into a regular cycle for thestock. Often a stock will demonstrate an annual cycle and withinthat cycle there will be a monthly cycle and within that cyclethere will be a daily cycle and possibly even an hourly one. Before we get too far into this discussion of cycles I wouldlike to define what I mean by a “cycle.” A cycle is adiscernible regularity to the price of a Stock, Bond, Option orother monetary instrument which includes equally spacedalternating highs and lows. A trend on the other hand isgenerally longer term and involves prices moving within a channelin either an upward or downward direction. The advantages of being able to identify a cycle is obviouslyto be able to determine when the next high or low willoccur (not necessarily how high or low it will go).Unfortunately, identifying the cycle itself is not always soobvious. However, with a little training and a little time spentstudying the chart, the cycle will often just jump out at you. I know the title of this newsletter is Financial TrendForecaster and somehow trends and cycles don't seem to gotogether but being able to spot both makes a much more profitableinvestor. Often within a trend there will be a cycle and with-ina cycle there will be a trend. Robert Prechter, editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, P.O.Box 1618, Gainesville, GA 30503, may be considered one of thekings of modern day cycle theory. He actually combines cycles,Elliott waves, numerical relationships, lunar phases and a hostof other indicators to arrive at his predictions, some of which Iagree with and others of which I don't. (Of course, no two marketparticipants ever agree 100% of the time.) One of Prechter's primary hypotheses is that cycles sort offit together like those little nesting dolls—inside each oneis a smaller one. There is a primary super cycle for the stockmarket, which began in 1789 and has mainly trended up. This islike the big Papa Doll. Within this cycle there is a Mama Dollsuper cycle which began in 1932 and is in an uptrend. Nestedwithin this cycle is an upward trending cycle (from 1974),Primary Wave (from 1987), Intermediate Wave (from 1994),and MinorWave (from Oct. 27, 1995). According to Prechter all of thesecycles are up but topping and his prediction based upon numericalrelationships is that the Dow will peak shortly between 5400 and5500. If he is correct, the topping of the smaller cycles is oflittle concern but the topping of the three largest cycles wouldmean MAJOR Devastation. Remember, the crash of '87 wasonly a primary cycle correction according to his reckoning!Counting Elliott waves, which generally consist of three waves upbroken by two shorter waves down, is an entirely differentprocess than spotting the types of cycles I am talking about. Interestingly, the Elliott wave is also predicting aJanuary-March top in Gold that corresponds fairly well with theMIP's prediction. One time I heard of an investor who used the “newsletterconsensus investing” approach. He would subscribe to 10 to15 newsletters and watch for a consensus among the writers, If,for instance, two of them advised the same stock it was a buysignal and if three, then it became a strong buy. If you follow that reasoning Gold is very likely to be toppingin the January-February range due to the agreement of the MIP andElliott wave. By the way, Elliott Wave is predicting a top in theXAU (Gold Stock Index) at 176 which is well above the peak inearly 1994 or anything we have seen this year. Currently the XAUis around 120. The only thing that could cause that dramatic arise is a panic due to either troops in Bosnia or anotherGovernment shut down. (For more discussion on this see thearticle on this month's MIP.) An interesting stock to learn to spot cycles on is Microsoftduring this past year (see page 1). Prior to this year Microsofthas not been volatile enough to spot the cycles, although theyprobably existed (volatility enhances cycles). Cycles are easiestto spot in a High Low Close (HLC) Chart. A HLC chart iscreated by drawing a vertical line with the top representing thehigh for the day the bottom representing the low and a horizontaldash representing the close. Our Microsoft chart is set with vertical lines spaced every 10trading days (2 weeks). Therefore, dotted lines are four weeksapart (as are solids). After March 29th the solid lines coincidewith the 4 week cyclical highs and the dotted lines are the fourweek lows. The way to isolate a cycle is by simply trying various lengthsuntil we find one that corresponds with the majority of highs andhas corresponding lows in between. By starting at 3/29/95 we seethat the next three successive cycles hit very close. Then we hitthe blow off peak of July which appears to be a week early,raising a question that we will answer later. The cycle continues with two more regular cycles with thethird cycle gapping up and peaks on a dotted line (instead ofsolid) at arrow “C”. This raises another question inour minds and the answer appears to be a longer 16 week cyclewith the peaks at “A, B, and C”. Since both“B” and “C” were higher than the surroundingpeaks it seems obvious that this is a bigger (longer term) cycle.Point “A” was not obvious, at the time, but wasdetermined by counting backward from “B”. Finally, there is probably an 8 week cycle midway between the16 week arrows which moves that high closer to the dotted linethan the solid. The one strange point is that the four week cycleis out of sync. with the 8 and 16 (i.e. it falls on asolid line rather than a dotted). Prior to point “A”this was not the case but cycles do change on occasion. We mustbe willing to follow the chart not try to fit the chart to ourideas. Our December 8th Hotline recommended closing our Microsoftposition at the four week cyclical high due on December 13thbecause the technical indicators did not look good. The high was due Wednesday plus or minus two days. I stated itshould reach $95-100. The true high occurred on the first day ofthe window (the 11th) and only reached 94 � giving us a poorshowing by the 13th. With point “C” not exceeding point“B” all that is necessary for Microsoft to really fallis a break through the support trendline. If it is contained bythe support line we can expect it to rise to the resistance line.But as time goes on the two lines get closer until it must breakthrough one or the other. An interesting footnote to the price action at point“C” is that it nicely filled in the gap created in thedrop from the top at point “B”. For some reason marketsdon't like gaps and often return to fill them at a later date. Microsoft Note: From a Fundamental standpoint (Fundamentalsare the study of the earnings, yield, new sales, etc. of acompany), Microsoft still is looking positive. However, from aTechnical standpoint (Technicals are the study of chart patterns,trendlines, cycles, etc.), Microsoft looks poor. It is possiblethat it will undergo a major correction before continuing itsuptrend. Long Term Cycle Long Term Bonds have demonstrated a longer term cycle firstidentified by Russian theorist Kondratieff. In the bond chartdating from 1820 we can see the peaks (denoted by the“P”) and the valley's (“V”) follow anapproximate 50-60 year cycle. The “orthodox” peaks areat 1860, 1920, 1980 with the valleys at 1830, 1890, 1950. Theactual peaks and valleys may be slightly different. If this cycleholds we should be able to expect a cycle low around 2010.Unfortunately with a cycle of this magnitude the variation can bequite great (as demonstrated in 1840). We ought to be able toexpect a few more years of downtrend before we reach the bottom. A Guaranteed Trend Some Trends are subject to reversal at any moment as part of acycle. Some trends like those in currencies are longer term.There is one trend, however, that is guaranteed to last the restof our lives. That trend is the population trend. As Baby Boomersage they will eventually become Senior Boomers. One of the underlying causes of the current stock market boomis the fact that Baby Boomers (BB's) are into their peak earningyears, have two incomes and as such are saving, investing andspending more. All of this money flooding into the market drives up shareprices, just as it drove up commodity prices in the 80's when the“BB's” were in their peak consuming years. If we followthis trend into the next decade and beyond as BB's enter theirretirement years, we ought to be able to develop some reasonablehypotheses. It has been said that as fewer workers are paying into SocialSecurity (which is not a trust fund but simply a wealthredistribution scheme). These workers are supporting more retiredpeople. In 1950 each retiree was supported by 17 workers, in 1990 itwas down to 3.4 workers and sometime after 2010 it will be lessthan 2 workers! At that point each worker will have to give uphalf his salary just to pay for the one on retirement. How many youngsters around today will be willing to do that?Unless something changes drastically, Social Security is doomedby demographics. Fortunately, a lot of BB's have sensed this andalthough they may be outraged, they are planning for thateventuality (which may be why they are investing in the stockmarket). The major recipient of new capital in the market todayis mutual funds, which filters it into stocks and (lately)bonds—driving up the prices of the markets. One logical conclusion of this scenario would be that as theseBB's retire (with or without Social Security) they will begin tosell off their stocks to meet monthly expenses, thus driving downthe overall stock market. A brighter scenario would be that since they are retired theirexpenses will have decreased and hopefully the companiesproductivity will have increased enough that the retirees canlive off the income of their investments. The alternative is that people realize that they can not liveoff their investments (if they made any), Social Security is bustand so they must continue working past retirement age. This isthe norm in most third world countries and was expected even inthis country until this century. There simply was no retirement.You worked until you died. The first Baby Boomers are almost 50 now and should beginretiring between 2002 and 2012. Ever wonder why congress is soset on getting the budget balanced in 7 years? Because if theydon't do it by then they never will! This is their last chance tosave Social Security and the whole house of cards. Kenneth Coleman of The Fed Tracker believes thatanother reason the year 2002 is significant is that Europe issupposed to have a single currency by that date. If they succeed,this would provide an alternative to the U.S. Dollar as thereserve currency of the world. Losing reserve status could causefurther downward pressure on the greenback and further valueerosion. Allen Keyte of World Affairs Review, on the other hand,sees a stronger Dollar in the near term due to intervention byforeign banks. Japanese Banks have a lot to lose if the Yen remains toostrong too long. Whether you believe in conspiracies or believethat the other “National” banks will rescue the Bank ofJapan simply because it is in the world's best interest; We canexpect a concerted effort to try to prevent a collapse of Japan'seconomy. As a result we can expect the Dollar to appreciateagainst the Yen in the next year. The long term trend for theDollar, however, is still down, down, down. What can we do to prepare for 2002? Develop a regularaccumulation program by investing a portion of our assets in theone item that is not a debt to anyone. Physical Gold! Everythingelse is simply an IOU. Bonds are obviously debts, stocks arepaper, as is cash, bank deposits, options, futures, everythingexcept Gold and precious metals. The only other true asset may behome ownership (without a mortgage) but if BB's decrease theirdemand for housing (due to empty nests and a desire to cutexpenses) housing values may still plummet. In addition to holding a portion of our assets in gold I wouldsuggest an annuity. Although annuities are debts, they areguaranteed to appreciate at a fixed rate for the years untilretirement (say 15 more) at which point they are guaranteed topay for the rest of your life. The best and safest annuities are from Swiss life insuranceagencies and denominated in Swiss Francs. That way as the Dollardepreciates your investment actually grows and your spendableincome increases. In addition, Swiss annuities are not dependentupon the value of the U.S. stock market but are investedprudently by the world's best money managers. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) TheNovember CPI index has been our first surprise in a long time.The MIP was predicting a flat to slightly increasing CPI …instead we got a relatively sharp decrease. This is a primeexample of an Abnormally Severe Market Aberration. Shutting down the government for a couple of weeks is not yournormal occurrence and no statistical model (no matter how good)can predict these type of events. With up to 800 thousand government employees unemployed andthe rest of the country uncertain about the future, spending wasdown and prices dropped in response. In addition, the Treasury didn't hold its regular Bondauctions, (since it wasn't authorized to pay the money back).Instead it “borrowed” 60 Billion Dollars fromtwo federal retirement accounts. This had the effect of reducingthe supply of Bonds on the market, causing the recent Bond rally.As of this writing we are in another Government shut down and theTreasury has arranged for alternative financing through Februaryor March. If this plays out as November did our Gold positionsmay not perform as well as expected. On the other hand, if panic begins to settle into the market,Gold could skyrocket and fulfill Prechter's expectations. Panic in the market is not as far fetched as it appeared onlya few weeks ago. One of the pillars of this year's Stock and Bondmarket rally is the premise that the Republicans will make goodon their promise to balance the budget. Should doubt be cast uponthe viability of that premise the shocks could be devastating. As I stated last month we are in an overall downtrend so thedown moves should be stronger than the up moves (i.e.Bonds will move more during their cycle than Gold during itscycle). So at this point we are waiting for a buy signal from theRelative Strength Indicator for Bonds and a peak in Gold.According to the MIP these are due in late January. However, at this point a good case can be made for caution.There is more to the battle between Congress than whether webalance the Budget in 7 years or 9 years. The battle is over the entire philosophy of Government. Thisis the High Noon show down between the Republican“Earps” and the Democratic “Clantons”(spelled Clinton this time around). This show down is over control and power! Clinton has takenthe posture that even though people voted overwhelmingly in favorof smaller government and a balanced budget, when it comes tomaking hard sacrifices the people will cave in. In other words,government as usual. Postpone the inevitable, and do whatever ittakes to get re-elected. The Republicans are also out for power and control (and to getre-elected) but want to use it to balance the budget, restorecompetitiveness to industry and in turn restore wealth to theentire country. Unfortunately, even if they balance the budget(which is questionable at the moment), they will not even havebegun to address the problem of the National Debt. We must remember the deficit is the amount the Government isin the hole this year (i.e. how much more theyspent over what came in). The debt is the total amountowed to all creditors (including Bond holders). By the year 2002 the debt could reach $6 Trillion. Becauseinterest rates are down the debt has not been increasing as fastas it could be…but it is still multiplying due to compoundinterest. Remember compound interest is one of the most powerfulforces on earth. When used to your advantage it can provide foryour retirement. When used against you it can bankrupt even theU.S. Government! So what does this mean for us as investors? First of all, thedemographics are against us, political inertia is against us andcompound interest is against us. Bob Dole was quoted as saying on 11/10/95 “Don't sellyour Gold yet”…This appears to be good advice! Thepossibility of the house of cards crashing down is still real. Acrisis of confidence in the Government's ability (or desire) torepay debtors could cause a stock and bond market crash and aflight to precious metals. This is one of the primary reasons we recommend a coresurvival holding of 5-10% of your assets and/or one year's livingexpenses. These are minimums for insurance purposes. As eventsunfold it may be prudent to have greater portions in Gold(usually in the form of stocks or mutual funds) as investments. The long term factors seem to favor Gold holdings. In additionto those above, the demographics of China and its explodingdemand for Gold should be positive for the yellow metal but thequestion is the short term. In the very short term (i.e. 2 months) we may have acrisis that causes it to skyrocket. If that is papered over, themedium term (i.e. 1 year) looks negative for Gold with theMIP in a down trend. The Long term (over 1 year) Gold will shineagain. Charts Fund Name Symbol Invesco Strategic Gold FGLDX Van Eck Gold Resources GRFRX Fidelity Select Amer.

CPI-U Inflation Rate Data Disinflation Ending? Current Positioning Relative Strength Index The Beginning Investor Microsoft Making Your Money Work for You The U.S. Dollar Index Good Savings Habits The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Compound Interest How to Read the MIP Chart Charts Disinflation Ending? A mathematician, an accountant and an economist apply for thesame job. The interviewer calls in the mathematician and asks"What does two plus two equal?" The mathematicianreplies "Four." The interviewer asks "Four,exactly?" The mathematician looks at the interviewerincredulously and says "Yes, four, exactly. "Then theinterviewer calls in the accountant and asks the same question"What does two plus two equal?" The accountant says"On average, four - give or take ten percent, but onaverage, four. "Then the interviewer calls in the economistand poses the same question "What does two plus twoequal?" The economist gets up, locks the door, closes theshade, sits down next to the interviewer and says "What doyou want it to equal?" One of the basic tenets of economics is the theory that thesupply of money spreads over the entire supply of goods. In otherwords, if the system you are examining has 100 equally valueditems for sale and there is 100 dollars in the system to buythem, then each item will be valued at one dollar. If the systemis infused with 100 more dollars, no one is any richer since bothdemand and supply has remained the same, only the numbers havechanged. All that happens is the price of each item doubles. You would think that if the result were a “wash” thegovernment wouldn't inflate the currency because it would havenothing to gain, but what really happens is that the governmentspends the money before the economy realizes that it is onlyworth half as much. This resembles the children's game of“Old Maid” In this version everyone tries to spend themoney before everyone else catches on. The attached chart was brought to my attention by one of oursubscribers. It presents an interesting picture and I appreciateyou bringing it to my attention. The article concluded from the data that we should be enteringa period of inflation because the chart is turning up. Thisappears reasonable at first look. The chart on the previous page was developed by dividing M3(the broadest definition of money supply) by the annual change inGDP i.e. the increase (or decrease) in the quantity ofgoods produced vs. those produced the previous year. The resultis sort of “the amount of money available to spend on newgoods produced.” This appeared interesting so I studied the actual data. Ifound that this chart looks almost identical to M3 alone, so thechange in GNP had very little effect. So what you are actuallylooking at is a chart of M3 which ought to be an indicator ofinflation. However, M3 plotted against total GNP (not shown)appears quite different but shows the recent downtrend but notmuch else of interest. Since the economy is so large I thought perhaps a 4 yearmoving average would show us the actual trend that the economywould see. As we would expect the early seventies showed a largeincrease which would result in inflation but unexpectedly the 4year average peaks in 1975 not in 1980. Not until we extend thetime frame out to 8-10 years do we peak in 1980 where goldactually peaked (see the dotted 8 year average line). This wouldlead me to conclude that if M3 has any effect at all it takes avery long time. The MIP is in a downtrend for the first half of next year, sowe know the uptick will not occur before then. By observing the trend of the 8 year moving average line wesee that the seventies were a time of inflation, the earlyeighties were relatively flat, and the past 10 years were in adowntrend with a final bottom actually registering in thenegative range in 1993. If the peak in M3/GDP in 72-74 corresponds to the gold peak in1980 we should expect a 6-8 year lag from the bottom of the mostrecent decline. This would mean low interest rates and increasingbond prices through this century! A 6 year lag would put thebottom in 1999. The only indicator that might lead us to concludethat an upturn is eminent is that M3/GDP has crossed up throughthe 8 year average line. If 1999 turns out to be the bottom we may see true deflationnot just disinflation and maybe even negative interest rates likein Switzerland in the 70's. Fortunately, the smaller peaks and valleys should provide uswith plenty of trading opportunities. But if the overall trend isdown we would expect greater profitability on the Bond side ofeach trade since Gold would only be a counter trend blip. Regardless of when the up surge occurs next year or in 1999,the MIP should keep us on the right side of the market and giveus plenty of warning as to the exact timing of the up turn. This is a perfect illustration of how two people can look atthe same data and come to two different conclusions. Thus theadvent of the stock market and economist jokes. Relative Strength Index Several subscribers showed interest in the relative strengthindex presented last month (since it is such a highly usefultool) so I am including the formula for calculating the RSI andwill try to include a chart of both a gold mutual fund and a bondmutual fund each month. I wish I could include all the gold fundsI follow to show you the comparison but of course space would notallow that. Suffice it to say they are surprisingly similar withone occasionally demonstrating a specific characteristic betterthan the others. One key indicator for Relative Strength is called“Negative Divergence” this is illustrated in the BenhamGold chart on this page by the trend lines. This is generally avery good indicator that a turn is eminent. Circle “A”resembles the current situation so hopefully we will see asimilar run-up. Benham 2020 is showing signs of negative divergence now. (seeprevious page). The formula for calculating the Welles Wilder RSI is: First you calculate the change which is simply =Today's close - Yesterday's close. If positive it equals +1, ifnegative it equals -1. If no change it equals zero. UpAve is calculated by adding all the +1's over the period(usually 14 trading days) DnAve is calculated by adding all the -1's (zero's areignored). The final step is to plot the current point on a chartwith horizontal lines at the 30%, 50% & 70% points. Microsoft The long trend up represented by line “A” is quite aways below our current position allowing for a major decline fromhere without disrupting the long term trend. Line “B”is also providing support at our current position as is downtrendline “C”. If Microsoft remains above it's recent low of83 1/8 we will have a higher low and a positive signal. The nextthing to look for would be a close above line “D” andpreferably above point “2” leaving only point“1” to conquer. Breaking through “D” &“2” will almost guarantee a close above“1”.This being the fourth upward thrust after“1” it is very critical. If we do not see a close abovepoint “1” on this thrust we will close our Microsoftpositions and you could consider a short position. But at thispoint MSFT's RSI is extremely oversold and could be developingthe momentum necessary to break above trendline “D”.once again this is the final thrust. If it doesn't make it“goodbye Microsoft”. The U.S. Dollar Index The dollar has declined a bit in the last month butis making a positive formation. Trend line “A” showshigher lows and provides good support even though trendline“B” is down. This is forcing a confrontation which willprobably result in a breach of line “B”. This wouldleave us with a rise with resistance at every dotted line. Withlines “D” and “G” being the strongest.Chances are slim that it will break through “G” but Iwouldn't be surprised to see it rise to test it again. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) The October Consumer Price Index came in significantly higherthan September, as we have been predicting for six months!Considering the fact that we have been in a steady downtrendduring that entire period, I think we can be proud of ouraccuracy in calling this turning point. If this month's inflation rate continues for 11 more months,next year we would be looking at almost 4% inflation, astaggering increase from last month's 2.5% rate. Fortunately, forour wallets at the checkout stand, our numbers predict only acouple of month's increase before a return to the downtrend. Thisdowntrend, of course, is not a decrease in prices (deflation)simply a lower rate of increase (disinflation). We are still looking to profit from our gold positions. Goldis up 5% from it's recent low and by combining relative strengthindicators with the Moore Inflation Predictor, we will be able tomore closely identify the exact turning point as Januaryapproaches. We continue to expect a sell-off in Bonds, andUtilities through the January turning point. This is confirmed bythe relative strength indicators which are in extremelyoverbought condition. Gold should continue to do well. Best Wishes. I hope you caught the bottom in gold and areenjoying the ride. Timothy McMahon The Beginning Investor How To Read The MIP Chart The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is primarily apredictor of the inflation rate for the coming 12 months. It isextremely accurate over a six month time frame and accuratelyforecasts turning points out to the 1 year mark. The vertical axis is the inflation rate in percentage termswhile the horizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chartis the actual historical Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). While theright side is the predicted CPI-U. The right side consists of several diverging lines starting ata “You are here” arrow. The median line is the mostlikely prediction for the future CPI-U with likely highs and lowsdiverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. By focusing on the median line you can easily see futureturning points in the CPI-U index. An increase in this indexusually translates to an increase in the price of gold, goldstocks and other precious metals and commodities. A decrease inthe CPI-U index usually indicates a decrease in the above and anincrease in Bonds, Utilities and other interest sensitiveinstruments. CPI Data- By annualizing the CPI-U Data over varioustime spans we can get an idea of the likely range over the nextyear's time frame. Keep in mind that 1 and 2 month rates havevery little long-term significance. The Basic Portfolio- For the simplest portfolio staywith the Benham Family. We have chosen Benham for two reasons. 1)It has a good Gold Fund. 2) It has a long term Bond Fund that isusually the most volatile (i.e. provides the greatest upsidepotential during up moves) 3) It has several alternatives forparking funds during periods of uncertainty. Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham GoldEquity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. New Money- Any funds recently freed up can be investedin Gold funds, Money Market funds or Cash (Interest Bearing).

Over a 40year period that amounts to $1.2 million. You can do simplearithmetic. Figure it out yourself. How much will you have earnedover your lifetime? Let's look at some facts of life. Americans save less thananyone else in the world. We save 5.2% of our disposable incomecompared to 14% by the Germans, 15% by the British, and 20%by theJapanese (source: Bureau of Economic analysis, Department ofCommerce). Here's another disturbing fact: Most Americans retirein poverty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 87% of Americans65 and older retire on incomes of $10,000 or less a year and 67%of those retire on incomes of less than $5,000. Inflation is destroying purchasing power. The combined rate ofinflation from 1990 to 1995 was about 20%. Taxes are another problem for every wage-earner in America.The average worker in America works 2 hours, 40 minutes each dayjust to pay taxes. There are three keys in making your money work for you. Theyare: (1) Good Saving Habits; (2) Compound Interest; and (3) MoneyStorage. Good Saving Habits To help understand how money works, let us make a fewassumptions. Assume your goal is to accumulate a $100,000retirement nest egg at age 65. If you could get a 12% return onyour money, how much would you have to save each month? If youstarted at age 25 you would only have to save $10 a month toreach your goal. If you started at age 35, you would need $30 amonth. If you waited until you were 45 you would have to save$100 a month. If you were a real procrastinator and waited untilyou were 55 you would need a whopping $435 a month to reach yourgoal! Compound Interest Making Compound Interest Work for You Let's say that you made a one time investment of $1000instead. You can see by the following table that if you invested your$1000 at 10% for 50 years you would have $117,390. #Years 5% 10% 15% 40 Years $827.82 $225.94 $56.21 30 Years 1505.14 607.92 230.02 20 Years 3024.26 1745.96 976.15 10 Years 7950.46 6274.54 4925.21 Yearly Savings to Reach $100,000 Goal* 5%* 10%* 10 years $1,628 $2,593 20 years 2,654 6,729 30 years 4,321 17,449 40 years 7,039 45,259 50 years 11,467 117,390 60 years 18,679 304,481 Money Storage The average investor uses Banks, Saving & Loans, CreditUnions and Insurance companies for their investments. Theinterest rate from these institutions varies from 2 - 6%. Theycharge from 7-18% (or more) for loaning out that same money—yourmoney! Start a Family Tradition How much will you need to save per year to reach your $100,000goal at age 65? This chart shows how much you need to save peryear at different investment return rates and the number of yearsyou need to save. Obviously the sooner that you start saving andthe higher the return the less you have to save per year. If your children can take the $100,000 that you have left themand add another $100 a month at 10% for 40 years, it will add upto (or should I say multiply to) $5,057,035! So start saving now andI will see you next month. *Income taxes may be due annually on the interest earned, eventhough the money is invested and is not a part of your“disposable” income unless you invest tax deferred suchas in an Annuity or IRA.

McMahon Volume 1, Number 3 Editor InThis Issue . . . Multi-Currency Sandwich Market Orders Trends and Cycles Opposite Pairs Jurassic Microsoft? It's OK to Lose Money? Trading Strategies--Limit Orders The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Multi-Currency Sandwich Last month I briefly mentioned the currency sandwich availableat most European banks. This month I would like to explain in alittle more depth how the sandwich works. Let's assume that wewant to profit from an increase in the Dollar. We could borrowone currency from the bank, pay the conversion fee to anothercurrency and deposit it right back with the same bank. Since themoney never leaves the bank and it is earning the loan rate onthe first currency, the banks usually require a very smallpercentage of the total as security, perhaps as little as 10%.This gives you a great deal of leverage but also a bit of riskshould the currency go against you. Your profit is theappreciation on the currency deposited, plus you receive thedifference between the two interest rates. Currency Loan Rate Int. Received Abbr. U.S. Dollar 8% 1 1/2 % (USD) Canadian Dollar 8 7/8 % 1 3/4 % (CAD) British Pound 9 % 1 3/4 % (GBP) Swiss Franc 5 1/2 % 1 % (CHF) German Mark 6 3/4 % 1 1/4 (DEM) Japanese Yen Rates 3 1/2 effective 0 July 1, 1995 (JPY) This works best when the currency you are borrowing has a lowinterest rate and the one you are depositing has a much higherinterest rate. It will work the other way, if you get a verylarge appreciation on the deposited currency or a largedevaluation on the borrowed currency. Always remember that you are short the borrowed currency, i.e.,you must repay the loan at some time in the future, and in themean time you must pay interest. Here is an example based uponrates available as of July 1, 1995. Loan Raterefers to what you pay to borrow that currency per annum. InterestReceived is what you receive in a savings account on yourdeposit,. Generally, you get about 1/4 % more on a three monthcertificate of deposit. Abbreviation is the symbolused to signify the currency in many European banks. In our Premiere issue on page 6 we said, “The Dollar isnow at the low end of its range and we expect a rebound over thenext few months.” This was written around July 1. Had weacted upon it then by creating a sandwich with the Yen, we couldhave borrowed �10,000,000 Yen (assuming we had $11,837 ondeposit). Next we could convert it to $118,370 dollars at 87 Yenper Dollar and redeposit the dollars into a three month CD. Inactuality, you give the order and it is all done with one order. The interest portion of the equation works as follows: You owe1/4 of 3.5% (since you are only keeping the money one quarter ofa year) or 0.88% times 10,000,000 Yen which is �88,000. You receive1/4 of 1.5% = 0.375% times $118,370 which is $443.89. As of thiswriting the Yen has moved into the high 90's per U.S. Dollar, soto make the profit an even 20, let's assume 104 Yen/ per Dollaron October 1. At that point we could convert our Dollars back toYen and repay the loan. We would receive $118,370 + $443.89 =$118,813.89. We multiply this times 104 � (yen) /per $ (Dollar)or �12,356,644.30. From this we must repay �10,000,000principal + �88,000 interest leaving �2,268,644.30 profit. Orabout $21,813.8900 plus you would still have the originalcollateral of $11,837 plus its interest. This shows the power ofcurrency moves—almost 200% profit in three months!. This,however, was a very unusual period. It was the reversal point andthey tend to be very steep. Another unusual feature of the current period is the largespread between interest paid and interest received. There iscurrently a 6 1/2% difference between the 8% the European bankscharge on a U.S. Dollar loan and the 1 1/2% they pay depositors.This is a very profitable time for bankers. I would estimate amore normal spread to be between 3 and 3 1/2%. Therefore, duringa less volatile time if the exchange rate remained flat we couldmake money by borrowing Yen at 1 1/2% and lending Dollars at 41/2% for a profit of 3% if the exchange rate remained flat. Threepercent does not sound like much, but remember this profit is onborrowed money! Also, this is besides the interest on the moneyreally on deposit. In other words, they pay you 3% to borrowtheir money! In return you take the risk of the currency exchangerate going against you. Also you are earning the 3% on 10 timesyour original investment. So in the previous example, in a yearyou would have earned $3551.10 on your $118,370 (loan) plus$532.66 on the initial deposit for a total of $4083.76 on adeposit of $11,837. This is 34.5% -- not a bad year! This wasassuming no move in the exchange rate. Moves in your favor would,of course, increase your profit. However, violent moves likethose of the past three months, if against you, could result inthe equivalent of a margin call. That is, the bank requires youto deposit more money or they cancel your loan and send you abill. Theoretically, instead of making money, you could end upowing them the $21,813.89 from the previous example. Generally,however, you should leave orders that they close the position ifa certain number of dollars are lost. There is an old saying thatsays “Never Meet a Margin Call.” It carries a greatamount of truth. If the position is going that badly, why throwaway more money? Reevaluate your initial premise and wait for abetter entry point. Generally, it is best to wait until a turnhas been confirmed and give up the first 10% of the move than totry to catch the whole move and end up catching 10% against you. Trends and Cycles Speaking of turns and moves brings us to Trends and Cycles.Cycles occur all around us. Within these cycles are uptrends,downtrends and turning points. I have always believed that if wecan identify a recurring cycle and accurately identify thecurrent position within that cycle, we ought to be able to find away to profit. This is the basic premise of the Moore InflationPredictor. It allows us to predict not only whether we are in anuptrend or downtrend but also when the next turning point shouldoccur. Recently I began looking at an interesting cycle that occursover a long time and is relatively regular. This cycle is thepaper and paperboard cycle. This cycle begins with plenty ofproductive capacity and as demand increases supply can not keepup. The prices for paper increase during this phase, as does thedemand for recyclable paper and its price. As this pricestructure increases, paper companies plan and build increasedproductive capacity. However, it takes years to build a papermill, so the price continues to increase until finally the millcomes on line and capacity is again plentiful. At this pointprices drop rapidly and the cycle begins its climb again. Currently we are in the middle of an uptrend cycle (as anyonewho has bought paper lately can tell you) hopefully before toolong a new mill will come on line and prices will drop. But inthe mean time, supply is so tight our local school district wastold by one of the local paper distributors that they may not beable to buy all the paper they need this year. Since we have identified the cycle, the trend and ourposition, we ought to be able to identify a way to profit. Wecould stockpile paper during low price times, buy long termpaperboard contracts, or when a new plant is announced, buy putoptions on paperboard. However, I present it here primarily as anexample of cycles and the type of thinking that must go intofinding profit opportunities. Perhaps some of you can identifyeasier profit opportunities in this cycle or use the sameanalysis to find other opportunities. Jurassic Microsoft? Because of another old saying, “Buy the Rumor Sell theFact,” Wall Street sold off Microsoft just as we entered.The release of Windows 95� was “the Fact” and itoccurred just in time for us to enter at a good price. Microsoftwas trading in the low 90's the week after we mailed the Augustissue so you should have been able to pick it up at around 92.For the special portfolio we will use the September 6 price of$13.88 for the ZMFAA option. As of this writing, Microsoft is upa few points. We have gotten in at a good price. As long as thereis no major sell off in the overall market we should do well.Remember this is a pure speculation not for money you cannotafford to lose! Windows 95� is selling like hotcakes. The last majoroperating system release was DOS 6.0 and it took fortydays to sell a million copies. Windows 95� did it in just four! Windows95�'s opening weekend had higher revenues than the openingweekend of Jurassic Park and twice those of Lion King! Since Microsoft has been trading in a fairly wide (percentagewise) range of 89-99, another way of trading the volatileMicrosoft stocks (or options) would be to place an open orderwith your broker to buy Microsoft whenever it reaches say 91 andsell when it reaches 98. Lately, this may involve a holdingperiod of only a couple of weeks. Picking up 7% or so (dependingon the size of your trade and the amount of commissions paid) ina couple of weeks is not a bad trade. Trading Strategies-LimitOrders The Microsoft options we are using are very thinly traded.This means that very few of them trade on any given day. Whenbuying or selling thinly traded stock (or options), it is veryimportant to place a limit price (i.e., the maximum weare willing to pay) on the transaction. This is called a Limitorder. The reason is thinly traded stocks usually have a largespread. That is, the bid price (what someone is willing to pay)may be 13 and the ask price (what someone is willing to sell at)may be 14 with the last stock exchanging hands at 13 3/4. If wetell our broker to buy at the market we will receive at least 1share at 14, depending on how many are being offered. If we arebuying a very low priced stock (say $1) and we want a largequantity (say 10,000 shares) we may have to buy 100 at 1, 1000 at1 1/8, 500 at 1 1/4 and so on until we get our 10,000. Returningto the Microsoft option, if we bought only 1 contract at themarket, we would pay $14 x 100 shares per contract or $1400 pluscommissions. However, with such a large spread we could issue anorder to buy at 13 1/4 or even 13 1/8. For this example we willuse 13 1/4. Our offer would now be the quoted offer. So the nextperson who asked for a quotation would see 13 1/4 bid 14 asked.At this point should someone want to sell “at themarket” they would be selling to us! Usually, in a marketthat is not moving too fast we will get a fill at our price andwe have saved 3/4 x 100 or $75. On one contract it is not much,but on 10,000 shares it is $7500! Even on one contract it maycover the commission. Some floor traders truly make a living offthe spread. In this example it is possible that both the bid andthe ask are placed by the same trader! In other words he iswilling to sell at 14 or buy at 13. This is a perfect example ofbuy low sell high. In fact, he is like any other merchant buyingat wholesale and selling at retail. Suppose a trader picked up1/4 point on 10,000 shares in a day. That is $2500, not bad for aday's work. These traders help to create a liquid market, butthere is no reason we should not try to buy at wholesale wheneverpossible. MarketOrders The only time we do not want to use a limit order is when themarket is moving rapidly. In the previous example, it is possiblethat right after we placed our order for 13 1/4 someone elsecould place an order for 13 1/2. Then someone could place anorder for 13 3/4 and then 13 7/8. The offer price could still be14 and no shares have yet changed hands. At this point ordersbegin getting filled at 14 then 14 1/8 etc. We are now miles awayfrom getting our order filled. There are four questions to askyour broker. (1) How many shares (or contracts) have tradedtoday? If it is a high number, generally the spread will besmall. (2) What was the last trade? Generally, it should bebetween the bid and ask, if it is not, the market has movedwithout any shares exchanging hands, a sign of very thin trading.This happened one morning a short time ago on the MicrosoftZMFAB, Bid was 11 1/2, Ask was 11 3/4, Last trade was 9 7/8 onthe previous day. Obviously, Microsoft stock must have moved up,pushing the option bid and ask up, but as the bid moved up eachask must have been withdrawn before it was filled. The otherpossibility is that there were no open orders overnight and atthe open after the move in Microsoft the new bid and ask wereestablished. (Question #3) What was the open price (the firsttrade of the day)? If it was much higher or lower than thecurrent price it would signify a rapidly moving market. If themarket opened at 9 7/8 and it is now 11 1/2-11 3/4 you probablydo not want to use a limit order. Although you might get a fillat 13 5/8 you would only be saving an eighth. Someone else couldsimultaneously enter a market order and get a fill at 13 3/4(buying all the shares offered at 13 3/4). This would leave thenext person who enters a market order the shares offered at 137/8 and so on and you never get a fill. (Question #4) What wasthe previous day's close (or last trade price)? If it issignificantly different from today's open it also signifies arapidly moving market. A Market Order says you are willing to paythe seller's asking price. If there is not much to be gained byusing a limit order or we want to be sure to get a fill, use amarket order. Opposite Pairs The opposite pairs theory is as follows: One side of the pairshould be rising while the other side is falling. Therefore, weshould always be fully invested but in the “correct”side. One subscriber wrote saying he was unable to find a“perfect” pair. By that he meant he could not find apair where when one side rose the other always fell.Unfortunately, since we live in an imperfect world there is nosuch thing as a perfect pair. The key is actually to be in theone that is rising more or even falling less. During the firstpart of this year almost everything was rising including gold andbond funds. However, by following the inflation predictor weshould be able to determine which will be the superior performer.An interesting way of looking at opposites is to consider theratio between them (much as you would in currencies). Suppose youstart this portfolio with $1000 with which you can buy 100 sharesof a gold fund or you can buy 100 shares of the bond fund (theyare both trading at $10/share today). We feel the gold shares arethe better performers for the next quarter so we are buying goldshares. Three months from now we still have 100 shares of thegold fund but they are now worth $12/share. The bond fund hasdecreased to now worth $8/share and we exchange our $1200 for 150shares of the bond fund. Since both the bond funds and the goldfunds we are using cycle in a trading range, we can expect thebond fund to at some time return to $10. At some point the goldfund should also be at $10 again (but not necessarily at the samepoint). However, we now have more shares. So we must really bemore concerned with continuously increasing our shares than withthe actual dollar value at any given point. It's OK to Lose Money? Let us look at an example of how we could increase shares but“lose money”. Suppose we started at par at $10 againbut this time gold shares went to $9 while bonds went to $7. Atthis point we would only have $900 to exchange (a $100 Loss) butwe would still get 128.57 shares of the bond fund. In the longrun, as long as we increase our number of shares on each trade wewill come out ahead. Another possibility is that both fundsincrease, e.g., Gold goes to $14 while Bonds go to $12.Of course we want to be in the $14 fund but we only receive116.67 shares of the other at the switch. Returning to our first example, we have switched and now have150 shares of an $8 bond fund. Suppose both it and the gold fundsimply return to $10. We have increased both our holdings and ourdollars by 50% and both funds have gone nowhere! The buyand hold investor made zero and would have been better off in aninterest bearing savings account. making 3%. Instead, by switching, we have made a wonderful return. Evenif we had the 116.67 shares, as in our worst example, we would beup almost 17%. Of course at the point of the switch we were up40% but the point is to remember that we are increasing ourshares. Unfortunately, keeping track of the ratio is much moredifficult than tracking dollars, especially if we start with onefund at 5.78 and the other at 22.20. Another thing that adds tothe difficulty is if you buy a different fund every time youreturn to gold. One way to graphically track the ratio is to divide one sideof the pair by the other side and graph the resulting ratio. I amincluding a graph of the ratio of Benham Gold divided by (versus)Benham 2020 (see page 4). When the chart is rising, the firstfund (Gold) is appreciating faster and when it is falling, thesecond fund (2020) is the superior performer. When it is level,both funds may be rising or falling, or not moving but they areperforming equally in percentage terms. The Moore InflationPredictor (MIP) The August MIP contained no surprises and we still appear tobe on track for a nice rise through December. The MIP appears tobe level to slightly down for the upcoming September numberswhich are released in Mid-October with a rise occurringthereafter and occurring through December. Dr. Moore always feltthat the data did not affect the market until about one monthafter its release. I personally disagreed with his timing andwould try to be in place at the exact time of the turning pointeven though the data has not yet been released since sometimesyou could miss a good portion of the move by starting a monthlate. This is of course personal interpretation of the chart andyou are certainly welcome to interpret the chart any way you feelbest. Just remember, precise timing (to the day) is verydifficult (read impossible) in a monthly newsletter. Youmay want to try to follow the market around the turning point andadjust the timing a bit. Our portfolio sold Benham 2020 (BTTTX) not (BTTX) as mistypedlast month on September 15 at $22.20 for a $.61 gain or 2.8% in alittle over 2 months. Once again, had we been publishing in Maywe would have been in at around $18.50 for a gain of $3.7 or 20%in four months. As we can see, in this instance, the majority ofthe gain occurred in the first two months with a few scraps leftfor the end. In my experience this seems to be common. We hope to pick up at least another 20-30% on the gold side ofthe pair through December. Gold has already begun to show signsof strength and should move nicely.

McMahon Volume 1, Number 2 Editor InThis Issue . . . Would You Invest in This Stock? 6 Month Predictor How to Invest in Currencies Tracking Accuracy Microsoft—A 5000 Pound Gorilla? Worst Performers The Moore Inflation Predictor Changes and Formats Indexes and Rates Charts Would You Investin This Stock? Unfortunately, for all of us who live in the United States,whether we like it or not we own this stock. This is the chart ofthe U.S. Dollar denominated in Swiss Francs. In other words thisis what the Dollar looks like to a Swiss citizen. In the last ten years the Dollar has lost over 50% of itspurchasing power compared to the Swiss Franc. Last month Iincluded a chart that showed that the U.S. Dollar remained in arelatively narrow trading range compared to a basket ofcurrencies. However, if we compare it to the top performingcurrencies it has performed poorly, at best. The best performing currencies over the last ten years includethe Swiss Franc, the Japanese Yen and the Deutsche Mark. Grantedthere have been brief interruptions in the Dollar's downwardslide such as during 1984, 1988-89, and a small portion of 1991and another portion of 1992, but on the average the Dollar hasbeen losing ground against the big three and only outperformingthe worst performing currencies. Primarily this is due to excess supply, i.e. the creation oftoo many Dollars. Basic economic theory states that if the rateof Dollar creation exactly matches the growth in Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) there will be no inflation or deflation. If moreDollars than goods are created we will have inflation and if lessDollars are created we will have deflation. This of course isover simplified because there are a lot of other factors in playbut the basic premise holds. This inflation or deflation eventually translates into adecrease or increase (respectively) in the value of the Dollarversus other currencies. Of course their own respective rates ofinflation or deflation must be factored into the equation also,but eventually that is the role of the currency markets.Currencies value may be affected by government intervention to acertain extent but in the long term not even the combined effortsof the U.S., Germany, and Japan can keep the Dollar overvaluedforever The final factor determining the value of any particularcurrency is the rate of interest paid on it and normally thiswould also be determined by the free market. In other words in atotally free market if the Mexican Peso is consistently losingsay 10% of its value per year it should pay at least 16% interestin order for an investor to earn 6%. Interest has been likened to the “cost” of buyingmoney, but in actuality it is more like the cost of renting it.Therefore if we are to invest profitably in currencies we want tohold a currency that provides the best combined return. By that Imean the best combination of appreciation and interest. Forexample if the Yen is appreciating by 4% per year and paying 2%interest we will earn the same 6% as in the Peso example. Thetricky part is predicting how much the currency will appreciatein the coming year. With all that said, deciding which currency to invest in boilsdown to deciding which direction a currency is headed (and by howmuch) and how much interest it is paying. For the long terminvestor predicting the direction is simple. In the long run theD-Mark, Yen and Swiss Franc are headed up and the Dollar isheaded down. The long term trend is still in effect and isprimarily influenced by politicians. So unless you believe theSenate is going to actually become fiscally responsible andbalance the budget and eliminate inflation, the current trendwill continue. That said I believe that the dollar is oversold (i.e. hasfallen too much) and is due to correct in the upward direction.So, now is not the time to jump ship on the U.S. Dollar. Shipsare a good analogy for currencies for another reason, Just likeships they do not change direction easily. They are big lumberingbehemoths that take a lot of force to change direction. Thatmakes them relatively easy to invest in. They will tend in thedirection they are currently traveling until a great force buildsup. That force has acted upon the dollar and is now starting anup trend which should last at least several months. So the answer to the question “Would you buy thisstock?” is YES for two reasons: (1) for a portion of ourassets we have no choice and (2) in the short run it should goup. [Top of Page] How to Invest in Currencies Last month I likened currencies to opposite pairs. At anygiven time some currency is appreciating or depreciating comparedto the others. Therefore if we can determine which will providethe greatest total return we can switch to it and profit comparedto the others. Currency investing in the U.S. is often considered theprovince of high risk options and futures traders. In Europe andAsia, however, people do business in several currencies everyday.Investing and profiting for them is easier but not just becauseof familiarity. In most countries in the world banking includes what we wouldconsider several different industries. The European bank forexample handles checking and saving accounts as we would expect,but they also handle Stocks, Bonds, Precious Metals, and SafetyDeposit Boxes. In short anything relating to money is handled byyour banker. When you think about it, it makes much more sensethan having to deal with a half dozen different establishmentsand it provides a broader income base for the bank so it has lessrisk of bank collapse. Speaking of safety, how safe are foreign banks? A lot dependson the country involved. Swiss banks are notoriously safe eventhough they have no deposit insurance from the government. Theyknow there is no safety net, so they are much more careful. Othergood banks are located in Britain, the Channel Islands, Austria,Luxembourg, the Caymans, and Hong Kong. What does all this have to do with currencies? Well, inaddition to the above services foreign banks can also offerdeposits (checking and savings) denominated in any currency youdesire. So the easiest way to invest in a foreign currency is tosimply open an account denominated in that currency. You can evenget a money market account for longer terms and get a littlebetter interest rate. Another simple way to invest in a stronger currency for thevery long term is to purchase an annuity denominated in thatcurrency. Annuities are buy them and forget them investmentswhich makes this is a very powerful method. An annuitydenominated in Swiss Francs and purchased in 1984 would be worthat least twice what an annuity denominated in Dollars is worthtoday simply due to the appreciation of the Franc. The above investments involve dealing with what many of usconsider the unknown i.e. a foreign bank or insurance company.Opening a foreign account is as simple as opening an account inanother state. Simply write or fax a request for the properforms, sign them and send a check with them. As long as you sendafter tax dollars, openly mail a check (without concealment) andyou report the account on your income tax, it is perfectly legal(at least for the present). Incidentally, there is one bank in the U.S. that offersaccounts denominated in foreign currencies. Namely, Mark TwainBank of Saint Louis, Missouri. Like any other bank it has quite afew branches and you can easily open an account with any one ofthem. Another way to profit from currency appreciation and themethod I used for my first currency play is to simply purchase anADR for a stock of the country you expect to appreciate. An ADR(American Depository Receipt) is simply an IOU for a stock fromanother country. Rather than have to contact the company everytime a US citizen buys a share of their stock a US bank holds thestocks and issues a receipt for X number of shares. Several years ago I reasoned that the D-Mark was due to riseand consequently all German stocks would appreciate against theDollar. Naturally a good stock would be even better, so Iresearched the German stocks available as ADRs and found thatDaimler Benz (the maker of Mercedes) was relatively cheap. Afterseveral months, Benz had appreciated about 20% in Mark terms andthe Mark had appreciated an equal amount against the Dollar. Soan easy way to play the currency is buy the stock. Had I beenwrong in either case (about the stock or the currency) I stillhad a very low risk situation. Higher risk methods of investing in currencies are currencyoptions and futures contracts and a third alternative called asandwich offered by foreign banks. Let's assume that we want toprofit from the coming increase in the Dollar. We could borrow aweaker currency from the bank and pay the conversion fee anddeposit it back with the same bank. Since the money never leavesthe bank and it is earning the loan rate on the one currency, thebanks usually require a very small percentage of the total assecurity. This gives you a great deal of leverage but also a bitof risk should the currency go against you. This works best whenthe currency you are borrowing has a low interest rate and theone you are depositing has a high interest rate. In that case, inaddition to currency appreciation you receive the differencebetween the two interest rates. Unfortunately, this situationdoesn't occur too often. If anyone would like the names and addresses of reputableforeign banks send a self-addressed stamped envelope and I willbe happy to send you a list. [Top of Page] Microsoft-- A 5000 Pound Gorilla? I'm sure everyone has heard the jokes about the five-thousandpound gorilla. “Where does he sleep?” “Where doeshe go?” etc. The answer of course is “Anywhere he wantsto!” The same is almost true for Microsoft. Microsoft hasgrown in the past decade from nothing to one of the world'slargest corporations. In the process it has turned Bill Gatesinto the world's richest man and made billionaires out of severalof his early friends and associates. In the last year Microsoft has gone from a low of 53 7/8 to ahigh of 110 1/4. Currently it is trading around 98. Earlier this year Microsoft (MSFT) tried to purchase Intuit,another software maker whose one claim to fame is a programcalled Quicken and its big brother Quickbooks. This purchase of arelatively small potatoes company stirred up such a ruckus thatthe Department of Justice (DOJ) stepped in and used every trickin the book to stop the purchase. Have you ever wondered why the DOJ would even care? Microsofthad an accounting program of its own called Money, but hadalready made arrangements to sell it. So there really wasn't anyconflict, they just wanted to own a different accounting program. The real reason was that Quicken has millions of users tiedinto electronic banking. Microsoft wanted to buy those users!This would have, in effect, made Microsoft one of the biggestbanks in the world! I personally, don't think that would have been a bad thing. Itwould have been profitable, safe, progressive and provideservices the customer wants. In addition it would have beencapable of competing with global banks that no other U.S. bankcan touch. But the DOJ didn't see it that way. Well, Microsoft being an agile gorilla and moving a bitquicker than the lumbering DOJ, appears to have pulled an endrun. Along with its long planned Windows95 it has included a bitof a ringer. Microsoft included a button that signs you up for Microsoft'snew on-line service, which will compete with Prodigy, America OnLine and CompuServe. So far not even the DOJ has been able tostop this new wrinkle. Since Microsoft is not “tying”i.e. forcing anyone to purchase anything extra with this button,it is just giving it away and if you don't want the button youcan erase it or not install it in the first place. What does this have to do with banking? Well, all theestablished on-line services allow you to open brokerage andbanking accounts on-line. We must assume that Microsoft On-linewill do the same! How much revenue will this new venture generate? At this pointI have not heard any estimates or even much interest in thebanking end of it but I'm sure Microsoft feels it will be veryprofitable. Speaking of profitability, how profitable will Windows95 be?Pros in the computer industry estimate that Windows95 itself willgenerate between .8 and 2.4 Billion in revenues for Microsoft inthe next year alone. There has not been a new operating system release in severalyears, so there is quite a bit of pent-up demand just waiting toexplode. Microsoft has put off the release of this long awaitedsoftware a couple of times trying to be sure it will be bug freeand have enough drivers to make it work relatively well from thestart. A lot of people feel it will solve all their computingproblems. In addition, the computer sellers are planning on usingit as a “loss-leader” to get people into their stores.All this bodes well for Microsoft. At first glance, Microsoft appears a bit pricey at almosttwice its low for the year and with a P/E of over 40. P/E isprice divided by earnings and a low P/E (say <10 or so) isgenerally considered a bargain. But if you factor inprojected earnings Microsoft is back in the reasonable pricerange. Several subscribers asked for quick turn profitrecommendations like the technology stocks that I mentioned inlast month's issue. I believe Microsoft will trade up to itsold highs and above within months of the release of Windows 95 inlate August. Microsoft is a good short term speculation. If it is stilltrading below 100 by the time you read this it is a definite BUY!Since most technology stocks are hot right now I probably wouldnot plan on holding for the long term at this point. This issimply a play on the release of Windows95. The conservative way to play this is to buy the sharesoutright. The speculative way is to purchase the options.Currently there are LEAPS (Long Term Options) available onMicrosoft. The symbol for the Jan 97 Call with a strike price of100 is (ZMFAT). This would be a good play if (MSFT) is below 100.Since these are such long options you could try for a little morespeculation and use the 105s (ZMFAA) or 110s (ZMFAB). You can buyone contract of the 110s for around $1000 should Microsoft go to120 in the next few months (ZMFAB) should double. An interesting point about options is that although they areconsidered higher risk than buying the stock outright a case canbe made that they are actually less risky. Assume you buy 50 MSFTat $100/share you have $5000 at risk. Should Microsoft return to$50 you are out $2500. Had you purchased the long term calls onecontract which controls 100 shares (instead of 50) would cost youabout $1800. In the previous case with a fall to $50. your optionmight be worth $300. Assuming a short time has expired, youractual dollar loss is $1500. A much smaller loss. In the event ofa gain say the stock goes to 120 at that point your 50 shareswould be worth $6000 for a gain of $1000 but your option shouldbe worth $35 or so for a gain of $1700. So you made more or lostless. The major drawback to options is the time factor, if youdon't make money quickly the time value evaporates and youroption expires worthless. This is less of a risk with Leaps sincethey are so long term. The only “fly in the ointment to purchasing Microsoftwould be if the DOJ makes Microsoft pull the Microsoft Onlinebutton. This is unlikely and would costly but not disastrous. Inthe event of a correction, due to DOJ actions, I would double upand buy more Microsoft. Plan on taking profits when Microsoftreaches 120. The more cautious should place a trailing stop 10%below your purchase price. Remember this is a short termspeculation not for the more conservative investor. [Top of Page] The Moore Inflation Predictor As we can see in this months Inflation Predictor Chart the CPIpeaked in May and has steadily declined through July. As a point of clarification, had we been publishing at thatpoint, we would have recommended the purchase of the Benham 2020mutual fund in May rather than July when our first issue wasactually, published. In May (BTTTX) was trading at around $18.50.It quickly climbed to 21 retraced to below 20 and as of thiswriting is headed higher, probably through the cycle bottom inSeptember. [Top of Page] Indexes and Rates The July Consumer Price Index (released in mid-August) wasidentical to the Index of June, which resulted in a decline to2.76% in the inflation rate from a rate of 3.04% in June.Statistically, the reason for this is that the rate is acomposite of a string of twelve numbers and a high one wasdropped from the beginning and a zero was added to the end. The government however, rounds the rates reported andtherefore publicized 2.8% and 3.0% respectively. For some perverse reason known only to Statisticians andbureaucrats they called it a seasonally adjusted increase of .2%.The truth is, it is a .28% decrease and the decline will continuethrough September. This deception may have had some small buttemporary effect on the bond prices but it provides a big lessonin why we need to base our financial decisions on a source otherthan the nightly news. [Top of Page] 6 Month Predictor The predictor chart as shown on this page has indicated areversal is imminent. It actually has already reversed and soactive traders need to watch the price of Silver and beginlooking for a good entry point. For the sample portfolio we willrecommend Silver Calls. [Top of Page] Tracking Accuracy Many of you have asked how well the opposite pairs aretracking the CPI. Gold and Bonds have not been as accurately tracking the CPI asSilver and Platinum have. This is one reason (BTTX) had an upturnrather than simply a flattening over the previous month. Silver and Platinum, however, have done a good job of trackingthe CPI and therefore we will be using them to catch the upturn.We are expecting an uptick in their respective prices beginningin September. In addition, Silver tends to be more volatile thanGold and should therefore result in a greater percentage rise andbegin a bit earlier. Also Silver has shown unusual signs ofmarket activity as mentioned last month. The Silver Mutual Fundof Choice is Lexington Strategic Silver. As you can see from theGain / Loss chart Invesco Strategic Gold is the Gold Fund ofchoice having the largest gain during the CPI uptick of Mar-May1995 and the largest loss during the downtick lastOctober-January. [Top of Page] Worst Performers Based upon the last down period of the CPI i.e. October1994-Jan 1995 the Funds that lost the most and reacted thequickest therefore ought to gain the most during this shortupturn: Last time around Lexington Strategic Silver was a bigloser but was not one of the biggest gainers I am betting it willdo better this time around but it is really a toss-up between itand Invesco. Strictly speaking the numbers indicate Invesco.sothe conservative portfolio will be half in Lexington StrategicSilver and half in Invesco Strategic Gold. The Speculative Stock Portfolio will be half in Echo Bay (ECO)and half in Coeur D' Alene (CDE). [Top of Page] Changes and Formats Many of you requested that I continue to publish the actualCPI Index numbers in table form. So, I have decided to make thelast page a data page. It will include the Gold chart along withits moving average, the Silver chart with its moving average anda table of values for the CPI. In addition, it will include myrecommendations for the three portfolios (although I haverearranged them from most conservative to most speculative). Ihope the last page will provide a quick overview of the entirenewsletter for those of you who are very rushed for time. Otherchanges are for readability. A vast majority of subscriberswanted larger charts or at least larger words, so we are trying athree column format. As a new publication we will continue tochange and hopefully develop a useful, readable style. I wouldlike to thank all of you who subscribed and I appreciate yourcomments and will try to incorporate as many as possible. Another request was for a telephone Hotline, we areconsidering this and will see as we get more subscribers. Anotherthing in the works is eight pages rather than six. As long as you remain charter subscribers I promise you thebest renewal rates and possibly other special bonuses as well. Iwant to continue to be responsive to your needs and wonder howmany of you have email? I have considered starting a newsgroup orforum on line. If you are interested, drop me an email message atTJMcMahon@AOL.com. Welcome and Thanks for Subscribing! I hope to continue toprovide value and service for your money.

The company has negotiated with the Regional Electric Company (REC)to obtain import/export metering for grid connected projects ranging from5 kilowatts to 15 megawatts. Indeed, we are confident that for customerswith an annual electricity bill in excess of �10,000, we can create a projectthat will yield a POSITIVE cash flow relative to the current electricitybill. This is partly due to the REC�s ability to pay it�s traditional customersfor exported wind energy. The tarrifs for these payments will vary, butin general, the highest prices paid are during the winter months, whenwind energy is abundant. There is a near continuous spectrum of wind turbines rated between 10WATTS and 1.5 MEGAWATTS at any voltages (AC or DC). The companyis familiar with all the manufacturers of wind turbines and related equipment( European and World wide ) and is therefore well placed to select andmatch the correct equipment according to the customer�s need. The companyis not affiliated or connected to any one manufacturer.

Wind and solar power can seriouslycompete with all other energy sources only when the hourly, daily and seasonalvariations can be effectively removed. Hydrogen production will accomplishthis with only slight modifications to the technologies already in usein the conventional Oil & Gas industries for the bulk transportationof fluids and gases. The company was granted a UK Patent in November 1995, detailing an efficientmethodology for the total conversion of wind (or solar) energy to hydrogenvia electrolysis of water. YGM is firmly committed to the development ofhydrogen as a fuel for use in fuel cells, boilers, gas turbines or conventionalinternal combustion engines.

To provide needed information to physicians and other professionals. To provide needed information and referrals to all who make requests. To encourage additional professionals to enter the field. To help translate public awareness into sharply focused programs of research, education, and treatment innovation. Foundation Background The National Foundation For Depressive Illness (NAFDI) was established in 1983 to provide public and professional information aboutAffective Disorders, the availability of treatment, and the urgent need for further research. The Foundation is committed to an extensive, ongoing public information campaign addressed to this pervasive, costly, and hidden national emergency. Ongoing activities include: The education of business leaders about the costs of undiagnosed Depressive Illness in the workplace, including higher expenditures for medical insurance and the loss of productivity due to disfunction and absenteeism. Sponsoring press briefings with public figures, such as Senators Edward Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, and Terry Sanford, as well as Dr. Joyce Brothers, to generate awareness about NAFDI. Briefing health writers at Mature Market Seminars and other forums on Depression and the Elderly; providing speakers and materials for workshops, symposia, and seminars in the mental health community. Providing information about the symptoms of Depressive Illness through a national "800" number, and follow up information and medical referrals for those who request them, Working with the news media ("20/20," "The Mind Series," Time Magazine, etc.) to increase public awareness and to insure the accuracy of information presented. What is needed, and what the Foundation plans for the future, is a campaign of scope and magnitude comparable to those aimed atcancer and heart disease. The task of the Foundation is especially difficult because typical public attitudes toward Depression and other Affective Disorders hold the individual responsible for his or her own illness. Indeed, most depressed people hold themselves responsible -- a wrong attitude likely to accelerate the depression.

Everyone experiences variations in mood -- transitory blues, disappointments, the normal grief that accompanies the loss of someone you love. But a severe or prolonged depression that interferes with the ability to function, feel pleasure, or maintain interest is not a mere case of the blues. It is an illness. Researchers have demonstrated that it results from biochemical imbalances in the brain. Depressive Illness Is Treatable More than 80 percent of those suffering from Depressive Illness can be treated successfully with modern medications. These medications are not habit-forming, do not produce a "high", and are not abused. Sometimes, after or concurrent with this treatment, therapy or counseling is desirable. Millions Suffer, Few Are Treated Depressive Illness, also referred to as Affective or Mood Disorder, attacks millions of Americans and is often fatal; yet few people are being properly treated or even diagnosed. The costs of this neglect, both in terms of human suffering and economic loss, are staggering. A Major Unrecognized Health Problem Depressive Illness is among the most common and destructive of illnesses prevalent in the United States today. In addition to major depression, many people suffer from manic depressive illness (bipolar disorder) which is characterized by radical mood swings from severe depression to exaggerated, inappropriate elation. An estimated 35-40 million Americans living today will suffer from major Depressive Illness during their lives. For each person directly suffering, three or four times that number of their relatives, employees, associates, and friends will also be adversely affected. Of those 35-40 million afflicted, a substantial percentage will commit suicide if not treated with appropriate medication.

They include loss of self-esteem, "self-medication" with alcohol and drugs, family and career disruption, chronic disability and, in many cases, death. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among children and adolescents. It Costs Billions -- and Everybody Pays Estimates of the cost range from 15 to 35 billion dollars a year and encompass the loss of time and productivity,personnel replacement, medical care, and loss of life. Not only affected individuals, but their families, friends, employers, colleagues, and the community-at-large share in these costs. Urgent Attention Is Required Two brief mentions of Affective Disorders in a national newspaper column stimulated almost 100,000 requests for further information. A network television program depicting Depressive Illness brought in 200,000 letters. Despite the severity, magnitude, and cost of this problem, expenditures on public information, professional education, and research are minuscule in comparison with the efforts made on behalf of other, oftentimes less prevalent, disorders.

Most blame themselves and are blamed by others. This leads to the alienation of family and friends who, if they knew of the illness, would be likely to offer support and help find effective treatment. There Are Several Causes of Depressive Illness There are probably several causes of Depressive Illness and several different types of depression. Recent research shows that depression runs in families. The most severe form, bipolar disorder, is most likely inherited. Certain environmental situations, such as stress or breakup of important attachments, may precipitate depression, especially in vulnerable persons. Research is underway to understand the interaction of genes and environment, and precisely what is inherited.

Here is a checklist of symptoms of Depressive illness: Loss of energy and interest. Diminished ability to enjoy oneself. Decreased -- or increased -- sleeping or appetite. Difficulty in concentrating; indecisiveness; slowed or fuzzy thinking. Exaggerated feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or anxiety. Feelings of worthlessness. Recurring thoughts about death andsuicide. If most of these symptoms last for two weeks or more, you probably have Depressive Illness. Sometimes depression alternates with "mania" and is called Manic-Depressive Illness. Manic Depression causes mood swings creating periods with the following symptoms: A high energy level with decreased need for sleep. Unwarranted or exaggerated belief in one's own ability. Extreme irritability. Rapid, unpredictable emotional change. Impulsive, thoughtless activity, with a high risk of damaging consequences (i.e., stock speculations, sudden love affairs, etc.). Failure To Diagnose Studies have revealed that of those individuals who do eventually seek help, only a fraction seek out a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of Depressive Illness. More and more nonspecialists are learning to diagnose and treat depression, but too often, when medication is needed, it is not prescribed or is prescribed ineffectively. We are doing our best to educate professionals in depression's proper diagnosis and medical treatment. Correct Diagnosis, Wrong Treatment When Depressive Illness is diagnosed, minor tranquilizers and sleeping pills are prescribed twice as often as the right medication; and even when the right medication is prescribed, dosages are frequently lower than those needed to achieve an adequate level of therapeutic benefit.

Only patients with a Depressive Illness will experience a positive response, which may take up to six weeks. Lithium, a natural salt, is effective in the treatment of mania and, sometimes, of depression. On occasion, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)is useful, particularly for individuals whose depression is incapacitating, severe, life-threatening, or for those who cannot take or do not respond to antidepressant medications. For proper diagnosis of Depressive Illness and administration of antidepressant medication, physicians expert in diagnosis and biochemical therapy must be consulted. All physical treatments incur the risks of side effects and make informed medical monitoring a mandatory part of all treatment. Over 80 percent of those treated with these medications respond favorably, and most are able to resume normal activity. Many find psychotherapy or counseling useful as well.

Break large tasks into smaller ones; set priorities and take things one at a time; avoid taking on too much responsibility and setting overly difficult goals. Try not to expect too much from yourself so as to lessen any feeling of failure you may have. Activities such as exercise, attending sports or cultural events or participating in a religious or social event can help you feel better. It is important not to overdo it; feeling better takes time. Avoid alcohol and non-prescribed drugs. This kind of self-medication may provide a temporary "high", but in the end will intensify depression. If affected with Depressive disorders, you may feel exhausted, worthless, helpless and hopeless. You may feel like giving up. It is important to realize that these symptoms and negative thinking are part of depression. When treatment begins to take effect, the negative thinking fades.

TimeTech Investors utilizes a computer methodology that analyzes pricechanges of high yield bond mutual funds to determine whether to be invested in bond funds (which is constructive to earning high current yield with possible price appreciation) or to be invested in an associated money-market mutual fund with preservation of capital being the objective, whileearning a money-market fund yield). The investors' portfolio values are protected on a very cost effective basis by effecting an exchange to a money market mutual fund and vice-versa. More specific information is available in our "Frequently Asked Questions" section. The TimeTech Investor strategy is designed to Add Value to investors' portfolios in periods of market declines overa buy and hold strategy. The methodology has been successfully used in client portfolios since1989 and has achieved outstanding performance results. In our history, wehave achieved positive Performance Results in each quarter. The Bond Market seems to be starting 1996 in much the same manner as it did in 1994, with rising interest rates. Our Current Market Position may change but we will share with you our most recent decisions.

What is the objective of the TimeTech program? A. To provide income-oriented investors with an above-average current yield, to participate in market advances, and most importantly, to protect and preserve capital during a market decline. Q. What is the minimum investment? A. $25,000 Q. What mutual funds are used? A. Any high yield bond mutual fund or variable annuity with a high yield option that has good performance can be used, provided it allows unrestricted, cost effective exchanges to its corresponding money market fund. Q. How does the TimeTech program work? A. TimeTech's computer model keeps you invested in the high yield bond fund while market conditions remain favorable. When interest rates start trending up and bond values start to decline, the TimeTech program issues a "sell" signal and orders an exchange or switch into the safe harbor of the mutual fund's money market account. When market conditions improve, the program issues a "buy" and switches you back into the high yield fund again. Q. How many times per year can I expect Time Tech to move in and out of the fund? A. It's impossible to predict the future, but since TimeTech's inception in 1989, clients have averaged approximately 3 round-trip exchanges per year. Q. What is TimeTech's fee structure? A. The fee structure is as follows: Amount Under Advisory Management On the first $200,000 the annual fee is 1.2% On the next $300,000 the annual fee is 1.0% On the excess the annual fee is .8% One quarter of the annual fee is billed each quarter in advance. The fee may be paid or deducted (only with your permission) from your account. Q. What are the charges on each exchange? A. Because TimeTech always remains within the same mutual fund family, there are no commissions on exchanges. Most funds or brokerage accounts charge a nominal $5 to $10 fee to provide the exchange. Q. Can I cancel my TimeTech management program at any time? A. Yes. Our cancellation policy is covered in the managementagreement. Q. Is the TimeTech program appropriate for retirement accounts? A. Yes. The program works well with retirement accounts as well as with regular accounts. TimeTech creates high current income and each exchange is a capital transaction: therefore, tax-deferred accounts avoid current taxation and allow your portfolio to compoundaat higher rates. Q. What is the liquidity of the program? A. Currently, mutual funds may redeem shares within three businessdays. Thus, if you need money quickly, it is available. Actual redemption policys of a mutual fund are governed by its prospectuswhich should be consulted. Q. What reports will I receive? A. Each transaction will produce a confirmation. You will alsoreceive regular statements from the brokerage firm or mutual fundcompany. Each quarter, TimeTech will provide you with a performance report for the quarter, for the year to date, and for the total periodthat TimeTech has managed your account. Q. Aren't high yield bond fund investment risky? A. The portfolio managers of high yield bond funds research the credit worthiness of bonds very carefully before adding them to the fund's portfolio. They aso monitor those bonds in the portfolio continuously. In addition, most high yield bond funds diversify for safety into a broad number of binds, sometimes with as many as severalhundred different issues. This greatly reduces the risk of individualcredit defaults. The issuers of high yield bonds are classicallyof lower credit qualityand therefore higher risk. Investors arecompensated for that risk with a higher current yield. Q. How do I open an account? A. Your broker, registered representitive or financial planner canassist you in choosing a high yield bond fund that meets your objectives and that fits TimeTech's parameters. Once TimeTech has received and approved your management agreement, your account will be up and running.

The individual portfolio rate of return for each quarter is computed using the exacttime weighted method recognized by the Association for InvestmentManagement and Research. The exact time weighted method uses theportfolio market values at the time of each addition or withdrawl ofcapital. All additions and withdrawls are valued based on the trade date of the related transaction. The rate of return is computed bydividing the change in market value, as determined by quoted market prices, by the balance of funds available in the portfolio for the period or portion of a period between changes in capital or market value. Therates of return so computed are then weighted by the number of days over which the change was observed and averaged for the period. A composite rate of return is computed by compounding the weightedaverage rates of return for the year and then computing the effectiveannual rate, compounded daily, necessary to generate and equivalent level of income on an unchanging capital balance.

TimeTech Investors utilizes a computer methodology that analyzes pricechanges of high yield bond mutual funds to determine whether to be invested in bond funds (which is constructive to earning high current yield with possible price appreciation) or to be invested in an associated money-market mutual fund with preservation of capital being the objective, whileearning a money-market fund yield). The investors' portfolio values are protected on a very cost effective basis by effecting an exchange to a money market mutual fund and vice-versa. More specific information is available in our "Frequently Asked Questions" section. The TimeTech Investor strategy is designed to Add Value to investors' portfolios in periods of market declines overa buy and hold strategy. The methodology has been successfully used in client portfolios since1989 and has achieved outstanding performance results.

We hope this web site will help you learn more about our company and stay in touch with the continuous progress we intend to make for patients, health care providers, our investors and our employees. SuperGen was founded to provide an increasing number of products that treat life-threatening diseases such as cancer, blood cell disorders and obesity. In just five years, we are well on our way to achieving leadership in this mission. Our company is absolutely focused on products and performance, and on the people and patents necessary to realize our vision for creating enduring long-term value. We invite you to explore and share that vision. Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer SuperGen, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products intended to treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and blood cell (hematological) disorders, and other serious conditions such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its anticancer portfolio of nine generic products and five enhanced or "supergeneric" products. The Company is also developing a group of proprietary blood cell disorder products for the treatment of anemia associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, renal failure and aplastic anemia. SuperGen's proprietary obesity pill, which has shown promise in early preclinical and animal studies for chronic genetic obesity, general obesity and Type II diabetes, is currently in Phase II clinical trials.

SuperGen has built a lean team of highly accomplished and motivated people -- mostly at the senior level and many of whom have worked together as teams for years at other successful pharmaceutical companies. For example, the company's Development and Registration function, located in a separate facility near Chicago, includes six Ph.D. level members, who collectively have been responsible for nearly 200 New Drug Applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The team, as well as the company's entrepreneurial corporate culture, are an extension of the vision and strategy of SuperGen's founder Dr. Joseph Rubinfeld. Joseph Rubinfeld, PhD. Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., co-founded the Company in 1991. He has served as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Scientific Officer and a director of the Company since its inception. Dr. Rubinfeld was one of the four initial founders of Amgen in 1980 and served as Vice President and Chief of Operations until 1983. Prior to Amgen, Dr. Rubinfeld was employed at Bristol-Myers Squibb (formerly Bristol-Myers International Corporation) in a variety of positions, most recently as Vice President and Director of Research and Development. While at Bristol-Myers, Dr. Rubinfeld was instrumental in licensing the original anticancer line of products for Bristol-Myers, including Mitomycin and Bleomycin. From 1987 to 1990, he was a Senior Director at Cetus Corporation. Dr. Rubinfeld also has been a research scientist with several pharmaceutical and consumer product companies including Schering-Plough Corporation and Colgate-Palmolive Co. He received his B.S. in chemistry from C.C.N.Y., and his M.A. and Ph.D. in chemistry from Columbia University. Dr. Rubinfeld has numerous patents and/or publications on a wide range of inventions and developments including the 10-second developer for Polaroid film, manufacture of cephalosporins (the next generation of antibiotics following penicillin) and the first commercial synthetic biodegradable detergent. In 1984 Dr. Rubinfeld received the Commonwealth Award for Invention.

Basic research fills an important role in health care, but that role is already well served and is inherently a primary basis of risk for most traditional "biotechnology" companies. Our fundamental belief is that products which reach and benefit consumers in a timely manner are the real driver of creating long-term value -- for patients, for health care providers and for investors. Thus our strategy differs from many health care companies at our stage of development. This difference is reflected in the breadth and maturity of our product portfolio and pipeline. With our current products and product development programs, SuperGen intends to be a major player in the treatment of life-threatening diseases such as cancer, blood-cell disorders and obesity.

The Company believes that this approach differs from that adopted by most pharmaceutical companies. Instead of engaging in pure discovery research to obtain lead compounds, the Company licenses or acquires rights to compounds typically at the preclinical or early clinical stage of development that have shown efficacy in humans or in a model relevant to a particular clinical disease. The Company then seeks to enhance and complete the product development and bring the product to market. In its generic and supergeneric drug development program, the Company targets off-patent products that have already been commercialized but nevertheless offer the Company attractive market opportunities. The Company believes that this approach minimizes the significant financial investment required by pure discovery research and reduces the risk of failure in developing a commercially viable product. SuperGen's objective is to become a leading supplier of pharmaceuticals for life-threatening diseases, including cancer and blood cell disorders, and other serious conditions such as obesity. The Company focuses its product development efforts where the Company believes there are significant market opportunities, such as in the treatment of cancer and other blood cell disorders and in obesity, as well as in smaller niche markets where the Company believes there is limited competition, such as certain anticancer drug markets. The Company seeks to develop a diversified pharmaceutical offering within its focused anticancer/blood cell disorder market, including generic, supergeneric and proprietary drugs, and seeks to implement a staged strategy for bringing products to market. The Company believes that early commercialization of its anticancer generic drugs will assist the Company in developing its reputation and presence in the market while it continues to develop its supergeneric and proprietary products.
