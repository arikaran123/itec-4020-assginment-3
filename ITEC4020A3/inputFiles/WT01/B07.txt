Remote Sensing of Sea Ice Remote Sensing of land cover and Forestry Remote Sensing of the middle atmosphere Publications Introduction The Remote Sensing Group is active in applications for remotesensing using sensors in the frequency band from VHF to sub millimetrewaves. The aim is to develop applications of new sensors for environmentalmonitoring. Satellite applications dominate but airborne and ground-basedtechniques are also of interest. Developments in INSAR technology. An ESA project for calibration and validation of the SAR for thefuture Envisat satellite has been ongoing. Methods for calibrationof the VHF SAR CARABAS have been developed. Using two or more SAR images over the same area it is possibleto extract two parameters, coherence and phase. The coherenceis related to the stability on the scale of the radar wavelengthand phase is related to the location of the imaged object. Coherencehas been shown to be a useful tool for classification of differentland covers, see below. For interferometric SAR methods for slope corrections of the radarbackscatter have been developed. The phase measurements have been shown to be an accurate measureof the ground topography in an area in Northern Sweden. A semi-automatic differential INSAR processor has been developedwhere the inputs are two SAR images and one DEM (Digital ElevationModel). Many of the INSAR developments have been carried out under anESA contract co-ordinated by Matra Cap Systems for studying applicationsof interferometric SAR. The Remote Sensing Group has had the mainresponsibility for forestry. Coherence estimation A very important step in INSAR is to estimate coherence and phasecorrectly. Coherence estimation is often biased for low coherence.The bias depends on window size and assumed ground topographyover the window. There is a trade-off between overestimation andunderestimation of the coherence. Overestimation can be decreasedusing larger windows but then assumptions of the ground topographywill not longer be valid and that will underestimate the coherence.Using an available digital elevation model, DEM, will more orless eliminate the effect of underestimation. Current effortsare to further analyse the statistics of the images and the knownestimators in order to reduce the bias. Temporal and volume decorrelation In the case of a time interval between image acquisitions (repeat-passinterferometry), the ground area is likely to change, thus causingtemporal decorrelation. Volume decorrelation occurs over areaswhich have scatterers distributed over different heights e.g.in crown, trunk and undergrowth layers in forests. Under manyconditions it is impossible to discriminate between temporal andvolume decorrelation, but when the two images are taken from almostthe same position (within about 100 metres) the volume correlationbecomes negligible, leaving the temporal decorrelation. Our studiesshow that the temporal decorrelation is the major discriminatingfactor in INSAR images. The temporal changes can be split intotwo factors; geometrical and dielectric changes. Geometrical changes(due mostly to wind) are believed to be the major cause of decorrelationin forests on a short time scale (almost instantaneous) whiledielectric changes will work on longer time scales (over a fewdays, depending mainly on changes in weather conditions). Troposphericinfluence on INSAR For accurate phase measurements the error due to the atmosphericdelay is an important factor, and an investigation of the atmosphericinfluence on the accuracy of derived DEM:s from INSAR has startedbased on the long experience of water vapour radiometer observationsas well as GPS observations. Remote Sensing of Sea Ice Modelling of SAR signatures from sea ice An extensive program on modelling of the radar backscatter fromsea ice has been ongoing for validation of satellite remote sensingusing synthetic aperture radar. Models help in understanding risksof misinterpretation of single sensor signatures. Level and deformedice, frazil, frost flowers, new ice, leads etc. have been studied.Of special interest has been ice ridges due to the problems associatedwith ship navigation, and signatures of frost flowers etc. givingrise to similar signatures as deformed ice. Baltic Sea Ice EMAC'95 For increased information about radar scattering properties multifrequency is important. Optimal frequency combinations for futuresatellite missions are also important to investigate. As part of the European Multi-Sensor Airborne Campaign (EMAC-95)onSnow and Ice 1995 in Finland radar signatures of smooth low-salinitylevel ice in the Gulf of Bothnia were measured by means of a shipmounted scatterometer operating at L, S, C, and X-band. Utilisingthe ranging capability of the scatterometer system the dominantscattering contributions as function of depth in the ice werelocated for the different frequencies. Together with in situice and snow observations and using radar scattering modellingit was found that the X-band scattering is caused by volume inhomogeneitiesin the uppermost part of the ice, the C- and S-band scatteringby the roughness of the snow-ice interface, while at L-band dominantradar returns originate also from the ice-water interface. Inconclusion C- and L-band would be complementary for SAR sea icemonitoring in the Baltic. Sea ice displacements by INSAR Interferometric SAR technique, INSAR, can be used to measure surfacedisplacements between acquisitions. This has attracted much interestfor earthquake and landslide monitoring. It can also be used tomeasure displacements over fast ice. Over the fast ice in the Bay of Bothnia, we have measured displacementson the cm level over approx. 2010 km2. Such measurementsare believed to be unique. Current efforts are to model the icedisplacements and compare with INSAR measurements. Arctic Sea Ice Ice type classification Ice concentration in the Arctic derived from ERS-1 SAR and theSSM/I together with field observations consisting of ship observationsand helicopter video from the Arctic-91 expedition were compared.The studied areas were characterised by melting conditions andnew ice formation with frost flowers. For interpretation temporalsequences of the SAR images and meteorological information wasused. It was found that SSM/I may underestimate the ice concentrationby 20 per cent due to thin ice formation and melting conditionswhile SAR may overestimate. This illustrates the importance ofcombining information from different sensors. By using the SARestimate of different ice classes it is believed to be possibleto increase the accuracy of the ice concentration. Ice motion derivation Optical flow and other algorithms have been derived in the groupfor ice motion derivation. The basic assumptions in the opticalflow analysis are that image brightness is stationary and thevelocity field is constant within a small neighbourhood. An erroranalysis is made and two criteria introduced for testing the possibilityof using the optical flow method. Some smoothing has to take placein order to increase the estimate accuracy of sea ice motion.To avoid an ill-conditioned problem a conditioning number is introduced.A test of the non-uniformity of the velocity field is also introduced.The two criteria are used for choosing the spatial resolutionsuitable for an automatic optical flow analysis. The method hasbeen applied to three image pairs from Arctic-91 and with a pixelspacing of 200 m. The rms. error between the automatic methodand manually identified control points in the images was foundto vary between 640 and 730 meters. The same area (the Yermakplateau) has been observed during the expedition in 1996 and thework will continue using these images when available. A matching algorithm based on a similarity measure, the sum-of-squareddifference (SSD), has also been tested with the same three imagepairs as used in the optical flow method. The experimental resultsobtained with both optical flow method and SSD method are in agood agreement. Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996 Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996 Preparations for the Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996 has been ongoingduring the period of the biennial report. A team consisting ofparticipants from Alfred Wegener Institute, Chalmers Universityof Technology, Helsinki University, Helsinki University of Technology,and SMHI carried out a program in Remote Sensing and Sea Ice inJuly - September 1996. Synthetic aperture radar images from RADARSATand ERS-2 are provided by support from the Canadian and EuropeanSpace Agencies, respectively. Remote Sensing of land cover and Forestry Forestry using CARABAS Microwave SAR signatures are saturated at relatively low stemvolumes. Lower frequencies have increased potential to estimatehigh stem volumes or biomass. CARABAS is an airborne VHF syntheticaperture radar system developed by the National Defence ResearchOrganisation. Images have been provided from Ottenbylund, Öland,and from Maine, USA. Field investigations have taken place atOttenbylund and it has been shown that the sensitivity for stemvolume has not saturated like higher frequency SAR systems forthe observed stem volume (up to 210 m3/ha). References[117-119, 216, 218]. A program for developing models for the radar scattering is ongoing.Compared to models developed at higher frequencies it is importantto investigate what forest properties dominate the scattering,to what extent coherent interactions take place and to what extentground penetration takes place. INSAR Forestry applications and land cover applications In order to understand INSAR images over forested areas, it isimportant to develop models which relate geophysical parametersto the parameters in the images, i.e. coherence and phase. Thecurrent forest model is an extension of the "water cloudmodel" developed for normal SAR images. It includes the volumeand temporal decorrelation of the forests and also gives a phasemeasure. Observations illustrate that the coherence and interferometricheight varies in different images. A model has been developedbased on how the scattering from the forest layers is combinedwith ground scattering from areas within the forest, either attenuatedby the canopy or not. Crucial information is the percentage ofopen areas within the forest and the attenuation through the canopytogether with the temporal stability of the canopy scattering.Available information on these properties is limited and uncertain,but best estimates result in reasonable agreement between theoryand observations. Using the coherence together with the intensity it is possibleto classify different land covers. Results indicate that the separationof forest from non-forest areas is much easier using coherencemeasurements than in intensity images. However, the coherenceresults indicate a difficulty in discriminating between open fieldsand clear cut areas of forest. In this case the intensity informationcan be used to complement coherence measurements. Although wehave concentrated on boreal forests, initial results from an areain the Amazon rain forest indicate that coherence can still beused for the important task of identifying areas of cutting withinforested regions. DEM production INSAR images can also be used to produce accurate digital heightmaps (Digital Elevation Models). An important problem is thatless accurate measurements are derived over forests due to thelow coherence and that the forest will give a contribution tothe height measurement. This effect can be modelled by the aboveforest model. However, it is still possible to produce DEM:s fromINSAR images. Over an area in Northern Sweden covered partly withboreal forests, we have achieved an accuracy of 5 m RMS error(using 20 m pixel size) for the DEM (compared to a real DEM) forone INSAR image. Of course, by using several INSAR images theerror will decrease. The bias between the ground level DEM andthe INSAR measured DEM is caused by the forest height. Remote Sensing of the middle atmosphere In the group the retrieval of vertical profiles from passive radiometricobservations of the middle atmosphere is studied. This work isperformed to analyse the measurements from a ground-based instrumentunder construction at Onsala Space Observatory (22.2 and 110-116GHz) and the aeronomical measurements of the Odin satellite (480-580GHz). None of the sensors is yet working operationally and thework has been concentrated on simulating system properties andestimating different error sources. To study the profile retrieval accuracy of the future observationsis of course of general interest but it can also be a help inthe construction work because the importance of different instrumentallimitations is revealed in the theoretical examination. Simulation of a ground-based observation is relatively straightforwardand focus has been put to comparing the performance of differentretrieval methods. The methods have been studied both theoreticallyand practically by inverting simulated spectra. Several importantdifferences were found but no method was found to be superiorin all occasions, the choice of retrieval scheme must be selectedaccording to the purpose of the observation. The influence ofdifferent error sources has also been examined. The importanceof suppressing the baseline ripple to enable ozone in the lowerstratosphere to be satisfactory retrieved was shown. To simulate a satellite limb sounding observation is more complex.A model of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere and the mostimportant instrumental characteristics of the sensor has beenimplemented and observations have been successively simulated.The expected retrieval accuracy has been studied for differentobservation conditions and a number of species, including O3,ClO, HNO3, and H2O. It was found that thefixed design of the Odin sub-mm receiver enables simultaneousobservation of at least four species and suggestions on suitableinstrumental settings for observations in the stratosphere andthe mesosphere have been given.

Institutionen för Radio- och Rymdvetenskap med Onsala Rymdobservatoriumkan erbjuda intressanta examensarbeten inom flera olika forskningsområden.För en fullständig uppsättning se Onsala-listan.Nedan finner du, efter en presentation av gruppens forskningsverksamhet,beskrivningar av aktuella examensarben, liksom namn på kontaktpersoner. Egna idéer till projekt kan naturligtvis också diskuteras. Aktuell forskning vid fjärranalysgruppen Fjärranalysgruppen utnyttjar elektromagnetiska sensorer alltifrånVHF till millimeter vågor för observationer av våregen jord, t ex för att utröna utsträckning ochegenskaper hos havsis, för att kartlägga skogar ochvåtmarker, eller för att utforska ozonskiktet. Mångaav tillämpningarna handlar således om miljömätteknik.En stor del av arbetet är f n fokuserat på den europeiskamiljösatelliten ERS-1 med dess syntetiska aperturradar (SAR).SAR-principen använder satellitens rörelse föratt syntetisera en större antenn, och därmed erhållsen mycket hög upplösning. Genom att modellera hur radarsignalernaväxelverkar med mediet och jämföra med in situ-mätningar,kan slutsatser dras om hur radarbilderna skall tolkas. Forskningenär alltså inriktad på vågutbredning ochmikrovågssystem. Verksamheten syftar till att utveckla nyaoch avancerade sensorer mot en viss mötuppgift, vilket innebäratt verksamheten omfattar alltifrån systemegenskaper, elektromagnetiskspridning, bildbehandling, signalextraktion etc. Olika examensarbetenkan ha sin huvudinriktning mot olika aspekter.

A system model is described to characterisedifferent effects in the system. A description of error sourcesis included as well as a thorough description of estimation techniques.Coherence and phase estimates are shown to be biased under certainconditions. Height estimates suffers from several errors, e.g.biasing, orbital modelling and atmospheric-induced errors. Fourof the applications are covered, digital height maps, forest monitoring,land cover classification and shore-fast sea ice monitoring togetherwith an error analysis of results. For example, derived digitalheight maps have a RMS error of 3-5 meters in northern Swedenbut also a height bias over forested areas which is approx. lessthan half the real tree height in the area. The modelling of forestsshow a principle agreement with measured parameters in the images.Weather conditions greatly influence measurements. Inversion ofmeasured parameters should be possible with the model and thusa measure of forest bole volume could be obtained from the images.Land cover classification using SAR interferometry is outlinedtogether with how the data could be used. However, better understandingof how different land classes appear in the images is required.

Note: The program represents the aims as planned before the expeditionstart. The actual program was determined by the ice situationand changes in the planned route. Leg 1: Sea ice melt period; program related to meltponds andgeneral ice properties. Ice properties are recorded together with meteorological informationin the trafficability report. The same observations will takeplace on Polarstern and the reports will be co-ordinated. GöranLiljeström is the only representative but he will obtainhelp from the Russian ice experts onboard. Visual observationsof area coverage of one year, two year and multi year ice is important.Of special importance during this leg is the meltpond coverageand melt pond properties e.g. size distributions. To extend the ship observations video recordings from the helicopterwill be carried out together with ice reconnaissance. Such observationsshould be checked during the cruise for consistency with the bridgeobservations. With only Göran Liljeström in the program field workhas to be concentrated to the cases when stops are taking placeduring days with satellite imaging. The melt period extends somewhat into leg 2. It should be notedthat the meltpond coverage is varying between first year (30-50%)and multiyear ice (20-30%). Embarking: Göteborg Leg 2: Sea ice freeze-up period, program related to the variabilityof the ice properties including melting conditions The melt period extends somewhat into leg 2. Melt ponds are ofinterest from many points of view including the fact that majorparts of the roughness characterisation of the ice surface isrelated to the melt ponds. The melting is also related to radiationproperties and radiation measurements 300-1100 nm will be performedwithin snow and ice and in the water beneath the ice, in leadsand meltponds. Possibilities to characterise one year, two yearand multi year ice is generally important. As the variability of the ice is the most interesting aspect,as the time within the ice is limited to two - three weeks, andas the program is split between the two ships reducing the effectivenessin characterising sea ice properties we have asked for a stoponce per day or at least 14 - 15 stops for making field observationstogether with helicopeter observations. The helicopter observationsare particularly important together with the longer stops whenmore extensive ice information can be obtained. This should becombined with satellite images and the route should then be relatedto the satellite acquisitions. Helicopter observations are performed using scatterometer andvideo in order to have observe mesoscale variations. Larger areasare covered in a zig-zag manner by helicopter making scatterometerobservations (altitude 100 m) followed by separate videofilmingfrom higher altitude. GPS and time information important for localization.Photographs from helicopter are also very good complements (timenoted). Notes on ice properties of area important. The stopping time needs to be 3 - 12 hours depending on the program.The ice structure and microstructure will be measured (3 hours)followed by sediment and sediment redistribution observations(3 hours). Radiation properties can be measured in parallell.For excavating an ice trench and for optical measurements at differentdepth of the ice, for drilling of ice cores (note Göran Liljeströmwill have equipment for quick drilling of 1.5 m ice cores forwhich temperature profiles and salinity can be determined by thesea ice group) and determining temperature, salinity and DEP (dielectricprofiling of conductance and capacitance at several frequencies1- 100 kHz) of the ice cores up to 12 hours is necessary. Shortstops will be used for observations adjacent to the ship as wellas observations away from the ship while the ship is moving. Longerstops are necessary for some of the program elements as well asfor wide area coverage of ice information and helicopter observations.Areas covered by helicopter scatterometer should also be characterizedby surface observations made by team using skidoos. Surface properties,snow layer (thickness), aged ice surface (thickness, properties),roughness characterization (mechanical pin device with a measurmentgrid behind + photographs), snow wetness, roughness properties,snow and ice temperature (particularly when temperature of iceis close to zero), ice ridge properties (height, width, blocksizes, block roughness on various sizes). Thin ice and occurenceof frost flower important information. Thickness of ice is determinedby means of radio echo soundings using 50 or 400 Mhz along transectsusing man-hauled or using skidoo. The ice information also includes Radio beacons have been placed to localise three areas of icewith different properties during 1995. Due to the drift patternthese areas will have drifted to the area where leg 2 starts oreven further north. Revisiting at least one of these areas isvery important, but depending on the most recent location informationfrom the beacon. (This program point not possible to carry outas the ice drift was larger than anticipated.) The group has 25 hours of helicopter time available which isapproximately the same time as 1991. Due to the risk for bad flyingconditions we have to agree on a priority list such as (1) revisitingof one beacon-site, (2) area coverage with helicopter borne scatterometer,(3) area coverage by video. Embarking: Lominosov Ridge Leg 1 + 2 Remote sensing The remote sensing program is mainly related to ERS-2 and Radarsatfor which Jan Askne and Hajo Eicken are PI:s for different projectswhich we will try to coordinate. ERS-2 needs direct contact witha ground station which limits the coverage to the first partsof Leg 1. Radarsat has the capability to store data onboard anddump it over Canada. The delays in the delivery of data are notyet quite clear. NOAA AVHRR data is of interest to combine with radiation measurementson the ice and with SAR data. High resolution data will be obtainedat Polarstern, low resolution on Oden. Okean data will be received on Polarstern and possibly Oden ifpossible. The nominal lifetime of the satellite is already over. SSM/I data is planned to be combined with Radarsat data.WT01-B07-17IA039-000745-B025-109http://www.rss.chalmers.se:80/WWW_rsg/cruisereport.htm 129.16.35.18 19970210104810 text/html 9395HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 10:48:21 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.1Last-modified: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 22:30:09 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 9212 Utkast till Cruise Report SEA ICE REMOTE SENSING OF THE HIGH ARCTIC Cruise Report from Arctic Ocean 1996 (leg2) with i/b Oden Prepared by Bertil Håkansson with contributionsfrom the participants November, 1996 Background The satelliteborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is apromising technique for research in hostile environment like theArctic, where weather and ice conditions are a real threat totraditional in situ observations and measurements (cf. Askne 1994).This technique has also been proven to be useful for ship andicebreaker operations in ice infested seas (cf. Håkanssonet al. 1995, and Herland & Berglund 1995). Since SAR dataare obtained as an image, the distribution of different typesof ice and open water can be obtained. The gathered expedition data are used for SAR imagery validation,and evaluation of its usefulness for monitoring of sea ice propertiesof importance for climate change. In particular we are interestedin meltpond distribution, sea ice concentrations and sea ice drift.The results from Arctic-91 expedition shows that ESA satelliteERS-1 indeed could be used for retrieving some of these sea icevariables (Sun & Askne 1994 and Pettersson et al. 1996). However,the ERS-1 SAR imagery has a much smaller geographic coverage thanthe present Radarsat SAR imagery (100*100 km2compared to 500*500 km2) and in addition Radarsathas a much larger coverage towards the high latitudes (up to about88° N) than ERS-1 and -2. Since little is known about theice distribution and its seasonal variability at high latitudes,it is possible with this technique to improve our knowledge andcontribute with bits and pieces to the water and energy exchangebetween the ocean and the atmosphere in the Arctic area. Processeswhich are critical in climate and environmentally related researchactivities. Work at Oden and on the ice The radar emits energy in the microwave range of the spectrum,for example the Canadian satellite Radarsat is operating at thefrequency of 5.3 GHz, at different angles to the ground. In thiscontext an important task of the expedition was to get informationof the sea ice conditions for comparison with the image data.We concentrated our efforts on snow coverage, density, grain size,temperature, wetness and thickness as well as the ice thickness,roughness, temperature, salinity, porosity, density and dielectricproperties. In addition it is important to have information onridges, leads, meltponds, first-year and multi-year ice distributions. Hence, the aim of our project was to gather information of snowand ice conditions, distribution of ice and open water and ofice-types, during times when the satellite passed over our observationarea. A helicopterborne video camera connected to a GPS was usedto observe the local scale of the sea ice variability. Helicopterflights in this part of the world are extremely weather dependentsince the visibility changes rapidly and there is often risk foricing during high moisture content at air temperatures below 0°C. During the second leg of the cruise the air temperature neverexceed 0° C and the moisture was almost always around 80to 90 %. When the cloud cover disappeared, the outgoing thermalradiation often cooled the atmosphere close to the ground andthe moist turned into fog. Despite the weather conditions we managedto get 4 stations covered with measurements from the helicopter. In addition, tests were performed with a skidoo mounted radar,determining the backscatter from layers where the dielectric propertiesof the ice varied rapidly. Large backscatter is generally obtainedfrom the interface between ice and water. These radar data arecompared with actual observations of the ice thickness, usinga machine driven drill. In general the accuracy of the radar is± 0.20 meters. A scatterometer mounted on the helicopter was used to determinethe backscatter from different ice-types and water. This informationis of importance for the interpretation of SAR imagery, as a complementto the calculated backscatter, using a model based on the dataobtained from the ground measurements. Also the sun radiation within the ice was measured. A larger holewas sawed into the ice and from the side a small horizontal holewas drilled. A radians meter was put into this hole, from whichthe sun radiation, coming through the snow and the ice above it,was observed. These data will be used to increase the knowledgeof the energy flux parameterisation in snow and ice, which areimportant for climate models. Another additional subproject ofthe group was to investigate the sediment content in the sea ice.A presentation of this project will be given elsewhere. Some preliminary results In all we were able to cover 12 ice stations. The average snowthickness varied from 8 to 56 cm, with the thin snow cover (8to 15 cm) obtained at 85° N 10° E and southward to themarginal ice zone. The snow can be classified into four differenttypes, based on density and grain size; a/ new snow with highvoid content and small grain size, b/ new but windpacked snowwith relatively low void content and slightly larger grain size,c/ granular snow particles with low void content and d/ highlygranular snow-ice particles with medium void content loosely bondedto each other. Statistics shows there are a relation between meanand standard deviation of snow thickness. These data can be usedto estimate the local average snow cover thickness, informationnecessary for thermodynamic modelling and heat exchange betweenthe water-ice-atmosphere system and for interpretation of SARimagery. In the eastern high Arctic there were no signs that a summer melthas taken place, since relatively high salinity was found in thesurface parts of the second-year ice cores, investigated alongthe 85° N latitude between 149 and 160° E. On the otherhand, in areas closer to the ice edge i.e. south of 85° Nalong 10° E had experienced melting conditions. A conclusionbased on the vast amount of frozen melt ponds found in this partof the Arctic. Typically the ponds were covered with 10 to 20cm of fresh ice above a layer of fresh water on multi-year ice. The very first preliminary analysis of a RADARSAT image from September1 indicate that the ice concentration is on average 85 % in thatparticular area, which is close in magnitude to the estimate foundfrom helicopter video measurements, cf Figure 1. At first glanceit may appear unlikely with such a relatively low ice concentration,but note that the i/b Oden managed well at these latitudes, sinceice breaking could be avoided to a great extent due to the presenceof leads and openings.

Our founders believed, as did Sigmund Freud, that psychoanalytic training and practice should be open tocreative and talented professionals from all fields of study. Theodor Reik Consultation Center (TRCC) referral service has met community needs for low cost psychotherapy and psychoanalysis for over 40 years. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. Professional workshops, seminars and conferences supported by TRCC and the NPAP Membership organization. Psychoanalytic Review, founded in 1913, is the oldest continuously published psychoanalytic journal in the world. It has been, historically, and continues to be opposed to dogma, rigidity and exclusionism. While maintaining the highest standards of scholarship, it is the only established journal that is committed to a psychoanalytic exploration of, not only the clinical domain, but also the realm of general culture. The Institute is chartered under the Education Law of the State of New York by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. Absolute Charter from the New York State Board of Regents was granted on February 24, 1967.

It is often said that the most talented analysts started out with at least one crazy parent who was not "cured" by the youngster's best efforts to understand and respond. NPAP's Charter permits persons to enter psychoanalytic training if they have earned at least a Master's degree in a field of human relations. Candidates have come to NPAP from the fields of religion, law, literature, the arts, education, philosophy and other branches of the humanities as well as the fields of nursing, social work, psychology and psychiatry. WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS SPECIAL TRAINING? Usually the candidate's whole life changes. The study of psychoanalysis is not only about helping others. Its insights have a way of becoming intensely personal for all who undertake the 4 components of training. The Curriculum consists of 26 courses focused on understanding how theory can be applied to actually working with patients one-to-one. Candidates receive a thorough grounding in Classical Psychoanalysis as well as contemporary thinking in the areas of Psychoanalytic Ego Psychology, Object Relations, and Self Psychology. The Training Analysis is a unique feature of an analyst's preparation. No psychoanalyst is allowed to treat others without first undergoing personal analysis. Otherwise, even the brightest of students still would have no foundation for understanding what patients are truly saying and would have no way to recognize when their own personality dynamics were limiting or interfering with their work. Training Analysis is traditionally the most important aspect of learning to understand the human mind and expand the analyst's talents in responding to others. Clinical experience consists of treating patients with a variety of diagnoses and levels of functioning while the candidate is in supervision. After completing the first phase of training, candidates may affiliate with NPAP's referral service, known as the THEODOR REIK CONSULTATION CENTER. TRCC is not a clinic and does not subject candidates or patients to an institutional atmosphere. Rather, TRCC's patients are treated in the candidate's own privateoffice. Candidates just beginning a private practice may rent space in the NPAP building at affordable rates. Control Analysis refers to the intensive experience of meeting weekly with a supervisor to focus on the candidate's treatment of a single patient in psychoanalysis. This makes possible a depth of understanding and responding that could never come about any other way. Candidates conduct at least two such treatments under different supervisors, lasting at least 1 year for one patient and 2 years for the other. IS TRAINING EXPENSIVE? Courses are $200 for a 12-week session ($250 for an auditor). This is much less expensive than virtually any other type of graduate training. The more expensive part is the Training Analysis which is why candidates may request a list of NPAP Members willing to conduct alow-fee Training Analysis. When all is said and done, analysis enhancespersonal life as well as professional competence.

TRCC is not a clinic. More than 250 therapists see TRCC's patients in their own offices, affording each patient privacy and confidentiality. Therapists do not "sign up" with TRCC. Each must be invited to participate after a committee interview and evaluation of the therapist's training, understanding and sensitivity. In this way TRCC ensures that its therapists are warm, caring people-many trained in couples therapy, family and group therapy as well as individual treatment. Many therapists are multi-lingual so that foreign languages may not be a barrier. We believe that problems which may seem insurmountable can be explored and often resolved with the help of a therapist who understands and appreciates each individual's uniqueness, inner resources, and feelings. This service to the community is non-profit in the truest sense: TRCC's Director and Executive Committee are elected by the Membership of the Institute to serve as volunteers. No hidden owners or administrators benefit financially from the patient-therapist relationship. The fee for treatment is based on the ability to pay and starts at $15 per session. The Intake Interview fee is $25. Although TRCC's administrative office is located in Manhattan, our therapists are located throughout the Tri-State area (New York, Connecticut, New Jersey) and beyond. To make an appointment for an intake interview, please call: (212)-ANALYST Each year TRCC sponsors the NPAP CLINICAL WORKSHOP SERIES for new and established mental health professionals.

How do I know if I should begin psychotherapy? When a person is asking this question seriously, then psychotherapy is usually a good idea. Waiting for a crisis or panic is not necessary. Therapy is most productive when a person realizes that personal difficulties are not going to change by repeating the usual methods. 2. What if I have been told to go into therapy? If a boss or spouse has insisted that you begin therapy, you may be angry and think about what you need to do to placate others and end your treatment. After you get past this initial focus, you may find therapy one of the most important experiences of your life. 3. Does therapy take a long time? Often people experience a burst of growth right at the start, along with a realization that they are still holding on to thoughts or feelings that cannot be explored as easily as they might have wished. This struggle toward the goal of telling the whole story, not just part, may increase time in therapy as it increases growth. 4. If I go more often, does this mean I am sicker? No, often the opposite is true. People who are basically healthy but distressed by problems in living can make the best use of two or three sessions a week. They realize that a single session tends to limit them to talking about weekly events, whereas two or three sessions permit genuine exploration of important ideas and feelings. 5. What are the differences between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists, and psychoanalysts? While most of these practitioners have probably had some training in basic counseling methods, the differences between them are crucial and affect the perspective from which you as the patient will be treated. A psychiatrist is a physician and has been uniquely trained in prescribing psychotropic medications. A psychologist has a Ph.D. or Psy.D. degree and is uniquely trained in psychological testing and research. A social worker has an M.S.W. degree and is uniquely trained in the workings of social service programs and psychosocial counseling. In most states,the term psychotherapist can be used by anyone, with or without training and credentials. A psychoanalyst has the most comprehensive training of all, since this specialized training cannot even begin until the person has already earned a postgraduate degree. A certified psychoanalyst has spent an extra 8-10 years focusing on how to work with people one-to-one. Psychoanalysis is the only profession in which certification requires the analyst to go through personal treatment, averaging 5-10 years, so that the analyst will not confuse the analyst's personal issues with the patient's. 6. Even when I know the differences in academic degrees, how can I be sure that my therapist's training is relevant and certified? Strange as it seems, you can't really be sure unless you investigate, since most states do not pay any attention to whether or not a therapist has been through personal analysis and completed a training program in psychoanalysis. A true psychoanalyst will have a certificate from a recognized institute and will be able to point you to a national Directory of Psychoanalysts where this person's name is listed. 7. When it comes to my own therapy sessions, what difference does training in psychoanalysis really make? Your psychoanalyst's approach to therapy will be distinctive. Virtually all other branches of the mental health field teach their professionals to function as "experts," with goals, ideas or plans that the patient is supposed to learn to go along with. Psychoanalysts consider this approach useless and even harmful, since it falsely implies that the patient is ignorant or wrong and that the therapist knows better. A psychoanalyst's approach is based on a sophisticated listening process that can identify previously unknown obstacles to growth. Resolving these obstacles frees the person's own talents in choosing a personal pathway to solving problems. 8. Don't psychoanalysts spend a lot of time talking about childhood? Psychoanalysts have no special topics the patient is supposed to discuss. Patients often bring up childhood memories and fantasies as psychoanalysis enables the mind to expand. Life themes that previously seemed disconnected are understood in a new light. This integration of past and present is part of the holistic growth resulting from psychoanalysis. 9. What if I have health insurance for psychotherapy? Many analysts are willing to cooperate with insurance companies, but even though you pay premiums year after year, you might be surprised to find that your policy strictly limits benefits for psychotherapy. A summer 1996 issue of The National Psychologist reported that a whopping 99% of the consumers who actually examined their HMO's policies and procedures are dissatisfied. Consumers found that their company expected a detailed written report about confidential information, that they are only covered for a few sessions, that the company wanted them to take pills, or that they could not choose the best therapist because the company required them to see someone who had a financial agreement on the side that they are not allowed to know about. When your own life and future is at stake, beware of choosing the path that looks cheapest at first glance. 10. Does psychoanalysis curtail creativity? Most people worried about losing creativity in therapy are inwardly aware that they long for more productive ways to harness their creativity and bring it to light. In psychoanalytic therapy a person's creativity is likely to expand as inner wishes to be more creative have a chance to come to fruition in the person's actions. Creativity actually increases. 11. Why does Managed Care try to avoid psychoanalysts? Because managed care makes a profit by paying out as little money as possible for treatment. Most managed care operations restrict treatment to a specific topic (or diagnosis) that must be written down and sent to the company. Managed care limits the number of sessions, interferes with confidentiality and restricts the therapists who work for the company. Psychoanalysts insist that only the patient has the right to set the agenda for therapy, and that only the patient should have the freedom to shorten or expand this agenda according to personal needs. 12. Is psychoanalysis expensive? Most psychoanalysts have a sliding fee scale, or set aside part of their time for patients who can only afford a lower fee. Many analysts also have a network of colleagues who can help find the right analyst for someone in financial need. For nearly 100 years this commitment to patient needs has made psychoanalytic therapy available and affordable. As Freud once remarked, "nothing is as expensive as illness, or ignorance". 13. Is treatment confidential? If you are seeing a certified psychoanalyst - and not using Managed Care - the answer is absolutely YES. However, under Managed Care, no one can guarantee your privacy as information collected about you as a patient is stored in the company's computer, and may possibly be shared with other companies or agencies. 14. How should I go about choosing a therapist? Two rules are fundamental: (a) the person you choose should have advanced, specialized training in psychotherapy (not just an academic degree or license), and (b) you should not rely on an insurance company's list of therapists. Although it is sometimes helpful to seek a recommendation, you must always rely on your own judgment when it comes to the "chemistry" in the room. Avoid basing your choice merely on a convenient location, surface similarities between you and a therapist, or even the therapist's gender; chemistry matters most. At the THEODOR REIK CONSULTATION CENTER, nearly 250 therapists in private practice in the New York-Connecticut-New Jersey region have met TRCC's advanced training standards. If no one at TRCC is just right, the Intake Director will know who to recommend instead.

Louis S. Berger, PhD Tuesday, January 21. 1997 8 PM NPAP Library 150 West 13 Street New York City In recent times, radical critiques of the human sciences' traditional,widely and uncritically accepted basic assumptions (about persons, knowledge,truth, validation, internal and external reality, and the like) have convergedon a consensus that seriously calls these assumptions into question, seeingthem as deeply flawed. These challenged assumptions also operate ubiquitously within psychoanalysis,and the principal premise of this presentation is that they also, at bottom,are responsible for the many familiar theoretical, conceptual, methodologicaland clinical difficulties that perennially plague psychoanalysis. In support of this premise, first the radical critiques of general psychologywill be outlined and considered Next. their relevance specifically forpsychoanalysis will be discussed, with particular attention to the linkagesthat are widely thought to exist between psychoanalytic theory and itsclinical practice. Finally, tentative recommendations for future directionswill be offered, including an introduction to the concept of "psychoanalyticpraxis." Louis S. Berger's professional life spans the fields of electrical engineering(B. S.), physics (M. S. ), music (M. M. ), and clinical psychology (Ph.D. ). Formerly a cellist withthe Boston Symphony, on the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry andBehavioral Sciences, University of Louisville School of Medicine, he isnow Staff Psychologist at Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas.and teaches seminars in the Department of Psychiatry, University of TexasHealth Science Center at San Antonio. Dr Berger is the author of IntroductoryStatistics: A New Approach for the Behavioral Sciences (1981). PsychoanalyticTheory and Clinical Relevance: What Makes a Theory Consequential for Practice?(Analytic Press, 1985), and Substance Abuse as Symptom: A PsychoanalyticCritique of Treatment Approaches and the Cultural Beliefs that SustainThem (Analytic Press, 1991), and numerous book reviews and articles.

An auditormay take one course each term from among the list of required 600 levelcourses. Unless the number of auditors is sufficient for the Faculty andCurriculum Committee to schedule a separate class, auditors are admittedinto regularly scheduled courses. Admission as an auditor: An auditor must have at least a Master's degree. Interested persons complete an application form available from the NPAP office and are then invited for an enrollment interview. Tuition and Fees: Tuition is $250 for each 12-session course taken atthe 600 level. In addition to the $50 application fee, auditors pay aregistration fee of $25 per term; a yearly $10 library fee; a $30 fee for asubscription to The Psychoanalytic Review; a $10 fee for a subscription tothe NPAP News and Reviews; and $20 for membership in the candidate association, the Members-in-Training-Organization (MITO). Options: Auditors complete all reading assignments and participate ingeneral class discussions with no more than 2 absences. They may choosewhether or not to make formal oral presentations (where applicable) orcomplete written assignments. An auditor who completes all courserequirements and receives an acceptable faculty evaluation will receivefull credit for this course if admitted later into the training program. Evaluations: Auditors submit evaluations of their experiences in eachcourse to the Faculty and Curriculum Committee. Instructors evaluateauditors according to the extent of each auditor's self-chosen immersion incourse requirements. Limitations: Because of the complex nature of the Institute's trainingaims for all its candidates, auditors implicitly understand and accept thatthe Training Committee reserves the right to discontinue an auditor'sparticipation at any time. An auditor who has completed all courses at theEnrollment level must then either leave the Institute or apply for fullstatus as a Member-in-Training. The Institute is chartered under the Education Law of the State of New York by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.

Psychoanalytic Review, founded in 1913, is the oldest continuously published psychoanalytic journal in the world. It has been, historically, and continues to be opposed to dogma, rigidity and exclusionism. While maintaining the highest standards of scholarship, it is the only established journal that is committed to a psychoanalytic exploration of, not only the clinical domain, but also the realm of general culture.

The 18th AIVC Conference Announcement and Call for Papers can be seen here. A major new printed report, 'A Guide to Energy Efficient Ventilation ', has been published by the AIVC. Click here to find out more aboutthe publications produced by the AIVC. AIRBASE has been released on CD-ROM and now contains over ten thousand records. About the AIVC Ventilation and air infiltration into buildings represent a substantialenergy demand which can account for between 25% to over 50% ofa building's total space heating (or cooling) needs. Unnecessaryor excessive air change can therefore have an important impacton global energy use. On the other hand insufficient ventilationmay result in poor indoor air quality and consequential healthproblems. Designing for optimum ventilation performance is hence a vitalpart of building design. This task is made especially difficult,however, by the complexities of airflow behaviour, climatic influences,occupancy patterns and pollutant emission characteristics. In recognition of the significant impact of ventilation on energyuse, combined with concerns over indoor air quality, the International Energy Agency (IEA) inaugurated the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centrein 1979. The role of the centre is to provide technical supportto those involved in the research and development of ventilationtechnology as well as to ensure the widest dissemination of informationon related energy and air quality issues. The AIVC fulfils its objectives by providing a range of servicesand facilities which include: Information Services The Centre provides a comprehensive information service, the hubof which is its bibliographic database - AIRBASE . This contains abstracts of several thousand specialist articlesrelated to ventilation and associated issues. AIRBASE is regularlyupdated and may be accessed via the Centre or may be obtainedin machine readable form for operation on IBM PC compatible computers.The majority of items referenced in AIRBASE are available fromthe AIVC's international library service (subject to copyrightrestrictions). Technical Analysis The AIVC undertakes its own technical programme which is focusedon the analysis and interpretation of international research.Current activities include: the development of a Numerical Database for design and evaluation applications, the review of ventilation strategies for commercial and domesticenvironments, the evaluation of calculation and measurement procedures forpredicting airflow and air change rates, reviewing the energy and environmental impact of buildingventilation, and assessing air change and ventilation efficiency applications. Technical Interchange An important task of the Centre is to ensure the widest possibledissemination of information. In fulfilling this task it publishesmany technical reports and co-ordinatesand publishes the results of related IEA activities. In addition,the AIVC organises regular conferences and specialist workshops.It also publishes "Air Infiltration Review (AIR)" - a quarterly journal of information, news andshort technical items. "Air Infiltration Review" iscurrently circulated to over 40 countries. In addition, as partof its dissemination activity, the AIVC carries out regular surveysof world-wide research into building ventilation. Annual Conference The 18th AIVC Conference "Ventilation and Cooling"is open to participants from all countries* in the IEA ECBCS Implementing Agreement.

KEYWORDS air infiltration, ventilation system AIVC Technical Note 37 A strategy for future ventilation research and applications. AUTHOR Liddament M W AIRBASE #NO 7905, 1992, 53pp, in English. ABSTRACT The impact of ventilation on energy use can be considerable.Total building energy use is variously estimated to account for30% of all energy consumed inInternational Energy Agency countries.Of this, as much as 50% can be associated with ventilation andair infiltration. As living standards throughout the world improve,it may be expected that building occupants will demand ever increasingstandards of comfort. This will inevitably result in increaseddemand on building energy use and further heighten concerns overglobal pollution.Much can be achieved to reduce energy demandby improvingenergy efficiency. However, as the thermal performanceof buildings improves, ventilation will become the dominant sourceof building energy loss. Unfortunately, reducing ventilation asa means to minimise energy demand, hasbecome inextricably linkedto problems associated with unhealthy buildings. Ventilation isthus an essential parameter in both energy and indoor air qualitycontrol. The purpose of this report is to assess future ventilationresearch and development needs. An objective has been toidentifythe prime objectives and tasks needed to secure energy efficientventilation without detriment to indoor air quality.

AUTHOR Kendrick J F AIRBASE #NO 7908, 1993, 47pp, in English. ABSTRACT A fundamental objective of this report is to investigatethe techniques used in the design and research fields for theevaluation of thermal and air flow simulations. The scope is restrictedto the whole building rather than flow and heat transfer withinindividual structural elements (e.g. cavity walls). Considerabledevelopments are taking place in the field of air flow and thermalsimulation. Rather than present an in-depth study of these developments,this report concentrates on the rather more general aspects ofthe combined simulation.

AUTHOR Irving S J AIRBASE #NO 9102, December 1994, 25pp, 15 figs, tabs, 17refs, in English. ABSTRACT Discusses the issues which influence the performanceof heat recovery devices within typical building applications.It is intended to cover the three main types if devices installedin ventilation systems in residential and commercial buildings,which are run-around coils, plate heat exchangers and thermalwheels (rotary regenerators). Other systems such as heat pipesare also described briefly. The successful implementation of airto air heat recovery depends on factors such as careful equipmentselection, proper integration of equipment into the ventilationsystem, good commissioning, proper maintenance and operation,and building characteristics, such as airtightness. One sectiongives information to assist the designer and building operatorto understand some of the factors that influence the performanceof heat recovery systems, highlighting some of the key pointsthat have emerged from the analysis of existing information, detailedsimulation work and site measurements.

AUTHOR Colliver D G AIRBASE #NO 9104, September 1995, 36pp, 10 figs, 10 tabs,refs, in English. ABSTRACT The objectives of this work are: first to determine thetheoretical energy requirements per constant mien unit of outdoorair used for ventilation for a number of different climates andlocations in North America and Europe; and secondly to determinethe variation of this annual ventilation heating and cooling energyrequirements due to the set points for temperature and humidity.The energy impact and/or trade-offs involved between bringingin outdoor air for indoor air pollution reduction and the energyrequired to condition this sir are investigated in this report.Long-term hourly weather data from several European and Americanlocations were analysed to determine the average conditions ofair over the period of record of the data. These data were thenanalysed to determine the psychometric process theoretical heating,cooling and moisture removal energy requirements for a constantmass of airflow per hour (MJ.h/kg). Summary weather data are alsoprovided if it is desired to determine the additional effectsof equipment and design. It was found that a significant amountof energy is required to condition air which is used for ventilation.The annual energy required per kg/hr of airflow varies from 22.1MJ.h/kg for Los Angeles to 102.5 MJ.h/kg for Omaha. In Europethe range was from 45.6 MJ.h/kg for Nice to 101.1 MJ.h/kg forSaint-Hubert. In Europe most of the energy was used to heat theair to the desired set point. In American there were significantamounts of both heating and cooling required. Much of the variationwas due to the amount of moisture in the air which had to be removedin air conditioning. In situation where air conditioning is used,a significant amount of this energy is used in dehumidifying theair. For example, in Miami 86% of the energy is used for moistureremoval. It was found that the energy used was highly sensitiveto the cooling and relative humidity set points.

It is primarily concerned with providingan introduction to the topic and encapsulates the knowledge andexperience derived from experts in all the participating countriesof the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre. Numerical descriptionshave been kept to a minimum, while emphasis is placed on describingventilation and the decision making involved in selecting andplanning for ventilation. By understanding this Guide, it is hopedthat the reader will be able to make fundamental judgements abouthow much ventilation should be provided and how this should beaccomplished for optimum cost and energy efficiency. This guide is specifically aimed at the policy maker, architect,building services engineer, designer and building owners and occupierswho require a background knowledge to ventilation. Contents: Chapter 1 Rationale and Background to Ventilation Chapter 2 Indoor Air Quality and Comfort Chapter 3 The Energy Impact of Ventilation and Air Infiltration Chapter 4 Design Criteria Chapter 5 Ventilation Strategies Chapter 6 Ventilation Heat Recovery Chapter 7 Ventilation and Cooling Chapter 8 Air Cleaning by Filtration Chapter 9 Ventilation Efficiency Chapter 10 Maintenance and Designing for Maintenance Chapter 11 Measurement Methods Chapter 12 Calculation Methods Appendix 1 Air Leakage Characteristics of Building Components Appendix 2 Wind Pressure Coefficient Data Appendix 3 AIDA - Air Infiltration Development Algorithm Index Structured in twelve chapters the first considers the role ofventilation. It looks at the need for ventilation to meet metabolicneeds (oxygen and odour control), the minimum acceptable ventilationrate and at additional requirements to meet the (polluting) activitiesof occupants (e.g. smoking, cooking, unvented clothes drying etc.). It is argued that too often it falls upon ventilation to accomplishtasks for which it is not intended. Pollutant concentration is reduced by ventilation. As the ventilationrate is increased, energy demand also grows. Chapter 2 reviews indoor air quality. Good indoor air qualitymay be defined as air which is free of pollutants that cause irritation,discomfort or ill health to occupants. Thermal conditions andrelative humidity also influence comfort and health. A poor indoorenvironment can manifest itself as a 'sick' building in whichsome occupants experience mild illness symptoms during periodsof occupancy. More serious pollutant problems may result in longterm and permanent ill-health effects. Since much time is spentinside buildings, considerable effort has focused on methods toachieve an optimum indoor environment, with particular emphasison health, odour control, thermal comfort and energy efficiency. Aspects of Indoor Air Quality are discussed with particularemphasis on providing an overview of indoor air quality in relationto: Sources of Pollutant Metabolism and Health Odour Sick buildings Comfort Reducing Pollutant Concentration Above all a coordinated approach is needed to secure good IAQas outlined in the figure below: Securing good indoor air quality Aspects of energy impact are outlined in Chapter 3. A considerableproportion of the energy consumed in buildings is lost by ventilationand air infiltration. This has important implications both atthe consumer level, where the cost must normally be met, and atthe strategic level, where it contributes to primary energy needand environmental pollution. Since ventilation is so closely linkedto concern about indoor air quality, there is the further problemof identifying how much ventilation is needed to provide for ahealthy indoor environment. Since it is difficult to assess the energy impact of ventilation,the context of air change in relation to energy use is often undefined.As a consequence, no adequate datum exists from which strategicplanning for improving the energy efficiency of ventilation canbe developed. This difficulty stems from the enormous complexityof the task, which needs to accommodate wide variations in factorssuch as climate, building air tightness, occupancy patterns andapproaches to ventilation. Efforts to overcome these difficultiesare progressing and an attempt is made in Chapter 3 to outlinethe results of present progress. Chapter 4 focuses on ventilation design criteria. A ventilationsystem must be designed to satisfy the required demand. In meetingthis need it is necessary to consider a wide range of criteria,varying from meeting the needs of Building Regulations to planningfor maintenance and replacement (Figure 2). It is also necessaryto integrate the ventilation system itself into the overall designof the building, especially in relation to air tightness, roompartitioning and accessibility. Since such a wide range of parameters is involved, there is rarelya unique solution to a particular ventilation design. Insteadthe designer must base a judgement on the individual needs ofeach building. Ultimately a robust solution is needed which ensuresthe health and comfort of occupants. Ventilation needs must bebased on criteria that can be established at the design stageof a building. To return afterwards in an attempt to mitigateproblems as they arise may lead to considerable expense and failure. Design Criteria are subjected to many parameters Strategies for ventilation are reviewed in Chapter 5. A wide rangeof systems and techniques is available to meet the needs of ventilationwith each having its own set of advantages, disadvantages andapplications. Sometimes choice is dictated by local climate conditionsor building type. Frequently, price competitiveness and an unwillingnessto deviate from the minimum specification of relevant BuildingRegulations or Codes of Practice can further restrict choice andalso limit the opportunity for innovation. To justify a complexstrategy, it is usually necessary to demonstrate advantages interms of improved indoor climate, reduced energy demand and acceptable'payback' periods. Strategies reviewed cover both natural andmechanical systems. Chapter 6 looks at the potential for ventilation heat recovery.Considerable energy is lost from a building through the departingair stream. When air change is dominated by infiltration, littlecan be done to re-capture this energy. On the other hand, if exhaustair is centrally collected, a variety of methods for recoveringor recycling the waste heat become possible. In view of the scaleof ventilation energy loss, considerable effort has been devotedto the design and development of ventilation air heat recoverysystems. While the heat recovery process can be shown to be extremely efficient,benefits must always be equated against the (primary) energy neededto drive the process and capital and maintenance costs. Varioushidden losses such as air infiltration must also be thoroughlyunderstood. Ventilation and cooling is reviewed in Chapter 7. Cooling is neededwhen the indoor environment becomes excessively hot or humid.This may occur as a result of high outdoor temperatures or asa consequence of excessive solar or internal heat gains. Highinternal gain is particularly a problem in large non-domesticbuildings. When the need for cooling is dictated by internal heat gains ratherthan outside temperature and humidity, much can be accomplishedto reduce the need for or eliminate altogether active coolingsystems. Solutions depend on climate but include cooling by ventilation(passive cooling), designing for reduced solar gains, the useof thermal mass and restricting internal heat loads. The role of filtration to clean ventilation air is explored inChapter 8. Filtration is a method by which particulates and, sometimes,gaseous pollutants may be removed from the air. Pollutants areintercepted by a filter while allowing clean air to pass through.This method of air cleaning is especially necessary when highconcentrations of particulates are present or when the sourceof pollutant is derived from outside the building. Potential benefitscan include improved air quality, reduced dependence on ventilationand improved energy efficiency. Filtration is not a substitutefor the ventilation needed to meet the metabolic requirementsof occupants. Ventilation Efficiency and the process of air mixing is outlinedin Chapter 9. Indices of ventilation efficiency characterise themixing behaviour of air and the distribution of pollutant withina space. These two aspects may be subdivided into indices of airchange efficiency and pollutant removal effectiveness respectively.Ventilation efficiency is based on an evaluation of the 'age',of air and on the concentration distribution of pollutant withinthe air. Some indices are based on room averaged values, whileothers refer to specific points or locations. This has importantconsequences because while room values provide some guidance tothe overall performance of a ventilation system, point valuesindicate regions where localised poor ventilation might occur. Chapter 10 looks at maintenance issues. Maintenance is neededto ensure the reliability of the ventilation system and to securethe economic operation of the ventilation plant. Evidence suggests,however, that maintenance is often inadequate and that the needfor maintenance may even be ignored in the course of buildingdesign. Typical problems include worn gaskets, dirty fans andgrilles, and ill-fitting and clogged filters. This concern hasresulted in much more specific guidelines being developed forthe maintenance of ventilation systems, some of which are discussedin Chapter 10. Only by correct functioning can a ventilation systembe relied upon to meet the indoor air quality needs of a building. Measurement methods are reviewed in Chapter 11. Measurements areneeded to verify the performance of ventilation systems and totest the integrity of the building shell. They are essential forcommissioning, diagnostic analysis, design evaluation and research.In addition, measurement results provide the fundamental meansfor understanding the mechanics of ventilation and air flow inbuildings. Measurement data are also needed to provide backgroundinformation for parametric studies on building air leakage characteristics,indoor air quality and ventilation system performance. Many measurementtechniques have been developed with each having a specific purpose.An analysis of principal measurement techniques and applicationsis presented. Finally, Chapter 12 reviews recent developments in calculationtechniques. Calculation techniques and numerical models are essentialfor any design process. They provide the means by which the designercan develop and investigate an idea before being committed tothe final product. Typical design aspects cover system sizing, performance evaluation,indoor air quality prediction, energy impact assessment, and costbenefit analysis. A calculation technique or model is used toanalyse the interaction of design options with fixed constraints.Such a process is necessarily iterative, with adjustments madeto parameters over which control is possible, until an optimumdesign solution is achieved. A wide range of methods of varying complexity have been developedwith no single method being universally appropriate. Selectionvaries according to the required level of accuracy, the availabilityof data and the type of building under investigation. As designs have become more complex and performance tolerancesmore demanding, it is increasingly important for the designerto be able to understand and use calculation techniques. Thisneed has resulted in the development of improved algorithms andwider availability of design data. Techniques cover methods to determine: air change rates in buildings and rooms. the flow rate of air through infiltration and purpose providedflow openings (network methods). air flow pattern in a space (computational fluid dynamics). Subsidiary calculations cover pollutant transport, energy analysisand the evaluation of driving forces (wind and stack effect). Calculation techniques are used for design and decision making A series of appendices provide numerical support to Chapter 12including data and a simple ventilation calculation algorithm.

For the first time, an invitationwas extended to all participating countries of the IEA Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems Programme . This resulted in over 100 delegates attending 4 sessionsof oral presentations based on submitted papers and a further3 poster sessions, a total of 59 presentations from 15 countries.Topics covered included: Keynote Speaker and the Opening Session Offices and Other Non-Residential Buildings Ventilation of Transportation-Related Structures Statistical Analysis Applicability of Crack Flow Equations Measures of Ventilation Performance External Contaminants and the Internal Distribution of Pollutants Dwellings Innovative Technologies Guest Speaker and Close of Conference Keynote Speaker and the Opening Session The Keynote Speaker at the Conference, Bertil Pettersson, DirectorGeneral of the Swedish Board for Building Research, stated inhis address that much of the world's energy is obtained and usedin a non-sustainable way. He continued by stressing that existingenergy supplies must be used more efficiently and renewable energysources should be further exploited. Citing the example of Sweden,he indicated that while the total floor area of the Swedish residentialand service sector building stock had increased by about 40% from1970 to 1995, the total energy consumption had remained roughlyconstant. This implied that the specific energy consumption (energyused per unit of floor area) had decreased by approximately 25%during the same period. Furthermore, he also outlined the benefitsof International Energy Agency collaborative research with theaim of decreasing total energy consumption. The benefits thathe observed included: shared costs, pooled resources, the avoidance of mistakes and duplicated efforts, and the development of a common understanding of technical methods. The first paper in the opening session, called "Optimum ventilation and air flow control in buildings? ", examined the overall theme of the Conference, andwas presented by Tor-Göran Malmström (Royal Institute of Technology , Sweden). In this paper he explained the factors affectingindoor air quality. In particular, he emphasised that internalpollutant sources should first be controlled and then the qualityof the air entering the room should be verified. He then continuedby discussing how air flow control can be used to determine thequality and rate of air exchange. This session also included a paper by Bj�rn Larsen (The Vekst Foundation, Norway) explaining his computerisedmethod ( Figure 1 ) for balancing ventilationsystems, a practical demonstration of which was also given atthe Conference. The method he described makes it possible to pre-setventilation terminals at the factory to desired pressure losscharacteristics (achieved by damper positioning). In this way,mechanical ventilation systems can be balanced before they havebeen installed. Figure 1 A 'DPM' machine for pre-settingair terminals Offices and Other Non-Residential Buildings Two contributions from the UK Building Research Establishment focused on office buildings. Martin White discussed the efficiency of single-sided and cross ventilationin office spaces, while Brian Webb considered summer cooling for office-type buildings by nightventilation. Although not restricted in application to non-residentialbuildings, Matheos Santamouris(University of Athens, Greece) reported on the progress of thenatural ventilation studies made within the European PASCOOL project.This included single-sided and cross ventilation, as well as flowthrough large internal openings in the context of natural ventilationfor cooling. The project has resulted in the development of severalapplicable calculation tools. Passive cooling was also the subjectof other presentations from Greece, Sweden and Switzerland (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Cooling improvement for nightcooling system Mikko Suokas (Fincoil-teollisuusOy, Finland) advised on how to reduce draught problems in cooledworking rooms. His view was that the 'throw' from air-coolingdevices should stay close to the ceiling for as long as possible,without interference from either beams, light fittings, or walls.In this way, the cooled air mixes better with the existing roomair, without causing draughts in the occupied zone. Peter Wouters from Belgium (BBRI) expanded on the subject of non-residentialventilation. In "Ventilation requirements in non-domestic buildings and energy efficiency", voted as the Best Paper at the Conference, he proposedthat ventilation rate requirements for non-domestic buildingsmay vary by up to a factor of 10 depending on whether or not thelevels of emissions from the building materials are taken intoaccount. This, he argued, could potentially have a large consequenteffect on energy consumption. Anders Nilson (Bengt Dahlgren AB, Sweden) also considered energy efficiency,specifically in office buildings, with an energy and system analysisstudy. Public Assembly Buildings Findings from measurements made in a cinema (with a downwardsmixing ventilation system) were reported by Yonghui Jin (NarvikInstitute of Technology, Norway). 'Step-up' and 'step-down' tracergas measurements enabled the calculation of local and room airchange efficiencies, which indicated that close to perfect mixingwas occurring. Carbon dioxide concentrations were found to varylinearly with the number of occupants. The design of another typeof public assembly building, in this case a naturally ventilatedconcert hall (Figure 3 ), was discussedby Robert Cohen (HGA ConsultingEngineers Ltd, UK). This project used computational fluid dynamicsto decide the size and locations of the ventilation openings.In addition, a dynamic thermal model was used to confirm thatthe likely number of hours per year above a certain temperaturelevel was acceptable. Figure 3 Building section Ventilation of Transportation-RelatedStructures Certain presentations at the Conference examined ventilation ofstructures intended for transportation-related purposes. Willem de Gids (TNO , Netherlands) described how a dynamic ventilation model hadbeen used to improve the design of a ventilation system in a traintunnel with a shopping centre above (Figure 4 ), thus improving air quality in the centre and reducing cleaningcosts. The problems associated with the cooling and ventilationof a high speed underground transportation system were outlinedby Peter Rosemann (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Switzerland). This major project plans to link the majorSwiss cities with a train network involving partially evacuatedtunnels (to reduce aerodynamic drag). In addition, design guidelinesfor ventilation systems for pollution control in large semi-enclosedbus terminals were presented. Concerning this work, Joanna Yiu (Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong) indicated thatindustrial occupational exposure limits were the most applicableexisting guidelines to deal with the pollutants contained in dieselfuel exhausts. However, she did not consider them to be ideal,because they are based on working conditions only for healthyadults. Figure 4 Tunnel with fans Statistical Analysis In his poster, Jerzy Sowa (WarsawUniversity of Technology, Poland) compared different methods ofincorporating stochastic factors into deterministic models ofindoor air quality. Approaches taken used time series data asinputs to contaminant dispersal models, Monte-Carlo analysis,and a stochastic differential equation model. The mean valuesof pollutant concentration found with all three methods were verysimilar. However, the spread of the results as measured by thestandard deviation showed a wide variation. Related work was describedby Krystyna Pietrzyk (Chalmers University of Technology , Sweden). She explained how probability density functionsof the air change rate in a single family house had been derived,with two-parameter Weibull distributions assumed for the windvelocity. The air change rates were found to approximately followeither normal or log-normal distributions depending on the winddirection. Johnny Kronvall (J&W ConsultingEngineers, Sweden) has been investigating system safety analysisas a method of finding "the probability that a ventilationsystem provides certain required air flow rates in each occupiedpart of a building during the time between scheduled maintenanceoccasions." He suggested that this is a promising techniquefor judging the reliability of mechanical ventilation systems.But, he cautioned that data for the mechanical reliability ofindividual components would need to be collated for it to be practical. Applicability of Crack Flow Equations Two of the fundamental assumptions concerning the applicabilityof crack flow equations have been investigated by researchersin the UK and the USA. An experimental study of crack flow withvarying pressure differentials was the subject of a presentationgiven by Steve Sharples (University of Sheffield , UK). He proposed that the results confirmed the often assumedview that it is acceptable to consider average steady-state pressuredifferentials in place of time-varying differentials. Anotherimportant issue discussed at the Conference was that the applicationof experimentally measured airtightness data (typically measuredat greater than 10 Pa pressure difference) to numerical modelsoften relies on an extrapolation down to the pressure differences(typically less than 10 Pa) encountered due to natural drivingforces. The power law is an appropriate method for extrapolatingfrom measured airtightness data to lower pressure differenceswas the conclusion reached by Max Sherman (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , USA). Measures of Ventilation Performance Lars Ekberg (Chalmers University of Technology , Sweden) spoke about how he has been checking ventilationrates by carbon dioxide monitoring. Again from Sweden, Bj�rn Hedin (Lund Institute of Technology) introduced a new model toextract more information from standard tracer gas measurementsof ventilation air flows. The effect of recirculation on air changeeffectiveness (sometimes called the coefficient of air changeperformance) was the subject of a contribution by Clifford Federspiel (Johnson Controls Inc, USA). He proposed a relative measureof air change effectiveness that can be used to take into accountthe age of supply air when the fraction of recirculated air isgreater than zero. An advantage of this measure, he argued, isthat it can identify systems in which 'short-circuiting' is occurring. Karl Janssens from Belgium (CatholicUniversity of Leuven) gave an account of laboratory tests forthe determination of 'local specific fresh air flow rates' inan imperfectly mixed ventilated air space. In addition, work fromFrance and the UK reported on measurements and modelling respectivelyfor calculating the pollutant removal effectiveness and air changeefficiency for various ventilation strategies. External Contaminants and the InternalDistribution of Pollutants Vina Kukadia, (Building Research Establishment , UK) presented the outcome of a pilot study designed to findthe effect of external atmospheric pollution on indoor air quality.Another external pollutant, radon, is of continuing concern andin connection with this, Pirjo Korhonen (University of Kuopio, Finland) has compared indoor levelsof radon between workplaces and homes located nearby in differentparts of Finland. Certain features of particulate pollution interactionswith indoor surfaces were explained by Miriam Byrne (Imperial College ,UK), who has been carrying out measurements and modelling forrisk assessment and contaminant control. Also at the Conference,George Walton (NIST , USA) demonstrated the latest version of his multizone airflowand contaminant dispersal model, CONTAM96, which includes a graphicaluser interface. Dwellings The work of members of the European Standards Committee CEN TC156(Ventilation) was reported by Andrew Cripps (Building Research Establishment , UK) with his paper on calculation methods for the determinationof air flow rates in dwellings. Two delegates from Sweden eachtalked about residential ventilation. One of these was Per Levin (Royal Institute of Technology , Sweden), who outlined the development of a simple occupancy-controlledexhaust air ventilation system. The other was �ke Blomsterberg (Swedish National Testing and Research Institute, Sweden),who discussed the influence of outdoor air vents and airtightnesson natural ventilation. Max Sherman (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , USA) proposed the most appropriate types of residentialventilation systems for the different regions of the USA. Thiswas based on modelling for various levels of airtightness of thedwelling stock to predict resultant energy consumption while stillmeeting ventilation requirements. On a connected subject, Don Stevens (Stevens and Associates, USA) identified the evolution ofventilation in manufactured housing in the north-western UnitedStates. The findings from a measurement survey of the indoor airquality of 30 houses with distributed heating systems in Quebecwere given by Denis Parent (Hydro-Québec,Canada). He concluded that during the milder part of the heatingseason only the minority of the tested houses had adequate ventilation,with an improvement during the colder part. Also, there didn'tseem to be a significant correlation between building airtightnessand indoor air quality. IEA ECBCS Annex 27 Other contributions on dwellings concerned products of the continuingwork of IEA ECBCS Annex 27 "Evaluation and Demonstration of Domestic VentilationSystems". Peter Op't Veld(Cauberg-Huygen Consulting Engineers, Netherlands) gave an overviewof his assessment of aspects of noise and ventilation systems.This covered the transmission of outdoor noise, noise generatedby ventilation system components and the impact of a system onsound transmission in or between dwellings. His work for thisAnnex has produced a simplified tool for the selection of ventilationsystems based on the criteria of noise. Also as part of Annex27, Lars-Göran Månsson (LGM Consult AB, Sweden) outlinedthe progress made in developing a simplified tool for evaluatingdomestic ventilation systems' ability to provide an acceptableindoor air quality. Multi-zone calculations of air flows and tracer gas measurementsin dwellings were compared by Charlotte Svensson (J&W Consulting Engineers, Sweden). This forms part ofthe Swedish contribution to Annex 27. The study highlighted thegood agreement that can be obtained between measurements and calculationswhen the input parameters of the model are consistent with theexperimental configuration. Along similar lines, Jacques Riberon (CSTB , France) gavean account of a comparison of ventilation systems performancesin residential buildings made with the model SIREN. Innovative Technologies Conventionally, air dehumidification has been achieved by refrigerativesystems. However with current environmental concerns, alternativeapproaches are being sought. As part of an investigation of dehumidificationby absorption, J�rgen R�ben (University of Essen , Germany) described a theoretical model of an open cycledehumidification process using hygroscopic materials to absorbthe moisture.The Best Poster at the Conference was awarded toPeter Hansson (Royal Institute of Technology , Sweden) for his poster, "A technique to improve the performance of displacement ventilation during cold climate conditions". He has devised a method of using warm air extractedat ceiling level to heat cold surfaces and so improve ventilationefficiency and thermal comfort by reducing downdraught. Guest Speaker and Close of Conference The Guest Speaker at the Conference Banquet was Professor EnnoAbel of Chalmers Institute of Technology, who in addition presentedthe Best Paper and Best Poster awards. Willem de Gids (TNO , Netherlands) and Martin Liddament (AIVC, UK) summed-up andclosed the Conference.

Click here to find out more aboutthe publications produced by the AIVC. AIRBASE has been released on CD-ROM and now contains over ten thousand records. About the AIVC Ventilation and air infiltration into buildings represent a substantialenergy demand which can account for between 25% to over 50% ofa building's total space heating (or cooling) needs. Unnecessaryor excessive air change can therefore have an important impacton global energy use. On the other hand insufficient ventilationmay result in poor indoor air quality and consequential healthproblems. Designing for optimum ventilation performance is hence a vitalpart of building design. This task is made especially difficult,however, by the complexities of airflow behaviour, climatic influences,occupancy patterns and pollutant emission characteristics. In recognition of the significant impact of ventilation on energyuse, combined with concerns over indoor air quality, the International Energy Agency (IEA) inaugurated the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centrein 1979. The role of the centre is to provide technical supportto those involved in the research and development of ventilationtechnology as well as to ensure the widest dissemination of informationon related energy and air quality issues. The AIVC fulfils its objectives by providing a range of servicesand facilities which include: Information Services The Centre provides a comprehensive information service, the hubof which is its bibliographic database - AIRBASE . This contains abstracts of several thousand specialist articlesrelated to ventilation and associated issues. AIRBASE is regularlyupdated and may be accessed via the Centre or may be obtainedin machine readable form for operation on IBM PC compatible computers.The majority of items referenced in AIRBASE are available fromthe AIVC's international library service (subject to copyrightrestrictions). Technical Analysis The AIVC undertakes its own technical programme which is focusedon the analysis and interpretation of international research.Current activities include: the development of a Numerical Database for design and evaluation applications, the review of ventilation strategies for commercial and domesticenvironments, the evaluation of calculation and measurement procedures forpredicting airflow and air change rates, reviewing the energy and environmental impact of buildingventilation, and assessing air change and ventilation efficiency applications. Technical Interchange An important task of the Centre is to ensure the widest possibledissemination of information. In fulfilling this task it publishesmany technical reports and co-ordinatesand publishes the results of related IEA activities. In addition,the AIVC organises regular conferences and specialist workshops.It also publishes "Air Infiltration Review (AIR)" - a quarterly journal of information, news andshort technical items. "Air Infiltration Review" iscurrently circulated to over 40 countries. In addition, as partof its dissemination activity, the AIVC carries out regular surveysof world-wide research into building ventilation.

Martin Liddament reviews some of the current knowledgeabout the use of metabolically produced CO2 in indoor air qualityevaluation and control. Background CO2 and Toxicity Metabolically Produced CO2 Outdoor or Background CO2 Concentration Indoor or Room Concentration of CO2 Steady State Concentration Transient Concentration Room Concentration and 'Perceived' Indoor Air Quality Measuring CO2 'Demand' Control Ventilation Conclusions For More Information and References Background The concentration of metabolically produced carbon dioxide (CO2)in a space has become a popular indicator of indoor air quality.Increasingly, it is used to control ventilation systems and asa measure of compliance with various Codes and Standards. Thereis underlying concern, however, that such measurements could giveerroneous information and that there may be a general misconceptionabout the significance of metabolic CO2. The purpose of this noteis to summarise recent contributions on this topic, with specificreference to a Seminar and Forum on metabolic carbon dioxide whichtook place earlier this year at the Atlanta ASHRAE meeting. The reasons for so much interest in CO2 were summarisedat this meeting by Andrew Persily of the US National Instituteof Science and Testing (NIST ). He emphasised that carbon dioxide is metabolically producedand can therefore be associated with the presence of occupants.Also it is relatively easy and inexpensive to measure, and itis fairly stable in that it is not especially reactive or absorbedby surfaces. In principle CO2 can be used to evaluate the ventilationrate, determine the proportion of outdoor air that is blendedwith recirculated air and provide an indication of perceived indoorair quality. CO2 and Toxicity The health and toxicity implications of carbon dioxide were reviewedby Michael Hodgson, MD of the University of Connecticut HealthSciences Center. His research indicates that, despite largelyuntested reports to the contrary, there is no physiological evidencethat CO2 has any metabolic influence at concentrations below about8500 ppm. Between 8500 -10,000 ppm the tidal flow of air throughthe lungs is increased and above 34,000 ppm the respiratory systembecomes more rapid. At 40-45,000 ppm sweating occurs and at about50,000ppm anxiety is induced. He also reported that in the 19thcentury, CO2 was used as a narcotic for surgery, where concentrationsapproaching 500,000 ppm (50%) were needed. Under all but extremeoccupancy conditions, therefore, the removal of CO2 from a spaceon grounds that it in itself influences health cannot normallybe regarded as an issue. Metabolically Produced CO2 Carbon dioxide is produced as part of metabolism. The rate ofproduction is fairly well defined and is dependent on the levelof metabolic activity. Examples are illustrated in Table 1 (BS5925,1990). On this issue, Michael Hodgson noted that,for any specific activity, production rate increases with bodyweight, reflecting the greater level of physical effort whichmust be applied. He also noted that physically fit people areable to do a greater level of work for each unit of CO2 produced. Table 1 Energy production levels and emissionrates of carbon dioxide for various levels of metabolic activity(based on BS5925:1990).

Indoor or Room Concentration of CO2 The indoor concentration of carbon dioxide depends on the outdoorlevel and the production rate of CO2 within the space. In theoffice, this extra contribution is primarily assumed to resultfrom metabolism, but in the home open gas cookers could make afurther significant contribution. Strictly, to determine the contributionto CO2 generated in a space, the difference between theindoor concentration and the outdoor concentration should be measured.However, for approximate purposes, an outdoor value of between350-400 ppm is usually assumed. It is important to be aware, however,that, for precision analysis, some authors, when refering to indoorCO2 concentration, automatically subtract the outdoor value (i.ethey give the difference value). On the otherhand moststandards, that refer to an acceptable indoor CO2 concentration,refer to the absolute or total room concentration. Steady State Concentration Metabolically produced CO2 behaves like any other pollutant inthat for a given level of occupancy and rate of ventilation, itsconcentration will asymptotically rise to a 'steady state' value.At steady state, the concentration will depend on both the outdoorair ventilation rate and the CO2 production rate, while the timetaken to reach steady state concentration will depend on the 'airchange' rate alone. The approximate relationship between steadystate concentration (absolute) and ventilation rate is illustratedin Figure 1 . If steady state concentrationhas been achieved, and the level of activity is known then, providedthere is no other source of generation, the measured CO2 concentrationprovides an indication of the amount of 'fresh' outdoor air beingsupplied to each occupant. Transient Concentration More often than not, steady state concentration is not reached.Either the volume of enclosed space is so large that it wouldtake many hours to achieve or the level of occupancy is continuallyvarying. Under these circumstances a 'spot' measurement of CO2can become meaningless. Various techniques have been developed,however, to estimate ventilation rate from the transient CO2 concentration.Persily (1996, 1994) , has investigatedthis in detail and offers several solutions. This aspect has alsobeen addressed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),following concern that too much reliance is placed on transientspot measurements. John Girman of the EPA indoor environmentaldivision described work involved in looking at the errors associatedwith spot measurements and devising methods to improve upon ventilationestimated from CO2 measurements. The main areas of error wereconcerned with the time it takes to reach steady state, assumptionsabout the rate of CO2 generation and fluctuations in outdoor concentration.Below about 3 air changes/hour approximately three hours is neededto achieve a steady state condition, however, work in progress(Mudarri, 1996 ) highlights how allowancescan be made for the non attainment of steady state conditionsbased on the duration and level of occupancy. For improved accuracy,more precise knowledge is needed about metabolic generation rate,for example the ratio of production for men and women in similaractivity is approximately 1:0.76. Such allowances have been incorporatedby Mudarri into a 10 Step Guide to estimating air change ratefrom relatively straightforward parameters. Figure 1 Metabolic carbon dioxide Room Concentration and 'Perceived' IndoorAir Quality Andrew Persily reviewed some of the background to the interestin CO2 including its relationship with peoples' perception ofindoor air quality, principally in relation to odour. He citeda number of examples indicating the relationship between CO2 concentrationand body odour. Particularly, there was consistent data linkingCO2 concentration with the percentage of people 'visiting' a spacewho were 'dissatisfied' with the level of odour (ppd). This linkageis associated with the actual CO2 concentration measured ratherthan the steady state value. Typically, 20% ppd corresponds toa CO2 concentration of 650 ppm above the outdoor value (i.e. approximately1000 ppm actual CO2 concentration (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Metabolic carbon dioxide asan indicator of acceptable indoor air quality Measuring CO2 Various techniques are available for the measurement of carbondioxide, a summary of which was presented by Richard Stoner ofSolomat Neotronics. Further information is also described in Chapter11 of the Guide to Ventilation (Liddament, 1996 ). Techniques vary from precision mass spectrometry to inexpensivedetection tubes that undergo colour change in reaction to thepresence of carbon dioxide. Probably the most common method fordemand control systems is non-dispersive infra-red detection whichmakes use of the property of a gas to absorb energy from an infra-redlight source. The resultant heat generated is detected as a volumetricchange. This absorption property is also applied to photo-acousticdetection in which absorption from a pulsed infrared source, tunedto the specific characteristics of CO2, is translated to a soundwave. The sound intensity is related to gas concentration. Bothsystems have a resolution of typically +/- 50 ppm and suffer fromdrift caused by dust on optics and a gradual deterioration inlamp performance. Other methods include potentiometric in whichCO2 is diffused into an electrolyte resulting in a change in appliedvoltage and amperometric based on the electrochemical diffusionof CO2 across a membrane into an electrolyte. Again sensitivityis typically +/- 50-100 ppm and drift can be significant. Sensorlife can also be limited. Problems and experiences associated with the measurement of metabolicallyproduced CO2 were further highlighted at an informal forum aimedat assessing the role of CO2 measurements as a means of estimatingoutdoor air ventilation rates. Experiences indicated significantinstrument drift. One monitored study showed that after a fewmonths a system having a set point of 1000 ppm did not react untilthe actual concentration had reached 1800 ppm. Several contributorsemphasised the need for regular instrument calibration. The conclusion,therefore, must be that any demand control sensor must containprovision for simple (possibly automatic) calibration. In short,an unattended system will fail, probably within only a few months. 'Demand' Control Ventilation Notwithstanding problems associated with monitoring metabolicCO2, it has become a popular component of demand control ventilationsystems. This formed part of a major Research Task (Annex 18 ) of the International Energy Agency's Implementing Agreementfor Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems (Mansson, 1990 ). Conclusions Carbon dioxide is largely non-toxic with evidence suggesting thatconcentrations as high as 10,000 ppm or more have no significanthealth effects. For normal conditions of occupancy, however, measured CO2 concentrationssignificantly above 1000 ppm provide an indication of inadequateventilation for comfort and may mean that the ventilation rateis inadequate to dilute other, more harmful pollutants that maybe present. In this sense, the monitoring of CO2 concentrationcan make a valuable contribution to IAQ assessment. Unfortunately, a measurement of concentration (especially a 'spot'measurement) at or below 1000 ppm does not necessarily providean indication of the adequacy of ventilation since there may beother pollutants present or insufficient time has elapsed to providea steady state reading, or the building may be at reduced occupancy. If CO2 is continuously monitored then it is possible to evaluatethe adequacy of air change by considering the rates of growthand decay in concentration as the occupancy level varies.

How are the results presented? Are CFD results realistic? Examples Conclusions References Introduction Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly being usedat the design stage for the evaluation of air distribution andsmoke control systems in a wide range of building types. CFD computer software operates by numerically solving the equationsgoverning fluid flow [1] . These compriseconservation statements for mass, momentum, energy and turbulenceparameters. The equations contain partial derivatives, are highlynon-linear and require an iterative solution procedure to yield results. What must be defined when using CFDsoftware? The process of running CFD software involves defining the factorswhich drive the flow (boundary conditions) such as supply airdiffusers, natural ventilation openings, exhaust locations andflow rates, heat gains, and hot or cold surfaces together withany objects or obstructions in the space. These are mapped toa computational grid which forms three-dimensional volumes ofspace completely filling the enclosure to be modelled. The equationsare solved at each one of these 'control volumes', usually called'cells' in 'finite-volume' codes and 'elements' in the alternative'finite-element' codes. Historically, the finite-volume approachwas developed in cartesian (rectangular) geometries. The finite-elementmethod has traditionally allowed more complex and hence realisticgeometries to be modelled although the developments which havetaken place in CFD mean that many of the old distinctions havebecome blurred. More accurate techniques for numerically integratingthe flow equations coupled with complex geometry capability infinite-volume codes provide a similar level of functionality tothe traditional finite-element approach. Finite element codesthemselves are changing, further reducing the distance betweenthem. The user has control over the grid and it is the resolution ofthe grid which can have an important influence on the accuracyof results. The finer the grid the better but the longer it willtake to achieve a solution. A typical grid will comprise manythousands of 'cells' [2, 3] . Mostcommercial CFD software uses the finite-volume approach to formthe numerical integral of the partial differential equations.Regarding complexity of modelling, much can still be done withcartesian geometry representations - taking advantage of the mucheasier model building and faster execution speed. In using CFD, which places major demands on computer processorspeed and RAM (memory), there is always a compromise to be madebetween accuracy and speed of solution. However, CFD softwareis becoming more user-friendly and computers very much fastersuch that high-specification PC's (e.g. fast 486's, Pentium andPentium Pro) can be particularly cost-effective in running CFDcodes and contributing successfully within the time-frame of thedesign process. How are the results presented? Once a solution is obtained the results can be viewed in graphicalform as flow patterns (vector plots), temperature and smoke contours,etc. (An example is shown in Figure 1 .)The numerical values can be interpreted to make judgements aboutthe acceptability of the thermal environment in terms of air velocities,temperatures, temperature gradients and ventilation effectiveness.In fire modelling it is temperatures and the development and movementof smoke which is the focus of interest either in a 'steady-state'form or evolving with time. Figure 1 Results presented in graphicalform. Are CFD results realistic? Validation is always an issue with any computer calculation method.With CFD the issue is more complex than usual because of the influencethe user can have over the quality of results. This is particularlyimportant in the context of setting boundary conditions, definingthe computational grid and procuring converged solutions in highRayleigh Number (highly buoyant) flow fields within an acceptablecomputation time. Turbulence modelling is also still an area requiringmore research and development. Here, it is the 'k-epsilon' modelwhich is still the 'industry standard' for engineering calculations.Despite the ever present need for more work, sufficient validationhas already been done such that, with experience and care, onecan have a good level of confidence in the quality of the results[4] . (Much analysis has taken placein IEA ECBCS Annex 26 "Air Flow in Large Enclosures"to evaluate the performance of CFD and to determine the conditionsunder which it is applicable [5] .) Examples Figures 1, 2 and 3 show example results from three different typesof CFD simulations. The first simulation, Figure 1 , is of temperatures and flow patterns in a three-dimensionalmodel of a naturally ventilated shopping mall. The ventilationsystem comprises low level openings with flow entering from theleft in the Figure and exiting at high level through the roofexhaust stack. The outdoor temperature is 16 °C. Occupancy,lighting and solar gains elevate the temperature up to approximately21 °C at high level. Here, the CFD code used has predictedthe natural ventilation flow rate based on external wind pressures,stack (buoyancy) effect and the resistance of the openings. Figure 2 Flow in a laboratory space ventilatedby laminar flow panels in ceiling. The second example, shown in Figure 2 ,represents flow in a laboratory space ventilated by laminar flowpanels in the ceiling. The exhaust air is taken through a fumecupboard extract. The Figure shows speed contours, illustratingthe acceleration of flow into the fume cupboard and the wake-influencedue to the proximity of the operator. Both the room air distributionand the fume cupboard containment effectiveness are being examinedhere. In the third simulation, Figure 3 , thedevelopment of temperatures and smoke concentrations are predictedin the atrium and occupied areas of a multi-floor office building.Outdoor air enters the atrium at ground level and natural smokevents allow the smoke to escape at roof level. The temperaturestratification in the smoke layer can be seen. At ground level,the volume of outside air entering the building maintains a clearlayer, and on the upper floors it is noticeable that floor supplyair diffusers (which remain in operation supplying fresh air)are helping to minimise the full impact of the smoke temperatures.From the information generated by CFD judgements can be made regardingthe safety and escape of occupants. Figure 3 Development of temperaturesand smoke concentration in the atrium and occupied areas of amulti-floor office building. Conclusions Fortunately, much of the complexity of a user-friendly CFD codeis transparent to the user, who need not concern him/herself aboutpartial differential equations. What is important, though, isthat the user is able to properly describe the application tobe modelled, to ensure that the solution obtained satisfies certaincriteria regarding grid resolution and the consequent residualerrors in the solution, and then exercise engineering abilityin interpreting the results. An advantage of CFD is that, if necessary,improvements can readily be made to the air distribution designor smoke control system and the calculation re-run. The question of cost-effectiveness is particularly important.Historically, such computer codes have been too expensive andtoo difficult to use to make a substantial impact in the buildingsand construction industry. Now, however, CFD software prices arefalling and performance and usability increasing such that acquiringan in-house CFD capability or, indeed, commissioning externalCFD studies can be a realistic and relatively low-cost optiongiving a substantial return in the quality of the project.

In order to fill these existing gaps, naturalventilation phenomena have been extensively studied in the frameworkof the PASCOOL research project (2) .The coordinated efforts of research groups from Belgium (BBRI),France (University of La Rochelle and ENTPE), Greece (Universityof Athens), Italy ( University of Milano), Portugal (Universityof Porto), Spain (University of Malaga) and Switzerland (EPFL)have made this PASCOOL task one of the most significant contributionsto natural ventilation studies in the recent years. Aims and Strategies of the VentilationPASCOOL Task Based on a huge experimental programme, various different aspectsof the problem were covered during the PASCOOL project: single sided ventilation cross ventilation/ airflow through large openings night ventilation and the coupling with thermal mass. More than a hundred single sided and cross ventilation experimentswere performed in various buildings and test cells located indifferent countries in Europe. In order to evaluate the ventilationflow rates, experimental techniques using tracer gases have beenexperienced and tested in natural ventilation configuration aswell as energy balance approaches. Various geometrical and climaticconfigurations have been tested. Combined ventilation and thermalmass experiments have also been performed to study air flow patternsin multizone buildings presenting important stack effects.<R> Various models have also been tested in order to predict naturalventilation air flows in buildings. New models resulting fromthe experiments have been proposed and integrated in a new airflow model PASSPORT-Air based on a network approach. In orderto feed this code with realistic data, the group has developedCPCALC+ (3) a new method predictingthe pressure coefficients on building surfaces for various shapesof building and roofs. Wind tunnel experiments using three boundarylayer profiles have been used to obtain regression curves forthe determination of the pressure coefficient distribution. Finally a new approach using zonal modelling has been proposedin order to assess air flow patterns in naturally ventilated rooms. Final Products and Main Results of thePASCOOL Natural Ventilation Task All the results of the Ventilation task are presented in the «Ventilation-ThermalMass Subtask Final Report» (2) organisedinto six chapters describing the contributions of the PASCOOLGroup to the various aspects of natural ventilation. In this shortpresentation, we will focus on three main contributions, SingleSided Ventilation, Cross Ventilation and Air Flow Modelling. Single Sided Ventilation Single sided ventilation experiments were carried out in realbuildings located in Athens, Madrid and Lyon, and in fully equippedtest cells . Two of them in Athens and BBRI were developed withinthe frame of the PASSYS Project. A third one located in Portohas also been used. Most of the experiments were performed usingtracer gas decay techniques. A total of 76 experiments were performed in Greece composing thelargest data base on single sided ventilation. From this database, a model has been proposed introducing a correction factor,CF by which the theoretical flow equations of the network modelhave to be multiplied to give more realistic results. Furthermore,a correlation giving CF in terms of thermal and flow characteristicshas been proposed. CF = 0.08 (Gr / (Re^2) )^-0.38 (1) With Gr: Grashof number calculated on the height of the openingand the reference temperature difference, and Re, Reynolds numbercalculated using the reference velocity and the depth of the cavity. This model has been validated using the results of other singlesided ventilation and it is convenient when the inertial flowdue to wind speed is the driving phenomenon. In the case of highertemperature differences between outdoor and indoor conditions,experiments carried out by BBRI in Belgium have demonstrated thata multi term model is more efficient. This model takes into accounteach physical contribution to the air flow by means of a new formulation. Q = (Q_net(Cd, Delta_T)^2 + (aAV)^2 + (bA)^2)^0.5 (2) With Q_net air flow rate calculated by the network model usingCd = 0.66, A opening area (m^2), V Wind speed (m/s), a, b windand turbulence parameters related to investigated environment. It has also been shown in the BBRI experiments that the heterogeneityof the concentration field is an important source of uncertaintywhen evaluating air flow rates due to natural ventilation. A thermalbalance of the room is certainly, when possible, a more accurateway. Indeed, as said before, these models are certainly limited toa reduced number of conditions (wind direction, wind speed andtemperature differences), and further investigation is now neededto extend their applicability domain. Cross Ventilation From a literature review, various models have been investigated Global air flow rate prediction Aynsley's Model (1977) (4) Vickery's Model (1987) (5) Global resistance approach (Aynsley 1988) (6) Virtual Stream tube method (Murakami 1991) (7) Velocity Coefficient Approaches Gouin (1984) (8) Givonni (1988) (9) Ernest (1991) (10) This review shows that there is a wide range of uncertainty inthese various models. In most cases the applicability limits arenot well described, and they can be very difficult to extend togeneral cases. In order to study a wide range of configurations, different experimentalfacilities have been used in Belgium, Greece, Spain and Switzerland.The resulting experiments were carried out using either constantinjection or decay methods. Single zone and two zone experiments carried out in Athens usedthe Aynsley model to identify the discharge coefficient of theopenings. A low value of .2 has been identified and does not seemto be influenced by the thermal conditions. In these experiments,the mixing of the tracer gas was found to be very good. This resultis surprising and disagrees with Murakami's description of aninertial flow crossing the room. On the contrary, the experiments carried out in Mendillory buildingin Spain showed a real difficulty in assessing a good homogeneityof the tracer gas in cross ventilation configuration. In thiscase, the decay method appears to be more appropriate than theconstant injection. Givonni's model giving the mean velocity within the cell has alsobeen used in order to propose various correlations. Nevertheless,the whole experience of cross ventilation studies carried outduring the PASCOOL Project clearly shows that specific experimentalfacilities are now necessary to go a step further. The boundaryconditions have to be controlled very carefully in order to givea strict indication of the limits of applicability of the variousexisting models. Air Flow Predictions During the PASCOOL Project, the modelling activities were splitinto two main contributions. On the one hand, a multizone airflow model PASSPORT-Air adapted to natural ventilation conditionshas been developed and evaluated through the large experimentalPASCOOL data base. On the other hand, a new approach using zonalmodelling has been investigated. PASSPORT-Air is based on a nodalconcept, each zone of a building is represented by a pressurenode. Boundary nodes are also representing the outside environment,and flow equations are used to calculate the air flows througheach flow path. Cracks, windows, doors and shafts are considered,and special care has been devoted to the prediction of naturalventilation flows.

Almost similarairflow rates are predicted by all tools when assuming regularair flow equations as shown in Table 1 .Nevertheless the introduction of the Correction Factor significantlyimproves the accuracy of the prediction. The correlation coefficientbetween experimental values and numerical prediction goes from0.4 without CF to 0.75 with CF correction. Figure 1 presents this result. Further validation of the model is obviouslynecessary to confirm this result, and special care in cross ventilationprediction will be required. Figure 1: Comparison of numerical predictionswith experimental results The limits of airflow network models are well known. While theycan predict the air flow rates between the zones of a buildingand the outdoors, they are not able to give any information aboutairflow patterns and velocity field within the rooms althoughthese data are obviously necessary when dealing with comfort predictionor natural ventilation efficiency. CFD codes could be used forthis purpose, however they are very heavy to use and the resultsare sometimes questionnable when using a limited number of nodesor wall functions. An intermediate concept has been developedover few years introducing an empirical description of a cavityin dominant flows: boundary layers, jets or plumes. These flowscan be described by analytical functions or empirical correlationsand mass balance and energy balance in each zone of the room arethen sufficient to predict air flow patterns and heat flows (12) . During the PASCOOL Project this concept has been used inorder to predict natural ventilation flow patterns within a room.The results obtained in comparison with those of CFD predictionare encouraging and further research in this field is very promising. Conclusion A large research effort in the field of natural ventilation hasbeen carried out during the PASCOOL E.C. Project. Various aspectsof the problem such as single sided ventilation, cross ventilation,airflow prediction, night ventilation or large internal openingshave been studied, and an important confrontation of experimentalknowledge and theroretical analysis has led to a real improvementof experience in this domain. Nevertheless, necessary studieshave also been identified in order to improve the descriptionof outdoor conditions around buildings and of heterogeneous indoorenvironment. Furthermore, another important effort is also necessaryto transform the scientific knowledge acquired during such a projectinto efficient design tools and guidelines for architects andengineers.

The latest revision is currently undergoing publicreview. Included is a proposed change to the specification ofventilation rate which separately takes into account pollutantgenerated from occupants and that generated from furnishings andfittings. This is quoted at 3.0 l/s.p and 0.35 l/s.m2 of floorarea. Assuming an office occupation density of approximately 10m2/occupant, the per occupant ventilation rate amounts to about6.5 l/s.p and corresponds to a steady state indoor CO2 concentrationof 1000 ppm. However, in more densely occupied spaces, CO2 concentrationsof up to 2000 ppm can be expected.

Inexpensive Ventilation Pre-heatAbsorbs in Excess of 60% of Solar Energy The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)in Golden, Colorado, in conjunction with Conserval Systems Inc,in Buffalo, NY have developed a solar collector which pre heatsincoming ventilation air by as much as 30oC. It consists of adark corrugated perforated sheet that is mounted several centimetresfrom a sun facing wall. The dark panel absorbs solar radiationand heats incoming air drawn through its perforations into a plenum.Heat escaping from the building is also captured in this plenum.Solar heat transfer has been maximised by optimising the air flowrate, and the spacing and size of the perforations. The simplicityof this product ensures reliability and ease of production. Aboveall it does not contain any of the complexities of earlier solarpanels. The system has been demonstrated in a wide variety of buildings.In cold climates it takes advantage of both direct and diffusesolar radiation to provide pre-heat, while in warm climates, especiallyin developing areas, it has important applications in crop drying.The 'Transpired Solar Collector' has been recognised by the UnitedStates Department of Energy's, 'Energy Related Inventions Program'as being among the top 2% of energy inventions. It also featuresDOE's R&D 100 award.

This is a counterbalanced openablewindow that responds to pressure difference, thus allowing analmost constant air flow rate irrespective of driving force. Bothexhaust and supply versions are available. It is recommended thatsupply windows are set in the lower part of opposite walls, whileexhaust windows are placed in the upper part of the same walls(see Figure). Irrespective of the nature of the driving forceor the direction of wind, a cross flow or stack flow ventilationpattern will be established.

Also presented is a toolunder development aimed at simplifying the application of sensitivitymethods. Such techniques are essential to add confidence to numericalprediction. Too often, simulation data are presented without anyerror bars and any information on their accuracy. They are obtainedwith a single run of the model, and the influence of the inputuncertainty is ignored. Sometimes, although less often, a one-parameter-at-a-timesensitivity analysis is performed, requiring a relatively longtime and providing no indication of interactions and unsuspectedeffects. It is important to understand that efficient methods exist forsensitivity analysis and that they are widely used in such fieldsas environmental risk analysis, economics, and the aircraft, nuclearand defence industries. In those fields, modellers are requiredto verify their results with sensitivity and error analyses [6] . Techniques It is a challenge for modellers to distribute models which cannotbe misused too easily. This means asking the user about the uncertaintyof the input, calculating confidence intervals, providing meansto perform sensitivity and error analysis, and addressing thesetopics in the user manual and in simulation reports. It can alsomean including a specialist on sensitivity analysis in the developmentteam. One of the arguments used to justify the avoidance of sensitivityanalysis is that the problem has too many input parameters. Thiscan be overcome by using techniques such as the 'Monte Carlo'which is capable of being used to calculate confidence intervalsin one hundred runs for any number of varying input parameters(±14% accuracy if Gaussian hypothesis is valid) [3,10] . Plackett and Burman designs exist which allow users to calculateall main effects of N parameters with N+1 runs, for N up to 100or more [15] . Sobol method existswhich makes possible apportionment of the linear and nonlinearsensitivity between parameters or groups of parameters [8,19] . Sequential bifurcation exists which screens important effectswith a small number of runs much smaller than the number of varyingparameters (i.e. 136 runs to extract 23 major parameters from390) [16,17] . For parametric or optimizationstudies, statistical techniques are available which minimize thenumber of simulations. They are usually based on surface responsetechniques [11] . In September 1995, the SAMO (Sensitivity Analysis of Model Output)conference in Belgirate was dedicated to those techniques andtheir use in different fields. The proceedings can be obtainedvia the Internet by connecting to http://rea.ei.jrc.it/SAMO/ and down-loading files [18] .Further information on this topic can also be located on the WWWby searching under 'sensitivity analysis'. A common starting point is the textbook by Box et al. on designof experiments [1] . The use of experimentaldesign in simulation was initiated by Naylor in 1969 [14] . Several textbooks on simulation introducing classical techniquesare also available [9,11] . More sophisticatedand also recent techniques are published in the following journals: American journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences Biometrica Communication in statistics (Theory and Method) Communication in statistics (Simulation and Computation) Communication ACM Computational statistics and data analysis Computer in physics European journal of operational research Journal of statistical computation and simulation Journal of mathematical physics Journal of quality technology Management sciences Mathematics and computers in simulation Reliability engineering and system safety Simuletter Simulation Tecnometrics This list is not at all comprehensive but few are read by buildingphysics practitioners. It is very difficult to keep track of whatis going on in secondary subjects, especially in statistics becausethe vocabulary is sometimes different, and extracting practicalinformation is not straightforward. Key papers are surveys ofthe subject by J.C. Helton, T. Turanyi or J. Kleijnen which containmany valuable pointers [7,20,13] . As part of IEA Annex 23 'Multizone air flow modelling', an importanteffort was targeted on the problem of simulation confidence. Thisaddressed experimental as well as user-introduced uncertainty.The final report contains theoretical points, techniques and severalcase studies [2,5] , thus representinga good introduction to the subject of sensitivity analysis forventilation practitioners. MISA (Multirun Interface for SensitivityAnalysis) In practice tools are needed which are efficient but at the sametime are good tutorials. One such tool, known as MISA (MultirunInterface for Sensitivity Analysis) is currently being developedat NIST. It is a Windows version of a tool developed as part ofAnnex 23. The aim of this software is to provide practitionerswith a way to use up-to-date statistical methods for simulationand to allow them to perform a sensitivity analysis within a coupleof hours. MISA is designed for encapsulating a DOS or a UNIX modellingprogram that works in batch mode with unformatted input and outputfile(s). The computation procedure follows [4] : The project file (the input file representing the projectunder study) is flagged to point the parameters to be studiedand becomes a reference file. The ranges of the parameters to be varied are entered. Depending on the type of statistical method to be used, adesign consisting of a special matrix of standardized values isselected. The design matrix has one line per simulation run andone row per parameter to be varied. A new input file is generated by processing the referencefile, the range information and a line of the design matrix. Thenew input file is run. Step 4 is repeated as many times as necessary to completethe design. Numerical treatments such as mean, standard deviations andcorrelation coefficients or meta-model regression are appliedto the output to extract the sensitivity indices or uncertaintyinformation related to the selected statistical technique. The general idea of the interface (see Figure 1 ) is to represent the flow of information during the multirunprocess and, within this scheme, to provide the user with toolsto perform analyses. The graphical interface, making the structureevident, gives the user easy access to the multirun facility,and he can then spend more effort on the statistical strategyto follow and the analysis of the results. Figure 1: Main window of MISA (MultirunInterface for Sensitivity Analysis). It is a graphical representationof the flow of information during the procedure. The user enterscommands through push buttons and pop-up menus which are placedinto the scheme according to their influence. Help windows areavailable which explain the main point of each step of the procedure. Conclusions Simulation work should incorporate a sensitivity analysis indicatingthe confidence limits of output data. This can be done efficientlyby using up-to-date statistical techniques as it is done in othersfields. There are many such techniques, and a statistical handbookfor simulation could be of great help. Sensitivity Analysis must be considered when developing modelsand user interfaces as well as when beginning a new study. Toassist this approach, MISA will be available very soon.

In addition, the heating and refrigerative coolingof a space is exceptionally energy intensive with the result thatunnecessary or uncontrolled air flow from buildings still resultsin a largely undefinable but significant proportion of total energyloss. Only by continuing to develop measurement and calculationtechniques, and by producing practitioner tools, can energy efficientsolutions to indoor environmental problems be achieved. In its strategy plan for 1994 to 1997, the IEA Executive Committeefor Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems (ECBCS) concluded that ventilation and air movement willbecome the dominant heat and cooling loss mechanism in buildingsof the next century. Its impact on global energy use will alsoincrease substantially. Thus a goal was established to determineindoor air quality and optimal ventilation needs and to identifyalternative energy efficient strategies to control the indoorenvironment. In support of this, various research annexes wereestablished including: Annex 23 Multi-Zone Air Flow Modelling Annex 26 Energy Efficient Ventilation of Large Enclosures These annexes have now been completed and the results were presentedat the recent Roomvent Conference held in Yokohama, Japan on 17th-19thJuly 1996. A review of the outcome is summarised below. Annex 23 Multi-Zone Air Flow Modelling (COMIS) Background and Objectives Having its origins as a year long international workshop heldat the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, the 'ConjunctionOf Multizone Infiltration Specialists' (COMIS) became adoptedas IEA Annex 23 in 1992. The Operating Agent responsible for thedevelopment and management of this task is Dr Helmut Feustel ofthe Energy and Environment Division of the LBL. Its focus wasto develop a new multi-zone (inter-room) air flow and pollutanttransport model. In support of this, the task also involved themost comprehensive evaluation of such models ever attempted. Thisactivity attracted the co-operation of researchers from nine countries,it included the intercomparison of many existing models and involvedmeasurements made in more than a dozen buildings and structures.While currently not widely used, multi-zone models are invaluablefor predicting the pattern of air flow and pollutant migrationthroughout an entire building. They have also been applied tothe prediction of air flow in a single enclosed space (Annex 26).Further applications include evaluating the performance of ventilationsystems, identifying the impact on air flow and air change rateof window or vent opening, and predicting flow rates in mechanicalor natural ventilation ducts. Additionally, they may be coupledto thermal models to provide a much more accurate evaluation ofheat loss and temperature distribution than is possible by simplyassuming a fixed air change rate or ventilation duty cycle. The Tasks Tasks included: devising a robust algorithm incorporating the fundamentalfeatures of interzonal air and pollutant flow. developing a user friendly interface. evaluating the algorithm for numerical reliability. evaluating potential user difficulties. comparing numerical prediction with experimental data. The Algorithm COMIS is designed to solve a network of equations representingair flow between individual rooms or zones within a building andbetween the inside and outside of a building. It is modular inconcept and contains algorithms to handle many flow problems includingflow through cracks, large openings, vertical openings, ductworkand natural and mechanical ventilation systems. It also evaluatespollutant migration and pressure distribution. In principle, furthermodules covering other aspects may be added as the need arises.Mass air flow rates are solved for known air path distributionsand for mechanical and natural driving forces. The User Interface Two user interfaces have been developed to aid the input of data.The first, 'COMERL', is DOS based and has been developed at EMPAin Switzerland as a simple tool to complement COMIS. The secondis a totally interactive Windows based graphical interface, 'IISIBat'which has been developed at the Centre Scientifique et Techniquedu Batiment (CSTB), France. This latter version introduces considerabletransparency into the operation of COMIS and very much relievesthe user of the need to understand the COMIS program. Both interfaceshave provision for 'default' information, including data fromthe AIVC's Numerical Database. COMIS IISIBat Graphical User Interface Numerical Reliability A variety of tests were introduced to ensure that the programcontained no numerical errors and would provide the same resultsirrespective of computer or operating system. This included 'UserTest 1' which was developed as part of a joint contribution bythe AIVC and LESO in Lausanne, Switzerland. This test representeda very simple network in which all openings and driving forceswere defined and extreme parameters were set, aimed at establishingthe ability of the algorithm to converge to a consistent solutionunder all possible conditions. This and other numerical tests,which compared results with known solutions, enabled inconsistenciesand problems in the code to be quickly identified and rectified. Evaluating Potential User Difficulties A further test, 'User Test 2', was developed to evaluate the abilityof the user to interpret input data and apply the data to a multi-zonemodel. Judgement was needed on the specification of items suchas the number and location of flow paths, leakage coefficients,and wind pressure distribution. This approach pinpointed potentialdifficulties and highlighted further explanations that were neededin the COMIS User Guide. Results also showed that the abilityof the user was critical in securing reliable predictions. Comparing Numerical Predictions with Experimental Data Ultimately the performance of a model can only be judged againstits ability to compare favourably with reliably measured results.A comprehensive measurement programme and data sensitivity analysiswas therefore undertaken. This included a mix of real buildingsand test structures, with each being used to focus on a differentaspect of multi-zone air flow. When compared against measurementdata, numerical predictions were found to be generally of thecorrect magnitude, although there were sometimes significant differencesin individual results. Much still depends on the interpretationplaced on the input data by the user and there are clearly uncertaintiesover assigning wind pressure and air leakage data. Extensive testinghas shown, however, that the algorithm itself is error free andaccurately solves the basic flow equations. Outcome and Conclusions The main development of this annex has been the production ofthe COMIS model which is available in the public domain as a standalone 'FORTRAN' Code. This has been thoroughly evaluated usinga wide range of measurement data. Also available in the publicdomain is the Swiss interactive input algorithm, COMERL. Followingfurther testing, the full Windows environment interface, IISIBat,will be available as a commercial product from CSTB in France. Effort is still needed to improve the accuracy and transparencyof input data. Nevertheless, provided the user is familiar withthe implications of input data and has a good concept of the sourceand flow characteristics of openings and driving forces, the COMISModel is capable of making a positive contribution to ventilationdesign and pollutant prediction.

Annex 26 Air Flow in Large Enclosures Background and Objectives Large enclosed spaces are becoming a feature of modern architectureand are evolving in response to consumer expectations. Examplesinclude shopping malls, atria buildings, airport terminals andcovered sports stadia. Each presents enormous design problemsin relation to heating and cooling loads, the provision of goodair quality, and protection against smoke and fire movement. Withoutmodern computational and measurement techniques, it is arguablethat such buildings could not be constructed to an acceptablelevel of energy and environmental performance. Many spectacularbuildings have now been designed and constructed on the basisof computational fluid dynamic analysis combined with physicalscale modelling. However, as more designers wish to follow thisroute, it has become critical to ensure that these design techniquesare correctly applied. A complete understanding of the implicationsof these methods is needed to avoid the risk of fundamental mistakesor to prevent too much reliance being placed on simulated predictions.Annex 26 was conceived to investigate the potential pitfalls andprovide design guidance on the application of measurement andcomputational tools for understanding air flow patterns in largeenclosures. The Operating Agent and Co-ordinater is Dr AlfredMoser of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH, Zurich.Typical building sizes included in this study vary from approximately1000 m3 to over 100,000 m3. These are essentially buildings inwhich thermal effects dominate and in which the occupied zonesare small compared to the total enclosed volume. The Tasks Tasks included: developing design guidance and producing a design principlesguide documenting and assessing analysis and prediction techniques documenting design case studies of existing large enclosures The Design Principles Guide The design principles guide provides recommendations and advicefor the planning of ventilation and air distribution systems inlarge enclosures. It focuses on information specific to the needsof such spaces, especially where this may differ from more conventionalbuildings. Particular aspects cover meeting ventilation, comfort,air quality and safety needs as well as energy implications, ventilationstrategies, design techniques, applications, commissioning andfeedback. Included in the Guide are worked examples, informationon selecting ventilation rates, and advice on design parametersand strategy selection. Analysis and Prediction Techniques Measurement and calculation methods form a vital part of the designand evaluation process. Methods are evolving rapidly and someof the most up-to-date techniques (both elementary and complex),as currently used by researchers and specialists, are reviewed.The relevance of each approach within the context of the design,construction and evaluation process is considered. Design beginswith 'macroscopic' methods based on engineering experience andsimple analytical tools. As development continues, more sophisticatedtechniques are often necessary. Examples look at individual flowelement models, zonal models (where the air space of a singleroom is subdivided into a relatively small number of zones orlayers), computational fluid dynamics, physical (scale) models,ventilation efficiency evaluation and, ultimately, commissioningand evaluation measurements. Case Studies To support the analytical and design guide development, a totalof twenty six case study buildings were monitored. Of these, sevenreference case study buildings were selected for detailed measurements.These were two university auditoriums (De Montfort University,United Kingdom, 870 m3, and Torino Polytechnic, Italy), an experimental1/5th scale model atrium (Japan, 135 m3), two sports halls (Norway,128,340 m3, and Germany, 2,230 m3), a factory unit (France, 8,820m3) and a large atrium office building (Switzerland, 20 m high).Measurements included ventilation rates, air and surface temperaturedistribution, air velocity distribution and outdoor weather conditions(e.g. temperature and wind velocity). In most cases, thermal transfer,temperature and air flow velocity distributions were comparedwith various computational fluid dynamics and other modellingapproaches. Outcome and Results The work of this team, both as Annex 26 and formerly Annex 20, has consistently produced simple guidance to assist in thereliable use of computational modelling and measurement techniques.This particular study has developed and perfected new methodsand has provided new guidance on the operational needs and applicabilityof computational fluid dynamics models. 'Simple' analysis tools intended for basic engineering applicationinclude the 'flow element' technique in which the total flow fieldis predicted by analysing each element of flow, i.e. jets, plumes,boundary layer flow etc., individually. Similarly a simplifiedmeasurement procedure to evaluate building air leakage has beendevised, aimed at identifying the position of the neutral pressureplane. This has been successfully applied to identify unexpectedsources of air leakage in an enclosure. At the more complex level, the performance of computational fluiddynamics models has been compared with measurement results. Thishas demonstrated the potential to predict flow and thermal patterns,to a reasonable degree of accuracy, especially as measured inthe well instrumented Japanese test atrium. A zonal model, inwhich the space was discretised into control volumes, was alsoable to give a good prediction of thermal stratification. Importantdiscoveries and conclusions concerning the use of computationalfluid dynamics models include: Conventional computational fluid dynamics approaches incorporatingk-e type turbulence representation were found to be capable ofgiving reliable prediction results for temperature, air velocityand pollutant fields. Small changes to boundary conditions may significantly affectthe main pattern of air flow and temperature distribution. Itwas therefore essential that boundary conditions were accuratelyrepresented. The extra effort expended to obtain realistic datais of proven value. Radiative heat transfer is a sensitive component of energytransport and must be incorporated in any computational fluiddynamics analysis. Convective heat transfer from boundaries to the air were notreliably predicted using coarse grid systems and log law wallfunctions. Results tended to be grid spacing dependent. The useof prescribed convective heat transfer coefficients were proposedinstead, although it was acknowledged that this might not alwaysbe easy. New wall functions for free-convection heat transferare now being developed by Annex 26 participants, and the applicationof these functions are presently being tried out. Slow or non-existant convergence of the solution procedurewas found in some instances. This tends to occur when flow isdominated by free convection forces (i.e. thermal buoyancy). Itwas demonstrated that this problem could be overcome by usinga 'coupled' rather than a conventional 'sequential' (SIMPLE) solver.In addition, instability in solutions was found in an isothermalcalculation of the air jets in the sports hall in Germany. Itis believed that the physical flow exhibits low-frequency oscillations.It is concluded that such flows may only be modelled by time-dependentcomputation. A steady-state model will never converge.

Knoll, J.C. Phaff and W.F. de Gids TNO Building and Construction Research, Delft, The Netherlands Synopsis Introduction Basics Of The Program Program Input Program Output First Evaluation Future Improvements Orders and Requests for Additional Information References Synopsis A computer program named "Cp Generator", has been developedto predict the wind pressure coefficients, Cp, on the facadesand roofs of block shaped buildings. The program is based on fits of measured data, including windshielding by obstacles and terrain roughness. The main advantages of the program are: it needs no expertise in wind pressures; the input is simple. It exists of building and obstacle coordinatesand orientations; generating Cp values for ventilation model calculations needsno separate action. By linking the pressure simulation programand the ventilation calculation program as well as their input,wider application of ventilation programs for non-experts becomespossible. The accuracy of the predicted wind pressures in the first versionof the pressure simulation program is promising. Some developmentis still needed, however, in particular complex building shapesand surroundings have to be dealt with more carefully, as wellas increasing wind velocities in small passages. Detailed improvementsare also necessary, for example, to account for sloped roofs andthe position of ventilation provisions above roof level. Consequently, generation and implementation of additional windtunnel data is planned, to improve the present version of theprogram. 1. Introduction A good prediction of wind pressure coefficients, Cp, on facadesand roofs with ventilation provision, is vital for natural ventilationcalculations. The accuracy of the ventilation calculations canhighly depend on it, if wind is the dominant driving force. The use of wind tunnel experiments to predict Cp values is a proven,but expensive method. The use of Cp estimations from data basesis a cheaper, but less accurate alternative and in the case ofsurrounding obstacles almost impossible. In both methods, generating Cp-values is an expert job, to beperformed separately, before the actual ventilation calculations.This is found to be a disadvantage for operating applicationswith ventilation models by non-expert users. The organisation for applied scientific research TNO is developingan automatic control system for natural ventilation of industrialbuildings for the Dutch ventilation company BRAKEL-ATMOS. Thecontrol system calculates and sets optimum grill positions, dependingon meteo conditions, inside temperature, required ventilationflow and allowable draught. For this application the need for implicit prediction of windpressure coefficients became urgent. Due to the knowledge of mostof its users, the input needs to be simple data of the buildingto be ventilated and its surroundings. The lack of such a tool led to the development of the first versionof a wind pressure simulation program, described in this paper. The pressure simulation program is a computer program, writtenin Pascal and running under MS-DOS. The pressure simulation program may be applied for: simple building structures (to be simplified to rectangularshaped facades with flat roofs); with ventilation provisions on variable position within thefacades and roof; in different surroundings per orientation; with common terrain roughnesses (z0 = 0.35 to 7 m); and several local obstacles (also more or less block shaped). 2. Basics Of The Program The pressure simulation program is based on measured data [1], [2]. It concerns wind tunnel experiments: on typical block shaped buildings, in different terrain roughnesses, with and without obstacles on systematically varying distances. Because of the systematic set-up of these measurements, it waspossible to fit the data to a set of mathematical expressions.For parameters describing the data additional references [3], [4] and [5] are applied. The start of the fits is a formula, describing the general relationof wind pressure and wind direction for an unshielded object.The relation is presented by different researchers (Phaff [1], Walker and Wilson [4] and ASHRAE). With a set of additional formulas, containing the building dimensionsand the terrain roughness as relevant parameters, the wind pressureson different spots of the roof and each facade are predicted. The next stage was to add the influence of nearby obstacles. For the main orientation of each obstacle to the building, a correctionon the unshielded Cp was determined, using both the distance betweenobstacle and building and the leeward side Cp of the obstacleitself. The obstacle leeward Cp was calculated using the sameprocedure as used for the unshielded building, but now using ofcourse the obstacle dimensions. After calculating the Cp correction for the main obstacle direction,the correction for surrounding directions is determined, usingthe "shielding angle" of the obstacle to the building. To ease the use of the program, a set of formulas has been added,calculating input parameters like dimensions and angles from aminimum of building and obstacle coordinates, to be entered bythe user. 3. Program Input To allow the program to be used by non-experts, the input is restrictedto measurable dimensions of the building, nearby obstacles andtheir positions. To prevent a time consuming, over-detailed input, a simple instructionpoints out what kind of details are relevant. An example is thecriteria for obstacles further away than 5 x their height. Theseare not considered to be of importance for the local shieldingbut may contribute to the terrain roughness. An example of a part of the input is given in the text block andthe building lay-out (Figure 1). ____________________________________________________ obstacles (position in metres) ____________________________________________________ terrain level above sea: 0 roof height of the building: 8.2 name: HOUSE x, y: 0, 0 l, b, z: 22.6, 8.5, 8 (actual gutter height = 5.4) name: x, y: 20, -10 l, b, z: 0.1, 0.1, 10 name: x, y: 14.6, 0 azimut: 270 l, b, z: 22.6, 2.15, 3 name: x, y: 18.3, 0 azimut: 270 l, b, z: 8.5, 34.2, 8.5 ____________________________________________________ Figure 1: Input lay-out with a markededge on floor level of each building.

The pressure data files may be linked directly to a ventilationcalculation program. The output may also be expressed graphically. An example of agraphical output is given in Figure 2. The upper figures show the Cp -values per wind direction in theunshielded situation (imaginary), the local shielding correction(black filling) and their combined result, presenting the actualCp -values. In the lower figures Cp is plotted polar on a mapwith the building lay-out. From this plot the influence of eachobstacle on Cp may be seen directly. Figure 2: Output graph for the rearfacade. '+'= unshielded, Bar=obstacle correction 'o'=resultingCp. Below given as a polar diagram. 5. First Evaluation For the output example shown, a data set of wind-tunnel Cp valuesis available. The data set has proved to fit well with actualon-site measurements. A comparison of these data and the Cp-values calculated with thepressure simulation program is presented in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5. Figure 3: Comparison measured and calculatedCp for the front facade. The comparison shows a rather good agreement for both facades.Most remarkable in these characteristics is the change of calculatedwindward into leeward pressures happening too fast. An over-estimationof the contraction effect (under-estimation of the velocity increase)in the case of small passages is held responsible for this. Figure 4: Comparison measured and calculatedCp for the rear facade The comparison for the roof pressure shows a worse agreement,especially for wind directions between 180º and 330º.The slope of the roof and the position of the ventilation ductwithin the roof is held responsible for this difference. The pressuresimulation program doesn't account for sloped roofs yet. One should realise that a rather preliminary tool is used andthat a rather complex configuration of obstacles is concerned. Figure 5: Comparison measured and calculatedCp for the roof pitch Also, one should realise that minor differences in Cp, especiallyover a wind direction sector, and at steep changes, will haveless effect in reality. This is due to normal fluctuations ofthe actual wind direction. Therefore the results of the comparisonare considered to be hopeful. If some essential corrections areadded, the pressure simulation program is expected to be a usefultool. Hence, further development of the tool is recommended. 6. Future Improvements To end up with a useful and sufficiently accurate pressure simulationprogram, improvements are recommended on: complex building shapes (non-block shaped, like sloped roofs,building extensions or combined obstacles, sloped surfaces, seasonalcorrections for vegetation); contraction effects depending on passage width. Apart from this, extracting a version for correction of localmeteo data is recommended. When local meteo data is used to controlventilation, the correction for local effects is often poor. Thisbadly affects ventilation control. The obstacle corrections ofthe pressure simulation program may also be utilised to correctthese data.

European Project on Natural Ventilation Inaugurated A new natural ventilation project, "NATVENT" has beeninaugurated with the aim of overcoming technical barriers to low-energynatural ventilation in office-type buildings in moderate and coldclimates. The programme falls within the European Joule programmeand will be coordinated by the UK Building Research Establishment. The main objective of this proposal is to reduce primary energyconsumption in buildings (and consequently CO2 emissions) by encouragingthe use of natural ventilation as the main design option for officetype buildings in moderate and cold countries. It is intendedfor countries with low winter and moderate summer temperaturesand where summer overheating from solar and internal gain canbe significantly reduced by good natural ventilation. It alsoaddresses the need to find good natural ventilation solutionsto buildings in those urban areas where external air pollutionand noise are problems.

A first draftstandard has been prepared and is currently under revision bythe working group and experts of the national CEN shadow committees.Since the draft with its annexes is rather comprehensive, thisarticle summarizes only roughly the basic assumptions and themethods developed so far, without giving the definitions and equationsin detail. For this, the reader is referred to the draft standard . Content of the draft standard In the draft standard, methods are presented to calculate airflows for the whole dwelling as well as room air flow rates, bothfor single family houses and individual apartments. The methodsmay be used for applications such as energy loss calculations,heat load calculations and indoor air quality evaluations. Naturalas well as mechanical extract and balanced ventilation systemsare considered. Flows due to window opening are also considered,but only as a single sided effect (no cross ventilation). Dependingon the application and the building type, only outdoor air flowrates or both outdoor and internal flows are considered. For thesedifferent applications, the same basic methods apply. Neverthelessthe input parameter values have to be selected according to therequirements set out for the specific application. Informativeannexes of the standard provide a) a selection of input data (such as leakage values, wind pressurecoefficients) and guidance for the selection of climatic dataas well as window opening factors b) calculation examples for both single and multifamily housesas well as comparison with results from measurements and calculationwith single and multizone models c) a bibliography. Input data The input data needed for the three calculation methods are largelyidentical. Information on the following main aspects of the building,the dwelling under consideration, the ventilation system and theexternal conditions is needed to use the methods outlined in thedraft standard: Building and dwelling: the type of building the building height the shielding from the wind the number of facades of the dwelling which are exposed towind the air leakage of the dwelling the distribution of the air leakage over the envelope Ventilation system: the type of system (natural, mechanical extract or mechanicalbalanced system) the capacity of the ventilation system - natural ventilation openings - mechanical flows the time these provisions are assumed to be used Finally the climatic data have to be known. Calculation method for whole house airflow rates For the determination of the whole house air flow rates, two methodsare given. The first method is an explicit method. This means that if allthe input data are known one can carry out the calculation procedurestep by step. The second method is the implicit method. This method is basedon a single zone model using a simple flow balance equation thathas to be solved iteratively for the unknown internal pressure.This solving process normally requires a computer. The advantageof this method is that the interactions between the wind inducedflow, the stack induced flow and the flows from the mechanicalsystem are considered correctly. Due to the nonlinearity of theseinteractions, the explicit method needs many empirical and approximativefactors to characterize these interaction effects. The methods given must be declared as simplified methods whencomparing them e.g. to multizone air flow models available today. The explicit method It is assumed, that the air flow is dominated by a single leakageand that across this leakage there is an effective pressure difference,which is a summation of windward and leeward pressures. The internalpressure is assumed to be close to the leeward side pressure. Default values for wind pressure coefficients, valid for a windsector of approximately 60 degrees to the facade axis, are givenin the standard . The wind direction is not considered more specifically. The basic procedure for the calculation is shown in Figure 1.The total flow is composed of additive flow terms accounting forthe natural flows, the flows of the mechanical system, the flowsdue to airing and combustion appliances, and, for apartments,also for internal flows. Figure 1 Natural flows due to stack and wind are calculated separatelyfor leakage and purpose provided openings as a powerlaw functionof the flow coefficient and the pressure. For both stack and windinduced infiltration flows, an additional factor accounts forthe leakage distribution effects. Ducts are considered for stackpressures of both infiltration and purpose provided flows. For mechanical extract and balanced systems respectively, theinteraction with the natural flows is considered. Airing is treated as a single sided, single room ventilation effectthrough open window and doors. Cross-ventilation effects are notconsidered. Combustion induced flows are determined by a factor which accountsfor the fact that a certain proportion of the natural or extractflow may be used to cover the additional flow needed for the combustionprocess, by a factor which considers whether the combustion airflow is separated from the room (closed system) or not, by thespecific air flow per fuel type needed for the combustion processand the proportion of time the combustion appliance is activated. For the determination of the internal flow in an apartment, informationon the leakage distribution and thus on neutral pressure levelin the staircase is necessary. Open/closed ducts and windows, and intermittent operation of themechanical system are all considered in the resulting flow bytime weighted addition of the respective flows. The implicit method This method is based on a single zone model. This means that thedwelling is represented by one zone with one temperature and onepressure value. This zone pressure value has to be determinediteratively based on a flow balance equation for all flows enteringand leaving this zone. The model is based on the same input parametersas needed for the explicit method. Nevertheless, individual leakagevalues for the facades and the roof have to be determined as percentagesof the overall leakage. Guidance for the selection of cp-coefficientvalues at the external nodes is given in an annex of the draftstandard. In order to model stack driven flows correctly, distributed leaksmay be modelled by two individual, vertically separated leakages.This is especially important for natural systems with no verticalduct. The building can be modelled in a more complex way, taking intoaccount more than two facades. In this case though, the relevantinformation on the leakage and wind pressure distribution mustbe available. The implicit method can also be applied to apartmentbuilding types. Besides the unknown pressure in the zone under consideration,also the pressure in the staircase is unknown. Therefore, thisbuilding type is normally treated using multizone air flow models.Nevertheless, two extreme cases can be calculated using the methodin the standard: a) The staircase is not considered as a partof the building, b) The staircase is considered as a part of thezone (pstaircase = pzone). Flows for both cases must be calculatedand the results be considered according to the specific application. Calculation method for room air flow rates The method gives total flow rates for an individual room in thedwelling. To perform the calculations, the whole dwelling flowsmust be determined first, using the methods outlined above. It is assumed that the internal doors to the room under investigationare closed. More than one room may be considered as one zone ifthe internal partitions are removed or the connecting doors open. The calculation procedure is applicable to heat load calculationsonly, giving conservative high flow rate values. For indoor air quality evaluations, information on internal flowsis needed that can only be determined by multizone modelling.For energy calculations, room air flow values are not consideredto be relevant.

Potentially, therefore, they couldprovide an alternative to conventional computational fluid dynamic(CFD) analysis for predicting air flow patterns. This new approachapproximates reality by constraining motions and collisions offluid 'particles' to a 'lattice', where each particle representsa finite mass of fluid. Simplification takes place by reducingthe near infinite motion characteristics of a real fluid to avery restricted set of discrete particle speeds and directions. A typical lattice for flow in 2-dimensions is illustrated in Figure1. Particles are restricted to moving along propagation linesand collide only at the intersections ('nodes') of these lines.Each collision must observe Newton's laws of motion, namely thatmomentum and mass are conserved. Various outcomes of particlecollisions are possible. In some cases the direction of particleflow changes, while in others no change in direction occurs. Typically,the solution algorithm incorporates a 'look-up table', in whichall the possible outcomes of collisions are stored. Figure 1 Example hexagonal lattice This article presents an example of the application of the latticegas approach, and outlines some of the essential concepts. Theexample is based on a method proposed by Frisch, Hasslacher, and Pomeau (1986) , known as an FHP model. Lattice Geometry A highly symmetric lattice is needed to ensure that vorticity(rotational motion of a fluid) is realistically simulated. Hardy et al (1972, 1973, 1976) showed that a basic rectangular lattice is inadequate forthis purpose. However, Frisch et al (1986) concluded that for flow in 2-dimensions, a hexagonal lattice,illustrated in Figure 1, is satisfactory. Three-dimensional flowis more difficult to model, but has been simulated using a 'facecentred hyper-cubic' (FCHC) lattice. (See Frisch et al, 1987 .) Although particles must move along the propagation lines,the velocity (i.e. speed and direction) components can neverthelessbe resolved to generate the full flow field. Analogous to wind tunnel experiments, lattice flow has to be scaledto correspond to the correct flow regime (i.e. laminar, transitional,or turbulent flow). This is characterised by the Reynolds number.By increasing the number of nodes, and hence the Reynolds number,features such as the onset and development of turbulence automaticallyemerge. A disadvantage is that turbulent flow currently requiresmany thousands of nodes. CollisionRules A set of collision rules must be specified. These fall into thecategories of 'trivial' collisions, which result in no changein direction of colliding particles, and 'non-trivial' collisions,involving a change of direction of some or all of the particles.Collisions throughout the entire lattice are assumed to occursimultaneously and at 'unit' time steps. Following collision,they then arrive at their new nodes. The resultant propagationof particles simulates the movement of fluid throughout the space. In 2 dimensions, using an FHP model, there are 64 possibilitiesfor a collision at each node. The outcome of each possible collisionis chosen so that the number of particles present before and afteris preserved. In addition, the total of the momenta of all theparticles involved remains constant. The number of particles andthe momentum should be the only conserved quantities in any collision.As a consequence, some collisions result in more than one outcome.When this happens, the outcome is selected at random. The completeset of non-trivial collision rules, as proposed by H�non (1987) , is given as follows, and results in up to 72 distinct outcomes: head-on (2 particles) - 3 possibilities, each with 2 possibleoutcomes (see Figure 2a), triple (3 particles) - 2 possibilities, each with 2 possibleoutcomes (including 1 trivial, see Figure 2b), head-on with spectator (3 particles) - 12 possibilities, eachwith 1 possible outcome (see Figure 2c), and binary head-on (4 particle) - 3 possibilities, each with 2possible outcomes (see Figure 2d). Figure 2 Collision rules - any orientation Boundaries Perimeter obstructions to flow (e.g. walls, floors, and ceilings)and internal obstructions (e.g. furniture and people) are realisedby setting 'solid boundary nodes'. Implementing the conditionof 'no-slip' (i.e. zero parallel fluid velocity) at such boundariesis illustrated in Figure 3. On reaching a solid surface, particlesare returned along the same propagation line. Figure 3 Implementation of no-slip condition at solid boundaries Flow boundaries (e.g. open doors, windows, ventilation systems)are represented by a variety of means. For example, it is possibleto introduce 'forcing rules' to simulate a linear pressure gradient,as shown in Figure 4. This involves imposing directional flowon the lattice particles by introducing additional x-momentumat random lattice locations. The strength of pressure gradientis increased by adding to the number of nodes and the number oftime steps at which forcing is applied. The mass flow rate intothe space (i.e. the number of particles entering the lattice pertime step) must be balanced by an identical mass flow rate outof the space. Figure 4 Forcing rules to simulate a pressure gradient Interpretation of Lattice Dynamics In order to convert the discrete motions of particles into physicallymeaningful quantities, it is useful to partition the lattice intoa number of rectangular 'domains'. For each domain, the averagemass and momentum densities of particles must be determined. Theaverage mass density of particles is given by the number of particleswithin a domain divided by the number of domain nodes. (For a2-dimensional hexagonal lattice, the overall value should be between0 and 3 particles per node, otherwise the fluid would have unphysicalbehaviour.) The average momentum density is determined by summingthe spatial co-ordinate components of the momentum of all theparticles within a domain and, again, dividing by the number ofdomain nodes. An evaluation of the average particle velocity withineach domain is then made from these quantities. Viscosity is the resistance to flow that a fluid exerts on itselfwhen adjacent regions of the fluid move with different velocities.For any lattice gas model, the viscosity and hence Reynolds numberof the fluid depends on the average mass density. Initialising a Simulation The lattice must be sized to set the characteristic Reynolds numberof the problem to be studied. For this model, the maximum obtainableReynolds number for a given lattice size occurs when there isan average of about 2.0 particles per node, for the complete setof collision rules stated above. An initial particle distributiondefining the true mass density of the lattice is established.This implies an initial momentum distribution, from which thecalculation proceeds by running the model over a number of unittime steps. In general, simulations must be run until transient disturbancescaused by the initial conditions have disappeared. This is likelyto be a large multiple (e.g. greater than 10) of the number oftime steps taken for a particle, moving at the average velocity,to have 'propagated through the system'. At this stage a consistentpattern of flow may begin to emerge. An Air Flow Example The above concepts have been incorporated into a simplistic 2-dimensionalexample, as illustrated in Figure 5. A 2-dimensional office spaceis modelled using 400 x 400 lattice nodes, and 40 x 40 domains(each of 10 x 10 lattice nodes). The average mass density of thelattice is 2.4 particles per node, yielding low Reynolds numberflow. The upper and lower boundaries are solid, and there is a no-slipcondition at these edges. Particles reaching one side of the latticeare fed back into the other side, with identical velocity andat the same y-value. A block of three adjacent solid rectanglesprovides an internal obstacle to flow, which is a crude representationof a person sitting at a desk. A no-slip condition is also presentat these boundaries. The air flows under isothermal forced convection, as provided,for example, by a balanced mechanical ventilation system. Thedriving force for the flow is provided by a linear pressure gradient(in the x-direction in Figure 5), implemented with theforcing rules shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the resultant velocity field after 100000 unittime steps (which required approximately 4 hours computation timeon a 100 MHz Intel Pentium based computer). It should be notedthat the Reynolds number is perhaps too low for a full-scale ventilationsystem. Clearly, therefore, this example is very idealised, butnevertheless the potential for predicting flow using this approachis demonstrated. Figure 5 Example simulation Conclusions The lattice gas method presented may be used to produce qualitativefeatures of physical fluid behaviour. In the short term, the methodis likely to be limited to low Reynolds number applications. Inthe longer term, current limitations imposed by the high storageand processing requirements needed for turbulent flow analysismust be overcome. This may be possible by compressing the datastored to represent the lattice. Current work to overcome highprocessing requirements includes using lattice models with parallelcomputers (e.g. Krafczyk and Rank, 1995 ), to which they are well-suited. The method has the positive characteristic that, subject to theconstraint of the discrete nature of the lattice, arbitrarilycomplex boundaries can be included without increasing the timeneeded for computations. It is also possible to track either individualor groups of particles, so that, for instance, pollutant transportmay be studied. This approach dispenses with the need to solvethe Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, since turbulence developsnaturally in lattice gas methods, artificial turbulence models,as incorporated into conventional CFD techniques, are unnecessary.To conclude, the lattice gas technique may prove to be a usefultool for air flow analysis, especially with recent developmentsallowing for the inclusion of buoyancy effects (e.g. see Chen et al, 1989 , and Burges and Zaleski, 1987 ).

Topicscovered included: Energy Impact Standards Offices and Large Enclosures Ventilation in the Home Retrofit Mites, Mould and Moisture Radon Calculation Techniques Measurement Techniques Conference Awards and Banquet Richard Karney, Director of the Building Systems and MaterialsDivision at the US Department of Energy , delivered the Welcome Address and introduced the KeynoteSpeaker, Commissioner Jannane Sharpless from the California Energy Commission , who spoke about the need for long-term public investmentto complement the research and development projects funded byprivate industry. Energy Impact Several presentations focused on energy consumption. The firstby Don Colliver (University of Kentucky , USA) outlined the results of a study to determine the energynecessary to condition a fixed flow rate of outside air to variousheating and cooling set points. Later on, Jürgen Röben,of the Universit&aumlt Essen in Germany, discussed the benefit of low energy dehumidification,achieved with an open cycle liquid desiccant system, whilst ProfessorFritz Steimle, also from Essen, described how the separation ofsensible cooling from latent heat removal can allow a more energyefficient system. Standards A workshop on standardisation encouraged various speakers to givean informal presentation on the current situations in their respectivecountries. Codes and Standards were also the subject of severalpapers delivered throughout the conference and included a presentationby Gene Tucker (EPA , USA)about the current revisions to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 "Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor AirQuality". Also from the USA, Bud Offermann (Indoor EnvironmentalEngineering) demonstrated the procedure for an experimental evaluationof ASHRAE Standard 129"Standard Method of Measuring Air Change Effectiveness". Offices and Large Enclosures Measurements to determine ventilation effectiveness in four mechanicallyventilated New Zealand office buildings highlighted the importanceof planning the ventilation system around the floor layout. Continuingwith offices, Peter Wouters (BBRI, Belgium) described the installationand operation of an infra-red (IR) detector controlled ventilationsystem. It was shown that, provided attention was paid to ductairtightness, then the IR detection facility can provide significantenergy savings. Elia Sterling (T.D.Sterling & Assocs, Canada)summarised the planning and design of some prototype energy efficientoffices, and Earle Perera (BRE , UK) illustrated how trickle ventilators are able to supplyadequate background ventilation for occupied offices. Alois Schälin(Federal Institute of Technology , Switzerland) reported on both the method of predicting airflows through open aircraft hanger doors using transient thermalmodels and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the possibilityof using huge air curtains to reduce heat loss in such structures . From Sweden, Sture Holmberg (National Institute of Occupational Health ) showed encouraging results from field measurements, carriedout in the plastics industry, of the principles of practical displacementventilation. Two strategies for cooling (without dehumidification)in non-residential buildings were explained by Andrew Martin (BSRIA,UK) and Willigert Raatschen (Dornier GmbH, Germany). The UK strategyconcerned the use of automatic controls for natural ventilationand passive cooling, whereas the German author presented the testingof a thermosyphoning facade system. Ventilation in the Home Lars-Göran Månsson (LGM Consult AB, Sweden) discussedthe various criteria influencing domestic ventilation system performance . As part of the same study , Johnny Kronvall (J & W Consulting Engineers AB, Sweden)described the simulation of passive stack ventilation (PSV) ina single family house and suggested possible improvements. Fromthe Swedish National Testing & Research Institute, ThomasCarlsson outlined the results of calculations for mechanical exhaustand balanced mechanical systems, concluding that outdoor air shouldbe supplied only via the bedrooms for both these systems. Also,Åke Blomsterberg, from the same organisation, contrastedthe outcome of long-term monitoring of a representative sampleof dwellings in Sweden for different ventilation systems and alsoshowed the results of an occupant survey of indoor climate anduser interaction in post-1988 single family Swedish dwellings.Findings reported by Duncan Hill (CMHC ) of an occupant survey in Canada concluded that increasedconsumer education and refinement of controls and maintenancestrategies would be needed to ensure more success with mechanicalventilation with heat recovery (MVHR). Ulf Krüger (Chalmers University , Sweden) proposed that slot inlet devices are very difficultto position without causing thermal discomfort. He justified thiswith studies of temperature and air velocity distributions aroundthese devices in relation to occupation zones in residential buildings.Still in Scandinavia, Jørn Brunsell (Norwegian BuildingResearch Institute) reported field tests of dynamic insulationin four houses. These revealed that it is essential for the airflow to remain constant, irrespective of climate, occupants, orinfiltration. Retrofit Retrofit activities are very important, because the existing buildingstock is substantially larger in size than the new building stock.The number of buildings in need of renovation is therefore significant.Peter Op 't Veld (NOVEM bv, The Netherlands) described the E'novationprogramme of renovation of dwellings, in which buildings withhigh energy use, poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and often moistureand mould growth, were made more energy efficient (by an averageof 39%) with, in addition, improved IAQ. An overview of a Frenchguide to assist in the choice and sizing of PSV systems for apartmentretrofits for ventilation and gas exhaust flues was given by Jean-GeorgesVillenave of CSTB . FromVTT Building Technology in Finland, Jorma Sateri argued that the installation of heatrecovery in existing Finnish multi-family buildings would be economicallyfeasible if their airtightness was 2 to 3 air changes per hourat 50 Pa, or better. Mites, Mould and Moisture Jan Nielsen (Danish Building Research Institute, Denmark) measuredhumidity levels in 16 humidity-controlled mechanically ventilatedapartments in conjunction with another 16 identical apartments(as a control group) with constant ventilation. Interestingly,the humidity-controlled apartments were found to use less energyfor heating than the control group, but still met humidity requirements.Furthermore, Donald McIntyre (EA Technology, UK) presented surveyresults (conducted during a winter period) of humidity and dustmites in 20 houses with MVHR and 20 other houses, from which heconcluded that the majority of the MVHR houses had humidity levelssufficiently low to reduce dust mite numbers. This contrastedwith a minority of the other houses. Sarah Palin, also from EATechnology, made a comparison of the energy consumption and resultantindoor humidity levels with each of PSV, MVHR, and mechanicalextract fans (MEF) in a single family test house. Nigel Oseland(BRE , UK) found that theresults of a postal survey of occupants of UK dwellings with eitherPSV or MEF showed, in general, that those with PSV in their homesseemed to have least problems with condensation or mould. Radon Paul Welsh (BRE , UK) andFan Wang (University of Sheffield, UK) have been independently examiningtechniques for reducing radon concentration in UK single familydwellings. Their results presented at the Conference, indicatedthat extract ventilation (depressurisation) of the underfloorspace produced the greatest reduction in radon levels in the livingarea. Pirjo Korhonen (University of Kuopio, Finland) found thatradon levels in various workplaces in Finland depended mainlyon the type of foundation and the magnitude of depressurisationof the work space. Richard Grot (Lagus Applied Technology, USA)explained how, using SF6 as a tracer gas in tunnels in a uraniummine, the transport of radon through the overlying soil and intothe cellars of 15 different buildings above had been investigated. Calculation Techniques An important mechanism for implementing research results is theproduction of calculation methods. Iain Walker (LBNL , USA) explained his simplified procedure for the calculationof attic ventilation rates. Willem de Gids (TNO , The Netherlands) stated that TNO now has an algorithm for the calculation of building surfacewind pressure coefficients, which has been designed to take intoaccount surrounding shielding. An integrated approach to predictingbuilding air flows by combining network models, CFD, and thermalsimulation was reported by Jan Hensen (University of Strathclyde , UK) together with the 'onions' and 'ping-pong' alternativemethods of coupling heat and air flow solvers. Both Muriel Regard(ENTPE , France) and MartinSimons (Coventry University , UK) presented their work on using CFD for ventilation effectivenesscalculations. Prompted by ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, Milton Meckler (The Meckler Group, USA)demonstrated dynamic IAQ models of ventilation system responseto emissions. Measurement Techniques A crucial aspect of ventilation research is having good measurementtechniques. Stephen Flanders (US Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory , USA) pointed out the uncertainties associated with fan pressurisationmeasurement, in particular, if ISO , CGSB and ASTM protocols are followed. Michael Cui (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , USA) has been using particle-imaging velocimetry to producewhole room air velocity profiles. Peter Wouters (BBRI, Belgium)proposed that acceptable results can be achieved for the investigationof airborne moisture transport if accurate humidity measurementsare made and tracer gas studies are used to find air flow rates. Conference Awards and Banquet Miriam Byrne, Imperial College, UK received the Best Paper awardfor her presentation entitled "Particulate Deposition onIndoor Surfaces - its Role, with Ventilation, in Indoor Air QualityPrediction". The Best Poster was awarded to Richard Diamondand Helmut Feustel of LBNL ,USA for their poster entitled "Air Flow Distribution in aMechanically Ventilated High-Rise Residential Building".Both these awards were presented by the Guest Speaker, John Millhone,Senior Fellow, Advanced International Studies, Battelle PacificNorthwest Laboratories (on assignment from the US Department of Energy ). After the awards, John Millhone delivered an address entitled"AIVC - Looking to the Next 16 Years" in which he stressedthe importance of the AIVC grasping the new opportunities createdby the growing international recognition of the importance ofenergy efficiency. He said that changes are occurring in Centraland Eastern Europe, as countries in this area emerge from a centrallycontrolled to a free-market economy which exposes their profligateenergy use and artificially low prices. He also saw AIVC playingan expanded role in the growing concern over the damage to theearth's climate being caused by greenhouse gases. He elaboratedby saying that as the dominant greenhouse gas emission is carbondioxide which is produced primarily by the burning of fossil fuelsfor energy, then it follows that energy efficiency programs arethe fastest, cheapest and largest option available for containingthis problem. He went on to say that the AIVC must expand theirmission to provide information and services, designed for theair infiltration and ventilation problems of the emerging free-marketcountries, if necessary at a discounted cost or even funded througha third party. In this way, he sees it as a low-cost method ofbuying a world-class technology transfer service and the uniqueand significant findings of the researchers in these new participatingcountries would enrich the body of knowledge of the AIVC and giveit an expanded relevance to major energy efficiency and environmentalproblems of the next 16 years. Just before the close of the Conference,the Summing-Up was given by Martin Liddament, Head of the AIVC,who reviewed how this field has progressed over the last 16 years.

The latest additionto this series summarises research into the use and applicationof heat pumps in ventilation heat recovery systems. It is aimedat design professionals, researchers and engineers who have aninterest in heat pumps in ventilation systems. The document is divided into six main sections. Contents: Scope Introduction Types of Heat Pumps Heat Pump Efficiency Working Fluids and the Montreal Protocol Residential Ventilation Systems Incorporating Heat Pumps Residential Air-to-Water Heat Pump Ventilation Systems Residential Air-to-Air Heat Pump Ventilation Systems Non-Residential Heat Pump Ventilation Systems Heat Pump Systems in Commercial Buildings Swimming Pool Heat Pump Systems Conclusions References Heat pumps are defined in the introduction by ASHRAE as devicesthat extract heat from one substance and transfer it to anotherportion of the same substance or to a second substance at a highertemperature. In the case of heat pump heat recovery from ventilationair, heat is extracted from a source, usually waste heat in theextract air, and transferred to a suitable source, usually thedomestic hot water system or alternatively space heating systemof the ventilation supply air. In section two of this document,the distinction is made between the two main types of heat pumps,i.e., vapour compression and absorption heat pumps, and a briefexplanation of their relevant operational cycle is given. Sectiontwo also defines the Coefficient of Performance and contains abrief note on the use of relevant working fluids and the MontrealProtocol. The main body of this bibliography outlines those papers thatdescribe the use and installation of heat pumps in real buildings.Section three concentrates on residential examples and sectionfour focuses on other buildings such as swimming pools and commercialestablishments. The most common configuration in all buildingsis an air-to-water type system, with the heat pump located inthe exhaust duct transferring waste heat to the hot water circuit.Air-to-air heat pumps are also popular, where heat is transferredto the supply air as a form of preheat. Novel configurations suchas "Dynamic Insulation" incorporating heat pumps havealso been included in this bibliography as well as the use ofheat pumps in swimming pools, schools, shops and offices. In conclusion the studies outlined demonstrate that for typicalresidential air-water heat pumps COP's of between 2 and 3.5 arepossible, and in extremely favourable cases they can be as highas 5. While for residential air-to-air heat pumps COP's of between2 to 5 were reported. Where combined heat pumps and heat exchangersare utilised COP's can reach slightly over 5. For commercial buildings,typical COP's range from 2 to 3, while for swimming pools exampleshave quoted around 1.7. These examples demonstrate the potentialfor heat pump technology to further enhance the energy efficiencyof our buildings.

Malmstrom T-G UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 1-5. Air quality, air flows in buildings, and ventilation are most important topics. Good air quality is however critically dependent also on other things than ventilation, eg source strengths, as is well known. The theme of our conference could also lead to the assumption that there is a simple connection between ventilation and air quality. As the public tend to see ventilation systems as responsible for bad air quality, it is important to state that there is no general criterion for good air quality possible to use in practice to control ventilation processes. Automatic ventilation control is still possible in specific cases only. The ventilation process depends on the total air exchange in the building, which is difficult to control. A related question is: what is acceptable as ventilation air? Is air leaking in through the outer wall acceptable? Is air supplied through the staircases acceptable? To answer such questions air quality criteria are needed too. controlled ventilation, air quality #NO 9830 Computerised methods for balancing ventilation systems. Larsen B T UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 7-13. Adequate ventilation with the "right amount of air, to the right place and at the right time" are important factors for achieving a good indoor climate. Thus it is of prime importance that the ventilation system is working properly. Using traditional methods, it is a very time consuming, and some times even impossible, task to balance ventilation systems to achieve correct air distribution. In most countries the growing concern about Indoor Air Quality has resulted in Building Codes demanding increased ventilation rates. This makes it even more critical that ventilation systems are correctly balanced. Otherwise the effort of solving one problem: "inadequate ventilation", may create two new problems: "draught and noise". This paper describes the "DPM method which is a new method for balancing ventilation systems. The balancing "starts at the designer's desk" by doing a comprehensive computerised pressure loss analysis. The results from this analysis are then input to a PC connected with an electronic instrument. The PC/instrument may be used for balancing when the air terminals are already installed in the building. However, there is a much larger potential for time and cost savings when using the DPM method for pre-setting air terminals at the factory. For this purpose a "DPM machine" has been designed for computerised pre-setting and bar code labelling of air terminals. With impressive results the ventilation systems in a number of buildings have been balanced in the last two years using the described innovative technology. ventilation system, indoor climate, air distribution #NO 9831 The effect of recirculation on air-change effectiveness. Federspiel C C UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 15-23. The effect of recirculation on the age of air is described. A new effectiveness measure called the relative air-change effectiveness is defined in such a way that the air distribution pattern in a room may be quantitatively characterized even when the age of the supply air is non-zero. This admits the evaluation of air distribution patterns in single-zone systems that recirculate air, and also multizone systems with or without recirculation. It is shown that the relative air-change effectiveness may be calculated either solely from age of air measurements of from age of air measurements and flow rate measurements. Re-evaluation of previously published experimental data demonstrates how knowledge of the relative air-change effectiveness may change conclusions drawn from experiments in working buildings. air change rate, air recirculation, air distribution #NO 9832 How effective is natural ventilation? A study of local mean age of air by modelling and measurement. Walker R R, Hayes S D, White M K UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 27-40. A condition often assumed when designing a naturally ventilated building is where air enters at low level and leaves at high level due to the stack effect. It then follows that, at upper levels, the air may be relatively 'stale' since it has previously passed through the lower storeys. An analogous situation may arise when wind is blowing, in which the air entering through the windward face becomes stale as it passes through the building to the downwind sections. It is not well understood how ventilation may, in reality, be affected by this. To address these issues, this report describes a modelling approach using BREEZE and complimentary measurements using the Passive Tracer Gas technique to study local ventilation rates in multiroomed office buildings. Calculations show that simple ventilation flow rates, as conventionally calculated at the design stage, cannot be relied upon to indicate the true 'freshness'. Measurements show that effective ventilation can be less than current minimum occupancy requirements. natural ventilation, ageing, stack effect, modelling, ventilation rate #NO 9833 The effect of external atmospheric pollution on indoor air quality. Kukadia V, Palmer J UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 41-53. This paper reports the findings of a pilot field study carried out to investigate the internal and external air pollution levels of two adjacent buildings, one naturally-ventilated and the other air-conditioned in an urban area, to investigate their relative attenuation of external pollution levels and to compare internal levels with existing air quality guidelines. Concentration levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were monitored, Simultaneously, measurements of ventilation rates within the buildings and periodic video recordings of the traffic were also carried out. As expected the concentration of external pollutants in the buildings followed the daily external variation, but at reduced levels. Generally, pollutant levels were higher in the naturally ventilated building than in the air-conditioned building. However, on a number of occasions, combustion products from heating boilers were entrained into the air-conditioned building via the high level air intake of the ventilation system raising the levels of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide inside the building to higher than those found externally. A comparison of the results with existing air quality guidelines or standards for exposure showed that in both buildings the level of contamination was less than the relevant standard, except during a limited period at the weekend when combustion products were possibly entrained into the air-conditioned building. There is thus no clear distinction between the two types of ventilation strategies in terms of providing adequate indoor air quality to the occupants of the buildings. outdoor air, pollutant, ventilation rate, combustion product #NO 9834 Comparison of indoor levels of radon between workplaces and homes located nearby in different parts of Finland. Korhonen P, Kokotti H, Kalliokoski P UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 55-63. The aim of this study was to compare the radon levels at workplaces and in homes located nearby. Homes (number of 57) and partly or fully underground workrooms (number of 55) have been studied at the four workplaces in southern Finland and one workplace in northern Finland. Radon concentrations both at workplaces and in homes seemed to be at the same level in the same district. The mean radon concentration in workrooms was 406 Bq.m-3, and in homes concentration was 398 Bq.m-3. At the workplaces having mere exhaust ventilation the mean radon concentration was higher (arithmetic mean of 677 Bq.m-3 n=14), than the places having mechanical exhaust and supply ventilation (arithmetic mean of 207 Bq.m-3, n=33). In an average the naturally ventilated workplaces (n=8) had the lowest level of indoor radon (arithmetic mean of 133 Bq.m-3). The highest radon level, both in the workrooms (2937 Bq.m-3) and in the homes (3080 Bq.m-3), was found in the northern Finland. The high values of indoor radon might be partly explained by the hill-construction of buildings without sealed constructions against soil, and partly by depressurisation caused by mechanical exhaust ventilation. radon, outdoor air, mechanical ventilation, depressurisation #NO 9835 Particulate pollution interactions with indoor surfaces: measurement and modelling for risk assessment and contaminant control. Byrne M A, Goddard A J H, Lockwood F C, Nasrullah M UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 65-73. In the urban environment, there is strong evidence that fine particulates associated with vehicular emissions are linked with respiratory problems and an increase in mortality. The population sector most at risk is the elderly who spend much of their time indoors; consequently, the infiltration of these particles and their subsequent behaviour indoors is of primary concern. The deposition of aerosol particles in the respiratory system and on indoor surfaces is a process governed by particle size; in addition to providing risk assessment data, an understanding of the interaction of particles with indoor surfaces can be applied to the design of systems for enhancing indoor aerosol deposition and thus inhibiting inhalation exposure. This paper describes experiments using tracer-labelled aerosols, in a range of monodisperse size distributions representative of real particulate pollutants, to study aerosol deposition on surfaces with representative roughness. Some preliminary data, exhibiting electrostactically-enhanced aerosol deposition are also presented. In order to make these data widely accessible, the experimental results are used to aid in the development of a CFD code by providing validation data. Simulations are described for a room-sized enclosure with representative indoor surfaces, to illustrate the influence of internal building surface characteristics on indoor aerosol concentration modification. particulate, pollutant, motor vehicle, respiratory illness, aerosol #NO 9836 Checking of ventilation rates by CO2 monitoring. Ekberg L E, Strindehag O UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 75-85. The present paper presents results from measurements of outdoor airflow rates and air change rates carried out simultaneously with measurements of the indoor concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The measurements were made both under controlled laboratory conditions and in the field. The field experiments were performed in a conference room, an assembly hall and an office room, and laboratory investigation was carried out in a 19 m3 test chamber. CO2 measurements can be successfully used to estimate the outdoor airflow rate in occupied rooms, but it is vital that the methodology takes into consideration a number of possible sources of errors. For example, it can not be presupposed that steady-state conditions prevail. However, inaccuracies due to non steady-state conditions may be reduced by a thorough analysis of the measurement results. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how the air change rate can be determined using a method based on analysis of the CO2-concentration decay in a room. carbon dioxide, ventilation rate, outdoor air, test chamber, #NO 9837 Reducing draught problems in the cold working rooms.

This study is done by order of a Finnish air cooler manufacturer and it is founded to a master's thesis of the same subject matter. The company produces eg unit air coolers with electric fans and so the aim of the study was to reduce draught problems caused by cold air jets. The desired values were: Because there are two different ways to reach and maintain low temperatures in cold working rooms we first compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods and then get acquainted with cold air jets and reducing draught problems they can cause. The cooling coil can be mounted in the ventilating unit in which case the cold air has to be blown into rooms through ducts and conventional air outlets. Cooling coils can also be mounted directly to the ceiling in cold rooms. In that case there is often used forced convection which is carried out with electric fans. The forced convection improves heat transfer and so it is possible to make coils of compact size. The installation with cooler coils and electric fans is called unit air cooler. The former method makes it possible to have silent cold rooms with good and even distribution. The air distribution can be still improved by using porous textile ducts and let the cold air flow through the cloth into the room. However, there can be some hygienic problems. Hygienic problems can be minimised with the latter method, unit air coolers, because they are quite easy to maintain and keep clean. The disadvantage is that there can be some noise and draught problems. Noise problems can be solved by using fans with low RPM, but the draught problem still remains. It can be reduced with air deflectors which intensify the so-called Coanda effect. The results of this study are utilised in a novel series of air coolers. draughts, temperature, cooling, air distribution #NO 9838 AIOLOS: Creation of an educational structure on the use of passive cooling ventilation techniques for buildings.

AIOLOS is a project partly financed by the European Commission, DG XVII for Energy, within the frame of the ALTENER programme. The purpose of the project is the creation and dissemination of educational material on the use of passive ventilation cooling systems and techniques as applied in buildings. All information will be coupled with the problems of passive solar heating, daylighting and visual comfort. The project is oriented to South European but also North European countries with moderate climate presenting cooling problems. Existing information and knowledge together with recent European research results will be compiled into an educational package. The package will include brochures of case studies, slides, didactic software, technical manuals, guidelines and a handbook with basic and up-to-date knowledge acquired by recent research projects in the field. The aim of the project is to provide building professionals with all necessary knowledge and tools on the efficient use of passive ventilation in buildings. All material will be in a flexible form so that it can be updated on a regular basis. Dissemination will be achieved by seminars attended by building professionals. The overall duration of the project is 18 months. passive cooling #NO 9839 Design guidelines for ventilation system for pollution control in large, semi-enclosed bus terminus.

In response to complaints about poor air quality in bus termini, the Hong Kong Government is considering imposing legislative control over ventilation system design and operation of bus termini in Hong Kong. However, there are, as yet, no relevant air quality criteria and ventilation system design guidelines for Hong Kong. In this paper, measured air quality data for 5 semi-enclosed bus termini are reviewed. This provides a picture of the prevalent air quality in bus termini. To establish a design guide for ventilation systems for Hong Kong, a number of overseas design guides are examined and a ventilation system design method is proposed. The significance of design parameters, such as bus engine emission rates, utilization of the terminus, ventilation effectiveness, etc, are discussed. motor vehicle, pollutant, ventilation system, building design #NO 9840 Cooling and ventilation of a high-speed ground transportation system. Rosemann P, Moser A UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 113-119. This paper presents the special needs and difficulties concerning cooling and ventilation of the SwissMetro high-speed ground transportation system. SwissMetro is based on four complementary technologies: a complete underground infrastructure, a partly evacuated tunnel system to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle with a maximum speed between 400 and 500km/h, linear electric motors and a magnetic levitation and guiding system. Due to high internal and external heat loads permanent cooling and air-conditioning of the vehicle is required. Additional thermal problems may occur in the case of an emergency. The pressure level inside the tunnel has to be raised within a short period of time to guarantee the safety of the passengers and to avoid any health risks. This repressurisation of long tunnel sections may cause shock waves and high temperatures inside the tunnel. The aim of the project is to analyse the spatial and temporal temperature evolution in the SwissMetro tunnels under different conditions and in emergency situations. cooling, motor vehicle, tunnel ventilation #NO 9841 Experiments in natural ventilation for passive cooling.

A naturally ventilated three level office building has been used to study basic stack ventilation configurations and the interaction between ventilation and the subsequent cooling of the building structure in summer. The research was performed in the framework of a European project on passive cooling of buildings and the objective was to validate simple ventilation algorithms and to give an experimental basis to design guidelines for night cooling techniques. The multilevel office allowed the studying of the influence of openings (size and position) on the neutral pressure level (NPL) and on airflow rates. Various cross-ventilation situations have been studied. A single flow path configuration was obtained by closing all windows and doors in the building envelope with the exception of the roof exhaust and one office window as the ventilation air inlet. Air flow patterns were traced with smoke and tracer gas. In a first set of experiments, where the only driving force is stack pressure, air velocities and the position of the NPL have been measured, and contraction and velocity coefficients as used in the Bernoulli model have been observed. In a second set of experiments, the resulting effective area of a combination of two openings in series was studied. Air flow rates derived from velocity measurements in the open doorways were found to be in agreement with the flow rates obtained with a constant injection tracer gas technique, with an uncertainty of +/-20%. Overall agreement was found between the velocity measurements and simplified models based on the Bernoulli equation. In order to cool multiple levels of a building with outside air, the position of the neutral pressure level should be controlled. The restrictions on opening size and position are discussed. natural ventilation, passive cooling, office building, stack ventilation #NO 9842 Modelling the influence of outdoor pollutants on the indoor air quality in buildings with airflow rate control. Kraenzmer M UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 135-143. Low emitting building materials have contributed to the reduction of indoor air contaminants, and in many countries gas ranges and gas cookers are rarely used. As a result, in buildings located in urban environments, a considerable part of the contaminants in the indoor air may originate from the outdoor air. In urban areas buildings are exposed to high concentrations of a large number of contaminants, especially during traffic peak hours. Often, the air intakes are located on the facades, and if there are no filters, the supply air will have the same content of contaminants as the outdoor air adjacent to the buildings. Where if possible, it is advantageous to place the air intakes on the roofs of the buildings (1). The higher the air intakes are placed, the better is the air quality in most cases. To avoid exposure to high concentrations indoors due to concentration peaks of contaminants in the outdoor air, it is possible to decrease the airflow rate temporarily (2). This could be done by monitoring the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO) adjacent to the air intake. When the outdoor concentration of CO exceeds a preset limit, the fans are simply switched off, or the speed of the fans are decreased to a more suitable level. modelling, outdoor air, pollutant, air flow, building material #NO 9843 Comparison of different methods of incorporation of stochastic factors into deterministic models of indoor air quality. Sowa J UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 145-153. The paper will discuss problems connected with incorporation of stochastic factors into deterministic models of indoor air quality. Three different methods: * quasi dynamic multi-zone modelling with generating of input data time series, * multi-zone modelling based on the theory of stochastic differential equations, * Monte-Carlo simulation with independent random generating of stochastic parameters, will be shortly presented. Described methods are compared on the base of computer simulation of CO2 concentration in simple two compartment office. The comparison of simulation outcomes shows that the way of stochastic disturbances incorporation into indoor air quality models does not have an important influence on mean value of predicted concentration. At the same time the analysis of standard deviations indicates that the method of disturbances generation and its later incorporation have a great influence on probability distribution of estimated concentrations. The author would like to highlight that differences. The conclusions include also subjective opinion of the author on main advantages and disadvantages of each of proposed methods. indoor air quality, multizone modelling, carbon dioxide #NO 9844 Residential mechanical ventilation systems: performance criteria and evaluations. Dorer V, Breer D UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 157-165. The performance of mechanical ventilation systems has been checked in several innovative residential houses in the frame of Swiss research as well as pilot and demonstration projects. This paper gives a list of performance criteria for the ongoing comparison and evaluation of these mechanical ventilation systems. For some criteria, target values are proposed. In the second part, this paper shortly describes four residential buildings with mechanical ventilation systems where such evaluations were performed and highlights interesting design features and results from the measurements. It then focuses on discrepancies between the design goals and what has been encountered in reality during the evaluation campaign. Problem items were, among others, commissioning, occupant acceptance and window opening behaviour as well as sealing of ducts and heat exchangers. mechanical ventilation, heat exchanger, occupancy effects #NO 9845 French ventilation system performances in residential buildings. Millet J-R, Villenave J G, Riberon J UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 167-173. The comparison of the performance of ventilation systems must take into account different issues. For indoor air quality, different kinds of pollutant sources have to be defined. To make an evaluation of the results, the best approach is to consider the people exposure. Four generic pollutants are taken into account: rooms components or furniture, human metabolism, cooking activities, passive smoking. As the definition of the unit for each pollutant is free, it is useful for their comparison to press them on a common "normalised" basis. This enables to make a distinction between the simulations based on generic pollutants and their interpretation which could be derived for many kinds of pollutants without having to do additional calculations as far as the considered pollutant follows the conventional patterns. The pressure difference, for example can be related to radon issues as to running of some heat appliances. The room parameters are mainly related to humidity issues as condensation, mould growth or house dust mites. For energy issues, a distinction has to be made between the direct energy use (fans) and the heat needs due to ventilation. Such a methodology has been defined within the IEA annex 27 project. After a presentation of the different parameters taken into account, we describe the computer code SIREN95 developed at CSTB in order to obtain the required results and we present a sensitivity analysis for the basic ventilation system used in France (mechanical exhaust). ventilation system, indoor air quality #NO 9846 Efficiency characterisation of various ventilation configurations. Hanrion M-L, Barles P, Marchal D UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 175-183. The study concerns the ventilation of a parallelepiped shaped room by means of several systems whose supplying and extracting methods differ, so the different thermic conditions applied to limits. To qualify the efficiency of each of these systems in relation with the various current criteria, we carried out measurements by means of a tracer gas, both with a transitory and a permanent flow. At the same time, numerical simulations were carried out by means of a CFD code which solves the equations of the fluids mechanic, material and heat transfers associated with flows. These calculations results, after measurements validation, enable to accurately know the air movements in the ventilated room as well as the tracer gas concentrations distribution in the tested configurations. From these calculation results, was also demonstrated how the complex behaviour of each of these ventilation systems can be characterised owing to the possibility of identifying it to a simple model, using a reduced number of parameters. These typical parameters can in turn be used to implement the system performance evaluation criteria. These criteria allow to compare the various studied ventilation systems and class them in performance order. It can be seen that this classification can be modified depending on the selected criterion as well as the chosen ventilated area. The study results equally show the interest of the use of numerical simulation together with experiments, thus extending the range of results in order to generalise conclusions. ventilation system, ventilation efficiency, tracer gas #NO 9847 Ventilation in houses with distributed heating systems. Parent D, Stricker S, Fugler D UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 185-195. The LTEE laboratory of Hydro-Quebec, in collaboration with Canada Mortgage and Housing conducted an indoor air quality study involving 30 single family detached houses heated with electric baseboard heaters in the vicinity of Trois Rivieres during the 1993-94 heating season. The houses were selected according to the measured air leakage at 50 Pa. so as to have a sample distribution similar to the distribution of air leakage of houses in the province of Quebec. The "source strength" of several air pollutants were calculated from measurements of ambient pollutant levels and total ventilation during a one-week test. In addition, the indoor CO2 and humidity levels were recorded in eight of the houses continuously during the heating season. The level of CO2 in the master bedroom was found to follow fairly closely the CO2 level in other parts of the building including the basement (within about 200 ppm) except when the bedroom door was closed. With the room occupied and the door closed, CO2 levels in the bedroom increased steadily during the night until morning, when the door was opened, to levels in excess of 3 500 ppm with one person, and in excess of 4 500 ppm with two persons. Model studies using the measured pollutant source strengths and measured equivalent leakage areas of the buildings indicated that the recommended health guidelines for airborne respirable solid particles (RSP's), CO2 and formaldehyde are exceeded during periods of low total ventilation, coinciding with mild outdoor temperatures and low wind conditions. It was observed that kitchen and bathroom fans originally installed in some of these houses were not operated by the occupants for sufficiently long times to affect the quality of indoor air. Various different methods of ventilating some of the houses were tested, including quiet replacement exhaust fans, mixing fans for indoor air, and a fresh air intake and mixing system. The effects of operating various air handling systems were monitored by keeping track of indoor CO2 and relative humidity in the master bedroom, and occupancy in person-hours per day. Quiet replacement fans noticeably improved indoor air quality when these were operated over 50% to 100% of the time. An area of remaining concern is the fact that exhaust only systems accentuate the negative pressure in the basement by raising the level of the neutral pressure zone in the building, and may enhance the flow of soil gases into the basement. A system which mixed indoor air between the basement and the main floor also reduced the average level of indoor pollutants. The system was designed to create a pressure difference between the main floor and the basement, causing a slight pressurization of the basement. A system designed to introduce 5L/s of outdoor air and to mix it with 55L/s of indoor air for tempering was installed to draw air from the hallway and deliver the mixed air into each of three bedrooms. This system was capable of maintaining CO2 levels in the master bedroom below 1000 ppm with two occupants in the room and the door closed. heating system, air leakage, pollutant, carbon dioxide, fan #NO 9848 Residential ventilation and energy characteristics. Sherman M H, Matson N E UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 197-207. The role of ventilation in the housing stock is to provide fresh air and to dilute internally-generated pollutants in order to assure adequate indoor air quality. Energy is required to provide this ventilation service, either directly for moving the air or indirectly for conditioning the outdoor air for thermal comfort. Different kinds of ventilation systems have different energy requirements. Existing dwellings in the United States are ventilated primarily through leaks in the building shell (ie infiltration) rather than by mechanical ventilation systems. This report ascertains, from best available data, the energy liability associated with providing the current levels of ventilation and to estimate the energy savings or penalties associated with tightening or loosening the building envelope while still providing ventilation for adequate indoor air quality. Various ASHRAE Standards (eg 62 119 and 136) are used to determine acceptable ventilation levels and energy requirements. Building characteristics, energy use, and building tightness data are combined to estimate both the energy liabilities of ventilation and its dependence on building stock characteristics. The average annual ventilation energy use for a typical dwelling is about 61 GJ (roughly 50% of total space conditioning energy usage); the cost-effective savings potential is about 38 GJ. The national cost savings potential, by tightening the houses to the ASHRAE Standard 119 levels while sill providing adequate ventilation through infiltration or mechanical ventilation, is $2.4 billion. The associated total annual ventilation energy use for the residential stock is about 4.5EJ (ExaJoules). residential building, outdoor air #NO 9849 Ventilation requirements in non-domestic building and energy efficiency.

The research community as well as the design and construction practice is spending a lot of efforts and investments in developing systems which optimise the energy use for achieving certain specified air flow rates. For example, improvements in efficiencies of 10 % in heat recovery systems would be considered as remarkable. At present, one observes a tremendous difference in the ventilation requirements in various countries as well as at the European level. Variation of a factor 10 of the ventilation rate requirement can be found in the proposal for European standard CEN prENV 1752 depending on the 'cleanness'of the building. The present paper develops these problems and makes a comparison with the situation in other areas like thermal comfort and lighting requirements. ventilation requirements, heat recovery, building regulations #NO 9850 IEA Annex 27: Evaluation and demonstration of domestic ventilation systems. Assessments on noise. Op't Veld P, Passlack-Zwaans C UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 217-225. The acceptance and appreciation of ventilation systems is mainly determined by the perceived indoor air quality, thermal comfort and noise. Noise in relation to ventilation systems can be divided into three categories: * outdoor noise (entering the dwelling through ventilation openings, cracks, mechanical supply and exhaust openings etc); * noise generated by components of the ventilation system; * the impact of ventilation systems on sound reduction of partitions (between dwellings, rooms etc). Depending on the type of ventilation system, one or more of these aspects are of concern. Noise related to the ventilation system and components, can result in turning off the ventilation system or closing vents etc. This can have a negative influence on ventilation and indoor air quality. In the framework of IEA ANNEX 27 several noise aspects of domestic ventilation systems have been evaluated. Outdoor noise: In noise loaded areas the selection and the applicability of different types of ventilation systems are determined by the noise level on the facades. A simplified tool is developed to select ventilation systems as a function of the required noise reduction of the facade, room dimensions and design and construction of the facade. System noise: Controlling noise levels caused by ventilation systems is in practice one of the most important factors to contribute to the satisfaction with a ventilation system. Air duct systems in dwellings transport noise generated by fans and aerodynamic noise generated by bends, control valves, grilles etc. ANNEX 27 gives basic formulas to estimate sound power levels of fans and grilles, indication of sizes for silencers and guidelines for design. Impact on noise reduction of partitions: The composite sound reduction is the result of different sound channels from one room to the other. One of these sound channels may be the ventilation system (cross-talk). Cross-talk can be brought about through the air duct system, overflow grilles and ventilation openings in partitions, duct transitions etc. ANNEX 27 provides guidelines for sound reductions of partitions and insertion losses for ducts to eliminate the influence of cross-talk. ventilation system, noise pollution #NO 9851 Modelling and assessing ventilation efficiency in an imperfectly mixed ventilated air space. Janssens K, Berckmans D, De Moor M UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 227-241. To ensure indoor air quality an efficient ventilation system should provide fresh air in those parts of a room where it is required. To assess whether the ventilation system fulfils the main objective, different definitions of local ventilation efficiency (the local mean age of air, the local ventilation rate, the local purging flow rate and the local air exchange rate) are reported in literature. Tracer gas techniques (step up method, step down method and pulse method) and CFD-models are mostly used in research to identify the 3-D distribution of these ventilation parameters in a ventilated space. In our laboratory the 'local volumetric concentration of fresh air flow rate' (m3/s.m3) was introduced as a new ventilation parameter. A total amount of 90 step up experiments was performed in a laboratory test installation with a volume of 9 m3 (3x2x1.5m) to model the 3-D distribution of this ventilation parameter in relation to different values of the ventilation rate (120-300 m3/h) and the heat supply (0-400 Watt) as control inputs. In the main part of the paper some results are given of the modelled 3-D distribution of the 'volumetric concentration of fresh air flow rate' in the test installation. This distribution of fresh air flow rate is assessed in relation to the air flow pattern which is visualised by smoke experiments and quantified by image analysis and the Archimedes number. ventilation efficiency, mixing ventilation #NO 9852 Practical experiences with IR controlled supply terminals in dwellings and offices.

Ventilation is necessary to provide a good indoor air quality to occupants in office buildings but is however a major energy consumer. In that manner, ventilation in itself can contribute to much more than 50% of the energy consumption for heating in well insulated office buildings. Likewise, the general trend in standards to augment ventilation requirements would still increase its energy costs. Thus, it seems obvious that an intelligent control of ventilation in office building allows to obtain substantial reductions of energy consumption. To a certain extent this is also true for dwellings even if in general ventilation represents a smaller contribution to the energy consumption for heating than in office buildings. In this connection, it should be noted that the increasing requirements regarding insulation of dwellings has for effect to augment this proportion. Demand controlled ventilation in dwellings appears therefore also as an interesting way to achieve energy consumption reduction. air conditioning, demand controlled ventilation, office building, insulation #NO 9853 The influence of outdoor air vents and airtightness on natural ventilation - calculations based on measurements. Blomsterberg A UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 253-262. Many modern buildings in the Nordic countries have mechanical ventilation. Passive stack ventilation is, however, an accepted ventilation system in the Nordic countries according to the current building codes. The building authorities need to be able to supply guidelines on natural ventilation systems in modern buildings, in order to fulfill the requirements on a healthy indoor climate at a reasonable energy cost. Therefore a project was initiated by the Nordic committee on building regulations. The aim of the project was to present functional and technical requirements on natural ventilation systems. The paper discusses the influence of outdoor air vents and airtightness on passive stack ventilation for Nordic dwellings. Calculations, based on measurements, were performed for a one storey one-family house, a 11/2-storey one-family house and two apartments in a three-storey building. Cumulative distributions of ventilation rates for a year were calculated, using a multi-zone air flow model, for individual rooms. It is shown that the ventilation rate will vary very much, without any interaction from the occupants or an automatic control system. A modern system for passive stack ventilation must include a system for control of the air flows in order to avoid excessive use of energy and inadequate indoor air quality. air tightness, natural ventilation, cold climate, passive stack ventilation #NO 9854 Maximum velocity of return flow close to the floor in a ventilated room - experimental and numerical results. Karimpanah M T, Sandberg M UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 263-271. The problem of sensation of draught in ventilated spaces is connected to inappropriate velocities in the occupied zone. In Scandinavia, velocities higher than 0.15 m/s are said to be an indicator of that occupants are likely to feel discomfort. Therefore knowledge of the flow field (both mean velocities and fluctuations) is necessary. Both experimental and numerical analysis of the flow field in a full scale room ventilated by a slot inlet, with two inlet Reynolds numbers 2440 and 7110, have been carried out. Results from both approaches show that the location of the maximum velocity near the floor is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. For a two-dimensional room, the maximum velocity at the floor level occurred at about 2/3 room length from the supply. The distance from the floor level is dependent on the inlet Reynolds number. The velocity profiles far away from the wall opposite to the inlet device have the same character as a wall jet profile. However, close to the corners they are transformed. The relative turbulence intensities measured in the return flow region are questionable, because of a hot wire's inability to record large fluctuations at low mean velocities. These turbulence intensities close to floor level vary from 15 to 80% and as the authors have pointed out previously hot wires do not indicate the real value of the turbulence intensities beyond 20%. Difficulties appear in numerical predictions of return flow properties. Comparison between predicted values and experimentally obtained values show a reasonable agreement. This is promising for future CFD-predictions. However, there is a need for an appropriate measurement technique that can cope with reversing flow. air flow, draughts, human comfort, measurement technique #NO 9855 Full-scale measurements of indoor air flow.

Full scale measurements of air flow velocities, temperature, intensity of turbulence and air exchange rate are carried out on two rooms with different types of ventilation located in the department of architecture at Chalmers University of Technology. The measurements have shown that mixed ventilation gives variable mean flow velocities with a high risk of draught as compared to the room provided with displacement ventilation. Air exchange rate for the room with displacement ventilation is obtained from tracer gas monitor by employing decay and constant emission methods. The measurements give similar results for both the methods. air flow, air change rate, draughts, displacement ventilation #NO 9856 Application of a passive tracer gas technique in naturally and mechanically ventilated school buildings. Stymne H, Boman C-A UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 283-291. The homogeneous emission passive tracer gas technique is described. This technique relies on an even distribution of constant tracer gas emission rate within the object to be measured, so that the emission rate per volume unit is constant. The local steady state concentration of the tracer gas is directly proportional to the mean age of air and the emission rate per volume unit. The technique was applied in 10 school buildings, of which 4 were newly constructed naturally ventilated buildings, 2 were old naturally ventilated buildings, 2 were old mechanically ventilated buildings and 2 were newly constructed supply and exhaust ventilated buildings. The result shows that the ventilation rates in naturally ventilated schools are relatively low compared to required standards. It demonstrates the importance of not only relying on the naturally induced ventilation rate, but also to use other means for improving the air quality during or between lessons, like window opening. tracer gas technique, school, mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation, window opening #NO 9857 Developing tracer gas technique to determine interzonal air exchange rate. Niu J L, Burnett J, van der Kooi J, van der Ree H UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 293-302. The use of local exhaust is considered to be the most effective way to control pollutant dispersion from intense sources, such as in kitchens, in toilets, as well as in copy machine rooms. The optimum air exhaust rate required to prevent pollutants from escaping into the major occupant areas very much depends on the natural air exchange rate (AER) between the hooded room and the major room space. This paper presents a mathematical model and a test procedure of using tracer gas technique to quantify the AER. In this study, the mathematical model analyzes the balance the balance of a tracer gas in two adjacent zones, and establishes two correlations between the dimensionless increase/decay rates of the gas concentrations and the AER. The mathematical model reveals two alternative ways to determine the AER: a). Tracer gas concentrations in both rooms involved be monitored; b). Tracer gas concentration in one of the two spaces be monitored. The latter method was validated in a test for AER quantification between ceiling void and room in a test chamber. Finally the proper use of the two methods is discussed, and it is suggested that the techniques developed in this study can be used for estimating minimum exhaust rate requirement for ventilation system renovation in existing buildings. tracer gas, air change rate, exhaust, mathematical modelling More abstracts WT01-B07-65IA068-000417-B013-14http://www.aivc.org:80/ra74_2.html 194.217.120.80 19970113034058 text/html 47863HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 03:40:49 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 47690Last-modified: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 16:02:32 GMTMore abstracts Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings (continued) #NO 9858 Application of the tracer gas techniques for the assessment of ventilation indexes in real buildings.

The work presented in this paper is aimed at the definition of tracer gas experimental procedures for measuring the air change rate, the age of air and the air change efficiency in real buildings under mechanical ventilation conditions. The measurement procedures, based on the decay method, were validated in a special experimental chamber and implemented in two rooms of a building under real operating conditions. Measurements of volumetric flow rate through the air ducts of two buildings, performed by means of the constant emission rate method, will be shown and commented. Results of some measurements obtained by tracer gas technique have been compared with values measured by using other traditional methods. tracer gas, ventilation rate, air change rate, ageing, mechanical ventilation #NO 9859 Zonal model to predict air distribution and dynamic concentration of pollutant in ventilated rooms. Cocora O UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 311-319. The first part of the paper will show some aspects of experimental research on air distribution in ventilated rooms. The study has been carried out to get an understanding of the air movement and the ventilation effectiveness by means of tracer gas measurements. It has been investigated the velocity and the distribution of the concentration in a two-dimensional isothermal flow issue of a linear supply opening. The second part of the paper will describe a proposed zonal model in 9 zones. This model is able to predict the steady-state behaviour of ventilated rooms and the dynamic evolution of a possible pollutant concentration in such environment. The theoretical model is based on the flow element method according to the throw of an isothermal jet and on a typical configuration of a zonal model. Comparison between experimental measurements and the zonal model show a good agreement on the range of usual air change rate in the ventilated rooms. air distribution, pollutant, ventilation effectiveness, tracer gas #NO 9860 Measurement of ventilation air flows. Hedin B UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 321-330. The common way to determine air infiltration, exfiltration and interzonal flows from tracer gas measurements in multizoned buildings is to rely upon the standard single or multizone model, Vc(t) = Qc(t)+p(t). Here c, p are zonal tracer concentrations and injections, t is time and V, Q are the sought volumes and flows. This model may work well provided that all zones are sufficiently well mixed and all flows really are constant during the measurements. The latter can be doubtful in naturally ventilated buildings, especially as the measurements may require several hours. This paper discusses one single question: What could be gained if the flows of the model are allowed to vary in time?, ie we will consider a (bilinear) model:Vc(t) = Q(t)+p(t). The variation of Q(t) will, however, be restricted to be piecewise linear. This extension will complicate the identification procedure, ie the computations, somewhat. On the other hand it does not alter the tracer gas measurements needed. The idea is rather to pick out more information from the standard tracer gas measurements. To test the extended model, single-tracer gas measurements have been carried out in a natural ventilated row house. Some basic concepts are introduced with one and two zone models and the house is modelled with a nine zones model. As intended, the extended model matches the measurements better. However, as demonstrated in the paper, this does not guarantee that the model found actually is better. air flow, air infiltration, tracer gas #NO 9861 Subfloor and house ventilation rates: comparing measured and predicted values. Hartless R P UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 331-342. This paper reports on the use of BRE's domestic ventilation model, BREVENT, to predict subfloor and whole house ventilation rates in a BRE/DoE test house. Before the model could be used though some minor adjustments were necessary because one of its underlying assumptions was that the subfloor temperature was equal to the external temperature. Temperature measurements over a number of months showed this assumption to be false and so an extra stack term was introduced into the model. However, the overall difference this makes is still quite small, only a few percent at most. The predicted subfloor ventilation rate matched the calculated value well, particularly when it was stack dominated. When wind played a significant part though the level of agreement deteriorated, particularly when subfloor air bricks were located on unsheltered walls. However, both the subfloor and whole house ventilation rate of the test house appears to be heavily influenced by the stack effect because the suspended floor and ceiling are leaky in comparison to the walls. As a result, subfloor ventilation will be stack dominated about 61% of the time. To improve the prediction of wind affected subfloor ventilation better pressure coefficient data is required. In a similar vein BREVENT can predict whole house ventilation rates best when the flow is stack dominated. Analysis of the separate stack and wind effects show that the ventilation in the test house will be stack dominated for about 86% of the time. When wind speed does influence ventilation then wind direction also has an effect: winds blowing from the East and West generally give ventilation rates 25% lower than those blowing from the North and South. underfloor crawlspace, ventilation rate, prediction, modelling #NO 9862 Experimental study of crack flow with varying pressure differentials. Sharples S, Thompson D UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 343-351. Existing experimental techniques for calculating air flow through building cracks are usually based upon relationships derived from experimental studies employing relatively simple procedures. Typically, a fixed pressure difference, DELTA P, is established across the crack of interest and then the air flow Q through the crack is determined. Most crack flow equations take the pressure differential DELTA P to be steady-state. In reality, the wind forces which generate much of the driving pressures represent highly fluctuating signals. A basic problem is to know what effect a fluctuating DELTA P has on the overall air flow through building cracks. The basic aim of this study was to determine the impact of these fluctuating pressures on crack flow equations. Experimental techniques generated sinusoidal pressure fluctuations across a range of fabricated, straight-through cracks, ranging from 1 to 5 mm thickness. Fluctuation frequencies from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz were used in the investigations. The results suggest that the average flow under conditions of fluctuating pressure differentials does not differ significantly from the flow which would occur if the mean pressure differential were imposed. This implies that the instantaneous flow at any fluctuating value of the pressure differential is that corresponding to the pressure differential on the steady-state flow-pressure curve. crack, air flow, pressure difference #NO 9863 Ventilation performance evaluation using passively-generated carbon dioxide as a tracer gas. Federspiel C C UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 1, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 355-363. Tracer gases are commonly used to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. One way to reduce the time, complexity, and cost of such experiments is to use the carbon dioxide generated by occupants as a tracer gas. In this paper, a method for using the carbon dioxide generated by occupants as a tracer gas for determining the effective supply air flow rate to a zone or the relative air-change effectiveness of a zone is described. The approach is to make use of a model of the accumulation dynamics and a model of the way that occupants generate carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide accumulation dynamics are modeled as a first-order perfect-mixing process with bypass. The rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide is modeled as an integrated random process. Sudden changes in the rate at which carbon dioxide is generated in a zone that occur when occupants enter and leave are detected using statistical techniques. The detector is used to adjust the gains of an estimator that determines either the effective supply air flow rate or the relative air-change effectiveness and also the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide. This can be done even when the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide changes with time and when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the supply air changes with time. The performance of the strategy is demonstrated with experimental results on a room in a working building. ventilation performance, carbon dioxide, tracer gas #NO 9864 Energy efficiency in office buildings. An energy and system analysis study.

In order to study the use of electricity in Swedish office buildings in detail, the Swedish Council for Building Research initiated four monitoring and building simulation projects in 1989. The project buildings represent different ages and different HVAC technologies. Based on a combination of hourly monitored data during four years, building simulations using the DOE2 program have been carried out. In two of the buildings, energy conservation measures have been implemented too. An interesting aspect in our study is the so called load factor. Load factors for lighting and other electric loads are evaluated. Taking this into account, you can optimize the design of the air flow rates and the cooling systems and reduce the investment and operational costs for the HVAC systems. Thanks to a correct HVAC design you may also reduce the negative impact on the environment by less use of CFCs etc. The studies indicate that the load factor variation in Swedish office buildings, during a day or a week, diverge substantially from the schedules for lighting and office machines etc according to the ASHRAE 90.1-1989 Standard. Regarding office machines etc, the installed power density also diverges to a great extent. energy efficiency, office building, ventilation system #NO 9865 Calculation methods for the determination of air flow rates in dwellings. Cripps A UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 379-389. Ad Hoc Group 4 of Working Group 2 of CEN TC156 (Ventilation) was set up to put forward standardised techniques for estimating ventilation rates in dwellings. The purpose of the standard is to ensure that different people carrying out calculations with the same input data will obtain the same result. This will allow the use of these results in energy, heating load, IAQ or other calculations. The methods proposed use two different techniques, an explicit and an implicit one. The explicit one involves more approximations, but can be carried out with a hand calculator. The implicit one requires the use of a computer. This paper explains the methods used, justifies the approximations made and gives examples of the use of the explicit method. These show that the explicit method gives results in good, but not perfect, agreement with experiment, and also that the method is simple to use. calculation techniques, air flow rate, residential building #NO 9866 Probabilistic analysis of air infiltration in a single family house. Pietrzyk K, Handa K UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 391-399. A Probabilistic model of air change rate in a single family house based on full-scale measurements has been developed. The probability of air change rate exceeding certain prescribed limits (risk of improper ventilation or excessive heat flow) is evaluated by utilising the distribution function based on calculated air flow rate. In this way the results are expressed in terms of the R-S model generally used in the safety analysis of structures. In particular, the probability of excessive and/or insufficient air infiltration can be expressed in terms of safety index BETA to describe the reliability of the building with respect to natural ventilation. The probability density functions for the air change rate have been established for different wind directions. Two methods of reducing the risk of unhygienic conditions have been studied. The first one is based on introducing extra small openings uniformly distributed over the building envelope and providing a fully naturally ventilated system. The second method consists in introducing mechanical exhaust ventilation system coupled with natural ventilation. Probability distributions of air change rates have been analysed for these two cases. residential building, air infiltration, air change rate, openings #NO 9867 System safety analysis on the performance of mechanical ventilation systems. Kronvall J UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 401-409. System safety of the performance of mechanical ventilation systems can of course be analysed by means of general methods for system safety analysis. Such methods are used a lot in industrial practice, especially in manufacturing industry. However applications on ventilation systems are more or less non-existing today. This paper summarises today's methods for system safety analysis and shows possible future ways of applying the methods on performance analyses of mechanical ventilation systems. mechanical ventilation, industrial building #NO 9868 Does the power law rule for low pressure building envelope leakage? Walker I S, Wilson D J, Sherman M H UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 411-421. Although the power law has been broadly accepted in measurement and air infiltration standards, and in many air infiltration calculation methods, the assumption that the power law is true over the range of pressures that a building envelope experiences has not been well documented. In this paper, we examine the validity of the power law through theoretical analysis, laboratory measurements of crack flow and detailed field tests of building envelopes. The results of the theoretical considerations, and field and laboratory measurements indicate that the power law is valid for low pressure building envelope leakage. building envelope, air infiltration  #NO 9869 Improve train tunnels. A dynamical ventilation model. Phaff H J C, de Gids W F UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 423-427. Train tunnels and subways are an interesting field of ventilation. Trains move air through tunnels at rates of 600 m3/s which is much more than flow rates in buildings. Air pressures can vary up to some 3000 Pa leading to air velocities in the range of 10 to 50 m/s. This can lead to unsafe situations and thermal discomfort. The development of high speed trains causes more concern for better tunnel design. Modern stations often house small shops and restaurants, that require lower air velocities for thermal comfort. A dynamical ventilation model has been made to study effects of improvements. An array of controlled fans seems to be a very effective draught remover. The dynamical model is programmed to serve as a demo to give insight in the matter and can be shown in just a couple of minutes from a PC.

Blomsterberg A, Carlsson T, Svensson C UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 429-443. A study of the reliability of systems by considering the ability of different systems to maintain a required air flow rate over time is included in a subtask of IEA Annex 27 "Evaluation and Demonstration of Domestic Ventilation Systems". Measurements and calculations were performed to determine the variation in ventilation rates due to variation in climate and variation in performance of the ventilation system. Dwellings with passive stack, mechanical exhaust and mechanical exhaust-supply ventilation, representative of the Swedish housing stock, were studied. Diagnostic tests were carried out, to discover if the installed ventilation system was functioning as designed and to determine certain values eg characteristics of inlets and outlets. The airtightness was tested. The air flows in mechanical ventilation were measured. The continuous monitoring included measurements in dwellings of overall and local (individual rooms) ventilation rates, and measurements of boundary conditions, during three different monthly periods. The ventilation rates were monitored using tracer gas; passive techniques for monthly averaging and constant concentration for hourly averaging. The measured ventilation rates were simulated using COMIS, a multi-zone air flow network model. The simulated and measured average total outdoor ventilation rates agree reasonably well, while there can be disagreement for hourly rates and individual rooms. This paper presents and discusses the measurements and the calculations and compares the two. multizone modelling, air flow, residential building #NO 9871 Reduction of flow loss due to heat recovery in PSV systems by optimum arrangement of heat-pipe assemblies. Riffat S B, Shao L UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 447-455. Natural ventilation is being applied to an increasing number of new buildings to minimise reliance on mechanical ventilation and so reduce emission of greenhouse gases. However, passive stack ventilation (PSV) systems are currently designed without incorporating heat recovery leading to significant wastage of energy. Heat recovery systems have not been used in naturally-ventilated buildings because the pressure loss caused by a conventional heat exchanger is large compared to the stack pressure and could cause the ventilation system to fail. In addition, the stack pressure decreases owing to reduction of the temperature difference associated with the heat exchange, although this problem can be lessened by appropriate siting of the heat exchanger to maximise the effective stack height. In this study, natural convective flow through PSV stacks were computed using CFD to determine the effect of the layout of heat-pipe assemblies as well as the effects of spacing and length of fins on reduction of flow rate through the stack. Among the layout patterns examined, the arrangement where the assemblies are placed in a pattern of an arrow facing the flow direction produced the least insertion flow loss. The flow loss due to the insertion of the heat pipe assemblies (IFL) was found to increase sharply with the number of fins and reached over 30% when only 4 fins were used. IFL also increased with fin length but the rate of increase reduced for larger fin lengths. Therefore, for a given total surface area of fins, using fins with a larger length causes less flow loss than fins with a smaller spacing. heat recovery, natural ventilation #NO 9872 The effect on ventilation parameters of various ventilation strategies. Simons M W, Waters J R UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 457-466. The work described in this paper is aimed at predicting the local values of the ventilation effectiveness parameters of large industrial buildings by a technique which involves the use of computational fluid dynamics and multizonal modelling. A modelling technique is described and applied to a typical modern industrial building equipped with both, mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The results of modelling each of the above systems are presented and discussed. They provide an interesting insight into magnitude and spatial variations in local air change index that occur in the occupied space. The results also demonstrate how differences in ventilation strategy can result in distinctly different variations of ventilation effectiveness parameters. It is concluded that the modelling technique described may be used to provide important information about the air movement characteristics of buildings in terms of local air change index and also that it could prove to be a very useful design aid. ventilation strategy, prediction, large building, industrial building, modelling #NO 9873 Natural ventilation design for a concert hall.

This paper describes the ventilation analysis undertaken during the design of a new music centre for which it was desired to avoid the use of air conditioning and conventional ducted mechanical ventilation. The main objective was to predict the thermal comfort of occupants in the centre's main auditorium during summertime performances. The analysis was done using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a dynamic thermal model. The CFD results were used to decide the size and location of openings for natural ventilation, which led to the final design having a much better distribution of incoming fresh air than the initial design. The peak fresh air ventilation rate was reduced, but this did not significantly increase the risk of summertime overheating. The dynamic thermal analysis predicted that the time when the temperature would be over 25 degrees C ranged from 0.3 performance hours/year with a dense concrete roof construction and an orchestra of 30 to 3.5 performance hours/year with a lightweight roof and an orchestra of 100. Given that the larger orchestra would not be formal and so could wear lighter clothing, it was concluded that natural ventilation should be a viable strategy for controlling the risk of summertime overheating. However, given uncertainties regarding the usage of the space and UK summertime temperatures in the future, it was recommended that provision was made in the design to enable mechanical cooling to be added at a later date. natural ventilation, building design, auditorium, large building #NO 9874 A technique for controlling air flow through modified Trombe walls. Pitts A C, Craigen S UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 477-485. This paper describes an experimental investigation into the operation of a modified Trombe wall. The construction has been altered to include a layer of insulation material; two alternative positions for this insulation layer have been considered and tested. Air flow from the top of the Trombe wall has also been enhanced by the inclusion of a low power axial flow fan which was controlled to function dependent on measured temperature in the wall cavity. The construction with exposed concrete facing into the air cavity has a slower response than that with exposed insulation facing the cavity. The concrete option also produces higher outlet temperatures, though the fan was found to operate for longer periods with the insulation option. The controller used could be developed for employment in more sophisticated control strategies. air flow, insulation, fan, wall #NO 9875 The efficiency of single-sided and cross ventilation in office spaces. White M, Walker R UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 487-496. This paper reports on work carried out at BRE to address the need for guidance on designing for natural ventilation via single-sided and cross-ventilation in office spaces and the limits of application on terms of plan depth. Present guidance suggests that natural ventilation will be adequate up to 6 m from the ventilating facade. This leads to the conventional design of offices up to 6 m deep on either side of a central corridor, giving as a rule of thumb a width of 15 m for a building with natural cross-ventilation. The present work looks at the opportunities for going beyond these rules of thumb. The implications for thermal comfort and draught risk are also assessed. In the conclusions issues such as, local ventilation rates, ventilating air penetration from a facade, the use of artificial mixing (eg ceiling fans) on hot days, the position of windows, and means of enhancing internal air speeds and air change rates are discussed. cross ventilation, building design #NO 9876 The evolution of ventilation in manufactured housing in the Northwestern United States. Stevens D, Lubliner M, Davis B UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 497-509. Electric utilities in the Pacific Northwest have spent over $100 million to support energy efficiency improvements in the HUD-code manufactured housing industry in the Pacific Northwest over the past several years. Over 65,000 manufactured housing units have been built since 1991 that exceed the new HUD standards for both thermal performance and mechanical ventilation that became effective in October, 1994. All of these units included mechanical ventilation systems that were designed to meet or exceed the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62-1989. This paper addresses the ventilation solutions that were developed and compares the comfort and energy considerations of the various strategies that have evolved in the Pacific Northwest and nationally. The use and location of a variety of outside air inlets will be addressed, as will the acceptance by the occupants of the ventilation strategy. mobile home, ventilation system, energy efficiency #NO 9877 Evaluation of ventilation system in very low energy houses. Pittomvils J, Hens H, van Bael F UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 513-520. Since 1985 more than 170 very low energy houses, all of the same type and structure, were built in the Flemish Region, Belgium. Because conduction losses are very low, ventilation losses become very important, up to 45% of the heat losses if no heat recovery is utilised. Three of the houses were monitored in detail for energy consumption, energy and ventilation efficiency. All houses are equipped with the same ventilation system: balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Tracer gas measurements, pressurisation tests, multipoint temperature measurements and on site and laboratory tests of the heat recovery system, give us a complete scope of the ventilation system and its energy and ventilation efficiency. Pressurisation and depressurisation tests revealed the main air leaks in the construction: the different connections wall-floor and wall-roof, the window perimeter, even the sockets. Extra care in construction practice changed the n50-value from an average of 4.5 AC/h to 3.5AC/h, still high for a house with controlled ventilation. After testing the airtightness, we carried out tracer gas measurements in whole dwellings and between the different zones. Real ventilation rates and interzonal flows were derived. Questions like: Are the airflows in accordance with the design values? Do they match the requirements? How can we measure interzonal flows with one tracer? were answered. The paper gives a mathematical description of the tracer gas flow patterns (solution of the differential flow equations) and compares the results with the measured data. To complete the evaluation we carried out laboratory tests and field measurements on the heat recovery system. In laboratory the flat plate cross-flow heat exchanger showed a thermal efficiency up to 65% under specific climate conditions. In the dwellings, insulation and airtightness of the ducts appeared to be very important. The temperature efficiency decreased to values less than 45%. As a conclusion, one may stress that a global evaluation of the ventilation efficiency has to include different tests. The medium or poor airtightness has the greatest impact on the energy efficiency of heat recovery and on the ability to control the system. Detailed testing also showed some flaws in the ventilation system and in the building construction. low energy house, ventilation system, mechanical ventilation, heat recovery #NO 9878 A technique to improve the performance of displacement ventilation during cold climate conditions. Hansson P, Stymne H UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 521-528. Ventilation by displacement is a type of ventilation where the air flow is thermally driven. By this arrangement one obtains two zones in the room - a lower zone with supply air conditions and an upper recirculation zone with extract air conditions. Cold climate causes downdraught from windows and external walls and results in a mixing of air from the upper into the lower zone. To avoid this problem during cold climate a new principle for ventilation by displacement is tested. Excess heat from the upper zone of the room is used for heating cold surfaces. The principle involves creation of a narrow space in front of the exterior wall, separating the cold wall from direct contact with room air. Extract air from the ceiling level is forced down through this space by an extraction fan. This method can advantageously by applied in large buildings where an external wall mainly consists of glass panes. In this case it might be appropriate to utilise the space between the inner couple of glasses for extract air. Tracer gas and temperature measurements were carried out in a test-room. The result shows that the ventilation efficiency improves when using the new principle. The thermal climate also improves due to less down-draught and higher surface temperatures. displacement ventilation, cold climate #NO 9879 Evaluation of a controlled natural ventilation system. Carlsson T UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 529-538. The project described in this paper has performed simulations using a multi-zone air flow model (4(COMIS)) of three different passive stack ventilation systems. The objective of the simulation calculations was to evaluate system performances and to make suggestions for possible improvements of the systems. passive stack ventilation, natural ventilation, air leakage #NO 9880 The development of an occupancy-controlled exhaust air ventilation system. Levin P UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 539-547. Many dwellings with natural or gravity ventilation systems suffer from poor airchange rates. In Sweden, especially houses built in the 1960-ies and 1970-ies heated with electric resistance heating and thus without chimneys, are at risk. Improving the airchange rate in these houses is to some extent performed to decrease Radon gas concentrations where appropriate. For comfort, most homeowners learn to live with low airchange rates, accepting eg odours or window condensation and trying to compensate this with increased airing. They are often reluctant to install mechanical ventilation systems. This paper describes a new concept for an occupancy-controlled exhaust air ventilation system. The system features bedroom night-time ventilation, wet-room day-time ventilation and variable total air flow at a low installation cost. The system has since autumn 1994 been successfully installed in four houses and evaluated by air flow measurements, tracer gas tests, multizone airchange calculations etc. The homeowners are very pleased with the performance of the systems and the improved airchange rates. exhaust, ventilation system, occupant behaviour #NO 9881 Air dehumidification by absorption. (A model for numerical calculation) Steimle F, Reckzuegel M, Roeben J UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 9-559. Especially in modern buildings with small capacity of humidity storage it is necessary to reduce the humidity in the supply air. Normally this was done by using a refrigeration system mostly with CFC's. There are some alternative fluids available, but mostly they show a high global warming potential. All these systems need electrical energy to be driven and therefore it is necessary to consider other possibilities with alternative systems. The most promising systems are sorptive systems that are used now in open cycles. In these systems the air is dehumidified by a liquid sorbent and cooled indirectly by evaporating water in an open circuit. In order to calculate the process of absorption on several conditions, computer based calculations are required. A model that describes the dehumidification process is introduced. dehumidification, numerical modelling #NO 9882 A control system that prevents air from entering an air-handling unit through the exhaust air. Seem J E, House J M UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 561-569. Traditional air-handling unit (AHU) control systems link the position of the exhaust air damper, recirculation air damper, and outdoor air damper. Tests at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on a variable-air-volume (VAV) AHU have shown that air can enter the AHU through the exhaust air damper. This can negatively impact indoor air quality if the exhaust air duct is located near a pollution source. This paper presents a new control system for variable air volume AHU's that use volume matching to control the return fan. The new control system links only the position of the exhaust air damper and recirculation air damper. During occupied times, the outdoor air damper is in the fully open position. Simulation and laboratory results are presented to compare the new control system and a traditional control system. Several cases are simulated to examine the effect of damper sizing and system load on airflow in AHU's. The simulations demonstrate that the new control system can prevent air from entering the AHU through the exhaust air damper for conditions that the traditional control system cannot. A case demonstrating the limits of the new control system to prevent this phenomenon is included in the simulation results. The laboratory results provide further evidence that the new control system prevents air from entering the AHU through the exhaust air damper for conditions that cause the phenomenon with the traditional control system. air intake, indoor air quality, outdoor air #NO 9883 The effects of building form on the natural ventilation of commercial buildings. Alexander D K, Jenkins H G, Jones P J UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 571-578. Wind pressures can significantly affect ventilation performance. However often they are overlooked in the design of a naturally ventilated building, with buoyancy forces presumed to offer the worst case scenario for design. The result is that airflow patterns and the ventilation performance of the building is often different from the design intent. Successful natural ventilation design requires careful consideration of the building form, and so must involve the architect at the early stages of fabric development. Whilst devices and features may be used to enhance the performance of ventilation outlets, the wind flows at inlets are more likely to be affected by the form of the building, and less amenable to improvement by small devices. Performance may be improved by larger features that in effect become part of the building form itself. Therefore the designer requires a greater awareness of the effect of wind on natural ventilation. They may require access to targeted design information and design tools that are as yet generally unavailable. building design, natural ventilation, commercial building, wind pressure #NO 9884 Novel methods of inducing air flows within buildings. Campbell D P, Webb R S UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 579-587. Water use is distributed throughout building structures. Energy used to pump the water to higher levels in the building is not currently recovered, and is dissipated by performing work on air in the ventilation system which is vented to the atmosphere, when the water is discharged into the drainage stack. This energy can be utilised productively, however, by strategically placing the air inlet for the drainage stack inside the building, thereby utilising the potential energy stored in the water to draw air through the building. Airflow induction by falling water films is a well known problem in the drainage industry, and airflow rates of 10-20 times the water flow rate are common. Basic analysis of the ventilation requirements for typical large buildings suggest that this may contribute between 1 and 7.5% of the total ventilation requirement. Air admittance valves would be effective at isolating the habitable space from the waste water. air flow #NO 9885 Summer cooling for office-type buildings by night ventilation. Kolokotroni M, Webb B C, Hayes S D UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 591-599. The suitability of night ventilation for cooling for the UK is first assessed by presenting plots of summer weather data on the bioclimatic chart for three locations within the country. These indicate that most of the external weather conditions lie within the thermal mass and ventilation effectiveness areas of the charts. To confirm this, thermal simulations of a typical office module under a variety of internal conditions and summer weather data were performed. Predictions have shown that internal temperatures can be maintained below the external values for solar and internal gains of up to about 50W/m2. Field measurements in a refurbished natural ventilated office have confirmed that temperatures in night ventilated spaces are generally lower during the following day, especially during the early hours of the working day. Finally, the development of a pre-design tool in the context of IEA Annex 28 on 'Low Energy Cooling Systems' is discussed. The main aim of the tool is to increase the awareness of designers for the energy benefits and the range of parameters for the application of night ventilation as the first means of cooling so that the need for artificial cooling is minimised or avoided altogether. cooling, ventilation system, thermal mass #NO 9886 Natural ventilation studies within the frame of PASCOOL project. Santamouris M, Dascalaki E, Allard F UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 601-609. Natural ventilation studies were carried out within the frame of PASCOOL EC Research Project. Research on this topic included experimental and modelling work aiming to fill the existing gaps in our knowledge of indoor air conditions in naturally ventilated buildings. Experiments were carried out in full scale and test cell facilities during the summer period. Single sided and cross ventilation as well as air flow through large internal openings were the basic topics that were studied. Existing models were validated and new ones were developed. A new computational tool for ventilation prediction was developed, based on the airflow network modeling. An intermediate approach, between network and CFD was proposed to take into account the impact of non-homogeneity on the indoor air motion. natural ventilation, passive cooling #NO 9887 Wind towers - old technology to solve a new problem. Harris D J, Webb R S UK, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, (AIVC), 1996, proceedings of 17th AIVC Conference, "Optimum Ventilation and Air Flow Control in Buildings", Volume 2, held 17-20 September 1996, Gothenburg, Sweden, pp 613-621. Wind towers (scoops situated on the roofs of buildings to catch the wind) have been in use for centuries in the Middle east and Pakistan, to provide ventilation and cooling with minimal mechanical plant. In Europe, the problem of cooling buildings has generally not been significant, but in recent years there has been a trend towards substantial increases in internal heat gains from IT equipment etc and overheating in summer has become one of our major concerns. This has been dealt with by the use of air conditioning, but in many instances this could be avoided by making better use of natural ventilation through wind towers. This paper reviews the use of wind towers for cooling spaces, and reports on work currently being carried out, using wind tunnel tests on scale models, to examine the adaptation of these principles for use in modern office buildings, in order to avoid expensive air conditioning. wind effects, ventilation system, cooling, wind tunnel tests More abstracts WT01-B07-66IA068-000417-B013-238http://www.aivc.org:80/ra74_3.html 194.217.120.80 19970113034500 text/html 56358HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 03:43:57 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 56185Last-modified: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 16:02:32 GMTMore abstracts Tracer Gas Methods #NO 9888 Determination of air change rates - use of tracers. Barat M, Douchez M France, CETIAT - Orsay, [1996], 49pp. One of the main aspects determining the thermal behaviour of buildings concerns the distribution and circulation of air. Experimentation was undertaken in the context of the investigation of a method of measurement of the natural ventilation of large rooms. The first objective was to endeavour to characterise the atmospheric conditions around the building, namely, conditions related to wind factors, but also those concerned with the location of the building in relation to neighbouring obstacles (other buildings, relief of the ground, etc). The relationship between the concentration of a tracer and the ventilation system was then studied, using various hypotheses. The aim of the experimentation was to define a method, based on selection of tracer, homogenisation of the atmosphere and representativeness of measurements. The research resulted in the determination of a practical method. air change rate, tracer gas, large building #NO 9889 Estimation variations in overall air change rate in dwellings by combining PFT measurements with the LBL method. Somogyi Z, Ducarme D, Wouters P Japan, Roomvent '96, 5th International Conference on Air Distribution in Rooms, supplement, pp 1-11, 5 figs, 3 refs. Knowledge on the variation of the air change rate in dwelling as a function of time can be useful information. The most straightforward approach is the use of active tracer gas techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are heavy and quite expensive. An alternative approach has been developed by combining results obtained by passive ventilation methods (PFT technique) with the approach used in the LBL method. The LBL method, developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, allows to estimate for single zone buildings the air change rate as a function of wind speed and temperature difference. Input parameters are some basic information on the leakage distribution, the height of the building, wind shielding etc. The method presented in this paper makes used of the outcome of the passive tracer gas method (which is an approximation of the average air change rate during the measurement period) and the following information on the building: relative proportion of leakage in floor and ceiling, height of the building and shielding data. NO information on the building airtightness (e.g. n50) value is needed. The approach has been applied on the PLEIADE dwelling, which is a low energy dwelling in the neighbourhood of Brussels. The results are promising. An additional advantage of the method is that it allows to correct for the averaging error of the PFT method which is unavoidable (the average air change rate is not the inverse of the average concentrations of the tracer gas). Ventilation rate, passive tracer gas technique, LBL method #NO 9890 A new tracer gas testing technique: theory and numerical simulations. Balcomb J D, Martin C J, Littler J UK, Building Serv Eng Res Technol, Vol 17, No 3, 1996, pp 101-107, 9 figs, 2 tabs, 8 refs. A new technique is presented for measuring air exchange rates and contaminant transfer dynamics in buildings. The method uses pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) to control tracer gas injection. Cross-correlation of the injection sequence with the tracer concentrations measured in multiple rooms is used to deduce system responses. Air flow rates in multiple room buildings can be measured simultaneously using a single tracer. Both dynamic air change rates and static flow rates can be determined, and bad mixing can be diagnosed and quantified. Traditional techniques for tracer gas testing are reviewed followed by a derivation of the new method. Numerical simulation trials of the technique are described, the first for a simple one room configuration, the second for the same situation with experimental noise added, and the third for a three room building. The results obtained by cross-correlation agree with the known impulse responses and air change rates providing a first proof of concept for the method. A subsequent paper will describe validation of the method in a multiroom test chamber. tracer gas, measurement technique, air change rate, mixing Pressure Tests of Leakage of Components #NO 9891 Air leakage performance of 11 log houses in eastern Ontario and western Quebec. Duncan R Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, May 1996, 23pp. This report contains the results of air tightness testing of 11 log homes of various construction details, sizes and ages in the region of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec. Two other air tightness studies one from Idaho 1993 and the other Minnesota 1990 agreed that it was possible to air seal a log home to a minimum standard, that the quality of the assembly appeared to play a role, air infiltration was a bigger problem than air leakage, lateral joints were not always the major air leakage areas but rather, corner, window/door assemblies and log to framing connections. Although the small sample prevents drawing scientific conclusions, the report indicated the following: Sealing (chinking) the exposed face of the log joints increased air tightness about an order of magnitude compared to a double line of caulking between logs. The same was generally true for air sealing joints at window and door openings. It should be noted that the test method may have had some influence on this finding as it was not possible to place the test box tight against the internal air seals. The air tightness of round V-scribe and hand hewn log construction was tighter than expected indicating that craftsmanship is a factor in developing air tightness. Tightening down gasketed walls with through bolts can maintain air tightness as shrinkage occurs. Various techniques for accommodating settlement appear to be working well. air leakage, sealing #NO 9892 Air infiltration from basements and sub-floors to the living space. McGrath P T, McManus J UK, Building Serv Eng Res Technol, Vol 17, No 2, 1996, pp 85-87, 2 tbs, 13 refs. This paper reports the results of an investigation into air flow from basements and sub-floors into the living space and shows that air infiltration from these areas makes a significant contribution to the whole house air infiltration rate. Experimental work in two typical test sites, using tracer gas techniques confirmed that contaminated soil gases may be transported into the living space by air from basements and sub-floors. The poor condition of most basements exacerbated the difficulty of practical methods of measuring airflow through basement ceilings. basement, air leakage, soil gas #NO 9893 Basic tips for duct design. Evans R A, Tsal R J USA, Ashrae Journal, July 1996, pp 37-42, 5 figs, refs. This article is centred on the performance, economics and modeling of duct systems. Specific subjects examined include duct shape, fitting performance, leakage and appropriate oversizing. Computer modeling is discussed to provide a better grasp as to how it can be used as a practical design tool. duct, air leakage Surface Pressures on Buildings #NO 9894 Natural ventilation of a high rise building with a twin face facade. Ziller C, Sedlacek G, Ruscheweyh H, Oesterle E, Lieb R D Germany, Ki Luft- und Kaeltetechnik, No 8, 1996, pp 343-346, 8 figs, 15 refs. Twin-facade systems represent an excellent attempt to fulfil energy conservation and emission reduction requirements. Using twin face facades makes it possible to ventilate rooms in high rise buildings which are more exposed to wind loads with ordinary windows, and reduce the need for air conditioning. The article describes the planned twin face system of one of the buildings at the Daimler Benz Project at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. In model tests the ventilation rate of the facade was investigated by simulating the thermal forces governing the phenomenon of natural ventilation. Ventilation rates for different flap configurations of the outer facade and different window openings are given. The investigations show that natural ventilation can be achieved even in cases of extreme wind or high solarisation. By considering the average temperature and wind data it can be demonstrated that the operation of the air conditioning plant can be reduced to a few weeks per year, with a matching reduction in energy consumption. high rise building, natural ventilation, wind effects, ventilation rate Theoretical Models #NO 9895 Final Report Annex 23: multi zone ventilation models. Participation of TNO Bouw. Examples. Phaff J C Netherlands, TNO Building and Construction Research, July 1996, 65pp. This report is an overview of examples for COMVEN by TNO Bouw within the framework of Annex 23, Multi zone Air Flow Models. It concludes the work in the extension ANNEX 23 1994-1996 and is the final report for the participation of TNO Bouw. TNO has worked continuously on improvements and further extensions of the operational computer program COMVEN. This program is a simulation program for ventilation of buildings. COMVEN is the central "engine" group of programs called COMIS. The most important other programs in this group are COMERL (CH) and IISIBAT (Fr). This report contains a series of examples. Each shows certain aspect of building ventilation and how that can be modelled in COMVEN> The examples are intended to be used by persons that work with COMVEN or the developers of the programs within COMIS. Knowledge on how to use and create the COMIS.CIF file is assumed. multizone modelling #NO 9896 Prediction of air temperature distribution in buildings with a zonal model. Inard C, Bouia H, Dalicieux P Energy and Buildings, No 24, 1996, pp 125-132, 10 figs, 3 tabs, 17 refs. This study presents a zonal model used for predicting the air temperature distribution inside a room. This model is original in the calculation of mass air flows between two zones. To do so, we distinguish zones where the momentum is small and for which we calculate the flow rates with aid of a pressure field, and the driving zones described using appropriate specific flow laws. A comparison between experimental results and those obtained with the model proves that they are fully consistent with each other. This allows us to consider the integration of this type of model into a general building thermal code. temperature, modelling #NO 9897 Air flow near an unflanged rectangular exhaust opening. Kulmala I, Saarenrinne P Energy and Buildings, No 24, 1996, pp 133-136, 3 figs, 14 refs. Turbulent air flow fields for an unflanged rectangular opening were calculated numerically using the standard k-e turbulence model. The accuracy of the calculations was verified by experimental laser Doppler anemometer velocity measurements and by comparison with previous empirical centre-line velocity equations. The results show that the air flow into an unobstructed exhaust hood can be predicted quite accurately provided that the calculation grid and the calculation domain are properly chosen. openings, air flow, modelling, measurement technique #NO 9898 On the combination of air velocity and flow measurements in single sided natural ventilation configurations. Dascalaki E, Santamouris M, Argiriou A, Helmis C, Asimakopoulos D N, Papadopoulos K, Soilemes A Energy and Buildings, No 24, 1996, pp 155-165, 12 figs, 6 tabs, 12 refs. Single sided natural ventilation configurations are very frequent especially in building in urban environments. Four single sided ventilation experiments were carried out in a full scale outdoor Test Cell facility. Air velocity measurements were taken at various heights in the middle of the opening. The average air flow rate through the opening was derived by using the tracer gas decay technique. This work presents the results of an investigation into the relationship between the air velocity at the opening and the bulk air flow rate measurements. The paper presents description of the experimental set-up as well as a qualitative discussion of the results. air flow, natural ventilation, tracer gas #NO 9899 Experimental evaluation of the velocity fields for local exhaust hoods with circular and rectangular openings. Cascetta F Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 5, 1996, pp 437-449, 12 figs, 36 refs. A detailed experimental evaluation of the velocity fields induced in the proximity of local exhaust hoods with circular and rectangular (right quadrilateral) openings is presented. It contains a comprehensive description of the purpose-built test facility, of the measurement instrumentation adopted, and of the experimental procedure in use. Results show that, for a given opening shape, the velocity fields are quite different for flanged or plain hood opening. Fluid-dynamic asymmetries, probably caused by possible instability phenomena (fluid stream attachment) and by the influence of external supports or objects, are also observed. exhaust hood, openings, measurement technique #NO 9900 Velocity fields in proximity of local exhaust hood openings: an intercomparison between current recommended formulas and experimental studies. Cascetta F, Bellia L Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 5, 1996, pp 451-459, 12 figs, 5 tabs, 28 refs. This article is the second part of an earlier paper which illustrated the test facility in use, the measurement procedure, and fully described the velocity fields in front of hood openings. A comparison between the main current formulas available in the literature, and the experimental results collected by the authors, is introduced and discussed. The predicted centerline velocities inferred from the recommended formulas are compared with the ones experimentally measured by the authors, for both plain and flanged free standing circular and rectangular exhaust openings. The velocity field outside the axis of the exhaust hood is also presented. It was experimentally determined and is expressed in terms of velocity contours. exhaust hood, openings, air flow #NO 9901 The Helsinki office environment study: air change in mechanically ventilated buildings. Teijonsalo J, Jaakkola J J K, Seppanen O Indoor Air, No 6, 1996, pp 111-117, 5 figs, 3 tabs, refs. The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and balance of mechanical ventilation in the rooms of Helsinki metropolitan office building with different types of ventilation systems. A random sample of 50 office buildings was selected from the Building Registry. Of these buildings, the 33 that have a mechanical ventilation system were included this study. Most office buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area have a ducted supply and exhaust system and hot water radiator heating. Air recirculation is used in about half of the buildings which have a mechanical supply and exhaust system. The average exhaust air=flow was 1.2L/s,m square (SD 0.73) or 17.2l/s per person (SD 11.6) The variation of the airflows was found to be very high among the buildings, and among the rooms within the buildings. Therefore, even though the ventilation rates on average comply with the Finnish building code, it was found that many people were working in offices with airflows which were either too low or unnecessarily high. office building, air change rate, mechanical ventilation #NO 9902 Turbulent jets in confined spaces: application in mixing ventilation. Experimental and numerical studies. Karimipanah T Sweden, Royal Institute of Technology, Centre for Built Environment, 1996. The objective of the study was to give a basis for modifying the existing design and testing method used to predict the velocities in the occupied zone during the design process. Two methodological systems of experiment and numerical simulation were been used. The numerical predictions are used in comparison with the measurements. A large amount of data was obtained for a test room whose dimensions were systematically varied. mixing ventilation, numerical modelling #NO 9903 A study of general ventilation and local exhaust ventilation in industrial premises using residence time distribution theory. Olander L, Dessagne J M, Bonthoux F, Leclerc J P Environmental Progress, Vol 14, No 3, August 1995, pp 159-163, 6 figs, 2 tabs, 14 refs. Several tools enable a more or less detailed description of the general ventilation and the local exhaust ventilation in industrial premises. An intermediate approach between predictive numerical simulation and experimental determination of classical aerodynamic parameters may be based on the Residence Time Distribution theory commonly used in chemical engineering. This paper deals with results for configurations composed of a cabin with a general ventilation system (one air inlet and one air outlet ensuring a high air removal rate) and a local exhaust ventilation (one air outlet above the working area). A model is built up from a combination of elementary volumes representing the ideal flow regions such as plug flow, perfectly mixed cell and perfect mixing cell in series. The fitting of the model is carried out by comparing the model response and the experimental response of tracer gas impulse injected in the room inlet. A satisfactory description of the air flow pattern has been found for the local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. This approach seems to be promising enough to encourage further investigations. industrial building, exhaust, ventilation system #NO 9904 Analysis of a three dimensional ventilation flow: experimental validation on a water scale model of numerical simulations. Fontaine J R, Biolley F, Rapp R, Serieys J C, Cunin J C Numerical Heat Transfer, Part A: No 26, 1994, pp 431-451, 11 figs, 17 refs. Laboratory an numerical experiments were conducted in order to study the flow within an isothermal parallelepipdic test room. The air is injected through a complex diffuser (made of 84 nozzles) near the ceiling and is evacuated through a rectangular exit just below the inlet. Measurements were performed on a hydraulic model at one sixth scale. The parameters were determined according to a Reynolds similitude. Both laser Doppler anemometry and flow visualization were used. Numerical simulations were carried out using the EOL-3D software developed at the Institute National de Recherche et de Securite. A comparison between experimental results and numerical predictions is presented. numerical modelling, air flow #NO 9905 General strategies and a calculation method for cold down draught prevention in a large glazed enclosure. Tjelflaat P O Japan, Roomvent '96, 5th International Conference on Air Distribution in Rooms, held 17-19 July, 1996, supplement, pp 21-30, 2 figs, 2 tabs, refs. Natural convection from windows occur at winter conditions. Down-draft is especially experienced to cause thermal discomfort near the high window facades used in large enclosures, like atria. In the present work, strategies and methods for down-draft prevention are reviewed and discussed. Further, a special strategy ,and a calculation method are applied for design for a 25.5 m high glazed facade exposed to an outdoor temperature of -22 degrees C. Extended window crossbars and a heated vertical air flow, issuing from a slot, are used in the design solution. calculation techniques, draughts, window, large building #NO 9906 Air flow patterns in a large industrial hall with displacement ventilation. Niemela R, Koskela H Japan, Roomvent '96, 5th International Conference on Air Distribution in Rooms, held 17-19 July, 1996, supplement, pp 363-370, 4 figs, refs. Air flow patterns and indoor climate were explored in a production hall, where containers and furnaces for paper and pulp industry and chemical industry were fabricated. Welding fumes and other particulates generated by welding and related processes were aimed to control by the displacement ventilation. The supply air was introduced through seven low impulse diffusers mounted on the floor level against one long wall. The air was exhausted by two roof fans. The supply air distribution was characterized with tracer gas measurements using a step-down procedure. However, the homogeneous initial concentration was not reached due to notable infiltration flows. Concentration of sulphur hexafluoride which served as a tracer was measured with two photoacoustic analyzers connected to multi-point sampling units. In addition, contaminant concentrations and thermal parameters were monitored at several sites in the hall. The local age values measured at different points in the occupied zone and at different heights indicated that the displacement flow behaviour was achieved. This observation was supported by vertical temperature distribution.. There were problems, however, in achieving the displacement flow patterns in the morning when the ambient air in the hall was slightly cooler than the supply air. industrial building, displacement ventilation #NO 9907 Finding the right mix. Bunn R Building Services, August 1996, pp 43-44, 4 figs. Describes the Building Research and Information Association's latest research into chilled ceilings and displacement ventilation which has centred on the effect of different chilled ceiling devices on air movement patterns in the occupied zone. Asks whether chilled beams maintain the displacement effect, or whether they create a mixing system. displacement ventilation, air movement, mixing #NO 9908 Application of computational fluid dynamics in building services engineering. Chow W K Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 5, 1996, pp 425-436, 12 figs, 36 refs. Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics to building services design is illustrated and reviewed. Principal areas of application are designs requiring an understanding of the air flow pattern, such as design of smoke control systems and air distribution in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. In such an approach, the indoor air motion is described by a set of partial differential equations describing conservation of mass, momentum, enthalpy and chemical species concentration, if any. The air flow pattern, temperature contour, and chemical species concentration distribution induced by thermal sources are predicted by solving that system of equations using the finite difference method. Assessment of the longitudinal ventilation in a tunnel, smoke filling in an atrium, and the interaction between the air flow induced by a fire and a sprinkler water spray are illustrated in the area of fire engineering. Simulation of the combustion process is briefly reviewed. Calculation of the macroscopic flow parameters in an air conditioned gymnasium and an office is demonstrated. computational fluid dynamics, smoke control, atrium Reduction of Heat Losses #NO 9909 Overall retrofit of Swiss apartment blocks. Caddet Netherlands, CADDET, Result 248, 1996, 4pp. In the near future a large number of dwellings in Switzerland dating from the 50s to the 70s will need to be retrofitted in order to upgrade the comfort levels to today's standards and to reduce the energy consumption. By carrying out an overall retrofit of both the envelope of the building and the building services this can be successfully accomplished. Two retrofit projects of apartment blocks, one in Meilen and one is Cossau, demonstrate how a well balanced strategy can achieve a comprehensive and economical retrofit. These projects feature standard retrofit measures recommended in a study carried out by an energy consultant. retrofitting, apartment building, building envelope #NO 9910 Energy conservation and retrofitting potential in Hellenic hotels. Santamouris M, Balaras C A, Dascalaki E, Argiriou A, Gaglia A Energy and Buildings, No 24, 1996, pp 65-75, 4 figs, 16 refs. Energy consumption data from 158 Hellenic hotels and estimated energy savings that result from the use of practical retrofitting techniques, material and new energy efficient systems are presented. The data were collected during an extensive energy audit of buildings that was carried out in Hellas, with the frame of a National Energy Programme sponsored by the CECVALOREN Programme, for energy conservation in buildings. During this short monitoring campaign and on-site visits of a trained panel of engineers to each building, all information related to the building's construction, heating, cooling and lighting systems, and all other mechanical and electrical systems, was collected. The main results and energy characteristics of cooling, heating and lighting on energy consumption and performance are discussed. The annual average total energy consumption in hotels is 273kWh/m squared, one of the highest amount all categories of buildings. Several scenarios for possible interventions to the buildings' outer envelope, heating, cooling and lighting systems are proposed and evaluated, in order to asses the effectiveness of various energy conservation techniques. Based on the results from several simulations, it is concluded that it is possible to reach an overall 20% energy conservation. retrofitting, hotel, field monitoring Energy and Buildings #NO 9911 Energy efficiency technology impact - appliances. Volume I. Thermal Engineering Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, July 1996, 72pp. In this project the effect of appliance efficiency on the overall residential end-use energy consumption and subsequent atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide in Canada is studied based on simulation studies conducted on the Expanded STAR database using the ENERPASS building simulation program. In addition, the effect of fuel substitution for space and domestic hot water heating on residential end-use energy consumption and atmospheric emissions is also evaluated. To conduct this study, first the CMHC STAR database was reviewed, modified and expanded to develop the Expanded STAR database. The new database exists in three formats which can be used with different building energy simulation programs and is considered acceptably representative of the Canadian housing stock at the national level, though not so at a regional level. As such, it is a valuable tool to study the impact of almost every energy conservation and electrical demand reduction option on the residential end-use energy consumption in Canada. The findings of this study clearly indicate that improving appliance efficiency reduces the overall end-use energy consumption in the residential sector as well as the associated carbon dioxide emissions. However, the magnitude of the savings as a result of improving only appliance efficiencies is quite small, in the 1-2 percent range. Significantly larger savings, in the order of 5-10 percent, can be obtained by improving house envelopes and heating/cooling systems in addition to improving appliance efficiencies. The effect of fuel substitution on residential energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions was also studied, and the results indicate that depending on the fuel substitution scenario adopted, there can be a significant potential to reduce residential end-use energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The Expanded STAR database and the methodology developed here can be used to easily predict the effect of fuel substitution scenarios. energy efficiency, domestic appliance #NO 9912 Energy efficiency technology impact - appliances.

Mathews E H, van Wyk S L Energy and Buildings, No 24, 1996, pp 117-123, 11 figs, 3 tabs, 16 refs. A large percentage of South Africa's population is at present in low-cost dwellings. Furthermore, more than 2 million new houses must be built over the next 10 years to alleviate the current housing shortage. Unfortunately the existing houses are very energy inefficient and if nothing is done now, the new houses will surely also be inefficient. It would have a tremendous impact on the inhabitants' disposable income, health as well as their environment if these low-cost houses could be made energy efficient. This prompted the authors to investigate retrofit options to improve energy efficiency of existing houses and to evaluate energy efficiency design concepts for new houses. The energy efficiency of the improvements was evaluated by means of computer simulations. Ceiling insulation was found to be the best retrofit for the typical formal low-cost house. By retrofitting existing formal low-cost houses with insulation integrated ceiling the Gauteng region could save $12 million in electricity costs per year and around $0.79 billion in peak demand electricity supply. If the proposed new houses are supplied with insulation integrated ceiling the Gauteng region could save approximately $2 million in electricity costs per year and $224 million in peak demand electricity supply. low income housing, energy efficiency, building design Pollution, Air Quality and Indoor Climate #NO 9917 Indices de qualite de l'air. Indices of air quality. Creuzevault D France, "Ventilation et Renouvellement d'Air", proceedings of a conference held Sophia Antipolis, 20-21 October 1993, pp 23-33. An underestimation of ventilation losses leads to an increase in health risks on the one hand, and to building degradation on the other. In contrast, an overestimation causes energy losses. This article presents four indicators of air quality, developed by three French and one Danish team. They are divided into those based on health criteria and those based on comfort considerations. indoor air quality, ventilation rate #NO 9918 Activated natural ventilation.

Godish T, Spengler J D Indoor Air, No 6, 1996, pp 135-145, 3 figs, refs. Adjustment of ventilation rates in buildings is widely practiced, both to provide good air quality on a proactive basis and to mitigate air quality problems associated with occupant complaints. However, both cross-sectional and experimental epidemiological studies have reported mixed results and have for the most part failed to establish definitive relationships between ventilation rates and symptom prevalence or dissatisfaction with air quality. The difficulties involved in establishing such relationships may be due to a variety of confounding factors which include limitations in study design and interaction effects; difficulties in controlling ventilation rates in experimental studies; inadequate mixing of supply air in occupied spaces; high source strengths for some contaminants; dynamic interaction between sources and ventilation rates that result in increased contaminant emissions; contaminant dose-response sensory effects which are log-linear; potential contaminant generation within ventilation systems themselves; and multifactorial genesis of sick building symptoms. There is limited evidence to suggest that ventilation rate increases up to 10 L/s person may be effective in reducing symptom prevalence and occupant dissatisfaction with air quality and that higher ventilation rates are not effective. Because of complex relationships between ventilation rates, contaminant levels, and building-related health complaints/dissatisfaction with air quality, the use of ventilation as a mitigation measure for air quality problems should be tempered with an understanding of factors which may limit its effectiveness. minimum ventilation rate, indoor air quality #NO 9921 Inadequate ventilation leads to office building complaints. Anon USA, Indoor Air Quality Update, September 1996, pp 11-13. Describes a case study involving an occupational health clinic in the southeastern US, where the administrator requested the help of IAQ investigators to respond to employee concerns about the adequacy of the ventilation system and potential contaminant concentrations. The investigators found what they considered to be inadequate ventilation, leading to excessive carbon dioxide levels, and uncovered several other problems with the building's HVAC configuration. office building, sick building syndrome, ventilation rate #NO 9922 Dispersion of automotive alternative fuel vapours within a residence and its attached garage. Lansari A, Streicher J J, Huber A G, et al Indoor Air, No 6, 1996, pp 118-126, 7 figs, refs. A study was undertaken to investigate the use of mass balance modelling techniques to predict air pollution concentrations in residential settings where the source is evaporative emissions of alternative fuels emitted in the attached garage. Known quantities of methanol were allowed to evaporate in the garage, then measured and simulated using a multizonal mass balance model (CONTAM88). The study found that evaporative emissions in an attached garage have a tendency to infiltrate the house, with rooms adjacent to the garage showing the highest levels of methanol concentrations. Thus automotive evaporative emissions may represent a source of indoor pollution and human exposure in a residential attached garage and also in other critical locations of the residence. organic compound, pollutant, garage, motor vehicle, modelling #NO 9923 Building materials for the environmentally hypersensitive. van Vliet J, et al Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 1995, 238pp. Building Materials for the Environmentally Hypersensitive was prepared to help individuals and builders select building materials that have minimal negative effects on the health of environmentally hypersensitive occupants. The materials included are those typically used in residential construction in cold climates. Two kinds of information were used in evaluating the materials: 1) known or published information about the products; and 2) the experiences of hypersensitive individuals with these material. The responses of hypersensitive individuals to the building materials were used as an indicator of how these material affect the environmentally hypersensitive. building material, sick building syndrome, cold climate #NO 9924 Sick building syndrome in air conditioned rooms: symptoms, causes and remedies.

Report on an indoor air investigation at a university in the midwestern US. The IAQ investigators responded to occupant complaints about conditions in two offices in a library building.

Correcting these problems led to increased satisfaction among the occupants. indoor air quality, occupant reaction, sick building syndrome, library #NO 9928 Carbon monoxide dispersion in residential buildings: literature review and technical analysis. Persily A K USA, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building and Fire Research Laboratory, October 1996, 71pp, refs. Carbon monoxide (CO) detectors are being used increasingly in residential buildings to warn occupants about CO concentrations that could potentially cause acute health effects. While the use of CO detectors can decrease the likelihood of exposure to such CO levels, questions exist concerning the installation of these devices in residential buildings, primarily with regards to the location and number of detectors. Efforts to develop installation guidance and standards have been faced with these questions of location, and the availability of technical information to support the development of installation recommendation has been questions. As the first task of a project to analyze the distribution of CO in residential buildings as it relates to the installation of CO detectors, a literature review and technical analysis was conducted to assess information on CO dispersion in residential buildings that could support the development of guidance on detector installation. The review covered a number of issues including CO concentration measurements in residential buildings, sources of indoor CO, mixing within and between rooms, tracer gas techniques for assessing building airflow, and computer models of air movement and contaminant dispersal in buildings. The material obtained in the literature review is discussed, and a technical analysis of the issues related to CO dispersion in residential buildings is presented. carbon monoxide, residential building #NO 9929 A numerical study of dispersion and local exhaust capture of aerosols generated from a variety of sources and airflow conditions. Madsen U, Fontaine J R, Nielsen P V, Aubertin G, Breum N O USA, American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal, No 57, 1996, pp 134-141, 9 figs, 21 refs. Focus is put on aerosol source parameters and their influence on aerosol dispersion and capture by a local exhaust. The studied parameters were particle diameter, density, and initial velocity. Included in the study was the influence of obstacles and airflow patterns. Direct capture efficiency of an exhaust above the contaminant source was used to compare the influence of the studied parameters. The study was based on a numerical model that computes the particle trajectories, taking inertia, drag forces, gravity, and turbulence into account. The relevance of particle relaxation time, aerodynamic diameter, and stopping distance is discussed. It is concluded that local exhaust capture of passively emitted particles can be described by particle relaxation time and the vertical air velocity at the emission point. The influence on direct capture from particle initial velocity is limited compared to imposed airflow patterns as jets and cross drafts. A table underneath the contaminant source may improve capture efficiency. The numerical model proved to be a useful tool to handle the complexity of contaminant sources in the industrial division. aerosol, numerical modelling #NO 9930 Transport of contaminated gas and dust in high-rise apartment buildings. Hergel T N, et al Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, February 1996, 20pp. Jacques Whitform Environment Limited (JWEL) and Morrison Hershfield Limited (MH) have completed a research project investigation the level of risk associated with soil gases and dust in high-rise apartment buildings. The research was conducted in response to a request for proposals issued by the Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation (CMHC). The study investigated the hypothesis that the risk associated with gas and dust from contaminated lands can be reduced fro residents of high-rise apartment building compared to residents of single-unit or low-rise residential structures. The study was conducted using a literature search to examine the risk associated with fugitive dust in high-rise apartment buildings, and tracer gases to examine transfer paths of gaseous phase contaminants and the effects of ventilation systems. dust, pollutant, high rise building, apartment building #NO 9931 Modelling and measurement of airflow and aerosol particle distribution in a ventilated two zone chamber. Lu W, Howarth A T, Adam N, Riffat S Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 5, 1996, pp 417-423, 6 figs, 9 refs. A CFD analysis of air movement and aerosol particle deposition and distribution in a ventilate two-zone system with a small interzonal opening is presented. The comparisons of average particle concentrations in both zones between computations and experiments are generally satisfactory and acceptable. It is concluded that particle deposition and migration are mainly influenced by the particle properties, the ventilation conditions and the airflow patterns in the two zones. Small particles have a greater influence on the indoor air quality than do the large particles. aerosol, test chamber, modelling, measurement technique #NO 9932 Concentrations of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartments of automobiles. Lawryk N J, Weisel C P Environ Sci Technol, No 30, 1996, pp 810-816, 8 figs, 5 tabs, 10 refs. In-vehicle concentrations of selected gosaline-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde were examined on 113 commuters through suburban New Jersey and 33 New Jersey/New York commutes. Overall median concentrations were lowest in a typical suburban commute, slightly higher on the New Jersey Turnpike, and the highest in transit through the Lincoln Tunnel. Median in-vehicle concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene, m&p-xylene, and 0-xylene were 14, 6.8, 36, and 15ug/ m cube, respectively. One vehicle, with a carburetor engine, developed malfunctions that caused gasoline emissions within the engine compartment during driving, resulting in the gasoline-derived VOC concentrations in this vehicle being much higher than in the properly maintained fuel-injected vehicle, particularly for the low ventilation extreme. The highest in-vehicle benzene concentration measured during these malfunctions was 45.2ug/m cube. The air concentration in the vehicle driven in tandem was a factor of 25 less (1.8ug/m cube). organic compound, motor vehicle #NO 9933 Field tests of remedial measures for houses affected by hazardous lands. CH2M Hill Engineering Ltd Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, May 1995, 29pp + app., 4 tabs, refs. Remedial measures to prevent soil gas infiltration have been implemented on many building affected by intrusion of radon, water vapor, methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The success of these measures has been well documented for gases such as radon, however similar detailed documentation was not readily available for methane or other VOCS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of four different remedial solutions installed on houses. All houses tested in this study had the potential of methane intrusion. Nine houses were tested as part of this study. The four different remedial measures which were evaluated included: a liner with a subslab passive vent system; an active venting fan connected to a foundation perimeter gas collection pipe; a passive vent connected to a foundation perimeter gas collection pipe; and a liner system only. Each of these four systems were installed in four separate communities across Canada. Based on long-term monitoring, none of the nine houses tested were identified as having significant methane concentration indoors due to soil gas entry. Although the remedial measures installed may have had an effect on the limited amount of methane detected indoors, other factors such as low methane generation rates, and diffusion controlled sources also had significant influence. In fact, at some houses, the control systems likely were not necessary because of the factors. Further short-term tracer tests were carried out on one of the systems to evaluate the integrity of the remedial measure. Based on a limited number of houses tested, the results suggested that the amount of gas could be limited by as much as four orders of magnitude. soil gas, organic compound, radon, residential building #NO 9934 Aural environment survey in air conditioned open plan offices. Tang S K, Burnett J, Poon C M UK, Building Serv Eng Res Technol, Vol 17, No 2, 1996, pp 97-100, 2 figs, 3 tabs, 17 refs. In this study, a field survey of the indoor aural environment was carried out in 30 air-conditioned open-plan commercial offices in Hong Kong, with over a thousand office workers were interviewed. Subjective responses of the office workers towards their aural environment were collected using questionnaires. Physical noise measurements were performed in an attempt to establish a suitable noise criteria for aural comfort. In addition, the nature of the noise from air-conditioning systems is discussed. Results show that the equivalent sound pressure level and noise criterion are better criteria than noise rating when correlated with subjective responses. noise pollution, air conditioning, office building #NO 9935 The influence of various air exchange rates on airborne particles and microorganisms in conventionally ventilated operating rooms. Kruppa B, Rueden H Indoor Air, No 6, 1996, pp 93-100, 6 figs, 5 tabs, refs. Concentrations of airborne particles and micro-organisms were assessed as a function of the air exchange rate in two operating theatres equipped with conventional air ventilation systems. The measurements were made with and without human activity (surgery). Under conditions without human activity the effect of the air exchange rate on viable (=micro-organisms) and non-viable airborne particles was measured. Under conditions with human activity an investigation was made to determine whether the air exchange rate has a significant influence on air-borne particle and bacteria concentrations. In addition, the influence of the number of persons in the operating theatres and the various operating activities were calculated. Statistical differences were found for airborne particle and airborne bacteria concentrations in supply and room air with and without human activity. From the point of view of hygiene, these differences must be considered irrelevant because of the slight margin (less than on e logarithmic step) between the values. A comparison of all air exchange rates clearly shows that the number of personnel present in the operating theatre exerts the strongest influence on airborne particle concentration variance in room air. As regards airborne bacteria concentrations in room air, explanation of variance by the parameters air exchange rate, number of persons and operating activity is negligible. Summarizing the low (7.5 and 10/h) and high (15 and 20/h) air exchange rates did not increase the explanation of variance for airborne particle and bacteria concentrations although the differences were significant.

Palin S L, McIntyre D A, Edwards R E UK, Building Serv Eng Res Technol, Vol 17, No 2, 1996, pp 79-84, 4 figs, 1 tab, 15 refs. Three ventilation systems were installed in a recently refurbished test house: full house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MHVR), passive stack ventilation (PSV) and extract fans in kitchen and bathroom. Humidifiers were installed to simulate normal occupancy and behaviour of the ventilation was monitored over the winter of 1993/94. The test house has a low leakage rate of 3 ac h-1 at 50 Pa pressure difference; this low rate was maintained over the duration of the tests. A comparison of ventilation rates provided by the three systems is given. MHVR was the most effective in maintaining low humidity. air change rate, particle, operating theatre #NO 9937 Additional analysis of Wallaceburg data. White J Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, July 1996. Data on moisture sources, winter condensation potential, carbon dioxide levels, levels of biological contamination and blood lymphocytes from fifty nine houses subjected to detailed testing and inspection in a previous phase of the Wallaceburg study were subject to more detailed statistical evaluation to determine the relationships between moisture sources, fungal growth and objective measures of health. The work showed a correlation between measurements of mold growth and immunological reactions of occupants and that mold growth appeared to be more related to local moisture sources than air change levels. moisture, condensation, carbon dioxide, biological pollutant #NO 9938 Mould in finished basements. Scanada Consultants Ltd Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, April 1996, 14pp. Finished basements in twenty seven Ottawa houses were investigated to determine if the basement assemblies could contribute to poor indoor air quality due to molds. The wall cavities were inspected with optical fibrescopes to determine the composition and note the conditions. Visible mold colonies were sampled to identify mold species. The presence of molds correlated with the presence of chronic wetting events rather than ant particular basement finishing techniques. Molds were analyzed form 16 (59%) of the houses and toxigenic mold were found in all houses except one. mould, basement Occupancy Effects #NO 9939 Occupant sensitive heating and ventilation: influence of building design and energy strategies on energy requirement and summer temperatures. Arbetstidsstyrd uppvarmning och ventilation En parameterstudie. Adamson B Sweden, Lund University, Department of Building Science, Institute of Science and Technology, Report BKL 1991:10, 145pp. The object of this parametric study is to make a contribution to the design of building elements in offices and other non-residential premises without occupant sensitive climatic control, and to put forward views regarding heating strategy. Cooling is discussed here only as passive cooling, i.e. cooling which can be achieved by making use of the building itself and its ventilation without the need to install refrigeration equipment. The need for cooling arises due to the architectural and structural design of the building. For instance, large southerly, easterly and westerly glazed areas demand solar control if active cooling is to be avoided. These are also dealt with in this study. The interest in offices and other working premises has increased in recent years die to the health problems which the users have experienced as a result of internal climatic conditions. It has generally been possible to trace back such ill-health to emissions from materials or to the ventilation system. Demands have been made for the supply of fresh air to be increased and for the effectiveness of ventilation to be improved. This has been taken into account in varying the parameters used in this study. occupant reaction, building design, passive cooling Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques #NO 9940 FANalyser: an automated portable test bench for analyzing the performance of fractional horsepower fan motor sets.

Dewsbury J UK, Building Serv Eng Res Technol, Vol 17, No 2, 1996, pp 65-71, 8 figs, 15 refs. The paper briefly describes the AC pressurisation method of building airtightness measurement and the disadvantages of earlier analysis methods. A new analysis method is described, based on fitting a non-linear function of the unknowns to data. The function is derived from the differential equations of the system components. The new method performed well with simulated data. With real data, the method produced good estimates of the leakage flow rate at 4Pa pressure loss, leakage length/area and enclosure flexing, but poor estimated of the leakage exponent. it is suspected that this problem was due to measurement errors. pressurisation, air tightness #NO 9943 AC pressurisation: Fourier analysis and the effect of compressibility of air. Dewsbury J UK, Building Serv Eng Res Technol, Vol 17, No 2, 1996, pp 73-77, 4 figs, 3 tabs, 10 refs. The AC pressurisation method of measuring the airtightness of building is briefly described. Using a simplified model, the leakage characteristics of the enclosure may be found by Fourier analysis of the pressure signal if the effects of compressibility and flexing are neglected. These effects become small at low frequency, but the frequency required to make them negligible may be too low for the available instruments and the resulting pressure signal may be smaller than appropriate for building airtightness measurements. The conditions under which the other approximations in the model may be justified are not yet know. pressurisation, modelling, air leakage Miscellaneous #NO 9944 Vertical temperature distributions in a gymnasium during cooling and heating seasons.

Marshall J W USA, Ashrae Journal, September 1996, pp 27-30, 1 tab, 9 refs. Discussion of ventilation standards in relation to the needs of health care, for example in operating rooms. Compares various ventilation standards. Concludes that air changes per hour would be the better predictor of patient exposure to contamination only if contamination were generated based on the volume of the patient room. A ventilation standard based on cfm per patient is likely to be more representative of expected contamination levels within a space than an air change per hour standard. The reason is that contamination sources are likely to be related to either the infactious patient themselves, or to patients, their visitors, and activities; while room volume is unlikely to be related to contamination sources. standard, air change rate, hospital #NO 9946 The situation of national and international standards on ventilation.

Divided into seven major sections: 1. overview of key trends in non-OECD energy use and carbon emissions since 1970, 2. energy use and carbon emissions patterns of five major non-OECD regions; 3-7 aggregate and sectoral energy use and carbon emissions data for countries within each of these five regions. carbon dioxide, pollutant #NO 9949 Controllable air ingress in dwellings. Les entrees d'air autoreglables dans les locaux d'habitation. Barbarin L France, "Ventilation et Renouvellement d'Air", proceedings of a conference held Sophia Antipolis, 20-21 October 1993, pp 159-167. The controlled entry of air is aimed at ensuring fresh air in dwellings to the principal rooms (bedroom and living room) with mechanical and natural ventilation. It must on the other hand ensure protection vis a vis outdoor noise when the acoustic qualities of the facade demand it. Gives examples of such regulatory systems, and describes installation procedures, dimensioning, and air flow characteristics. residential building, noise pollution #NO 9950 Displacement ventilation. Jackman P J UK, Building Services Research and Information Association (BSRIA), Technical Memorandum 2/90, 36pp, 27 figs, 5 tabs, 15 refs. In buoyancy driven, displacement ventilation, the incoming "fresh" air is gently introduced near the floor and at a temperature just slightly lower than the design room air temperature. The cool air flows slowly over the floor and air that has become warmed rises above the cool layer. Any local heat sources in the lower part of the room create convection currents that also contribute to the general upward movement and the air is ultimately exhausted at high level. Although this type of system has been used in other countries, notably in Scandinavia, since 1970, there is little experience of its use in the UK. This report contains state of the art information on the application of this method of ventilation and data appropriate to the design and operation in this country. displacement ventilation #NO 9951 It's all at the Co-op. Bunn R UK, Building Services Journal, August 1996, pp 15-19, 2 figs, 4 refs. Describes the new headquarters for Co-operative Retail Services, which includes chilled beams, displacement ventilation, and thermal storage. displacement ventilation, building design #NO 9952 Derivation of capture efficiency of kitchen range hoods in a confined space. Li Y, Delsante A Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 5, 1996, pp 461-468, 8 figs, 9 refs. An existing derivation of capture efficiency of a kitchen range hood in a confined flow system, based on a two-zone mixing model, is shown to be inconsistent and inadequate. A new derivation proposed, which shows that the capture efficiency equals the ratio of captured flow rate to the total plume flow rate at the front canopy height. The new capture efficiency equals the direct capture efficiency, if we assume that the hood captures contaminant directly from the source as efficiently as it captures contaminant that is entrained from the room. exhaust hood, kitchen, modelling #NO 9953 Displacement ventilation in a large painting workshop. Fontaine J R, Rapp R, Aubertin G France, INRS, "Mixing or Displacement?", Air Diffusion Working Day, Thermodynamics Laboratory, University of Liege, December 15th, 1993, 20pp. Illustrates the interest of using CFD to analyse the performance of ventilation systems by considering the example of a painting area in which it would be desirable to produce a displacement ventilation. The simulations were carried out using EOL, and CFD software developed at INRS and specially devised to deal with air quality problems in industrial ventilated premises. It contains many analysis tools to interpret the results in terms familiar to the industrial hygienist. Much experimental work has been engaged to validate the predications of EOL for ventilation flows. displacement ventilation, large building, pollutant, industrial building #NO 9954 Residence time distribution characterises ventilation in industrial premises. Olander L, Dessagne J M, Bonthoux F, Leclerc J P Chemical Technology Europe, May/June 1995, pp 13-15, 4 figs, 7 refs. In non-industrial buildings the general ventilation is usually sufficient to ensure that fresh air is renewed at an adequate rate. Many industrial premises, on the other hand, have localised emissions of contaminants that require local exhaust ventilation. But in practice local exhaust systems may not be 100% efficient, allowing contaminants to escape and mix with the ambient air. Ventilation designers need tools to allow them to assess the efficiency of different arrangements. A new approach to ventilation design is being developed, based on the concept of residence time distribution. The method promises to be easier than modern computational fluid dynamics but more accurate than traditional "rule of thumb" techniques. industrial building, ventilation system #NO 9955 Study and application of underfloor air conditioning system and natural ventilation for smart buildings. Iizuka H, Matsunwa K, Tanabe S, et al Japan, Roomvent '96, 5th International Conference on Air Distribution in Rooms, 17-19 July 1996, supplement, pp 355-362, 6 figs, 2 tabs, refs. An underfloor air conditioning system designed for buildings with intelligent features was developed and introduced into a smart building in Tokyo. Laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, field measurement studies were carried out before and after occupancy, to estimate and confirm the level of thermal comfort and energy saving effects of the system. These studies revealed that, compared with the conventional ceiling diffuser air conditioning system, the underfloor air conditioning system not only promoted highly efficient exhaust heat removal, but also increased the rate of dependency on natural energy. It was confirmed that in the underfloor air conditioning system, exhaust heat was elevated upward, carried by the air flow that blew from the floor to the ceiling, and formed thermal layers. This meant that exhaust heat was effectively discharged from the occupied space. The studies revealed that supply air temperature of 20 Deg. C could sufficiently serve as supply air all year round. The length of period dependent on natural ventilation was extended and the annual energy consumption level monitored also proved this. The supply air with a higher temperature enabled a higher temperature for the chilled water, and resulted in a more efficient operation of the refrigerators. it was also found out that the underfloor air conditioning system could be easily integrated with a passive energy system (such as "night purge" that utilised natural ventilation) to form an effective hybrid energy system. As a result, this building consumed primary energy of 432 Mcal/h m2 during the fiscal year of 1994, which was quite small compared with other conventional smart buildings in Tokyo. air conditioning, natural ventilation #NO 9956 Clearing the air: filters for residential forced-air systems. Creech D, Barcik M, Byers S USA, Home Energy, July/August 1996, pp 14-18, 2 figs.

Giabaklou Z, Ballinger J A Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 6, 1996, pp 503-507, 3 figs, 13 refs. Evaporative cooling is used extensively for cooling climates with medium to low humidity. In residential buildings the conventional mechanical systems to be both noisy and unsightly. Here a proposal is presented fro a passive evaporative cooling system which makes use of natural ventilation at the building facade. The system makes use of the evaporative effect from water falling vertically along guides to produces a reduction in the temperature of the air entering the building. it can also be used as a design element in the building facade. Such a system provided an inexpensive, energy efficient, environmentally benign and potentially attractive cooling system. A numerical study is presented to demonstrate the system efficiency and air flow rate through a building, making use of measured outside wind speed and direction, building geometry and surroundings. The likely effect of the system on the indoor air temperature is discussed; further work is being undertaken to explore the integration of such a system into the building fabric. passive cooling, natural ventilation #NO 9959 Cold ceilings: a demanding job for planners. Soffitti freddi: compito impegnativo per i progettisti. Oldrini L Italy, CDA, No 8, August 1996, pp 906-910, 20 figs. Chilled ceilings aren't any easy task for planners and architects, since the functional principles, influenced by various parameters, have to combine with the room and ceiling design. For these reasons different cooling systems with different functions are normally provided. Therefore, any proposal by builders has to be correctly compared and valued by planners; this task was made necessary by the actual status of experiences and studies in this field and possible by the outstanding standards. cold ceilings, design, functions, standards #NO 9960 What drives cooling savings in mobile homes?

Meklin T, Taskinen T, Nevalainen A Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 1083-1088. The aim of the study was to characterize the microbiological status of four school buildings with or without moisture problems. Both air samples and surface samples were taken. The study was a part of an epidemiological health study among the school children. The total concentrations of airborne fungi in three problem schools were 5-530 cfu/m3 and in the reference school 21-160 cfu/m3. Certain fungal genera were only detected in the problem schools. This was true in both air and surface samples. The results also indicate that the children's entering the room increases the concentrations of airborne fungi. The concentrations of surface samples in the problem school were higher than in the reference school as well. microbiological pollutant, school #NO 9965 Asthma among school employees in relation to the school environment. Smedje G, Norback D, Wessen B, Edling C Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 611-616. The relation between the indoor environment and the occurrence of asthma among the employees was investigated as a part of a Swedish school environment project. Data on health effects were gathered by a self-administered questionnaire answered by 1410 subjects (85%). Data on exposure were collected by measuring a wide range of factors in 96 classrooms. Asthma was more common among subjects working in schools with higher concentrations of total moulds and indoor concentration of microbially produced volatile ordanic compounds (MVOC). The results stress the importance of minimising the exposure to microbial growth in the indoor environment. respiratory illness, school, indoor air quality #NO 9966 Mite allergen levels in dust from carpeted floors in schools. Masuda S, Kaneko T, Horiba F, Ando H, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 653-658. Allergen levels of mites were measured in dust from classrooms with carpeted and wooden floors in school by sandwich ELISA. Mite allergen levels in dust samples from open-style classrooms with carpeted floors were as low as those of conventional classrooms with wooden floors. Some conventional classrooms and closed-type music rooms with carpeted floors gave high mite allergen levels. The mite allergen levels were highest in July or August, the most humid and hottest seasons in Japan, and decreased in November. The dust mite levels correlated with humidity but not temperature. It was suggested that humidity was one of important factors which affected mite allergen levels in carpeted classrooms. Attention needs to be paid to the structure and the ventilation which have an effect on humidity, when carpet is installed on the floors of classrooms. dust, floor coverings, school #NO 9967 Indoor environment in schools - pupils health and performance in regard to CO2 concentrations. Myhrvold A N, Olsen E, Lauridsen O Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 4, pp 369-374. The results in this paper represent a small part of a three year ongoing research project, "Indoor Environment in Schools". The project has been an effect study of rehabilitation in schools with poor indoor air quality. This project is a co-operation between the counties of Oppland and Vest Agder, the municipality of Ha in Rogaland and RF-Rogaland Research. The aim of the project has been to investigate the indoor environment in regard to the pupils' health, social environment and level of performance. The project has included field investigations of indoor air quality, pupils' health and social climate in addition to a reaction time test, called SPES. The results show both correlations between pupils' health and the CO2 concentrations in the classrooms, and between the pupils' performance and the CO2 concentrations. school, health, carbon dioxide World Renewable Energy Congress - selected papers #NO 9968 Renewable Energy: Renewable energy, energy efficiency and the environment.

Coch H, Serra R Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 128-132. The climate of Mediterranean countries is characterized by its complexity. Rapidly changing conditions mean that both cold and heat can be a problem. In architectural practice the design solutions that must be applied in buildings are complex. Solutions for summer comfort in Mediterranean areas also reflects this complexity. The causes of summer discomfort will be described and some examples of solutions against these will be showed and analyzed. thermal comfort, cooling, hot climate #NO 9973 The Oxford solar house. Fuentes M, Dichler A, Roaf S Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 145-153. This paper presents preliminary results from the first nine months of monitoring the Oxford Solar House (OSH) which was built, in particular, to evaluate the potential for photovoltaics to contribute cost effectively to domestic energy supply in the UK. The house was built in a south facing site with good solar access. It has a 4kWPV system integrated into the roof structure and a 5 metre squared solar thermal domestic hot water pre-heat. The house was designed to require a minimum of energy for heating, cooling and lighting, therefore optimizing the significance of the contribution of the solar electric supply. The performance of the PV system is presented, as well as an analysis of the whole design strategy to minimized energy loads. passive solar building, residential building, energy efficiency #NO 9974 The traditional Yemeni window and natural lighting. Ayssa A Z Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 214-218. The traditional Yemeni window is considered to be one of the most important elements that characterize the yemeni architecture. The beauty of the traditional Yemeni window comes from its four main components which combined the function of view, lighting, ventilation, protection, and privacy. These functions can be controlled by the occupants according to their social and environmental needs. The four main components are the lower part (Taqah), the fanlight (Qamariyah), the wooden external overhang (Konnah), and the small vent (Shaquos). Since fanlights provided natural lighting during day-time, the area of the lower part can be reduced and its exterior shutters can be closed without the need for artificial lighting. The internal natural lighting that is provided by the upper and lower parts of the window was investigated see its quality. In this investigation, there were two main goals. The first is the contribution and quality of the internal light provided by the Qamariyah when shutters are closed. The second is the effect of the internal simple white cloth curtains, in the lower part,in the internal light quality. Visual measurements were taken in a typical room of a traditional house of the Old City of Sana's, Yemen. From the findings, it was found that the fanlights (Qamariyat) provide low and soft homogeneous internal lighting which was as low as 22 lux average. However, the occupants have the ability to increase the level of lighting to as high as 600 or 700 lux. This can be done simply by deciding which shutter to open and how many of them to be opened. In this paper, the methodology and findings will be presented and discussed. hot climate, dry climate, window, daylighting #NO 9975 Solar duct for lighting and ventilation. Santa Amalia building, Barcelona, Spain. De-Urrutia O Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 227-230. The Santa Amalia building in Barcelona is a block of six flats incorporating a duct by which light is sent to the kitchens - previously without natural lighting - and also allows natural ventilation. Moreover, the passive solar gains obtained from the extensive glazed surfaces and the conservation of internal heat gains, along with a high degree of insulation, give energy saving of 68% for heating. passive solar design, duct, daylighting, apartment building #NO 9976 Air quality control in commercial buildings. Liddament M W Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 231-235. The heating or cooling of a space to maintain thermal comfort is a highly energy intensive process accounting for as much as 60-70% of total energy use in non-industrial buildings. Of this, approximately 30-50% is lost through ventilation and air infiltration. A recent review concludes that as the thermal insulation characteristics of buildings improve, ventilation and air movement are expected to become the dominant heating and cooling loss mechanism in buildings of the next century. While it is theoretically possible to reduce the energy impact of ventilation by restricting the rate of air change, this can have a dramatic influence on indoor air quality. On the other hand, there are many instances where air change is excessive or ventilation is called upon to deal with air quality problems that should be treated in other, less energy intensive ways. Only by understanding the role of ventilation and alternative control strategies can ventilation energy demand be optimised without causing harm or discomfort. The purpose of this paper is to review aspects of indoor air quality as they relate to the ventilation of commercial buildings. Also outlined is a variety of energy efficient approaches to ventilation. commercial building, indoor climate #NO 9977 Renewables in ventilation and indoor air quality. Sherman M, Levin H Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 236-240. The three main energy-related building services are space conditioning (for thermal comfort), lighting (for visual comfort), and ventilation (for indoor air quality). The purpose of this report is to address issues that relate renewable energy to the last of these three. ventilation system #NO 9978 Air movement in naturally ventilated buildings. Awbi H B Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 241-247. The air movement and the distribution of CO2 in naturally ventilated office room and an atrium is investigated using computational fluid dynamics. The results show that natural ventilation is capable of achieving acceptable CO2 levels. Adequate comfort levels could also be achieved for a typical UK summer climate in both types of buildings. Both wind-driven and buoyancy-driven flows are considered. natural ventilation, air movement, carbon dioxide, cross ventilation #NO 9979 Night cooling and ventilation design for office-type buildings.

The suitability of night ventilation for cooling is first discussed by presenting a plot of summer weather conditions on the bioclimatic chart by reporting on the results of energy and ventilation simulations of a typical UK office module. The development of a simplified design tool suitable for the early stages of design process is then described. For this model, user input is limited to a few key variables and the technique allows the designer to explore rapidly the effects of a range of design variables including external temperatures, internal gains and ventilation rates during the day and night. cooling, nighttime ventilation, office building #NO 9980 Air flow and thermal comfort simulation studies of wind ventilated classrooms in Malaysia. Rahman S A, Kannan K S Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 264-267. A CFD software called VORTEX is used as a tool to simulate air flow and thermal comfort in naturally wind ventilated classrooms of an educational institution, which are a different locations, have different configurations and slightly differing outdoor environmental conditions. Simulations of the various classrooms are compared to get the most thermally comfortable and uncomfortable naturally ventilated classroom. An analysis of the simulations will be done, taking into consideration, among other, location of inlets and outlets and the sheltering effect of the surrounding built-up environments. Recommendations will then be made on how to improve the ventilation of the least comfortable room, based on hypothetical simulation results. air flow, thermal comfort, simulation, school #NO 9981 Solar heat storage wall for building ventilation. Stritih U, Novak P Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 268-271. In this article we present a solar wall, which absorbs solar energy into black paraffin was which is an example of phase change material (PCM). The stored heat is used for heating the air for the ventilation of the house. Experimental results for prototype of the solar wall are presented and operation of the all in the heating season is calculated by computer simulation. passive solar design, ventilation system #NO 9982 Passive cooling as design methodology: some examples from the past to the present. Gallo C Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 309-314.

Khedari J, Hirunlabh J, Bunnag T Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 1, pp 335-338. The paper discusses the possibility of offering thermal comfort, without inducing mechanical energy costs, in new habitations, built in European style and situated in a hot and humid climate, by means of a construction elements: the Roof Solar Collector (RSC), which is made by using concrete roofing tiles on the outer side and gypsum board on the inner one. With this RSC it is possible, on the one hand, to minimize the fraction of the solar flux absorbed by the dwelling (insulation) and, on the other hand, to induce a natural ventilation which allows thermal comfort. The influence of length and tilt angle of the RSC on the performance of the RSC is studied experimentally. The results of the study, with regard to the natural ventilation of habitation, were that the optimum length of roof solar collector must be shorter than about 100 cm and the tilt angle should equal 30 degrees. The natural ventilation rate was about 0.08-0.15 m cubed s-1.m-2 passive solar design, natural ventilation, residential ventilation, roof #NO 9984 Evaluation of energy conservation potential by exhaust air recirculation for a commercial-type heated-air batch hay dryer. Schoenau G J, Arinze E A, Sokhansanj S, Trauttmansdorff F G Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 2, pp 676-681. Energy conservation in drying and processing operations is essential in order to improve the reliability of low and moderate temperature renewable energy system, and to reduce operating costs and energy consumption is systems using high-energy content fossil fuels in farms and processing plants especially in industrialized economics. An experimental evaluation of energy conservation potential by recirculating exhaust air in a commercial heated-air batch hay dryer is presented. The design of the exhaust recirculation unit is such that only about 30% of the total exhaust air is recirculated through the heater inlet. Experimental tests were conducted on the dryer with and without exhaust air recirculation. Maximum energy savings of 27% and 17% were achieved with exhaust air recirculation during fall and summer dryer operation respectively. energy consumption, exhaust, air recirculation #NO 9985 Computerised bioclimatic and psychrometric charts for thermal comfort studies in Malaysia. Azni Z A, Zain Z M, Shaari S Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 3, pp 1316-1319. This paper describes the experimental set-up of a computerized data-acquisition system in the town of Shah Alam, Malaysia. The system utilizes sensors for the capture of global horizontal solar radiation, relative humidity of air, ambient air temperature, wind speed and direction. These parameters are then displayed and plotted directly on both the bio-climatic and psychometric charts. Some initial attempts are made to describe the typical climate of Shah Alam by interpreting the resultant points on the charts. Consequently, as more data is acquired over a considerable period of time, sufficient to describe the Shah Alam more accurately, passive design strategies for cooling to achieve local thermal comfort may be attempted. thermal comfort, sensor, humidity, hot climate #NO 9986 Solar closets and sunspaces. Pine N, Bashus P Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 3, pp 1332-1337. A "solar closet" is an insulated box filled with sealed containers of water, with a solar air heater attached to one insulated side. In a simplified solar-space and water-heating technique, a low-thermal-mass isolated sunspace heats a house on an average winter day, with an average amount of sun.. A higher-temperature, compact, high-thermal-mass sauna behind the sunspace provides domestic hot water and space heat for the house during cloudy weather. sunspace, passive solar design #NO 9987 Energy consumption and indoor air quality in residential buildings.

Seasonal designation of habitable rooms and spaces within the indigenous courtyard houses of Baghdad regions of the hot-dry climates. Al-Azzawi S Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 3, pp 1367-1372. The indigenous courtyard houses of Baghdad are effectively designed and built as two-houses-in-one micro-climatically and thermal-environmentally (as well as in other aspects). Essentially, the ground floor, the semi-subterranean level, the subterranean level, and the roof terrace at second floor level are designed and built for summer habitation, while the first floor (with its mezzanine level the Kashif-Kan) is designed and built for winter habitation. Additionally, habitable rooms and spaces of these indigenous courtyard houses in Baghdad are not designated for a specific function, purpose, or use: instead, they are envisaged as multi-purpose to be used for sitting, living, dining, sleeping, and some are even for receiving visitors. However, they are designated according to season when they are meant to be used mainly in winter or summer or alternatively in spring and autumn, \9and some are even designated for use at a particular time of the day within the same season, as discussed in another paper submitted to the Congress). In this paper, such habitable rooms and spaces are identified in plan, in location (floor level), and in section, and then related to their seasonal designation. courtyard, hot climate, dry climate #NO 9989 Wind towers aerodynamic performance.

The use of passive solar cooling strategies offer real opportunities for improving the ambient comfort conditions in building whilst reducing the energy consumption due to the use of mechanical systems for space climatization. This research examines the potential of passive solar cooling strategies in an educational building. The alternatives proposed for investigation consisted of a wind tower system handling the temperature difference gradient and direct wind pressure effects. A new fenestration system on the south facade, implementation of an integrated energy efficient lighting system (including lamps, luminaries, ballasts and controls), and landscaping[ping features in a micro-climatic approach, to provide a pre-cooling effect, were also proposed as additional strategies. Results have shown that passive solar cooling has the potential to improve ambient comfort conditions in these type of building, dominated by large internal heat gain loads. Energy consumption die to electric lighting and mechanical space climatization was cut off by 60%. At this stage, and after the implementation of the techniques, monitoring of the ambient conditions will be conducted for a period of twelve months. It is also expected that the results of this research can be applied in other buildings with similar conditions in Mexico. passive solar design, cooling, school, wind pressure, stack effect #NO 9991 Thermal building simulation with a new tool - PASSPORT PLUS.

Passport Plus is a new design tool for building thermal analysis which was developed within a European research project, of the European Commission, DG XII. Passport Plus performs thermal simulations of multizone buildings. The validation has been performed against#t several other will know programs and experimental data, with excellent results. Passport Plus is a flexible numerical model, in a sense that it can be easily modified in order to adapt and incorporate new findings from ongoing and future research, independently developed modules for treating specific systems or processes, with minimum effort and changes to the programs' structure. simulation, passive cooling #NO 9992 Low cost passive solar housing in Botswana: effect of design parameters on indoor temperatures. Jain P K, Bingana L Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 3, pp 1442-1445. Extreme high an low summer and winter temperatures respectively in most parts of Botswana render the use of space conditioning devices mandatory. However, the use of such devices is not feasible in the low-cost housing sector, and the majority of the population face the severity of the climate. In this paper effects of passive solar building design parameters and building material on the indoor temperatures of a typical three bed-roomed, low-cost house are analyzed. By varying the design parameters and materials the mean-monthly maximum, minimum and average indoor temperatures without the use of space conditioning devices are simulated. An energy analysis software - CALPAS version 3 (1980) is used, and the parameters studied are the orientation, roof and wall insulation and colorful, glass area, thermal mass and ventilation. The conclusions drawn and the recommendations made provide guidelines for home-owners to construct thermally more comfortable passive solar houses without or with very little additional cost of construction. This paper and another one by Jain et al.

The indigenous courtyard houses of Baghdad in concepts, plans, forms, sections and elevations regions of the hot-dry climate. Al-Azzawi S Pergamon, 1996, "Renewable Energy", proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress, held Denver, Colorado, USA, 15-21 June 1996, Volume 3, pp 1450-1455. The indigenous courtyard houses of Baghdad are specifically designed to ameliorate the severe climatic conditions prevailing in summer which is a long, hot dry season. They do that in concepts, plans, forms, sections, and elevations, as well as in other aspects. These concepts also satisfy other important criteria which have concurrent design implications. courtyard, hot climate, dry climate More abstracts WT01-B07-68IA068-000417-B014-9http://www.aivc.org:80/ra74_5.html 194.217.120.80 19970113034735 text/html 48909HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 03:46:27 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 48736Last-modified: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 16:02:31 GMTMore abstracts Indoor Air '96 - selected papers #NO 9994 Displacement ventilation and cooled ceilings, results of laboratory tests and practical installations. Fitzner K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 41-50. In recent years two new ideas to design air-conditioning systems have spread very quickly in north-western Europe, displacement flow and cooled ceilings. These new air-conditioning systems are already frequently applied due to many advantages. There are many differences between this type of air flow compared with the better known mixed flow. Many questions arose about the design of the new systems: Dimensioning and location of the air outlets, influence of the thermal load, distribution of temperatures, velocities and concentrations in the occupied zone. Most of these questions are solved now and a survey about the design rules will be given and some applications will be shown. displacement ventilation, cooling, air conditioning #NO 9995 A study of ventilation influence on indoor radon concentration in air. Tian D Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 75-80. Along with improvements of Chinese people's living standards, household air conditioners have already come into population's home right now. In order to evaluate the influence of air-conditioned ventilation upon indoor radon concentration in air, indoor radon levels were studied by a continuous electrostatic radon monitor (CER) under normal living conditions. Results show radon levels with air-conditioners were not much more than one in winter without it, although fixing household conditioner requires a sealed room which will lead higher radon levels. Turning on air-conditioner helps to lower it. Total effects are normal , ventilation , exhaust or indraft , exhaust plus indraft, and reduce the harm to human. In summary, air-conditioners are good for human health. radon, ventilation system #NO 9996 Radon mitigation and backdrafting. Grimsrud D T, Hadlich D E, Angell W J, Kuzj P Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 93-97. The purpose of this project is to examine the potential for backdrafting in ten houses having active soil depressurization radon mitigation systems installed and operating. As part of a State Innovative Radon Grant project supported by the State of Minnesota's Department of Health, we investigated the impact of radon mitigation system on house depressurization and backdrafting of atmospherically vented combustion devices. Ten houses were chosen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area that contain active radon mitigation systems. All had basements. Air leakage measurements of the houses showed a median air leakage of 6.0 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure. Depressurization of the mechanical room relative to the outside was measured with the mitigation system off and in operation. The potential for backdrafting of the combustion equipment was also measured. We did not observe depressurization of the basements in any of the ten homes due to operation of the radon mitigation system. Worst-case depressurization was established by operating all exhaust equipment simultaneously. Worst-case depressurization caused backdrafting to occur in four of the ten houses. In one of the four the furnace began to draft after firing for three minutes. We tested the carbon monoxide production in the flues of each atmospherically vented combustion device during backdraft conditions. If the device did not experience backdrafting during the worst-case test, the backdraft was induced using a blower door. In tow of the ten houses elevated CO production was seen in one of the combustion appliances subject to backdrafting. Active soil depressurization systems did not add to backdrafting concerns in the houses tested. radon, depressurisation, basement #NO 9997 Measurement of air exchange rate and radon exhalation rate from building wall. Yamanishi H, Obayashi H, Sakuma Y, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 135-140. It is expected to develop a method for measuring air exchange rate in large experimental hall by means of radon observation. The method was applied to a room with low air change rate. The radon exhalation rate measured by direct method has been found almost the same as the estimated value from air change rate and radon concentration in room air. The time variation of air change rate in the room was reproduced and observed indoor radon and exhalation rate from wall. air change rate, radon, wall #NO 9998 Thermal comfort in naturally ventilated versus air conditioned offices. Oseland N A Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 215-220. The thermal environment was continuously monitored for one week in winter and one week in summer in 4 naturally ventilated (NV) air-conditioned (AC) UK offices. Occupants considered the NV offices to be comfortable across a wider range of temperatures than AC offices in winter, but the range was similar in summer. The neutral temperature in NV offices was 1.3 degrees C lower in winter and 2.2 degrees C lower in summer than in AC offices. However, there was only a marginal difference in clothing insulation and activity levels between the two types of office. Discrepancies of up to 4 degrees C were found between the observed neutral temperatures and those predicted by international standards ISO7730. thermal comfort, natural ventilation, air conditioning thermal comfort, natural ventilation, office building #NO 9999 Local ventilation with heat recovery: heat gain versus thermal comfort and energy consumption.

We use the refuse-air heat from hot tools in industrial shop to preheat the fresh air for the space heating. There is the technology-steam discharge through the steam pipe openings into the industrial shop. For this reason we have used the simulation software AZMAP. This software is based on the mathematical modeling of this energy system via a heat exchange network. The higher diameter of the opening means the higher steam loss but higher energy savings needed for the space heating of the industrial building. The adjustment of the fresh air-mass flow to obtain the thermal comfort in the industrial shop means the additional energy savings up to 3%. heat recovery, thermal comfort, energy consumption #NO 10000 Investigation of draft due to cold window in a climate chamber. Peng S Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 245-250. In cold climates, the temperature difference between vertical room surfaces and adjacent room air is capable of initiating cold downward convection flows, which are often intensive enough to create local drafts. An investigation of convection induced by a cold window was conducted in a climate chamber. The window faced an outdoor temperature of about -12 degrees C. A flat unit, placed horizontally below the window, was used to simulate floor heating. By measurements of the sir flow, the draft was investigated. THe result shows that the heating hardly affects the flow along the window surface, but gives considerable effects on the air current spreading over the floor. With the local air temperature increased and the local air velocity reduced, the near-floor draft can be greatly suppressed by floor heating. draughts, window, test chamber draughts, window, test chamber #NO 10001 Investigation of indoor thermal environment and air quality in well insulated and airtight houses in Tohoku district. Hasegawa K, Yoshino H Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 287-291. This paper describes the thermal environment and indoor air quality of 16 well-insulated and airtight houses in Senai and Moriaoka during the winter and summer of 1994. These houses have mechanical ventilation system and space heating system for a whole house. The thermal environment during the winter was comfortable, but some occupants complained of dryness of indoor air. During the summer, the indoor temperatures of houses did not rise so much without the cooling system, and it seems possible to be improved by cross ventilation or night time ventilation. The NO2 concentration were not so high. The concentration of NO2 with an unvented kerosene heater was higher than that without it. air tightness, indoor air quality #NO 10002 Field study on thermal comfort in transient spaces from outdoor to indoor. Hayashi T, Shibayama A, Hasebe R, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 293-298. Field measurements on thermal comfort were carried out in a passenger terminal building at an international airport and an office building with a big atrium using an instrumental cart built for investigating thermal environment from outdoor to indoor in transient spaces. Numerical simulation based on these field data was carried out to evaluate thermal comfort for sedentary and transient persons by using a thermo-regulation model with 16 body parts. It was found that the mean skin temperature of the transient persons was higher than that of sedentary ones. It was proved that atrium was functioning not only for pleasant atmosphere but also for a thermal buffer. thermal comfort, large building, atrium #NO 10003 Short circuiting of outdoor air in air conditioning systems. Jones P, Chan D W T, Burnett J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 313-318. Air conditioned buildings are becoming more and more associated with the negative aspects of environmental services design. They are generally regarded as associated with high energy use, high capital and maintenance costs and building health and comfort problems. One reason for the poor performance of air conditioning systems is the potential for short-circuiting of air between the various supply and exhaust locations. This means that the air that is delivered to the occupied zone is not as "fresh" as it was intended to be. This paper discusses the problem of short-circuiting of exhaust and supply air in air conditioned offices. It identifies three main short-circuiting situations, at external, intermediate and internal locations. Results from a number of case studies are presented to illustrate the problems that occur in practice. These results suggest that short-circuiting happens more often than perhaps previously thought, and that it may be fundamental to current problems associated with poor indoor air quality. Some recommendations are provided for good practice. outdoor air, air conditioning #NO 10004 A flow rate evaluation method of building airflow network based on transport equations of room ages of air. Kurabuchi T, Yoshihara K, Sugata D, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 359-364. Transport equations of room ages of air determined from tracer step-up and step-down experiments are derived under the condition that each room air is completely mixed and each flow rate of building airflow network is constant. Based on the derived transport equations of room ages of air, a new evaluation method of flow rates of building airflow network is proposed with a suitable tracer gas experiment procedure. Proposed transport equations are validated by comparison to the age distribution of rooms calculated from numerically simulated tracer gas experiments. A series of tracer step-down experiments were carried out of full-scale model house together with the direct measurement of flow rates. It was found that the age distribution of rooms calculated from the measured flow rates, and reversibly evaluated flow rates from the measured age distribution of rooms were in good agreement with the experiments. modelling, air flow, ageing, tracer gas #NO 10005 Thermal conditions in room and possibilities to form displacement ventilation processes. Mierzwinski S, Popiolek Z, Nawrocki W, Trzeciakiewicz Z Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 387-392. The objective of the paper is research on aerodynamical and thermal phenomena in rooms supporting or impeding two-zone air flow characteristic for displacement ventilation. The tests were carried out in scale models of an industrial hall. The power and location of the heat sources as well as the air volume flux in quasi-laminar sup[ply flows were changed as the boundary conditions of the modelled process of displacement ventilation. Distributions of the air temperature and of the tracer gas concentrations were measured. The flows visualized were recorded with a video camera. The effect of the ventilation boundary conditions on the creation of an inter-layer which divided the inflow zone and circulation zone. The characteristics of the inter-layer and interface were tested. Occurrence of two-zone flow in displacement ventilation systems is affected by the following depending on one another factors: plumes, supply flows, their position and other geometrical conditions of the room. These factors should be considered and optimized individually while maintaining, however certain proportions between the air change and power of the heat sources as well as the layered air flow within the whole lower zone. displacement ventilation, industrial building, large building #NO 10006 On the assessment of ventilation requirements for hospital operating rooms. Salvigni S, Piva S, Mazzacane S Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 393-398. During the surgical operations, both the necessity of lower energy consumption and a deeper consideration to the risks of post-operative sepsis need a new approach in the assessment of the ventilation requirements for the operating rooms. An Indoor Air Quality Procedure is used to discuss the sterility level attainable in these rooms during a surgical operation, for different ventilation rates and consistency of the medical team. Furthermore, their typical time dependent behaviour and the time of de-contamination are discussed. hospital, ventilation requirements, operating theatre #NO 10007 Occupant, trained and untrained panel responses to indoor air quality. Parine N, Oreszczyn T Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 429-434. The first UK experiment to utilize human sensory perception as a measure of an indoor air's acceptability took place in 1872. Since this time several important investigation have been carried out, using human arbiter, to determine the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain indoor air as acceptable. Humans, rather than instrumentation, have been preferred ad they can give both a quantitative and qualitative dimension to the judgments. However, qualitative judgments such as the pleasantness, annoyance or nuisance of odours and irritants will depend strongly on the context in which they are measured. Traditionally, "visitors" to buildings are employed to measure the acceptability of the indoor air as the occupants will have adapted to the ambient odour levels with the subsequent loss of sensitivity. This paper reports on the findings of an experiment that utilized occupants, a trained panel and an untrained panel to judge the indoor air in a large air-conditioned office building sited in central London. The evaluations took place over three weeks and the outside ventilation rates were reduced during the second and third weeks. All participants were "blind" to the changes in ventilation rates. Results suggest that the three groups' basis for acceptability judgments are very different and that the occupants' perception of "air quality" may be influenced by prior knowledge that the outside air is polluted which will inevitably effect the quality of the indoor air. Recommendations for standard methods of assessment of indoor air quality are presented based on the results from this study. occupant reaction, indoor air quality, ventilation rate #NO 10008 The "clean building philosophy". Flatheim G Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 477-479. "L" MARKET - now under construction - is based on the "clean building philosophy". A main goal is to deliver an office complex of approx. 76.000 metres squared without debris and building dust, such as mineral wool, cement, sand or gypsum. Implementation of a building project which employs new innovative techniques, requires the total co-operation and participation of contractor and sub-contractors. Accordingly, great emphasis is placed on the education of contractors and the displacement of conventional attitudes and practices. Unless individual workers can be convinced of the basic value of following "clean" construction procedures, there is no possibility of achieving one of the principal objectives of the original environmental plan, which was made for "L" MARKET. We have to convince the workers that the "clean building philosophy" is a benefit for their comfort and health during the construction time. office building, building design #NO 10009 Indoor exposure to pyrethroid insecticides. Berger Preiss E, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 507-512. The contamination of rooms after application of pyrethroid insecticides was investigated in this study. Three different formulations containing deltamethrin, permethrin, piperonylbutoxide and pyrethrins were sprayed in a model house consisting of ten identical furnished rooms and their concentration monitored on surfaces, in house dust and airborne dust over a period of two years. The concentrations of permethrin and deltamethrin decreased very slowly during this period. After 70 weeks, permethrin applied as a solvent-based emulsion was found in house dust in concentrations of 200ug/g, and deltamethrin applied as an aqueous suspension in concentrations of 5ug/g. Decontamination of the rooms using a household cleanser substantially reduced the pyrethroid concentration. pollutant, dust #NO 10010 Experimental study of thermal climate of an underground dwelling with ventilation and dehumidification. Wen Y, Chen Q, Ran M Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 519-524. The rapid increasing of population in the world, becoming barren of the earth land, and the damage of ecology balance are forcing mankind to pay attention to the underground space again. But the severe indoor environment problems of underground space, such as temperature, humidity and ventilation, have not been well solved, though some documents about those problems have been reported in recent years, which will obstruct the exploitation and utilization of underground space. In this paper, an experimental natural ventilation system with dehumidification in terms of special construction element measures has been designed and built in underground space. Measurements of its thermal-moisture properties was taken in the summer of 1994. The results have been qualitatively or quantitative analyzed. It shows that this system is effective to some degree to improve the thermal-moisture performance in the underground space. Finally, some useful suggestions have been proposed to ameliorate this system. dehumidification, thermal performance #NO 10011 Evaluation of diesel exhaust particles in roadside private homes. Fumasaka K, Miyazaki T, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 531-536. The contribution made by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) to indoor air pollutants was evaluated on the basis of concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), a major component of DEP. Concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM: particles of <10�m diameter) and EC in indoor and outdoor air were measured at 8 private homes located between 5 and 150 metres from a main road. Samples were collected using an AND sampler capable of separating airborne particles according to aerodynamic diameter (<2�m, 2-10�m, and >10�m). EC concentration in indoor air of homes located within 5 metres of the roadside was 25�g/cubic metre while that for homes located between 60 and 150 metres from the roadside was 17�g/cubic metre. The contribution of DEP to SPM of <2�m diameter in indoor air was evaluated at approximately 43-64% for homes located within 5 metres of the roadside and at 41-61% for those 60-150m distant. residential building, particle #NO 10012 Influence of the ventilation system to the particulate level in a hospital. Yiu J M K, Tung T C W, Chao C Y H, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 545-550. Airborne contaminants can easily be distributed by HVAC systems an dispersed in air. The control of microbioaerosols and particulate can be done partly by better design, installation, operation and maintenance of HVAC systems, This paper discussed the influence of ventilation and air-conditioning system and filtration provision to aerosols level in health care buildings. Particulate levels at selected areas with different ventilation rates, air side systems and filtration provisions in a newly built hospital in Hong Kong have been studied. It has been found that CAV may not perform better than VAV and 100% fresh air may not perform better than recirculatory system. Human activities and movement may have significant contribution to the particulate level in the fine size mode. ventilation system, particulate, hospital #NO 10013 Correlation between the sensation of draught and the convective heat transfer coefficient around the human head. Popiolek Z, Madsen T L Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 683-688. Sensation of draught is one of the most common reasons for complaints about thermal environment. It is therefore of interest to investigate correlation between the existing draught criteria and convective heat loss from the human body. The measurements were carried out with a thermal manikin head heated to simulate thermal comfort sensation for a human head under different environment conditions. The mean heat loss from the head was measured together with the local heat loss in four different positions. The corresponding convective heat transfer coefficient was calculated for the air velocity between 0 and 0.4 m/s, turbulence between 10 and 70% and frequency between 0 and 1 Hz. The air temperature and mean radiant temperature were kept constant around 20.5 degrees C. The main result was that, generally, the increase in convective heat loss caused by increasing air velocity and/or increasing turbulence cannot, by itself, explain the corresponding increase in draught sensations. The difference between heat loss from different parts of the head was smaller than the one found in earlier investigations. A good correlation between convective heat transfer coefficient of the overall head and draught sensation, for percentage of dissatisfied DR lower than 25% was found. draughts, convection, heat transfer, occupant reaction #NO 10014 Reduced heat stress in hot and humid offices by an individually controlled supply of dried air to workplaces. Gunnarsen L, Martin A, Santos B Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 689-694. At temperatures above comfort, sweating is increasingly important for human thermoregulation and air humidity becomes important when evaluating heat stress. Among heat acclimatized people, sweating is often quite efficient. Dry supply air may be a promising low-cost alternative to cooling in hot and humid areas. 123 heat-adapted subjects participated in six one-hour exposures in cubicles in a warm room without air conditioning. Each subject had individually-adjustable air outlets both above and below the desk. The temperature and humidity of the supply;air was varied in a blinded and randomized design. One exposure had no air supply. At the end of e#ach exposure the perceptions of subjects, water intake, skin temperatures, sweating and a simple performance measure were registered. The supply of de-humidified but not cooled air significantly increased acceptability and reduced most of the monitored indictors of heat stress. This reduction is possible even in offices without airtight enclosures when the dried air is supplied directly to each workplace. hot climate, humidity, workplace, occupant reaction #NO 10015 Thermal comfort, natural ventilation, natural lighting and edified environmental quality in industrial buildings. Frota A B, Matthes A G Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 707-712. In industrial buildings, the Edified Environmental Quality is very important, especially in Brazil, due to its warm and humid climate. Our subject is an industrial prefabricated building with a low internal heat generation and our objectives are: a) reduction in heat solar gains; b) save electric energy using natural light; c) intensive, well distributed and assured natural ventilation. We studied natural ventilation in laboratory experiments with a small-scale industrial building. The results show that it is possible to get good ventilation rates, that, associated with the other qualities, give industrial buildings Edified Environmental Quality and Energy Conservation. thermal comfort, natural ventilation, industrial building #NO 10016 Evaluation and comparison of as-built performances of vertical displacement and conventional HVAC systems in a research and demonstration facility. Holbrook T, Woods J, Koganei M, Olesen B Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 781-786. A newly constructed and commissioned Research and Demonstration Facility allows for an evaluation of the as-built performances of a vertical displacement ventilation system and a conventional variable air volume system in two architecturally similar rooms with each served by its own independent HVAC system. Evaluations based on air temperature, velocity, and contaminant concentration measurements obtained at several location and heights in the two rooms and within the HVAC systems were performed at two thermal load conditions. As-built performance deficiencies suggest the need for a re-evaluation of commissioning criteria. Baseline thermal and air quality performance of the VDV system was superior to that of the VAV system. The data were also used to validate a unique two-zone model of displacement ventilation. displacement ventilation, modelling, temperature #NO 10017 Prediction of buoyant plume and displacement ventilation with different turbulence models. Chen Q, Chao N Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 787-792. Four turbulence models, the "standard" k-e model, a modified k-e model, a RNG k-e model, and a Reynolds-stress model, were used to study a turbulent buoyant plume and room airflow with displacement ventilation. For the plume flow, it is found that the Reynolds-stress model predicted satisfactory velocity, temperature and turbulence quantities while the performance of the eddy-viscosity model is poor. For the room airflow, the computed airflow patterns, mean velocities, temperatures and contaminant concentrations agree reasonably with the experimental data obtained from a full-scale test chamber, but the discrepancies in some locations are large. displacement ventilation, turbulence, modelling #NO 10018 Experimental study on indoor thermal environment and air quality of the floor supply displacement ventilation system. Akimoto T, Nobe T, Tanabe S, Kimura K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 793-798. The results of laboratory measurements on the performance of the floor-supply displacement ventilation system are described. The experiments were performed in a controlled chamber configured to resemble a modern office space with modular workstation furniture and partitions. In addition to detailed measurements of temperature, air velocity, and tracer gas concentration, a skin-temperature-controlled thermal manikin was used to evaluate the quality of the non-uniform thermal environments produced by the proposed system in comparison to a conventional ceiling-based system. The results show that the proposed system could be operated to maintain acceptable thermal comfort and high ventilation efficiency in the occupied zone of the space, while at the same time taking advantage of the temperature stratification to achieve energy savings in air-conditioning of the space. thermal performance, displacement ventilation, occupant reaction #NO 10019 Effects of outdoor thermal environment in displacement ventilation Li Y, Moller S, Symons J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 799-804. The outdoor thermal environment can affect displacement ventilation in tow related aspects, namely the additional vertical wall buoyancy flows generated and the additional cooling load generated. These effects are due to the altered interior wall surface temperature and heat flux. This paper used a computational fluid dynamics approach to examine the flow and temperature fields of a displacement ventilated room influenced by outdoor temperature and solar radiation. It is shown that the warmer floor and ceiling weaken the gravity currents and the ceiling-jet driven wall flows respectively. outdoor air, displacement ventilation #NO 10020 Room air temperature profiles in underfloor air distribution system. Fujita H, Sakai K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 805-810. To make a model for easy prediction of the room air temperature profiles in the under-floor air distribution system, the measurements were made in a full-scale test room on various conditions of heat loads and supply air flow rates. based on the measurement results, the room air flow patterns are estimated, and a model to account for those flow patterns is proposed. The application of the model clarifies some relationships regarding the air flow and the heat. The model is also used to predict the temperature profiles, reproducing the measured profiles well, and show that accurate heat load profiles are important for accurate prediction of temperature profiles. temperature, air distribution, modelling #NO 10021 Perceived air quality in a displacement ventilated room. Brohus H, Knudsen H N, Nielsen P V, Clausen G, Fanger P O Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 811-816. In a displacement ventilated room the non-uniform contaminant distribution causes and improved indoor air quality in the occupied zone compared with conventional mixing ventilation. This has been demonstrated in numerous studies by chemical measurements. In this study the air quality in a displacement ventilated room was determined directly by asking humans about how they perceived the air quality. A trained sensory panel comprising 12 subjects assessed the perceived air quality immediately after entering a climate chamber. The experiments showed that the perceived air quality in the displacement ventilated chamber was substantially better than in the case of mixing ventilation. displacement ventilation, occupant reaction #NO 10022 Effects of outdoor thermal environment in displacement ventilation - Part 2 Heat transfer analysis. Li Y, Moller S, Symons J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 817-822. A reliable prediction of heat transfer is very important in the analysis of displacement ventilation, not only to assess the system cooling load, but also to ensure that the system utilizes the thermal fluid flow principles to achieve the required vertical air displacement. Four different methods are used to extract the heat transfer data from the output of a computational fluid dynamics analysis. The total heat gain into the room from the outdoor environment can be more than 50% of the total cooling load. It is shown that the outdoor environment also affect their spatial distribution of the heat gain. outdoor air, displacement ventilation, heat transfer #NO 10023 Ventilation performance and thermal comfort for displacement ventilation system in office space. Hasebe R, Jiang B, Kubo R, Tanabe S, Kimura K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 823-828. Experimental results on the ventilation efficiency and thermal comfort with the displacement ventilation system are described. Experiments were conducted in an office chamber. Displacement ventilation system of a wall mounted type was used for comparison with a conventional ceiling based diffuser system. It was found that ceiling based supply system was close to the perfect mixing system regarding both ventilation efficiency and thermal environment. Displacement ventilation system presented clear characteristics of piston flow and higher ventilation efficiency. thermal comfort, displacement ventilation #NO 10024 Convective phenomena involved in a displacement ventilation system. Manzoni D, Vialle P, Blay D Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 829-834. The present paper is devoted to the study of a displacement ventilation system regarding its applications to office and industrial environment. Although the principles of displacement ventilation are well-know, it appears that a correct use needs better knowledge for a good control of the flow pattern inside the room. Both experiments and calculations were carried out to investigate convective phenomena in such systems. The numerical study were performed using the CFD finite element code N3S and the CFD finite volume code ESTET. Different situations were investigated showing the influence of the main parameters such as, the heat release rate, the supply unit flow rate, the influence of cold walls on the flow pattern and temperature profile. displacement ventilation, convection, numerical modelling #NO 10025 Fundamentals and the ways of development of design calculations for air distribution in Russia. Grimtlin M I Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 835-840. The object of the present paper is to introduce the methods of design calculations for air distribution accepted in Russia and the principal stages of their development. These methods are based on the results of theoretical and experimental investigations of the regularities governing jet flow patterns with regard to peculiarity of their formation and development,in ventilated spaces. air distribution, building design #NO 10026 Field demonstration of a prototype residential ventilation controller. Kesselring J P Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 847-852. Non-use of residential mechanical ventilation equipment is due in part to the lack of user-friendly ventilation control systems. A prototype residential ventilation controller was developed and field-tested to determine its acceptability to home-owners. The prototype controller incorporated an adjustable duty cycle to control ventilation rate, programmable time-of-day scheduling, countdown timer override/purge to adjust CO" level, manual override with adjustable ventilation rate, and maximum-limit CO2-based override. Controllers were installed at 16 field test sites and data on CO2 concentration and ventilation fan use were taken over a four-month period. Home-owners reported a significant improvement indoor air quality and judged the prototype controller easy to use. Data analysis showed the average CO2 concentration was reduced by 7%. mechanical ventilation, carbon dioxide, demand control #NO 10027 An applied research on sharing exhaust duct system of multiple family kitchen exhaust machines to control residence kitchen pollution. Rerin W, Shiming M, Peihong Z Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 853-858. During the process of sharing exhaust duct system design, this research has invented a unique structural part to avoid cross air pollution and functional disturbance. Through theoretical analysis, laboratory experiment and practical engineering installation, it has been proved that the structural parts help to exhaust efficiently, to avoid cross air pollution and functional disturbance. Furthermore, through multiple structure and their different combination experiment, the research has realized a dynamic pressure distribution diagram of the duct system on the base of different structure and different combination process. The research has provided scientific basis for the duct production and practical installation. kitchen, exhaust, duct #NO 10028 Performance of a passive ventilation system using beam space as a fresh air supply chamber. Hayashi M, Yamada H Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 859-864. The performance of a passive ventilation system using beam space as a fresh air supply chamber was investigated by use of a test house and computer simulations. In a test house of which equivalent leakage area is 2.0 (cm squared/m squared), the fresh-sir was not supplied to the first floor from the beam space. But the outside-air infiltrated to the first floor through the leaks and its volume fluctuated due to the wind. In a well-airtight house: 0.5 (cm squared/m squared), the fresh-air was supplied to every room and its volume was steady. Its indoor air quality was acceptable in winter in Sapporo, Japan. passive ventilation, test house #NO 10029 Pressure and flow loss in natural ventilation stacks due to insertion of heat pipes for heat recovery. Shao L, Riffat S B Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 871-876. Study of pressure and flow loss caused by heat-pipes for heat recovery was carried out using computational fluid dynamics. It has been shown that heat-pipes located in the bottom of the stack produce greater insertion flow loss (IFL) than those located at the top. In addition, heat-pipes located next to the stack walls give rise to less IFL than those places in the centre. The results also showed that a smaller insertion pressure (IPL) caused by a heat-pipe corresponds to a greater IFL and vice versa. It has been demonstrated that IFL is the preferred indicator for loss caused by obstacles submerged in stack flows. The temperature of the heat pipe has little effect on flow loss performance of the heat exchangers. stack effect, natural ventilation, heat recovery #NO 10030 Study on temperature gradient in a displacement ventilation room. Liu C J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 877-880. The temperature gradient in a displacement ventilation room has fascinated many workers in this field. A imitative office room was selected for this study. The room was ventilated by means of a low velocity diffuser standing on the floor and attached to the rear wall. The exhaust outlet is on the ceiling. Room temperature at several heights were recorded with 23 thermocouples. The relationship between the working area air temperature difference and the supply air temperature difference have been obtained. The relationship can become a reference on design of displacement ventilation system. displacement ventilation, temperature #NO 10031 Thermal performance in the rooms with displacement ventilation. Koganei M, Kohno H Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 881-886. This paper aims to clarify the thermal performance in the rooms with displacement ventilation. Results of experiments performed on a 2.8m x 2.6m x3m test room with high heat loads (30-170W/m squared) are presented. Results of heat exchange analysis inside the room are also presented. The results of experiments indicate that the temperature stratification is strongly dependent on the air flow rate and heater height at a given heater input. Floor surface absorbs the heat from other surfaces by radiation and a great fraction of the heat is transferred from the floor surface to the floor structure. Results indicate the importance of floor insulation especially in this system. thermal performance, displacement ventilation #NO 10032 Passive smoking in a displacement ventilated room. Bjorn E, Nielsen P V Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 887-892. The aim of this research is to see if the displacement ventilation principle can protect a person from the exposure to passive tobacco smoking. This is done by full-scale experiments with two breathing thermal manikins, smoke visualizations, and tracer gas measurements. In some situations, exhaled smoke will stratify in a certain height due to the vertical temperature gradient. This horizontal layer of exhaled tobacco smoke may lead to exposure. In other situations, the smoke is mixed into the upper zone, and the passive smoker is protected to some extent by the displacement principle and the convective boundary layer flow around the body. passive smoking, displacement ventilation #NO 10033 Indoor air pollution as a function of indoor and outdoor sources in a typical Israeli apartment. Lokshin E, Mamane Y Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 953-958. It is the aim of this study to develop a mathematical model, describing indoor air pollutant concentrations as a function of indoor and outdoor sources. The work was carried out in two directions: development of a multi-zone air flow mode, and a transport model defining the pollutant concentrations in each zone of a building as a function of time. Data for simulation experiments were obtained from a typical Israeli apartments, constant outdoor concentrations, and assumed emission factors. It was found that indoor air quality is affected by meteorological conditions (wind), emissions from indoor sources, and the air tightness of a given building. The configuration of the staircase (open or closed and the presence of the vent top) also affects indoor air concentrations. outdoor air, apartment building, pollutant More abstracts WT01-B07-69IA068-000417-B014-171http://www.aivc.org:80/ra74_6.html 194.217.120.80 19970113034901 text/html 26127HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 03:47:57 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 25954Last-modified: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 16:02:31 GMTMore abstracts Indoor Air '96 - selected papers (continued) #NO 10034 Present tendencies of air quality control in ventilation and air cleaning systems. Bitkolov N Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 965-970. Air quality control in ventilation and air-cleaning systems is provided by ventilation itself, air purification and reduction of atmospheric emissions. Ventilation in industrial premised may provide for air re-circulation use of laminar airflows, design of ventilation modules, zonal planning of workrooms, separate local systems of heating and ventilation, control automatization and increasing ventilation and air purification expenses in capital investments. Air purification systems being a part of ventilation systems should be based on the following principles: contaminant volume and amount decrease design and use of air purification systems correlating with the source of contaminant emissions, minimizing systems resistance. Environmental safety in ventilation and air purification system accidents, which includes preventative measures, measures for elimination of hazardous effects, safety standard is a matter of the greatest concern at the present time. Air quality control at present time should provide effective and economical ventilation which meets the requirements on environmental safety. air cleaning, indoor air quality, industrial building #NO 10035 Distributions of sensory evaluations on thermal and cross ventilation conditions in naturally ventilated temperate climate classrooms. Iino Y, Hoyano A Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 1031-1036. Using data from a large number of teacher questionnaires distributed to public elementary schools in Kawasaki, Japan, we determined factors having the strongest influence on their sensory evaluations of thermal and cross-ventilation condition in natural-ventilated temperature-climate classrooms. These influential factors were derived from various factors regarding thermal-related environmental control used by teachers and classroom architectural planning factors. Then, using data from student questionnaires, we determined seating-dependent distributions of similar sensory evaluation for groups of classes with respective category of influential factors. AS the result, windows and door were fully opened except being closed for the safety and noise control reasons. The class directional orientation and the window types related to architectural openings had the strongest influence on sensory evaluations. The classrooms facing southward and having window types tend to be fully opened provided the most comfortable thermal environment. occupant reaction, cross ventilation, school #NO 10036 Air exchange rate of stationary automobiles. Park J, Spengler J D, Yoon D, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 1, pp 1097-1102. The air exchange rate (or air changes per hour:ACH) was measured under 4 different conditions in 3 stationary cars. The ACH ranged between 1.0 and 3.0-h1 with windows closed and no mechanical ventilation, between 1.8 and 3.7-h1 with windows closed and fan set on recirculation, between 13.3 and 26.1-h1 with windows open and no mechanical ventilation, and between 36.2 and 47.5-h1 with windows closed with the fan set on fresh air. ACH with windows closed and no ventilation was higher for the older car than for the newer cars. With the windows closed and the fan turned off, ACH was not influenced by wind speed. ACH in parked cars is relevant to understanding exposures to pollutants from internal sources was estimated using the EPA model for simulated "stop-and-go" urban driving cycles, and it was found that the pollutants build up rapidly and are diluted slowly inside parked cars. air change rate, motor vehicle, pollutant  #NO 10037 How to design and evaluate the HVAC for better indoor air quality with sufficient energy saving. Nakahara N Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 3-15. Energy conservation is not always an inconsistent idea with the indoor air quality HVAC designers should keep in mind that the harmony of these two concepts depend on their design philosophy as well as on their practical evaluation measures. The thermal zoning HVAC should be necessarily followed by the ventilation zoning. Several advanced techniques, such as the task-and-ambient system, transient characteristics of the room environment and human body and dynamic simulation, should be applied to obtain a better individual thermal satisfaction with even better indoor air quality. air conditioning, indoor air quality #NO 10038 Indoor formaldehyde concentrations and air exchange rates in Austrian prefabricated houses. Tappler P, Sulzner M, Burtscher I, Scheidl K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 103-108. Formaldehyde concentrations and air exchange rates were measured in 53 rooms of 27 prefabricated houses. The concentrations of formaldehyde were determined with a photometric method, whereas ventilation rates were measured with a tracer-gas technique. In 40% of the cases indoor formaldehyde concentrations exceeded the guideline value of 0.12 mg/m cube (median 0.111 mg/m cubed)> Critical formaldehyde concentrations were found in older prefabricated houses (erected before 1985) with chipboard walls, with the boards facing the interior of the rooms and in rooms with old furniture. Material tests identified chipboard as the major emission source of formaldehyde in these buildings. In most objects measured air exchange rates (median=0.20h -1) indicated very poor ventilation, which was another reason for high concentrations of formaldehyde. formaldehyde, air change rate, mobile home #NO 10039 The effect of mechanical ventilation on indoor nitrogen dioxide levels. Wiech C R, Raw G J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 123-128. A trial was set up to determine the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in reducing humidity and the effect this has on house dust mite populations in homes occupied by asthmatic patients. The trial included monitoring of a range of factors that might change with the introduction of MVHR and we have an effect on clinical measures of asthma. One such factor was the level of NO2, which was measured in the kitchen, bedroom, living room and outside at 40 homes, before and after MVHR was installed in 20 of these homes. The introduction of MVHR had no significant effect on NO(2) in any room or season even when homes with and without gas cooking were treated separately. mechanical ventilation, nitrogen dioxide #NO 10040 Ventilation in bedrooms: a serious problem? White J H, Lawton M Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 135-140. Several tests of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in both adult's and children's bedrooms have shown high levels in a fraction of the houses. This indicates a very low effective ventilation rate per person and the possibility that the concentration of other contaminants in the air in those rooms will also be high, at reasonable source strengths of the pollutants. Since bedrooms are designed for sleep, during which the resting body makes repairs to many systems, this does not bode will for the general health of those sleeping in such rooms. More research into the concentration of other contaminants in high CO2 houses is warranted. At the levels of CO2 found in some rooms, there may even be some direct effects of CO2, a possibility being studied by Hydro Quebec and Health Canada. bedroom, ventilation system #NO 10041 Dynamic ventilation - create microclimate that fits you best. Livtchak A, Laurikainen J, Pekkinen J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 141-144. Traditionally we used to design air conditioning systems to provide constant comfort air conditions (temperature, humidity and velocity) in an occupied zone. Is that really what we, inhabitants of air conditioned spaces are looking for? Observations of hygienists show that a man has a better productivity, working at lower surrounding room temperature, until he feels discomfort of being chilled or we would prefer higher indoor temperature before lunch than after it. Should we consider these observations as a message that we would rather provide variable than steady indoor climate? We succeeded in separating a man from outdoor conditions, placing him into the shelters of modern buildings. There is no doubt that we would like to be isolated from outdoor pollutants, traffic noise and other unpleasant irritants, but why to be separated from a fresh breeze of air with velocity sometimes exceeding the comfort level of say 0.15 m/s, or warmth of a swift sunlight. The subject of this paper is not to report an achievement but rather to initiate a dispute on the current approach in consideration of comfort conditions for indoor climate and discuss a new trend in air conditioning system design. DYNAMIC or INTELLIGENT ventilations is a system, where temperature, velocity, humidity of air, its ion and possibly odor composition, lighting in the room and probably sound effects are controlled by a program according to the inhabitants wishes or hygienists recommendations, the main features and basic components of the system are presented. It may be a system of the nearest future and we, engineers, do not see any technical obstacles to put it into practice. occupant behaviour, ventilation system #NO 10042 Construction of a new bullet train car providing satisfactory air to both smokers and non-smokers. Ishii I, Sakurai T, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 151-156. A new bullet train car with an effective ventilation system has been constructed as a result of co-operation between Japan Tobacco In. and East Japan Railway Company. The purpose of this system is to provide satisfactory and good quality air both to smokers and non-smokers on board. The principal aim of the system is to control the air stream in the carriage so as to prevent the tobacco smoke in the smoking section from moving into the non-smoking section. Moreover, an electrostatic precipitator and a deodorant filter were installed. The efficiency of this system was examined using this new train car. motor vehicle, tobacco smoke #NO 10043 Between and within workstations variability indoor air conditions in a sealed building with mechanical ventilation. Bourbeau J, Brisson C, Allaire S Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 163-167. The present study aims to assess the between and within workstations variability of the indoor air conditions in a sealed building with mechanical ventilation. The building under study had 9 constant air HVAC systems with 30 units of distribution and an outdoor air intake of a least 15 L/S/P for each system. CO2, temperature, humidity, and air velocity were measured 4 times/day in 120 workstations and were repeated during 3 days in 23 workstations. Total VOC, formaldehyde and total airborne particulates were measured in 14 workstations. Variability between workstations during work hours was for CO2: 571 ppm +- 69, for temperature: 23.2 degrees C +- 0.5, for humidity: 30% +_ 4, and for air velocity: .04m/sec. +- .03 (neck) and .03 m/sec. +_ .03 (ankles). Variability within workstations over 3 days was also low despite some outdoor variations. Total VOC were less than 200g/m cube, formaldehyde less than 2m/g cube and total airborne particulates less than 25g/m cube except for 3 workstations and outside. Properly designed building with mechanical ventilation and air conditioning can be effective in maintaining relatively stable indoor air conditions between and within workstations. mechanical ventilation, air tightness #NO 10044 Investigation of air flow pattern of the ventilation system in the repair process of VLCC. Xu W Q, Sun H, Sun Q Q, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 175-180. In the ship repair industry, enormous amounts of repair work is done in very large crude carriers (VLCC), such as in the cargo and ballast tanks. During the repair process, large quantities of smoke, fumes and heat are generated in these confined spaces. Due to the great depth and size of the tanks and limited number of openings on the deck, it is very difficult to extract these toxic gases. A new ventilation system based on the "all-directional, global ventilation using the push-pull and displacement method" was designed. The design concept is based on transferring fresh air to the bottom of the compartments and blowing it out uniformly from an air distributor in a "vector flow". Suction tubes installed at the top of the compartment would bring out heat and dust. It was shown by computer simulation and experimentation that the air flow pattern was reasonable and efficient. The new ventilation system can be used not only in the repair processes of VLCC but also in similar enclosed spaces such as big workshops and warehouses. air flow, toxic gas, large building #NO 10045 A model-based air flow management system. Pekkinen J, Mattila T, Laurikainen J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 181-183. A new air flow management system has been developed, which is based on a mathematical model of the ductwork. The model is given as input data in the form of a table. The intelligent control system checks the ductwork and makes an automatic balancing procedure to determine the pressure drops of different ductwork components and branches. Once the control system knows the geometry of the ductwork, it can control the system according to described procedures. air flow, mathematical modelling #NO 10046 Effect of the external air pollution on indoor air quality and selecting mechanical ventilation system. Kajtar L, Banhidi L Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 211-216. External air quality has a direct effect on the quality of indoor air in rooms of natural ventilation whereas in air-conditioned rooms it defines the ventilation system ( e.g. filter type) to be selected. We have performed on-spot measurements to study the dust pollution of air in the inner city of Budapest of moderate traffic and in walking areas of no motor vehicle traffic. Based on the measurement results we have evaluated air quality and efficiency of the filtering stages to be applied by climate centres in view of the annual filter replacement costs. indoor air quality, mechanical ventilation, #NO 10047 Control of the IAQ conditions in office buildings by general ventilation - simple guide. Shaw C Y, Vaculik F Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 217-222. The strategy most frequently used by building engineers to maintain an acceptable indoor air quality in office buildings and solve indoor air quality related complaints in ventilation. It is generally assumed that the indoor air quality requirements would be automatically met if adequate ventilation were provided. Ventilation is particularly effective under two situations: to re-establish the indoor air quality level after a scheduled shut down of the HVAC system and to speed up the removal of the contaminants generated in areas where renovations are taking place. In North America, it is a common practice to shut down the HVAC system in the evenings of week days and during weekends to save energy. It is also common to have renovations take place in part of an occupied building. Under either situation, special measures have to be used to remove the contaminant build-up as a direct result of such activities. To use this strategy effectively and in an energy efficient manner, it is not adequate to simply increase the ventilation rate. The building engineers have to know when, how much and how long the ventilation rate would need to be increased. Discussions with building engineers suggest that they do not have such information. This paper provides some practical guidelines for the building engineers to effectively operate the HVAC system after a scheduled shut-down or during a renovation period to avoid indoor air quality problems. These guidelines have been developed from the results of computer simulations of the contaminant movement in buildings and from experience in managing buildings. indoor air quality, ventilation strategy #NO 10048 Correlation between ventilation rates and indoor air quality levels in office buildings. Yoon D W, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 229-234. The impact of outdoor air change rates on the indoor air pollutant levels was evaluated in office buildings located in metropolitan areas of Seoul, Korea. Five buildings were selected for measurements. The concentration levels of the indoor air pollutants were monitored at different outdoor air change rates and the odor and discomfort ratings were surveyed with questionnaire by the occupants. The correlation between ventilation rate and indoor air pollutant levels were evaluated in various operating conditions of HVAC system. The results of this study could indicate that the air change rates and the carbon dioxide concentrations were statically significant in office buildings, and the proper outdoor air change rates and the operational strategy of ventilation systems should be considered differently with symptoms of occupants in office building. ventilation rate, office building #NO 10049 Assessment of the fire protection and ventilation systems in an enclosed car park. Chow W K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 253-258. The probable fire environment in an enclosed car park to be constructed was studied by using a fire zone model. Results are applied to assess the performance of the installed fir protection system. Alternate designs for smoke control and the thermal sensitivity of the sprinkler heads were evaluated. Performance of the ventilation system in this car park was assessed by studying the thermal environment at the occupied zone using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The air speed predicted were used to calculate the mean age of the air and the percentage of dissatisfied. From the investigation, designs on the fire protection and ventilation systems are recommended for providing a healthy and safe environment in this car park. smoke control, motor vehicle #NO 10050 Sick building syndrome symptoms before 6 months and 3 years after being exposed to a building with an improved ventilation system. Brisson C, Bourbeau J, Allaire S Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 259-264. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the decrease in the prevalence of symptoms observed six months after exposure to a building with an improved ventilation system was maintained three years later. More than 1300 office workers completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1991, before moving, in 1992, six months after moving, and in 1995. The prevalence of most symptoms decreased by 40 to 50% in 1992 compared to 1991 and was maintained in 1995 after controlling for personal, psychosocial, and work-related factors. sick building syndrome, survey #NO 10051 Nicotine analysis in sedimented indoor dust: estimation of smoking habits. Gebefuegi I L, Clausen E, Kemmather D, Kettrup A Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 353-356. Knowledge of tobacco smoke exposures in indoor environment plays an important role. We are looking for a possibility to estimate and compare objective smoking quantities by analysis of sedimented indoor particles by nicotine as a target compound. The results show a good conformity with the real tobacco consume in the examined flats. Limitations of this method are in the possible use of nicotine as pesticide and in the possible residues from earlier tobacco consume. A sufficient classification can be made, if none, less or frequently tobacco will be smoked inside the house. The average concentration of nicotine in non-smoker houses is 3 ug/g indoor dust (+- 2 ug/g). One cigarette smoked daily increases the concentration by 5 ug/g (+- 2ug/g). tobacco smoke, dust, occupant behaviour  #NO 10052 CO as a tracer for assessing exposures to particulates in wood and gas cookstove households of highland Guatemala. Naeher L P, Leaderer B P, Smith K R, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 417-422. Kitchen-area 22-hour gravimetric PM2.5 and diffusion staintube CO concentrations were measured in homes with open-fire and improved wood cookstoves in two studies, one in three test houses an one in 15 open-fire and 25 improved-stove houses. CO personal samples were also taken for mother and child. Correlations between kitchen-area and CO and PM2.5 levels were high (r2+0.89-0.94), as were those between the personal samples for mother and child (r2+0.95-0.99). In general, the correlations were lower for less-polluted conditions. The C)/PM2.5 ratio averaged 12.3-144.4 and 13.1-16.2 for open fires and improved stoves. These results generally support the use of CO staintubes as a proxy for PM2.5 carbon monoxide, tracer gas, particulate #NO 10053 Wind effect and human movement on airborne particulate concentration at office entrance areas. Chao C Y H, Tung T C W, Chan D W T Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 423-428. Field measurement has been conducted to study the PM-10 level at several office entrance areas inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University which is located close to automobile pollution sources. One building was selected for detailed investigation. Both indoor and outdoor dust levels were measured at the entrance. A simple expression has been used to indicate the influence of human movement and wind speed on the indoor and outdoor PM-10 ratio. It has been found that high wind speed corresponds to almost identical indoor and outdoor dust concentrations. The higher indoor population density results in higher indoor to outdoor PM-10 ratio. wind effects, particulate, outdoor air, pollutant More abstracts WT01-B07-70IA068-000417-B014-224http://www.aivc.org:80/ra74_7.html 194.217.120.80 19970113035050 text/html 45890HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 03:49:51 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 45717Last-modified: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 16:02:31 GMTMore abstracts Indoor Air '96 - selected papers (continued) #NO 10054 Prediction of ventilative driving pressure. Yamazaki H, Yamashito K, Gotoh T, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 503-508. A method to calculate coefficients of wind pressure and drag of a 2-dimension plate and disc is described with the calculation of the drag coefficients of a cylinder and sphere by making use of the potential theory, and furthermore a calculation method of a drag coefficient of a rectangular prism is shown together with offering 2 types of calculation methods of the pressure in the back side of the wind. These are, so to speak, a method to do calculation from a boundary pressure mean value of the main stream and the stagnation zone and a method to introduce the part after the backside stagnation zone maximum height from main stream pressure loos calculation. Furthermore, as a practical calculation method, description is made with a contraction coefficient method, calculation method of the wake maximum height, and calculation of the wake internal pressure by means of velocity profile. wind pressure, calculation techniques #NO 10055 Calculation method of cross ventilation in a room. Yamashita K, Yamazaki H, Gotoh T, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 509-514. The friction coefficient is greatly changed in accordance with Re number in gap wind capacity calculation, but the local pressure loss coefficient is sufficient with a constant. With draft, Re number is in general great and aperture thickness is small. Therefore the influence of the friction around the aperture is small, and the local pressure loss is finely changed in accordance with the aspect of the flow. Thus the calculation concerning such change is important. A wind capacity calculation expression is described by separating it into the ones of driving pressure and flow rate determination. calculation techniques, cross ventilation #NO 10056 An analysis of the stochastic properties of air temperature and humidity under thermally induced natural ventilation. Hokoi S, Matsumoto M, Tanaka H Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 515-520. For the prevention of suface condensation in a multi-room residential house, natural ventilation between rooms is one of the most influential factors. In this paper a method d#for analyzing stochastic properties of indoor air temperature and humidity is presented under the condition of natural ventilation caused by temperature differences or buoyant forces. The present method gives precise results for many apple;applications and can be used to analyze the indoor climate. Simple example calculations show that the stochastic nature of external climate and thermal natural ventilation has significant influence on indoor climate and thus on the occurrence of surface condensation. temperature, humidity, natural ventilation #NO 10057 Assessment of ventilation strategies using an air quality index introduced into CLIM2000 software. Gadeau A L Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 527-532. In this paper, we propose an Air Quality Index (AQI) useful for evaluating ventilation systems and which take into account the energy consumption. Our index, computed every hour, considers 4 pollutants: Co2, CO, NO2, HCHO. Several ventilation strategies have been built, installed into a typical French house occupied by 2 adults and 2 children, and simulated using CLIM2000 (software for energy management). We present here our results on the air quality and the energy consumption for 2 reference cases (smoker, no smoker) and three ventilation strategies. ventilation system, indoor air quality, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde #NO 10058 Thermal comfort and air flow measurements in domestic houses. Eftekhari M M Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 553-558. To reduce energy consumption in buildings, measures such as the use of cavity walls, double glazed sealed windows and insulated lofts are employed in new houses to improve thermal insulation. The energy consumption and thermal performance of two different types of house, an old and a new detached house are compared. The rate of air in flow as determined by tracer gas, the air velocity and temperature distribution at two levels of 0.15m and 1.2m were measured. The results show that in the new house the temperature difference between a seated person's head and ankle is more than 3 degrees C. This difference is increased when the central heating is switched on. In both houses there is a large amount of air infiltration into the lounge. Despite the inadequacy of installed air ventilator, the energy efficiency of the new house is demonstrated thermal comfort, air flow, residential building #NO 10059 Particle deposition in ventilation air supply ducts. Fransson J I Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 717-722. This paper consists of a theoretical study of particle deposition in a duct system, and field measurements in five HVAC systems. Particle deposition occurs mainly in components such as heater, bends and dampers. Deposition in the duct is reduced by good air filters. The field measurements confirmed the theoretical model. The greatest collection of particles was found in the intake duct. The particles comprise a relatively high proportion of viable fungi. However, it has not been possible to detect any net particle contribution to the supply air from the ventilation system. particle, duct #NO 10060 Performance of a ventilating air conditioning system using beam space. Yamada H, Hayashi M Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 723-728. The performance of a ventilating air-conditioning system is a well-insulated and well-air tightened house was investigated. The system used the beam space on the ceiling of the first floor as a fresh air supply chamber. The volume of fresh air supplied to each room, the temperature and the heat load of each room were measured in a test house of which the equivalent leakage area per floor area is 2.0[cm squared/m squared]. The measurement show that the thermal indoor climate is acceptable in September in HOKKAIDO, but the air flow was not well controlled because of the leak on the first floor. Therefore, the influence of the leaks was investigated by use of the computer simulation by method. As the result, the air flow is well controlled in a better airtight house (0.5[cm squared/m squared]). ventilation performance, ceiling, air tightness #NO 10061 Design and performance of passive stack ventilation in the Nordic countries. Sateri J, Blomsterberg A, Bergsoe N, Skaret E Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 735-740. The design of a building with a passive stack ventilation system must be based on total integration of all disciplines in the design process. In order to be able to control the air flows in the system, the building should be designed and built according to the present requirements for the air tightness of the building envelope. The ventilation system should be dimensioned based on the mean outdoor temperature and mean wind velocity during the warmest month of the year to maintain adequate ventilation during the summer. In order to avoid over-ventilation during the heating season, the dimensioning calculations should be repeated for the mean temperature and mean wind velocity during the coldest month of the year. The design must show how too high air flows are avoided during the winter. Calculations for typical Scandinavian buildings show that the opening area of the air inlets should be ca.2.7 cm squared/m squared of floor area in order to maintain adequate (o.5 ACH) ventilation rate in the whole house or apartment for at least 75% of the year (reference whether data for Stockholm in the year 1971). The variation in the ventilation rate in individual rooms can be much higher that the variation of the ventilation rate of the whole building. For example, a room in the upper flow of a 1 and a half floor house can have inadequate outdoor air flow throughout the heating season. stack ventilation, ventilation performance, building design #NO 10062 The Southampton survey of asthma and ventilation: results of humidity measurements. McIntyre D A, Lane A, Stephen F R, Raw G J, Wiech C R Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 747-752. The use of continuous mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in dwellings is expected to reduce the population of house dust mites. Twenty houses in the Southampton area were fitted with MVHR systems with a further 20 acting as controls. Temperatures and humidities were measured in asthmatic patients' bedrooms for over one year. During the winter four months the MV bedrooms had a mean absolute humidity of 6.75 as against 7.5g/kg for the controls (P<0.001). The WHO has suggested 7g/kg as a figure below which mites fail to thrive: 15 out of 20 of the MV houses had a winter humidity below 7g/kg, compared with 3 of the control houses. House leakiness affected the humidities in the MV group but not the controls. Mite and allergen results will be presented when available. allergies, ventilation system, humidity #NO 10063 The effect of ventilation and filtration on reduction of indoor air exposure to submicron pollutant particles - case study. Jamriska M, Morawska L Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 753-758. The issues of exposure to airborne pollutants and the health hazard associated with air quality are well recognized. Increasing attention is given to fine particulate contaminants in the submicron size range. Exposure to indoor pollutants could thus be significant as people spend up to 90% of their time indoors. There is so far no clear understanding of the indoor-outdoor air relationship in terms of airborne particulates, sources of pollutant particles and their significance as related to the exposure and health risk. This paper presents results of a case study in an office building focusing on the relationship between outdoor-indoor air and investigating the effect of filtration and ventilation on indoor airborne particle characteristics. particle, indoor air quality #NO 10064 Systems for preconditioning ventilation air. Khattar M, Brandemuehl M J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 765-770. The HVAC industry is searching for cost-effective and efficient solutions for meeting requirements that greatly increase the amount of outside ventilation air needed in buildings. The Electric Power Research Institute has teamed with equipment manufacturers to develop two dual path HVAC systems, with one path dedicated to preconditioning the outside air. Both deep-cool and deep-dry the incoming air before mixing it with the return air, reducing or eliminating the latent load on the primary cooling coil. In addition, their energy efficiency cuts electric energy consumption and demand, providing significant operating savings. outdoor air, air conditioning, energy efficiency, cooling #NO 10065 Performance evaluation of residential ventilation systems and components. Lommel A, Ruegg T, Stangier R Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 845-850. Tracer gas measurements (TG) of mechanical ventilation systems (VS) in three low-energy houses are reported. They demonstrate actual frequent IAQ-and energy performance problems of residential VS lacking very often performance evaluation tests and appropriate instruction of the residents. residential building, tracer gas #NO 10066 The impact of housing improvement on acute symptoms in homes. Raw G J, Brazier J E, Walters S, Green G Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 859-864. This paper concerns a new questionnaire, the Home Environment Survey (HES) and in particular the questions included in it about sick building syndrome symptoms. The data were derived from a study of 132 refurbished homes in the North of England and a comparable sample from 140 un-refurbished homes. The response to the symptom questions did not discriminate between the two housing groups. In contrast, a better-established instrument, the SF-36. did show poorer health in the unimproved housing. An initial attempt to improve the resolution of the HES symptom questions did not result in a significant difference between housing groups, bit did result in the HES correlating more strongly with the SF-36 scales, which may reduce the benefits of complementarity. questionnaire, sick building syndrome, refurbishment #NO 10067 The relationship between indoor air quality and carbon dioxide. Persily A K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 961-966. In some situations, measurement of indoor CO2 concentrations can be used to assess indoor air quality and ventilation. However, oversimplified descriptions of measurement procedures based on CO2 have been presented, and there have been many cases where indoor CO2 concentrations have been misinterpreted. This paper describes the relationship of indoor CO2 concentrations to building air quality and ventilation, with a focus on how CO2 can be used to evaluate air quality and ventilation performance. While CO2 concentrations do not provide a comprehensive indication of indoor air quality, they can be used to assess the acceptability of a space in terms of human body odor. Also, under some circumstances CO2 can be used to evaluate building ventilation, specifically air change rates and percent outdoor air intake. carbon dioxide, indoor air quality, ventilation performance #NO 10068 Numerical study on the air flows system with heat sources in an indoor telecommunication room. Nho H G, Kim W T Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 1021-1026. Air-flows and temperature distributions in an indoor telecommunication room with switching equipment, have been simulated in two models. Two separate models are applied; CASE 1 is a Upper Air Supply and Lower Return Flow System (LSURFS). and the other of CASE 2; is a lOwer Air Supply and Upper Return Flow System (LSURFS)> In addition to the influence of model type, the effects of the location of inlet/outlet and switching equipments as a heat source at each model are observed. air flow, modelling #NO 10069 Two dimensional numerical study of airflow through large openings. Li K, Teh S L Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 1027-1032. Natural ventilation is important to indoor air quality because its rate is usually low and cannot be easily adjusted. The results of a numerical study on the airflow within a single-sided naturally ventilated room with a large opening is presented here. Lam-Bremhorst low-Reynolds-number k-e model together with a self-developed two-dimensional flow simulation code based on SIMPLE algorithm was used. External temperatures in equatorial climate similar to those of Singapore were selected. Two room set-ups were examined. The firs is with a heat source and the second a split unit air-conditioner. Air exchange rates were predicted. It is found that the presence of the circulation fan in the split unit air-conditioner will decrease vertical temperature gradient in the opening region and hence the ventilation rate is lowered. numerical modelling, air flow, openings #NO 10070 Numerical simulation on the air flow window integrated with roll screen. Tanimoto J, Kimura K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 1039-1044. Numerical calculation procedure for air flow window (AFW) system integrated with roll screen is presented. In the proposed calculation method both heat and air flows within the window elements such as outside pane of glass, outer air space, Venetian blind, inner air space and roll screen, were taken into account considering thermal and air flow network. Agreements between measured and calculated temperatures and pressure differences in a series of experiments carried out in the environmental test chamber were observed. numerical modelling, air flow, window #NO 10071 Zonal model for predicting ventilation efficiency inside room. Yamanaka T, Satoh R, Kido K Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 1045-1050. The aim of this study is to establish the simple method to predict the air change efficiency inside the room ventilated mechanically. The zonal model is considered to be the most suitable way for such aim. The characteristics of airflow patterns and the distributions of local mean age are investigated by means of an experiment with a large cubic enclosure. The two dimensional zone model are tried to construct adopting two dimensional free jet theory so that the two dimensional zonal model is capable to estimate the age distribution approximately and evaluate the air change efficiency precisely. ventilation efficiency, modelling, mechanical ventilation #NO 10072 Depth average version of the k-epsilon model applied to air distribution and supply flow rate of plenum chamber of raised floor air conditioning systems. Aihara M, Kurabuchi T, Tanigawa M Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 2, pp 1057-1062. A study was performed on estimation of supply outlet flow rate distribution in a raised floor air-conditioning system using CFD> Because it is low in height direction, the conditions inside under-floor chamber were 2-dimensionally analyzed using a depth average version of the k-e model. The calculation included 8 cases in all by varying chamber height, position of air supply outlet, and chamber geometries. The calculation results were in good agreement with the experiment in case the chamber height was 100mm even when chamber geometries and air outlet positions were varied. However, in case chamber height was 70mm, it was necessary to adjust friction coefficient immediately after the air supply outlet. air distribution, air conditioning #NO 10073 Formaldehyde concentration of airtight homes. Muramatsu S, Okamoto S, Matsumura T Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 59-64. Recently, airtight homes have become popular in Japan. They have also become subjects of discussion concerning indoor air pollutions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). We used a simple method of measuring HCHO using a passive gas tube and the acetyle acetone methom (AAM), checking HCHO every hour for 24 hours and simultaneously checking C)2 concentrations. The level of HCHO concentration in airtight homes decreased every year. We found HCHO levels at more than 0.5ppm in new airtight homes at night it was especially high because doors and windows were kept closed. The air change rate was below 0.1 times per hour. Many types of pollutants were emitted from sources such as plywood, furniture and paint on interior walls. The levels of HCHO in airtight homes attenuated below 0.1ppm after a few years. formaldehyde, air tightness, residential building #NO 10074 The design of window-transom locations to improve the indoor air quality of bedrooms by outdoor air in the winter - computational fluid dynamics aided architectural design. Teng J, et al Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 247-252. Air quality in a room is measured by the concentration of pollutants presented there and by the efficiency of ventilation. Besides, in the winter, we need to account for the effect of thermal comfort associated with the indoor air. This paper used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) scheme to evaluated the local concentration and temperature profiles in a bedroom with window and transom positioned at various locations to determine the impact of these openings on the thermal comfort and air quality of the indoor air. The results obtained shows that thermal buoyancy resulting from the thermal plumes generated by the heat sources in space provides the mechanism for improving the air quality indoor. In addition, two optimum design combinations of window-transom arrangements are proposed for attaining an improved condition for air quality and acceptable thermal comfort in the winter. indoor air quality, bedroom, outdoor air #NO 10075 Developing interior foliage plants for the improvement of air quality and the indoor environment. Wood R A, Burchett M D Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 253-258. Most of the people responsible for buildings and their interior design and management, probably agree that indoor plants and interior plantscaping contribute to environmental quality. There has been relatively little scientific research however, on the ability of indoor plants to reduce indoor air pollution. It had been proposed that plants may function as "green livers" and act as sinks for many trace contaminants, through the metabolism of such chemicals. This proposal is analogous to the concept of plants as the "green lungs" of the earth due to the production of oxygen through photosynthesis. During the course of evolution, the higher plants have developed an effective defense system to protect labile macromolecules against attack by scavenging free radicals and hydrogen peroxide, which are formed as a result of oxidative stresses such as extremes of temperature or air pollution. The responses of indoor plants to pollutants may provide a simple method of monitoring gaseous pollutants, as well as providing pollution abatement to improve the quality of the air for building occupants. Indoor plants have also been shown to have a positive effect on relative humidity in an office environment. In recent years, researchers from several disciplines including plant physiology, plant biochemistry, environmental psychology, clinical psychology and behavioural medicine have been investigating the benefits of contact with plants. A recent study at the University of Technology, Sydney, demonstrated enhanced alpha EEG (Occipital Electroencephalograph), in the presence of plants. The plant significantly enhanced alpha waves (9-12Hz) in the right hemisphere. No significant differences were seen in the left hemisphere. indoor air quality, humidity #NO 10076 Experimental evaluation of a breathing wall used in a natural ventilation system. Hoyano A, Sugawara M, Tanaka I Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 289-294. A Breathing Wall used as the main component in a natural ventilation system were experimentally evaluated by determining wind velocity effects on the air flowrate, heat recovery capability, and internal condensation prevention. Test conditions simulated typical winter climate in Tokyo, Japan. At the most frequent velocity 3m/s and an outdoor air temperature of 5 degrees C, the system provides sufficient ventilation corresponding to 0.26 ACH if employed in a residential house; and at the maximum wind velocity of 10m/s, the most indoor perforated aluminum-foil sheet reached 11.2 degrees C due to good heat recovery capability, with no occurrence of internal condensation. natural ventilation, wall, wind effects, condensation #NO 10077 Development of a natural ventilation system using a pitched roof of breathing walls. Sugawara M, Hoyano A Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 717-722. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the employment of a newly proposed natural ventilation system which uses a pitched roof made of Breathing Walls. The system was developed to provide sufficient ventilation for obtaining a healthy/comfortable indoor independent of other architectural elements of a house, i.e, side walls, floor members, etc. Simulation results based on typical weather climate in Tokyo, Japan showed that a pitched roof of 6-cm-thick Breathing Walls containing 11 perforated aluminum foil sheets provide 0.5 air changes per hour, and that the equivalent thermal transmittance is 0.34 and 0.38 W/m squared degrees C providing that no internal condensation occurs at the maximum wind speed of 10 m/s. natural ventilation, roof, wall #NO 10078 A study of the impacts of outdoor air and living behaviour patterns on indoor air quality - case studies of apartments in Taiwan. Chiang C M, Chou P C, Wang W A, Chao N T Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 735-740. The indoor air quality issue in Taiwan has received more and more attention due to degradation of the outdoor environment. Carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter 10 (PM) were two major pollutants, showed the high Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level reading from public monitoring station in Taiwan. The concentration of carbon dioxide CO2), as taken in ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, is termed as an index for indoor air pollution. This study intends to identify the impacts from both of outdoor air and living behaviour patterns on indoor air quality by field measurement and questionnaire survey. outdoor air, occupant behaviour, apartment building #NO 10079 Laser Doppler measurements of airflow characteristics in rooms with mechanical ventilation. Finkelstein W, Melikov A, Sefker T, Langkilde G Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 785-790. This paper describes results from comprehensive measurements of airflow characteristics in two real-scale test rooms at 44 combinations of ventilation system, air supply device, airflow rate and supply and return air temperature difference. Real field situations were simulated in the test rooms furnished, arranged and equipped as a real office. During the measurements occupants performed typical office work. A three-dimensional laser Doppler anemometer was used during the measurements. Mean air velocities up to 0.6m/s and turbulence intensities up to 70% were measured. The frequency of the velocity fluctuations that contribute up to 90% to the standard deviation of the velocity was less than 2 Hz. large changes in the direction of the instantaneous velocity vector were identified. The airflow near the walls and the floor was found to be close to two-dimensional. In the rest of the occupied zone the airflow was three-dimensional. air flow, mechanical ventilation, measurement technique #NO 10080 Air exchange through elements of building partition. Piotrowski J Z Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 827-832. The research concerns air exchange through four building elements: window, frame joints, window sill clamp and wall connections. As the result of research there have been obtained curves which determine the amount of air exchange and the character of that process. The obtained results will help to analyze the model simulating air exchange through building structures and they will also be used in research of the so called "intelligent" partitions. air change rate, partitioning #NO 10081 Comparison of air change rate measurement methods: perfluorocarbon tracer gas method and fan pressurization test. Lee K, Spengler J D, Vallarino J, Ozkaynak H Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 833-838. Air leakage rates were measured by blower door depressurization in 43 homes in Southern California during the 1995 summer season. air change rates were also calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements. The average air leakage rate of 43 homes was 0.63+- 0.33 hr. A subset of 14 homes was measured by perfluoro-metyl-cyclohexane tracer gas (PFT) for weekly air change rates. For these 14 homes, the average air change rate using the PFT method was 1.36-1.21 hr and the average air leakage rate was 0.74 - 0.4 hr. The median air change rate calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements was 1.68 hr -1. Air change rates and air leakage rates were not significantly correlated. The fan pressurization test determines the relative leakage area of a structure, while the PFT method measures average concentration of tracer gas over time. The PFT method integrates different ventilation conditions over time, while the blower door tests leakage in homes with doors, windows and vents closed. Air change rates calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements were comparable to those measured by the pFt method, but did not correlate well with air leakage rate measurements. Therefore, air change rates may be more applicable for indoor air quality investigation than air leakage rates. air change rate, measurement technique, tracer gas #NO 10082 Use of ultrasonic anemometer for characterising room air flows. Koskela H, Niemela R, Hautalampi T, Heikkinen J, Collineau S Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 845-850. The applicability of the 3-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer for measurement of turbulent room air flows was studied and the results were compared with the omnidirectional sensor. The ultrasonic anemometer is suitable for both field and laboratory and the measured vectorial velocity is directly comparable with fluid dynamics simulations. In a turbulent flow both the mean air speed and turbulence intensity measured with an omnidirectional sensor differ significantly from the corresponding vectorial results. Omnidirectional results, which are commonly used for thermal comfort assessment, can be calculated from the output of the ultrasonic anemometer. instrumentation, measurement technique, air flow #NO 10083 On-demand ventilation control: a new approach to demand-controlled ventilation. Federspiel C C Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 935-940. In this paper a new strategy for controlling ventilation systems is described. The strategy provides fresh air at a flow rate proportional to an estimate of the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide. Thus, the ventilation rate is nearly proportional to the occupant density even under transient conditions. Properties of the new strategy are described, and the performance is compared to a concentration regulating strategy ion a simulation. The new strategy is shown to respond faster to a change in the occupant density and to keep the concentration at or below a threshold. controlled ventilation, demand control #NO 10084 An experimental study on the air distribution and thermal performance of the air circulation wall. Tajima M, Kamimori K, Sakai K, Hayashi T, Ishihara O Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 941-946. The air circulation wall is a triple envelope and double air layer system of outside walls and roofs. Its midst envelope is a thermal insulation board and divides the wall into tow air layers. Since its outer air layer works like a solar collector, this system increases indoor air temperature in winter under closed air circulation. In summer, its open air circulation exhausts hot air to the outdoor. many Japanese wooden houses with this air circulation system have been constructed. however, many problems are remained for its optimum designing such as the precise prediction of thermal characteristics in the layers, etc. This paper investigates the air distribution and thermal performance of the air circulation system through real-size model experiments. thermal performance, wall, cold climate #NO 10085 Chemical reactions in ventilation ducts.

A reaction between styrene and ozone was studied in simulated ventilation equipment. The gases were generated continuously and passed through a 6.0m PTFE tube for 23 seconds. Sampling was performed at the end of the tube with Tenax TA and a s Sep-Pak DNPH-Silica cartridge. It was found that a reaction between styrene and ozone occurred in the PTFE tube with formaldehyde and benzaldehyde as the main reaction products. Twenty-three seconds is a reasonable time for outdoor air to pass through the duct to the supply air terminal device in a building, thus showing that the same reaction between VOCs and ozone in the supply air is possible. duct, pollutant, sampling, measurement technique, organic compound #NO 10086 The effect of recirculation on air change effectiveness calculations. Federspiel C C, Johnson Controls Inc Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 971-976. It is shown that conventional methods of evaluating air-change effectiveness from age-of-air calculations are affected by recirculation. The result is that when air is recirculated, the conventional air-change effectiveness measure cannot be used to make judgments about the air distribution pattern in zones without knowledge of the recirculation fraction. To overcome this problem, a ventilation performance measure called the relative air-change effectiveness is defined. It is shown that the relative air-change effectiveness is independent of the recirculation fraction and that it may be determined solely for age-of-air calculations. The data from a previously published experiment on a mechanically ventilated building is re-evaluated using the relative air-change effectiveness. calculation techniques, air change rate #NO 10087 The effect of supplying fresh air directly to AC rooms on indoor air quality. Liu Y, Shen J Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 989-994. In air-conditioned (AC) rooms, complaints of unacceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) are increasing. One of the main reasons is that the fresh air supply becomes polluted when passed through an air conditioning system. Occupants need the characteristic odor of fresh air. A research project has been conducted over the past 3 years, in which fresh air is provided directly to AC rooms with a fresh air unit. The effect of fresh air upon the distribution of indoor air temperature and velocity could be minimized by different outlets, velocities, angles and mixture of methods of fresh air. The practical data for using the fresh air unit are suggested. indoor air quality, air conditioning, odour #NO 10088 Olfactory and chemical emissions of ventilation ducts. Torkki A, Seppanen O Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 995-1000. The main purpose of the research was to characterize the sensory and chemical emission rates of ventilation ducts in different environmental conditions. Ducts with different levels of contamination were studied under different temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. The temperature and relative humidity values were on the range of that normally used in a ductwork system. The air velocity changed between 0.1 m/s and 1.5 m/s. The following three ducts were tested: two new ducts, of which the first one was cleaned with normally used solvent and the second one was not cleaned after leaving from the production line, and the third one, which was a twenty year old dirty supply air duct from an office building. A trained panel assessed the decipol levels of the flow rate before and after the ducts. Volatile organic compounds were also determined before and after the ducts. The results showed that the air flow rate had statistically significant effect on the source strength of the ducts measured in olfs. The source strength of the new uncleaned and old dirty ducts increased with increasing air flow rate. The effect on the source strength of the new cleaned duct was opposite. The temperature and relative humidity of the air did not have statistically significant effect on the odor emission of the ducts. The chemical emissions of the new ducts were negative on average, which means that the surface of the ducts absorbs chemical compounds rather than desorbs. The old duct did not seem to have the ability to absorb chemical compounds as much as the new ducts had. The cleaning of the ductwork proved to be necessary. duct, occupant reaction, odour, organic compound #NO 10089 Economic analysis of ventilation in Swedish schools 1897-1994. Jonsson A Indoor Air '96, proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, held July 21-26, 1996, Nagoya, Japan, Volume 3, pp 1021-1026. A new formula, showing that the outdoor air rate should follow the square root of the standard of living, GNP/cap in fixed prices, is derived. Calculations with the formula shows that the increase of the outdoor air rate since 1880 in Swedish schools and the increase according to norm values for outdoor air rates, in schools coincide within limits of the accuracy of the calculation methods and within limits of how the norm values are interpreted. GNP/cap expresses the value of production per person and year. So the loss of a fraction of a years work is much more costly to day than in the 19th century. This means that we need a higher outdoor air rate to day to reduce the loss from bad indoor air. school, ventilation system, survey #NO 10090 Effect of ventilation rate on air quality perception in a 55,000 square meter office building.

This study evaluates the effect of changing the ventilation rate in a modern office building with no problem history. On separate weeks the ventilation was controlled to the ASHRAE design rate (0.4 ACH), no mechanical ventilation (infiltration of �0.2 ACH), and full economizer (1.0 ACH). 45 chemical constituents were measured. Chemical concentrations were relatively low even at minimum rates and were further reduced by increasing ventilation. Daily occupant surveys evaluating 25 measures of environment, mood, odor, and symptoms demonstrated a consistently high degree of acceptance unaffected by changes in ventilation rates. Incremental changes in ventilation rates may have negligible impact on office environments since chemical concentrations and complaints are generally quite low at existing rates. ventilation rate, indoor air quality, office building #NO 10091 The effect of measures to alleviate the symptoms of asthma on concentrations of VOCs and formaldehyde in UK homes.

The homes of 30 asthmatic patients living in the South of England have been subjected to interventions involving the installation of a mechanical ventilation system and/or the supply of a high efficiency vacuum cleaner. A further 10 homes of asthmatic patients were recruited to the study as a control group. The interventions were aimed primarily at reducing the number of dust mites in the homes. Concentrations of VOCs and formaldehyde were recorded in the homes on three occasions prior to and on five occasions following the interventions. No significant difference was found in the concentration of total VOCs in any group of homes before and after the date of intervention. Homes in which a mechanical ventilation system had been installed showed significantly lower formaldehyde concentrations in the bedroom after the installation than before this time; no significant difference occurred in the groups that were controls or received a vacuum cleaner without mechanical ventilation. allergies, formaldehyde, residential building More abstracts WT01-B07-71IA068-000417-B014-288http://www.aivc.org:80/ra73_1.html 194.217.120.80 19970113035135 text/html 48678HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 03:51:13 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 48505Last-modified: Thu, 05 Sep 1996 10:00:22 GMT More abstracts Ventilation in school buildings #NO 9596 Energyefficiency in schools: ECBCS Annex 15 Final report.

This study was conducted in response to those complaints.The object was to determine how well the ventilation system performedby measuring levels of metabolically augmented carbon dioxide.Carbon dioxide levels were measured by a direct-read infraredanalyser in each of nine classrooms and three hallway corridors.Tests were conducted during six sampling days in the spring of1985 and seven sampling days in the autumn of 1985. The performanceof the ventilation system, based on measurements of carbon dioxidelevels, appeared to be relatively poor during the first threesampling days of April 1985. In some classrooms carbon dioxidelevels were close to or exceeded 2500 ppm. These sampling datescoincided with complaints of poor indoor air quality being receivedby physical plant personnel the variable air volume HVAC systemwas subject to numerous mechanical and operating problems at thesame time. However, in late spring and early autumn carbon dioxidelevels were observed to be consistently below the new ASHRAE ventilationstandard of 1000 ppm. This performance indicates that a variableair volume HVAC system can be operated to provide a consistentlyadequate level of ventilation in a classroom building.

ABSTRACT An elementary school in Pennsylvania was tested in thespring of 1990 and discovered to have elevations ranging from5.5 to 76 pCi/l in 25 different rooms. The school is divided betweenan older wing that is a slab on grade with an access tunnel aroundthe perimeter and a newer wing that has half the classrooms overa slab and the other half over a walk out multipurpose room, kitchenand maintenance room. Although typically the operation of a univentheater will reduce radon concentrations in a room because of theintroduction of outside air, it was discovered however that inthe older wing of the school, the heaters were responsible fora significant portion of the radon entering the classrooms. Thispaper is a review of the operation of the univent heaters andalterations to the units and the operation of the building inorder to determine the radon pathways and how they might be controlled.

ABSTRACT Uncontrolled airflow, including duct leakage, pressureimbalances caused by closed interior doors, and exhaust/intakeairflow imbalance, was characterized in 70 commercial buildings.In 18 of these buildings, uncontrolled airflows were repairedand energy savings from these repairs were monitored. In mostbuildings, the retrofit was duct repair. In other cases, outdoorairflow was reduced and return air transfers were provided. Coolingenergy use was reduced by an average 15.1% in these 18 buildings.With an average repair cost of $455 and average cooling energysavings of $195 per year, uncontrolled airflow retrofits provedto be very cost-effective. Various factors indicate that greaterenergy savings could be achieved in the future.

AUTHOR Rousseau M J BIBINF Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, March 1996, 40pp. ABSTRACT An investigation was conducted of the effect of decreasingthe air leakage area across internal partitions of a typical modernhigh-rise apartment. The objective of this work was to study thepracticality of increased compartmentalization or separation ofthe living units from each other and from the corridors and verticalshafts in the building. Typically, the main barrier to air movementthrough a high-rise apartment building is the exterior skin orenvelope. Walls and doors between corridors, units and elevatorshafts and stairwells are much less airtight, and significantvolumes of air can move between these different areas of the buildinginterior under relatively small pressure differences. Some disadvantagesof this arrangement are that individual occupants can affect airmovement through the entire building by leaving windows or balconydoors open in their units, odours and pollutants produced in onearea of the building may be transferred to other areas, exteriorwalls and windows have large pressure differences across themwhich drives air and rain through any defect, and special measuresto control smoke migration during fires must be provided. Theobjectives of this study were to measure the actual pressure differencesacross various separations within a high-rise apartment building,to generate and analyze potential ways of reducing the air leakagethrough these separations, and to draw conclusions on their effectson air movement in the building, including changes in operationof typical current ventilation strategies and fire and smoke controlmeasures.

ABSTRACT This study deals with the modeling of air pollution inapartments from laboratory measurements of source strengths, usingformaldehyde and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) as modelpollutants. The sources in two test apartments were grouped intotwo building-related sources and occupant-related sources. Themeasured source strengths and ventilation rates were used forthe prediction of concentrations expected in the apartments. Thesepredictions were compared to measurements in the apartment over12 months. The conclusions were that the model predictions basedon emission rates measured in the laboratory can be used to predictthe long-term concentration of the two model pollutants in theapartments. Considering the measured differences in ventilationbetween the apartments, and occupant emission rate of between0.2 and 0.3 mg/h/kg body weight could be estimated. Based on previoussuggested limits of acceptable exposures of humans to VOCs, anacceptable average emission rate of VOCs from building materialsin general was estimated to be about 30 ug/m2/h. The modelingshowed that during the first 200 days, building materials dominatedthe emissions. After this, sources relating to the occupants dominated.On average about half of the VOC pollution originated from thebuilding materials.

ABSTRACT Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) operationcan play a crucial role in controlling indoor radon concentrations.Both the introduction of fresh air and the pressurization of anindoor radon concentration levels. Using an in-house computermodel, this paper examines the impact of configurational and operationalparameters of a building and HVAC system on indoor radon concentrationsin a large building. To achieve this, a three-phase approach wasfollowed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, inferencesare drawn about the influence of the parameters on indoor radonconcentrations and the efficacy of radon mitigation strategiesis examined. Results indicate that building ventilation rate andthe OA/EA ratio are significant parameters that affect indoorradon concentration.

AUTHOR Wang J, Ogilvie J R BIBINF USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 2, 1996, 12 figs,8 tabs, refs. ABSTRACT Air velocities in the occupied zone were measured ina full-size, slot-outlet and slot-inlet ventilated (SOSIV), unoccupiedroom. The measurements were taken at different room heights withtwo outlet/inlet locations, five levels of outlet jet momentum,with and without floor heating. the near floor air-flow in theSOSIV room possesses velocity and turbulence profiles similarto those of a fully developed wall jet. The velocity and turbulenceprofiles measured at the rooms mid-length are similar, with eachrepresenting the mirror image of the other. A full model was proposedto predict the floor-level air velocity in the SOSIV room. Fora given room aspect ratio and a given outlet/inlet location, thefloor-level air velocity can be uniquely determined by the jetmomentum ratio under isothermal conditions and is determined byboth the jet momentum ratio and the thermal buoyancy under nonisothermalconditions. The outlet and inlet locations and the room aspectratio can significantly affect the floor-level air velocity. Theresults can be applied to industrial plants and agricultural buildings.

ABSTRACT Proper distribution of conditioned air plays an importantrole in both the comfort of the occupants and the air qualityof ventilated or air-conditioned spaces. Conditioned air shouldbe supplied in proper quantities and temperatures to meet variousthermal requirements of occupied spaces. Large air velocities,temperature gradients, and turbulence intensities should be avoidedsince these factors, either individually or combined, may causedraft, which is undesirable for occupants. The main objectivesof this study were to evaluate the air distribution performanceindex (ADPI) based on measured centerline data and determine theeffect of turbulence on ADPA. The data were collected in a largetest room (24 by 16 by 9ft) with a high sidewall grille. The air-flowcharacteristics at the centerline of the room for 21 test casesunder both isothermal and nonisothermal flow conditions were investigated.The results showed that ADPI results were strongly dependent onthe room heat load and the airflow rate. The effect of turbulenceon ADPI was investigated using a comfort model, and a modifiedADPI model was presented. The results showed that the turbulenceintensity strongly affected ADPI values at high airflow rates.

AUTHOR Chow W K, Wong L T BIBINF Indoor Built Environ, No 5, 1996, pp 82-98, 23 figs, 2tabs, 23 refs. ABSTRACT The air flow characteristics induced by discharging airinto a climate chamber with and without a high sidewall grillwere studied experimentally. Over five hundred and thirty thousandvalues of the air speed were collected at positions above thefloor level, near the supply inlet and the exhaust outlet. Thethermal comfort indices due to temperature and air speed weremeasured under five flow conditions, two with a diffuser and threewithout a diffuser. An evaluation of thermal comfort using theair diffusion performance index (ADPI) and percentage dissatisfied(PD) was made. Macroscopic numbers describing the air flow studiedwere, the Archimedes number, the Reynolds number and the jet momentumnumber. The Reynolds number and the jet momentum number increasedas the total supply flow rate increased. However, the Archimedesnumber decreased with increasing flow rates. The Archimedes numberwas found to be correlated with the Reynolds number, which mightbe because they are defined by parameters related to the air velocityV and temperature difference. The ADPI was found to be linearlyrelated to the jet momentum number and related directly to thePD. The throw of the diffuser was found to be related to the correctedArchimedes number. The jet momentum number and Archimedes numberare related to the air speed, the root mean square of the airspeed and the turbulence intensity.

AUTHOR Chen Q BIBINF UK, Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 3, 1996, pp 233-244,10 figs, 27 refs. ABSTRACT The test results are presented from three Reynolds-stressmodels (two isotropization of production models and a quasi-isotropicmodel) and the standard k-e model for predicting typical airflowin a room. The flow patterns studied are natural convection, forcedconvection and mixed convection in a room and an impinging jetflow. Experimental data from the literature is used for validation.The results show that the computations and the experimental dataare in agreement for the mean air velocities, but less satisfactoryfor the turbulent quantities. The performance of the three Reynolds-stressmodels is similar, they all predict anisotropic turbulence andsecondary recirculation existing in a room airflow for which thek-e model fails. However, the Reynolds-stress models require additionalcomputing effort compared to the k-e model.

AUTHOR Chow T-T, Ip F, Dunn A, Tse W L BIBINF USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 2, 1996, [Preprint],6 figs, 1 tab. ABSTRACT Fluid mass and energy flows in air-conditioning systemsvary with the changing output demand. In lengthy or complex ductworkand pipework, the accuracy in simulating the dynamic network behavioris greatly affected by the accuracy in modeling the radial energylosses and the axial transport lag. Transport delay considerationis also vital in the study of heat exchanger dynamics. This paperreviews the development of transport delay models in fluid conduitflow. A new numerical model is recommended in which the thermalbehavior of fluid elements can be traced per physical distancetraveled in unit time step. Justifications by sensitivity andfrequency response analyses were performed. The results of analytical,experimental, as well as intermodel comparisons demonstrate thepromising accuracy of the numerical model introduced.

AUTHOR Katipamula S BIBINF USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 2, 1996 [Preprint],14 figs, 6 tabs, refs. ABSTRACT The 1994 Great Energy Predictor Shootout II (GEPS) sponsoredby ASHRAE Technical Committees TC 4.7, Energy Calculations andTC 1.5, Computer Applications, involved modeling/predicting heating,cooling, and electric energy consumption in two large institutionalbuildings in central Texan (an engineering center and a businessschool building). This paper describes the methodology used byone of the winning GEPS entries. Energy consumption in a largecommercial building is a complex function of climatic conditions,building characteristics, building use, system characteristics,and type of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC)equipment used. Therefore, multiple linear regression (MLR) modelsand non linear modeling approaches, such as artificial neuralnet work (ANN) models, tend to provide better modeling capabilitiesthan simple linear regression modeling approaches. The heatingand cooling energy consumption in both buildings is modeled usingthe MLR approach. The electric energy consumption at both sitesis weather-independent and is a function of only the buildingsoperating schedule; therefore, it is modeled using a daytypingalgorithm. At the engineering center, the coefficient of variation(CV) for electric energy end-uses varied from 1% to 6% while theCV for cooling energy consumption and heating energy consumptionvaried from 10% to 33%. At the business school building, the CVfor electric energy end-use varied from 5% to 14% while the CVfor Ec and Eh consumption varied from 27% to 36%.

AUTHOR Haberl J S, Thamilseran S BIBINF USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 2, 1996, 12 figs,5 tabs, refs. ABSTRACT A second predictor shootout contest has been developedand conducted to evaluate the most effective empirical or inversemodels for modeling hourly whole-building energy baselines forpurposes of measuring savings from energy conservation retrofits.This second contest utilized two sets of measured hourly pre-retrofitand post-retrofit data from buildings participating in a revolvingloan program in Texas (Claridge et al 1996), The accuracy of thecontestants models was evaluated by determining their abilityto predict data that were carefully removed from the training(or pre-retrofit) period. A comparison of the savings predictedby the models is also presented. The results from the contestshow that neural networks again provide the most accurate modelof a buildings energy use. However, in contrast to the first contest(Kreider and Haberl 1994a), the second contest results show thatcleverly assembled statistical models also appear to be a accurateor, in some cases, more accurate than some of the neural networkentries. When these models were used to forecast the baselineuse into the post-retrofit period, large variations in the predictedsavings occurred among the models, particularly for the coolingenergy savings in one of the case study buildings. These variationsappear to be due to the ability of the models (or inability) tocapture certain energy performance characteristics and the modelersassumptions about the post-retrofit energy use.

ABSTRACT The principle of good design for natural ventilationis to "build tight - ventilate right". A building cannotbe `too tight', but it may be under-ventilated. There is considerablescope for making UK buildings tighter. However, simpler techniquesneed to be developed (especially in large non domestic buildings)to identify envelope tightness and associated leakage paths. Alsoguidance needs to be provided on constructing tighter envelopes.Studies necessary to assess the implication of tighter buildingsare described. Sufficient information is available on ventilationrequirements necessary to satisfy safety and health criteria.However, criteria relating to comfort, especially those associatedwith odour, metabolic CO and summer overheating need to be investigated.The paper also discusses minimising the effects of tobacco smokeand controlling other internally generated pollutants. Guidelinesfor natural ventilation design may conflict with other designor climate-responsive strategies, future work should address this,and address issues such as ventilation openings (to provide both"background" and "rapid" ventilation) anddesign for deeper, naturally ventilated buildings.

AUTHOR Rousseau P G, Mathews E H BIBINF UK, Energy and Buildings, No 23, 1996, pp 231-236, 8 figs,5 refs. ABSTRACT In many cases natural ventilation may be sufficient toensure acceptable comfort levels in occupied buildings. In thesecases, installation of energy-intensive active environmental controlsystems will not be necessary. This will result in considerableenergy and cost savings and also indirectly in a reduced burdenon the environment, since the use of energy is always associatedwith the production of waste materials. This paper describes thedevelopment of a new model to predict natural ventilation flowrates in buildings. The model is based on the concept of a flownetwork where openings are represented by non-linear flow resistances.It takes into account the effect of both wind-induced pressuresand pressures due to thermal forces. The model draws on a healthybalance between purely theoretical equations and empirical data.The new flow model was linked to an existing thermal model toproduce a new integrated design tool for naturally ventilatedbuildings. It takes into account the important interaction betweenthe flow model and the thermal model and can therefore be usedto predict the natural ventilation flow rates as well as the resultingindoor air temperatures. The applicability of the new tool isillustrated through a case study. From this it is clear that thetool can be used successfully to optimize passive building design.The optimized design illustrated here not only results in minimuminitial cost, but also in improved passive thermal comfort insummertime and a reduction in winter heating energy consumption.

ABSTRACT This paper describes two projects that were specificallydesigned to be energy efficient and environmentally responsible:one residential and one commercial. It was expected that the projectswould achieve significant reductions relative to conventionalbuildings in five areas: operating energy, embodied energy, wateruse, use of ozone-depleting chemicals, and construction wastemanagement. Both buildings were intended to be leading edge, showinghow far buildings could reasonably go to minimize their environmentalimpact. While setting percentage reduction in building operatingenergy was relatively easy, setting targets in the other areaswas difficult. For the other four areas, there was little informationon conventional practice, the impact of alternative practices,and what a reasonable environmental target would be. This paperdescribes the analysis that was carried out in each of the fiveareas for the two buildings.

AUTHOR Jagemar L BIBINF Sweden, Gotheborg, Chalmers University of Technology, Deptof Building Services Engineering, 1996, 237pp. ABSTRACT A methodology for planning and design of energy efficientbuildings is presented and analysed. The starting point is thedefinition that energy efficiency is a question of minimizingthe energy end-use within realistic economic frames and fullypreserved function. The methodology is based on a systematic approachto the issue of energy efficiency. One element in this is theintroduction of a number of energy related ratios, Energy PerformanceRatios, that characterise the influence of building parts andthe technical systems of the building on the energy end-use ofthe building as an entirety. These ratios are selected and formulatedso that they facilitate a systematic strive towards high energyefficiency when applied in planning and design of buildings. Inthe present work the methodology is applied primarily on designand rating of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systemswith a focus on commercial buildings. However, the methodologyitself is not meant to be limited to these applications. The basicidea is that it should be applied on all the parts of the buildingthat have an obvious influence on the energy end-use.

ABSTRACT A simple and accurate technique to directly measure theoutdoor air delivery rates to building occupants is presented.A few (two to three) measurements of tracer concentrations aresufficient for calculation. Experimental results show that thecalculated outdoor air change rates from the tracer gas experimentsagreed well with the outdoor airflow rates measured independentlyby nozzles. A relationship between the local outdoor air exchangerate and the mean age of air was derived. The proposed techniqueprovides a way of simplifying the measurement of mean age of airand correcting experimental errors. Experimental results showthat almost all the errors in the mean age of air (a maximum of20% in our tests) caused by inaccurate timing of the start ofa tracer gas step-up process (tracer buildup) can be correctedby the proposed method. The underestimated ages of air in thestep-down processes (tracer decay) were also successfully corrected.

ABSTRACT It is shown that comparing measured indoor and outdoorcontaminant concentrations can be misleading if the concentrationsvary with time and if the averaging periods are too short. Inthis article an alternative methodology aimed at estimating theinternal source and sink effects in mechanically ventilated buildingsis described. The methodology is based on both the results fromcontinuous measurements, and calculations under transient conditions.The relative importance of indoor sources and outdoor sourcesis established by a comparison of the measured indoor concentrationand a calculated indoor concentration of a compound. Furthermore,dynamic calculations are used to investigate how the indoor concentrationsof contaminants originating outdoors and contaminants emittedfrom indoor sources are influenced by temporal reductions of theairflow rate. Reducing the outdoor airflow rate during periodswith high outdoor concentrations can significantly reduce theindoor levels of pollutants for situations in which the outdoorsources are more important than the indoor sources.

AUTHOR Sekhar S C, Tham K W, Lee S E BIBINF Indoor Built Environ, No 5, 1996, pp 99-105, 5 figs, 3tabs, 8 refs. ABSTRACT The problems associated with poor indoor air qualitymay in most cases be attributed to poorly designed and poorlyperforming ventilation systems. The problems in a mechanicallyair-conditioned building are compounded if the building is fairlyair tight and depends on fresh air provision at the central freshair intake in the air handling unit (AHU). The performance ofsuch a ventilation system not only depends on the quantity offresh air provided at the fresh air intake but the manner in whichthis air is distributed around the various zones in the building.The ventilation performance, characterised by the space air distribution,may be dictated by either the initial design and commissioningof the different components of the air-conditioning system, suchas the AHU, ducts, diffusers, etc. or subsequent changes in theoffice space layout and furnishing. This paper deals with thedetermination of some key ventilation parameters such as the airchange rate, the age of air and the air exchange efficiency, allof which lead to an insight into the performance of the ventilationsystem. The approach is case-study-based and the methodology involvestracer gas analysis employing the concentration decay method asa means of determining the key parameters.

ABSTRACT This study examines the effectiveness of using carbondioxide-based, demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) to provideadequate indoor air quality with minimum energy use. A detailedbuilding energy analysis program (ENERPASS) was combined witha contaminant-level prediction program (CONTAM87) to perform theanalysis. The combined program was used to evaluate the annualheating and cooling energy consumption and carbon dioxide andformaldehyde concentrations. The assessment was made on a mid-sizecommercial building designed to comply with ASHRAE Standard 90.1.Three separate heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC)systems were studied: single zone (ie. multiple roof top units),multizone, and variable air volume (VAV). The simulations weremade for five ventilation control strategies: fixed ventilation;building return air controlled to 1,000 ppm and 800 ppm; floorreturn air controlled to 1,000 ppm; and each zone controlled to1,000 ppm.

ABSTRACT This paper investigates the effect ventilation has onthe sensory evaluation of indoor air quality by occupants andvisitors, both trained in air quality evaluation and untrained,during three separate periods in a London office building. Resultsfrom the study suggested that trained panels used to judge thelevel of indoor air quality failed to indicate the level of occupantdissatisfaction. A naive panel also failed to show agreement witheither occupant or trained panel assessment of indoor air quality.Occupants may perceive indoor air quality as unacceptable, butodour is not considered the main problem. This suggests that theassessment of odour levels gives a poor indication of indoor airquality. The study revealed no statistically significant correlationbetween perceived indoor air quality and ventilation rates.

AUTHOR Jaakola J J K BIBINF Finland, Espoo, 1995, Helsinki University of Technology,Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Lab. of Heating, Ventilatingand Air Conditioning, Report A2, 121pp. ABSTRACT This thesis studied empirically the air handling etiologyof the non specific symptoms of the eyes, respiratory tract, skin,and central nervous system in office workers, often termed thesick building syndrome. The results of a four-period crossovertrial in 75 office workers suggest that 70% air recirculationwhen accompanied by an adequate intake of outdoor air can be usedwithout causing adverse effects. A cross-sectional study of 2678workers in 41 randomly selected office buildings from Helsinkimetropolitan area provides evidence that mechanical ventilation,air conditioning, steam and evaporative humidification and airrecirculation are risk indicators of studied symptoms in the existingFinnish office building stock. The results also suggest that outdoor-airventilation rates below the optimal increase the risk of the sickbuilding syndrome symptoms with such sources of pollutants aspresent in mechanically ventilated office buildings. Theoreticalexamination reveals that the sick building syndrome is a figurativeconcept of everyday language, rather than a singular disease entity.A theoretical model, the Office Environment Model, is presentedto explain relations between the office environment and health.

ABSTRACT Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been simultaneouslymeasured indoors and outdoors at 50 sparsely occupied telecommunications(Telco) offices, 9 variably occupied data centers and 11 denselyoccupied administrative (Admin) offices. Comparisons among thethree building types, as well as within each of the building types,showed the influence of ventilation and sources. On average, theTelco and Admin facilities were better ventilated than the DataCenters, and the geometric mean of the 1/0`s (sum of the concentrationsof identified VOCs) at Telco (3.2) and Admin (5.3) facilitieswere lower than at Data Centers (8.6) Admin Offices had more andstronger sources than Telco Offices, when comparably ventilatedfacilities were compared, many VOCs had 1/0 ratios that were significantlylarger at the Admin Offices, Furthermore, certain VOCs were detectedin Admin but not Telco Offices. The influence of human occupancyon indoor VOCs was gauged by comparing sparsely and densely occupiedbuildings. Octamethylcyclotrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane(D5), n-dodecan (n-C12) through n-hexadecane (n-C16), limonene,and, to a lesser extent, tetrachloroethylene were all presentin higher concentrations when there were more occupants (per unitarea). Within this set of compounds, D5 was the best marker ofoccupant density.

AUTHOR Yu K N, Young E C M, Chan T F, Lo T, Balendran R V BIBINF UK, Building and Environment, Vol 31, No 3, 1996, pp 255-257,4 figs, 6 refs. ABSTRACT The radon exhalation rates from four concrete blockscast with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and four with substitutionof pulverized fuel ash (PFA) were monitored for 34 months startingfrom November 1992. At the end of the 28th month, two OPC blocksand two PFA blocks were immersed in water, one from each groupfor 5 days the other one from each group for 10 days. These werethen taken out of water and the radon exhalation rates monitoredas usual. It was observed that the radon exhalation rate in generaldecreased with the age of the concrete blocks and the rate increasedafter the blocks were immersed in water. An explanation for thefirst result is that the gradual dehydration of concrete as itages will reduce the water content in the pores of the concrete,thus reducing the probability of retaining radon within the poresand the probability of radon emanation from these pores. The secondresult gives strong support to this assertion. KEYWORDS radon, concrete, building material #NO 9662 Radonmeasurement in schools. Self-paced training workbook.

Many ofthe occupants exhibited such symptoms. It is shown that the low-frequencycomponent of ventilation noise is often being amplified in thetightly sealed rooms.

AUTHOR Saman N F, Johnstone H W BIBINF USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 2, 1996, [preprint],10 figs, 3 tabs, refs. ABSTRACT A methodology for a psychrometric analysis of the problemof maintaining space temperature and humidity in non-humidity-generatingspaces is presented. Such spaces produce minimum or no latentload. Several different humidification schemes, including isothermal(steam generation) and adiabatic (evaporative cooling), were analyzed.Sometimes design engineers use outside air economizers with steamhumidifiers to save energy. In some cases, the addition of a steamhumidifier to an air-handling system with an outside air economizercycle was seen to require more energy than running the same systemon minimal outside air with mechanical refrigeration and substantiallylower moisture load. Because individual locations have differentoperational parameters, this sort of analysis is done by the designengineer as a tool in the selection and design of an appropriatehumidification system.

ABSTRACT An initial survey has been conducted to assess a self-administeredquestionnaire, finger-print and liking score which are aimed atquantifying, in a simple manner, occupants perceptions of theirinterior environments, 450 questionnaires have been analysed.The average liking scores for groups of occupants range between- 14% and +19%. The questionnaire responses have been found tobe consistent in two test-retests and in agreement with an earlierindependent survey. The results from four groups of occupantsin four different buildings, (208 responses), naturally ventilatedand air conditioned, are discussed in detail. In general therewas agreement between the liking scores and building sicknessscores but two buildings, each with a Building Sickness Scoreof 1.7, had liking scores of +19% and +1%. The questionnaire alsorevealed that office temperature, occupant health, and daylightwere important factors.

ABSTRACT When 207 subjects wearing their own clothing were randomlyassigned to 9 conditions, consisting of 3 levels of vertical thermalgradient (nominally 0, 2& 4K/m), and 3 levels of estimatedwhole-body heat loss (40, 48 & 56 W/m2 as measured on a similarly-clothedand seated thermal manikin, corresponding to warm, neutral andcool conditions respectively, "warm" being 1.4K aboveneutral in terms of operative temperature, and "cool"being 1.4K below) and exposed for 1 hour, local thermal discomfortwas reported by 45% of the group. Local and whole body discomfortsensations were unaffected by thermal gradient (P>0.30), butwere strongly affected by operative temperature (P<0.001). Discomfort due to dry air was unaffected by thermal gradient (P> 0.30) but increased significantly with operative temperature (P>0.001).Discomfort due to dry eyes increased significantly above 2 K/m(P<0,001), but was unaffected by operative temperature (P> 0.80).Individual difference in thermal and air quality requirementsare shown to be sufficient to cause the thermal discomfort associatedwith thermal gradients up to 4 K/m.

ABSTRACT The near-zone of an air inlet device is the most criticalpart of a room as regards fulfillment of the thermal conform demands.An acceptable solution for residential buildings can be to supplythe outdoor air through an air device place behind a radiator.Such a device provides a mechanical exhaust system that suppliespre-heated outdoor air. Normally radiator air devices are locatedbelow a window and window-sill. To examine the influence of awindow-sill placed above an air device, several different positionsand breadths of sills were tested. Air velocities, and air temperatureswere measured at distances within 0.50m from the device. The measurementsshow that thermal comfort is strongly dependent on the locationof the window-sill in relation to the air device. The degree ofturbulence intensity affects the percentage of dissatisfied peopledue to draught. The velocity measurement system used in this studyallows variation of the time constant of the system. When differenttime constants were used, the measured turbulence intensity variedconsiderable. Some measurements were carried out with the radiatorswitched off. In these cases different air velocities were measured,depending on the orientation of the sensors. This seems to bedue to the temperature and velocity gradients at the measuringpoints.

A proper designof the air conditioning systems is required in order to achievea satisfactory result. In 1963 UNI 5104 came into force in Italy,dealing with supply, order and testing of the systems. UNI 5104was updated in April 1991, as far as indoor air quality was concerned,but was still very rough. The minimum air change rate was fixedat 15 m3/(h person) for non smoking rooms and at 20-25 m3/(h person)if smoking is allowed. Higher values were foreseen for meetingrooms and cinemas, theatres and similar buildings. Furthermoresome general "suggestions" were given about the airfiltration.

ABSTRACT District heating and cooling (DHC) can provide multipleopportunities to reduce air emissions associated with space conditioningand electricity generation, which contribute 30% to 50% of allsuch emissions. When DHC is combined with cogeneration (CHP) maximumreductions in sulfur oxides (SOx) nitrogen oxides (NOx) carbondioxide (CO2), particulates, and ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) refrigerants can most effectively be achieved. Althoughsignificant improvements in air quality have been documented inEurope and Scandinavia due to DHC and CHP implementation, accuratelypredicting such improvements has been difficult. Without acceptablequantification methods, regulatory bodies are reluctant to grantair emissions credits, and local community leaders are unwillingto invest in DHC and CHP as preferred methods of providing energyor strategies for air quality improvement. The recent developmentand release of a number of computer models designed specificallyto provide quantification of air emissions that can result fromDHP and CHP implementation should help provide local, state, andnational policymakers with information vital to increasing supportand investment in DHC development.

ABSTRACT Historically, residential energy efficiency serviceshave been subsidized by utility ratepayers and by taxpayers throughfederal and state government programs. Over the last 10 years,customers have received free home energy audits, large rebatesfor efficiency products and services, and in some instances, freeefficiency measures. Now with deregulation of the utility industryon the horizon, along with cutbacks in federal and state spending,money is becoming less available for these programs. As a result,providers of residential energy services are beginning to lookfor ways to generate income that can cover all or most of thecosts of providing these services. The major challenge ahead isdetermining how to design programs in which customers value theservices enough to pay for them. Through a series of four communityefficiency projects, Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation(WECC) is striving to determine if residential efficiency servicescan indeed be self-sustaining, or if they will perpetually requiresome level of subsidy to exist.

ABSTRACT The energy cost of monitoring and controlling a buildingenvironment is a serious consideration for the heating, ventilating,and air-conditions (HVAC) engineering industry. This work is focusedon minimizing the energy cost associated with the control of variable-airvolume (VAV) systems. All the experimental work was performedusing a low-speed wind tunnel. The authors modified a low-speedwind tunnel to simulate a single VAV system. We also developeda dynamic model of the system and analyzed its energy consumptioncharacteristics. Conventional proportional and integral (PI) control,adaptive control and optimal control algorithms were developedand applied to the duct pressure control loop within the VAV system.A comparison of the performance of these control algorithms indicatesthat an optimal control strategy can save up to 30% of the energyconsumed in a system that employs a conventional PI control scheme.

ABSTRACT Laboratory animal ventilation systems should be designedto provide acceptable environmental conditions within the roomand within cages. This study was conducted to review and evaluateventilation strategies for improving thermal and air quality conditionsin laboratory animal facilities. It has long been recognized thatthe cage microenvironment can be considerably different from theroom macroenvironment. However, most research on laboratory animalventilation has focused on room conditions. There is limited informationregarding ventilation rates, room air distribution, and otherfactors required to maintain acceptable and uniform environmentin all animal cages. Current ventilation guidelines are basedlargely on room conditions, not on cage microenvironment. Recommendedroom ventilation rates (10 to 15 outside air changes per hour[ACH]) are based on keeping odors below objectionable levels forhumans and have little scientific basis. Recent research showsthat the recommended room air exchange rate of 10 to 15 ACH isenergy intensive yet does not ensure adequate air quality forlaboratory animals. Field studies show that numerous types ofair diffusers are being used in typical laboratory animal rooms,and most rooms have high-supply, high-return systems. Expert surveyresults indicate that designers prefer or specify laminar flowceiling diffusers, low exhaust location and small laboratory rooms.

ABSTRACT This paper presents the results of experimental researchperformed to study the flow characteristics of isothermal jetsissuing from vortex diffusers and to compare the vortex diffusersperformance with that of a conventional diffuser. Two styles ofvortex diffusers and one conventional circular ceiling diffuserwere used. For each diffuser, measurements were performed to obtaina velocity map, velocity profile, and velocity decay at threedifferent flow rates. A series of flow visualization experimentswas undertaken to capture the general behavior of jets issuingfrom the diffusers. Overall, it was found that the vortex diffusersproduce slightly more induction (mixing) of ambient air in comparisonto the conventional diffuser. This difference is probably causedby the turbulence produced as a result of the rotational motionnear the outlet of the vortex diffusers. The rotational motiondisappears within three outlet diameters, and the flow becomesradial.

ABSTRACT Data were collected in a large test room (24 by 16 by9ft [7.3 by 4.9 by 2.7m]) with a high sidewall grille. the airflowcharacteristics at the centerline of the room for 21 test casesfor both isothermal and nonisothermal flow conditions were investigated.The results show that both airflow rate and heat load stronglyaffect airflow patterns and air velocity and air temperature insidethe room. As the airflow rate increases and/or heat load decreases,the air jet travels further along the ceiling and lessens thechance of dropping into the occupied zone. On the other hand,as the airflow rate decreases and/or heat load increases, theair jet separates form the ceiling and moves down toward the occupiedzone, causing air at higher velocities and lower temperaturesto reach occupants resulting in a possible sensation of draft(coolness). Furthermore, stagnant areas form due to the lack ofair circulation. KEYWORDS air conditioning, human comfort, air movement #NO 9689 TheSistine Chapel: HVAC design for special use buildings.

ABSTRACT Environmental control systems for museums, art galleriesand other special buildings typically must control more than justair temperature and humidity, and must often provide much tightercontrol than is expected from conventional air conditioning systems.The priceless artifacts and art treasures housed in such buildingscan be permanently damaged if the environment is not continuouslycontrolled. The comfort of occupants also should be considered.Six principle factors are generally considered in the design ofsuch systems: air temperature, air humidity, light, air circulation,air-borne pollutants, and sound level. This paper discusses thesefactors and how they were addressed in the design of the air conditioningsystem for the Sistine Chapel, and provides general guidelinesfor other special buildings.

ABSTRACT Most of the modern office buildings and dwellings inSri Lanka are designed with the assumption that electrical air-conditioningsystems will be used to cope with the country`s high humidityand warm climate. The possibility of utilizing passive coolingconcepts for that purpose has yet to be explored by architects.This paper investigates the suitability of such cooling conceptsfor local conditions. Simple architectural modifications and afew changes in the usage patterns may result in a reduction inindoor temperature of 3.0 and 0.4 degreesC, respectively, fora daily maximum and minimum temperature of 30.9 and 27.2 degreesC,respectively, in a dwelling in Colombo in December. The achievementof comfort, described by satisfactory levels of a predicted percentageof dissatisfied, is also documented. Simulation results are comparedwith full-scale experiments. KEYWORDS cooling, hot climate #NO 9694 Installingand maintaining evaporative coolers. AUTHOR Otterbein R BIBINF USA, Home Energy, May/June, 1996, pp 23-28. ABSTRACT Evaporative coolers cost only one-tenth to one-fourthas much to operate as refrigeration air conditioning and are muchcheaper to buy. This make them an excellent option, particularlyin hot, dry areas of the country. An evaporative cooler is a simpledevice consisting of a fan and a water-wetted pad. A small pumprecirculates water from a sump (which is part of the cooler cabinet)to keep the pad wet. The fan draws outside air through the wetpad, making the air more humid but colder. This air is blown intothe house forcing the warmer air in the house to be exhaustedout open windows or through a vent into the attic. This is quitedifferent from refrigeration air conditioning, which cools insideair and returns it to the house. Although the use of outside airis one major benefit of evaporative coolers, it also complicatestheir installation and operation. The evaporative cooler mustbe installed outside the house, ducted into the house, and freezeprotected and isolated from the house during winter months.

AUTHOR Wong Y W, Chan W K BIBINF USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 2, 1996, [preprint],7 figs, 1 tab, refs. ABSTRACT This paper presents results of a study of the pressuredrop in a scale model of a stairshaft with closed treads. A 1:10scale model of a 10 story stairshaft was build to study airflowresistance within the shaft under isothermal conditions, includingthe effect of occupant density. Three cases were investigated:a stairshaft with no occupant, a shaft with medium density, andone with high-density occupancy. In addition, the effects of thedistribution of occupants in the stairshaft were studied. Thepressure drop through the model stairshaft was measured at eachstory for a range of volume flow rates between 0.0368 and 0.0901m3/s(1.29 and 3.18 ft3/s) introduced at a single injection point atthe top of the stairshaft. The pressure loss coefficient for thescale model with no occupants was found to be approximately 33.2.The results obtained are comparable to published measurementsmade in full-scale stairshafts with typical floor heights between3.2m and 3.85m. The pressure drop varies linearly with the heightof the stairshaft and varies directly with the square of the supplyair rates. Results from the test demonstrate the same trend asreported in the literature - that the pressure loss coefficientis a function of the occupant density in the stairshaft. The losscoefficient increased by a factor of approximately two when themodel was populated to simulate occupancy at medium occupant densityand by a factor of three at high occupant density when comparedto that of the empty stairshaft. The pressure loss coefficientsfor the scale model at medium and high occupant densities werefound to be approximately 65.7 and 95.9 respectively. The resultsalso agree with published results that the distribution of occupants,whether on the landings at each story or between floors, has littleeffect on the loss coefficients for medium- and high-density occupancy.

ABSTRACT Thermal bridges are parts of the buildings envelope whichin general are not correctly insulated. Problems relating to thermalbridges are often severe condensation and mould growth and a significantincrease of the energy losses. At present, these problems stillfrequently occur in new buildings but especially in rehabilitationprojects. In several countries so-called thermal bridge atlasesalready exist. These can help the designer to increase his understandingof the problems but they are not a real help in solving his specificproblems. One alternative is to perform detailed thermal bridgesimulations. This however is expensive and not al all part ofthe daily practice. This project aims to offer a computerisedthermal bridge atlas for 2-dimensional details. The target isto have at the end of the project 750 details in the atlas. Themain characteristics of the proposed atlas is its user friendliness,the large flexibility of modifying the detail (layer thickness,materials, boundary conditions,..) and the way of presenting theresults (e.g. colour pictures showing the isothermal lines, theheat flux lines,..)The final products of this project are extremelypowerful tools for so-called global training actions (for schools,colleges, architects, building contractors,..) It can be usedin relation to all building types.

ABSTRACT A program of work involving the measurement of ventilationrates, air velocities and temperatures has commenced within thenew Engineering and Manufacture Building, De Montfort University,and some initial results are reported here. Measurements havebeen recorded for "summer" conditions, average and maximumoccupancy levels. Results obtained so far indicate that ventilationrates through one of the theatres are driven by both stack andwind induced effects, and can be much higher than predicted bycomputer and physical models. Room air temperatures show littlevariation with time, due to the heavy weight nature of the buildingstructure and its exposed areas. Further work will examine mid-seasonand winter conditions and will contribute to a design guide forlarge naturally ventilated spaces.

ABSTRACT The evaluation of the effectiveness of a ventilationsystem is a difficult problem which necessitates important experimentalmethods and simulation programs which are not always readily available.The study presented here proposes a period for defining a simplifiedevaluation methodology for ventilation effectiveness. In a firststage the work concerns the theoretical characterisation of planejets and the setting up of a laboratory experiment destined forthe study of jet diffusion using the tracer gas technique. Thefirst experimental results give us information about the globalcharacterisation of air flows encountered in a ventilated cellby an isothermal plane jet. They show reasonable agreement withtheoretical prediction.

ABSTRACT The INRS (French National Institute for Research andOccupational Safety) promotes the concept of predictive ventilationusing the Computational Fluid Dynamics code EOL in the purposeof improving working conditions. 1. EOL simulates velocity, concentrationand temperature fields from the specification of the geometryof the enclosure, the ventilation system and the pollutant sources.It is available in two and three-dimensional versions. Validationprocedures were completed for the 2D version, whereas this articleis concerned with the 3D case. As a matter of fact, 3D validationof EOL is conducted for velocity under isothermal conditions inthe particular case of a painting area model in the INRS hydraulicbench. The INRS hydraulic bench simulates steady water flows inapproximate Reynolds similarity and is equipped with a laser Dopplervelocimeter that provides 2 non-simultaneous velocity components.Velocity measurements are done within and in the vicinity of themodel in a front view. First of all, the assumed symmetry of theexperimental device is checked with good agreement. Then, measurementsare compared with simulation results. Correlations between bothapproaches suggest a good correspondence regarding simulationand measurements. A future step of the study should include extracomparisons with the third velocity component and as a last stepin situ measurements of velocities in the actual painting area.

ABSTRACT In the frame of the European PASCOOL project, severalexperiments regarding single sided ventilation were carried outat BBRI in the outdoor PASSYS test cell. The test room of 30 m3has a vertical window of about 1 m2. During a first measurementperiod an open cold box, which allows one to control the verticalwind speed, was placed in front of this window. During a secondmeasurement period, the window was directly exposed to `real wind'.The air flow rates through the large opening is derived from theenergy balance of the test room. This approach is possible becausethe heat flow through the cell envelope can be accurately determinedthanks to the Pseudo-Adiabatic-Shell. Tracer gas measurementswere carried out in parallel. They are made difficult becausea clear air flow pattern appears and accordingly, the concentrationin the room is not homgenous. An error analysis has been appliedon both methods. The agreement between both methods is very goodand the heat balance approach proved to be more accurate thanthe tracer gas technique. a correlation model was derived fromthe first measurement period.

ABSTRACT After the new systems were installed in the houses, thecontinuously controlled effective ventilation rate remained above0.5 times per hour, and the system maintained low positive pressureindoors. The houses studied had a small overpressure (<0.5 PA) even without the pressure adjustment. The pressure adjustment increased overpressure only slightly, less than 2 Pa. The data collected were insufficient for a detailed energy consumption analysis; therefore, only differences of capacity flows were examined during several weekly periods when the pressure control was on or off in turns. Capacity flows were found to increase with increasing pressure differences. The pressure control did not affect the capacity flows in the tight house, if the disturbances of long-lasting periods (nights) with opened window were neglected. In the untight house, the pressure control decreased energy consumption and the capacity flows was obtained when the air exchange rate exceeded 0.9 h-1. High negative pressure in the houses in the radon problem areas is not desired. The pressure controlled ventilation system was found to prevent excessive underpressurization of houses, without increasing capacity flows.

The VE and TE were generallyhigher in the concentrated layout of OA equipment than in thedispersed layout. However, for the displacement system, the effectof the layout of OA equipment on VE and TE was relatively insignificant.

ABSTRACT The traditional logarithmic wall functions, originallyderived from forced convection boundary layer flow, are generallyused in conjunction with the standard k-e model to simulate airflows in buildings. In ventilated rooms, however, the flow closesolid wall is also influenced by natural convection along verticalsurface by accounting for the effect of buoyancy. These new wallfunctions have been applied in conjunction with the standard k-eturbulence model to calculate the flow in an air-filled enclosure.Comparisons have been made between the traditional and new wallfunctions and between numerical results and experimental data.The comparisons indicate that the numerical results can be significantlyimproved by using the new wall functions for the case considered.

ABSTRACT There exist in our industrial cities, many buildingswhich once formed the nucleus of industrial activity, but whichare now, due to economic changes, redundant. This is particularlytrue of buildings associated with heavy manufacturing industry.In Sheffield, England, the decline of what was once the largeststeel manufacturing industry in Western Europe, has left largetracts of land derelict. The wonderful buildings that were hometo the steel industry stand alone and empty like "dinosaurs".This paper will discuss how one of these buildings, [referredto as "the case-study buildings"], is currently beingre-configured to provide new specialist office and technical facilitiesfor one of the few surviving steelworks. We will discuss in generalterms, the design approach taken, but will concentrate upon howour resolution of the environment problems inherent in the existingstructure were resolved through the creation of a number of different"internal climates". The problems encountered, suchas a lack of thermal insulation and inadequate daylighting, arecommonly faced when working within the constraints of redundantindustrial buildings. We therefore hope that the approach takenin resolving the problems inherent in our case-study building,and the research that it has generated, have a wider relevance.

ABSTRACT The space which immediately surrounds a building is oftenneglected in relation to its effect as a climatic modifier ofthe interior space of the building, because the architect conceiveshis building only as a free standing object. However in many climatesthis space could be more important from the functional, thermaland visual point of view than interior space.

ABSTRACT Suspended timber ground floors are often used on newhouses, [1], and are also typical of a large number of housesbuilt before 1940, which represent a substantial building stockthat now needs refurbishment with improved insulation levels.While the thermal performance of walls and roofs has been improvedin recent years through loft and cavity wall insulation, the heatloss from the ground floor has been overlooked. This may constituteup to 25% of the total heat loss from an otherwise well-insulationhouse. Ventilation of the under-floor space is required to presenta build-up of moisture and subsequent rotting of the timbers,and this serves to increase the heat loss. Earlier work showedthat the heat loss may increase by 40% at a ventilation rate of1.5 air changes per hour[2]. The under-floor void may range inheight from a few centimetres to as much as half a metre, andmoisture enters mainly by evaporation of water from exposed earthand from construction water drying out. If the moisture contentof the timbers exceeds 20% for only a few days, various typesof mould may begin to grow, which cause rapid deterioration ofthe timbers through wet or dry rot. Ventilation is normally usedto prevent this, by means of air bricks in the outer walls. Thisventilation inevitably results in an increase in the heat lossfrom the floor, and is dependent on the wind speed and the degreeof exposure of the site.

ABSTRACT Ventilation is becoming the dominant factor in the energybalance of a building and increasing interest is being shown inthe effects of infiltration. A major contributor to overall ventilationrates is air flow through cracks in the facades of buildings.Increasingly, the validation of steady-state models for buildingcrack flow has been questioned. An approach is made to determinethe equations governing the air flow through simple cracks subjectto fluctuating pressures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyseswere carried out for various crack types subjected to fluctuatingpressures. In addition, an experimental arrangement was developedthat enables the laboratory simulation of fluctuating drivingpressure signals applied to a series of cracks. Pressure fluctuationswere imposed on a 1m2 section of wall with a centrally mountedcrack and the overall volumetric air flow rate, pressure distributionand flow direction were monitored. CFD analyses were carried outfor the crack type and specific flow conditions found from experimentaldata. An analysis was made of physical test results and a comparisonmade between these findings and the preliminary CFD models developed.An introduction to CFD analysis and fluctuating crack flow workis given and the methods used in simulating the necessary conditionsfor fluctuating flow with the results of preliminary CFD analysesare presented.

ABSTRACT In order to evaluate the influence of air conditionedventilation on indoor radon concentrations in air, levels of indoorradon were studied by a continuous electrostatic radon monitor(CERM) under normal living conditions. Results show indoor radonconcentrations in air were not much more than one in winter althoughfixing family conditioner requires a sealed room which leads higherradon level. Turning on air conditioner helps to lower indoorradon level. Therefore its total effects are normal< ventilation < exhaust or indraft < exhaust plus indraft, and reduce the harm to human. In summary, air conditioner is good for human health. KEYWORDS radon, air conditioning, ventilation air #NO 9722CFD simulation of swirl jet displacement ventilation systems.

ABSTRACT An investigation was made into the methods of numericallysimulating swirl jet displacement ventilation systems. Experimentaldata was obtained from a quarter-scale physical model that wasventilated using a swirl jet displacement type system. The datawas compared with results obtained from a dynamic thermal model(DTM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation underthe same geometric configuration, flow rate and internal heatload. The CFD solution was developed from high to low resolutioncomputational mesh with various solution techniques, the overalltrade-off being between computing (cpu) time and accuracy of solution.The results showed that for any space under investigation theaccuracy of the solution is mainly dependent on the degree ofsimplification and approximations involved within the solution.When the space under investigation involves a ventilation systemthat is highly complex in nature, as is the case of swirl jets,additional modelling difficulties may occur. The three-dimensionalityof the solution may lead to misinterpretation of results if greatcare is not taken.

ABSTRACT An assessment was undertaken on six different publichouses in the north of England and southern Scotland with theaim of recognising features of their construction and operationwhere environment impact had been reduced, what improvements couldbe made to accommodate best environment practice, and to raiseawareness of the adverse effect of buildings on the environment.Air quality assessments in each establishment identified potentialproblems in respect of the trading design approach to ventilatedspaces. Selected environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) surrogates(CO,NOx) were measured together with CO2 as a general air qualityindicator during a 3 month period using a photoacoustic multi-gasanalyser. All premises were installed with manually controlledmechanical displacement ventilation systems. The traditional approachto air quality problems arising from ETS has been one of reactionventilation when smoke levels were high, resulting generally inunder-ventilation of the space or, in some establishments wherethe smoke problem was perceived as being high, over-ventilationwhere the systems are operated continuously with a subsequentimpact on building energy use. This has been exacerbated by recentanti-smoking lobbyists success in persuading the EnvironmentalHealth Department of the local Councils to prosecute operatorsof excessively smoky public houses.

ABSTRACT Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in residential and commercialbuildings is a topic of great interest due to the serious implicationsfor public health and of the considerable impact on the buildingenergy load due to air change. Air quality requirements are generallyand simply matched by increasing the air change rate with consequentlarge increase of energy consumption. Nevertheless there existsan alternative approach based on an optimisation of the air changestrategies and of the ventilation efficiency. Experimental andtheoretical investigations have been planned in order to achievethese results. The experimental protocol is based on a qualitativeand quantitative evaluation of the air flow pattern and temperaturesin a well instrumented test cell adopting several ventilationtechniques and strategies. Smoke detection tracers, tracer gastechniques and high precision anemometers are used. The air speedand temperature map of the room give an indication on how to managethe ventilation system. Position, dimension and set-up of theinlet and outlet air grids in the room are changed. as well theair flow rate and time schedule. Several test configurations areinvestigated and the results obtained indicate the most suitableset, under both viewpoints, health and energy. In parallel withthis activity a theoretical study will be carried out by meansof simulations tools, on which a preliminary validation can beperformed by means of the experimental results.

ABSTRACT This paper describes the analysis and practical testingof a novel method of pre-heating ventilation air for buildingsby sucking the air from the cavity space in an external wall.The fresh air introduced into the building is pre-heated partlyby recovery of the heat escaping through the inner leaf of thewall and partly by collection of some of the solar energy incidenton the outer leaf of the wall. A classroom at Napier Universityin which the system was installed was monitored to assess theenergy and comfort benefits. Consideration was also given to noiselevels and the optimum control strategy. It is concluded thatthe "cavity-breather" method of pre-heating ventilationair is both energy-efficient and practical.

ABSTRACT As part of the energy conservation programme of the Finnishgovernment, a standard method for energy auditing in buildingshas been defined. It is backed by an energy saving calculationprogramme, audit report models, auditor training package and afollow up system. The follow up results indicate that there arelow cost measures which give good savings. In auditing, it isessential to check these first before suggesting the high costmeasures which, in spite of good savings, are not so often carriedout in practice. In the near future, a similar auditing systemis planned for the industrial sector, too, where the auditingproblems now look quite similar to those of the building sectorbefore the model.

ABSTRACT Although when speaking about daylighting and energy savingthe first thing that comes to mind is big commercial buildings,considerable energy savings and interesting solutions are alsopossible in residential buildings. Our research is based on thebelief that a low, compact structure maintains the energy stabilitybetter than the classical shapes of blocks of flats. The use ofurban land is more economic,too. - The study of daylighting andenergy conscious design has been understood in the context ofthe protection of the interior space and partly on the passiveuse of solar energy. These principles can be shortly expressedin four points. -uniform solar radiation of flats built-in fromthree sides can be provided only with the East - West orientationof the blocks of flats. - volume-to-space ratio must be as lowas possible. - the level of quality of daylighting in the flatshas to be considered. - the improved quality of life is an additionalbonus that can be offered to the user. On the basis of currentachievements, the deep daylighting is provided by light ducts.The efficiency of sky light is increased by the use of highlyreflective materials in the ducts and by the sawtooth shape ofthe duct wall.

ABSTRACT A passive ventilation system in Hokkaido is not spreadat present. This report presents the concept and the housing systemto the airtight performance for the passive ventilation, so twosubject are discussed. The first subject is the changes in theventilation rate and the permissible level of change. Changesin the ventilation rate caused by a stack effect were measuredin an airtight test house from autumn to winter by tracer gastechniques. It was found that the effect of changes of wind velocityon changes in the ventilation rate was smaller than the effectof temperature difference between inside and outside. The passiveventilation system in the airtight test house was able to supplythe required amount of fresh air in winter when the temperaturedifference between inside and outside was large. The second subjectis the appropriate installation of an inlet for fresh air andthe best method for circulating air in occupant spaces. As thetemperature of outdoor air is very low in winter, the fresh aircoming into the house must be warmed. The buffer space under thefloor maybe used as a chamber to warm the cold outdoor air andto distribute the warmed fresh air. Such a ventilation systemin homes in cold regions can greatly improve the indoor environment.

ABSTRACT This research is aimed to develop the leakage measuringtechnique by AC-pressurization method (AC-Press), which appliesthe sinusoidal volume changing to the building to be tested. Thispaper describes the principles and the characteristics includingthe comparison of the DC-pressurization method (DC-press), thatis, AC-Press has less impact to indoor environment during themeasurement, and is not necessarily penetrating the envelop witha duct for the testing. Also instrumentation of this method isindicated and the laboratory experiment using scale model withfour holes is executed. Effective Leakage Area (ELA) of the holeswere measured by DC-Press. The results show that reproducibilityis confirmed and that the difference of ELA between AC-Press andDC-Press varies from -2.2% to -7.7%. Furthermore the effect ofthe flow exponent and phase lag between room volume change andpressure change upon the estimated ELA is discussed.

ABSTRACT The commitment to reduce energy consumption by buildingshas focused attention of making new domestic buildings well insulatedby employing measures such as insulated cavity walls, double glazedsealed windows and insulated lofts. However in all the housesthere is an air ventilator which is simply a hole in the wallwith two air grilles on either side. To investigate thermal comfortdue to air ventilators position, air flow measurements were carriedout in two new houses where the air ventilators are placed athigh and low level. The amount of air flow into the lounge wasmeasured, together with air velocity and temperature distributionacross the air ventilator and the lounge at two levels of 0.15mand 1.2m. These results show that in cases were the air ventilatoris placed at low level in the lounge, cold air flows into thelounge and the temperature difference between head and ankle levelfor a seated person, is more that 3oC.

AUTHOR Larsen R BIBINF Japan, proceedings of the 5th International Conferenceon Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent '96, held Yokohama, Japan,17-19 July, 1996, Volume 1, pp 49-54. ABSTRACT In order to evaluate a given ventilation system in alivestock building and its sensitivity to wind, presence of heatsources (e.g. livestock) etc.it is of interest to estimate flowvector fields corresponding to the airflow. By introducing particles(e.g. smoke) into the air inlets of a model of a livestock building,the airflow in a laser-illuminated plane may be visualized. Basedon sequences of images recorded of this place using a video camera,estimates of 2-D flow vectors are derived locally. The local estimatesof velocity are found using a set of spatio-temporal convolutionfilters on the image sequence. After which the local estimatesare integrated to smooth flow fields using a model that incorporatesspatial smoothness. The algorithms are illustrated using a scalemodel of a pigs sty under isothermic conditions. It should benoted that this is an non-invasive technique (laser and cameramay be placed so they do not disturb the airflow) for estimatingair velocity in a 2-D plane.

ABSTRACT Prediction and measurement of interzonal airflow in abuilding is important in evaluating and planning IAQ, thermalcomfort, etc. In our experimental house, we planed the distributionof fresh air, passive ventilative cooling in summer. In this contextthe measurement of multi-zone airflow in this house, consideredas 17 rooms, was needed. In application of the measurement methodusing a single tracer gas, based on the system identificationtheory proposed by Okuyama, some improvements were made to secureaccuracy. The additional measurement for the fresh airflow fromoutside to each room was also carried out by another method ofconstant-concentration. In this paper, these measurements andresults are described.

ABSTRACT Multiple tracer gas techniques for measuring interzonalairflow rates between zones in a multizone building involve thesampling and measurement of the concentration of each tracer gasin each zone. Continuous measurements of gas concentrations ineach zone are usually not practical. The usual approach is discretesampling and measurement with one instrument for each gas. Twomethods, the differential method and the integral method, arecommonly used to calculate the interzonal airflows from the measuredtracer gas concentrations. A previous study by the authors showedthat both methods give similar results when the data were obtainedunder well controlled laboratory conditions. As tracer gas concentrationsmeasured under field conditions are often not as accurate as thosemeasured under laboratory conditions, a further comparison ofthese methods was made to determine their accuracies in fieldapplications. This paper presents the results of this comparison. KEYWORDS tracer gas technique, air flow #NO 9742Development of ventilation and air conditioning system for highlyairtight and insulated houses.

ABSTRACT In highly airtight and insulated houses, Osaka Gas hasinstalled a ventilation and air-conditioning system that takesadvantage of the structural characteristics of these houses, suchas underfloor space and vent sections in the wall. To verify thatthe system can vent air from underfloor into residence rooms withno problem, the VOC concentration of the indoor atmosphere wasmeasured under various conditions immediately after completionof the house. The result confirms that the VOC concentration isreduced by operating the ventilation unit and "bake-out".The ventilation rate and the temperature were also measured. Withthe client family living in the house, the heat environment wasmeasured under the heating conditions in winter. The measurementshows that the present system can heat rooms comfortably withlittle difference in temperature among rooms due to radiationfrom floors and walls.

ABSTRACT The contaminant concentration inhaled by an occupant(ie. the personal exposure) is usually less than the return concentrationin displacement ventilated rooms. Tow main questions are investigated:1. Does the exhalation from one person penetrate the breathingzone of another person placed nearby, thus leading to larger personalexposure? 2. When two persons are placed close to each other,do the convective boundary layer flows interact so that the personalexposure to an ambient concentration field is altered? These problemsare investigated experimentally: Full-scale experiments are madein a displacement ventilated room with two breathing thermal manikins.When the manikins are facing each other, interaction can takeplace, and the exposure is increased. Horizontal distance betweenmanikins and horizontal inclination of exhalation flow are importantparameters. If exhalation is directed towards the back, largerexposures do not occur. When two persons stand close together,the exposure to ambient concentration is not altered. Traditionalone or two-zone models are not adequate for the case of face-to-facerespiration. When people are standing close or respirating face-toback, normal exposure levels for displacement ventilation canbe expected.

ABSTRACT Non-steady numerical simulation is performed to predictthermal environment in a passive solar room with a Trombe wall.With a weather model assuming a typical winter day of Osaka Japan,the simulation is continued until the test room thermal environmentbecomes periodically steady conditions. It needs about five daysusing a fully implicit time marching method the time step of whichis 1 minute. The thermal storage effect of the Trombe wall isconfirmed qualitatively and the CFD code proved to be a usefulmeans to design various passive solar systems. As for computerefforts saving, a simple method that only temperature field iscalculated every time step proved to be effective. For example,a simulation in which flows field is calculated every three timesteps while temperature field is calculated every step saved CPUtime nearly 50% compared with a simulation in which all variablesare calculated every time step.

ABSTRACT Modern design of air supply devices is to ensure properdelivery of conditioned air in a space to provide a conditionedair in a space to provide a comfortable environment with goodair quality. Since most of the devices have a complex geometry,it is a challenging task to predict airflow pattern in such adevice. This paper reports the simulation of a complex air diffuserwith the Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) technique. The "standard"k-e model was used in the CFD technique. Three different gridsystems were employed to present the complex geometry: cylindercoordinate with small steps, body-fitted-coordinate, and unstructuredgrids. Compared with airflow pattern observed by smoke, the resultsshow that the CFD technique with cylinder coordinate could notpredict the airflow pattern correctly. This is because excessivehigh turbulence is calculated in the boundary layer with smallsteps. Although the labor costs are high for grid-generation,the computed velocity vectors with the body-fitted coordinateand unstructured grid systems agree with those by flow visualisationtechnique.

The second part of this work deals with theinfluence of the inlet jet profile (plane or parabolic) on theflow. It is reported here that while the average flow is not greatlyaffected by the inlet profile. The fluctuating part of the flowis modified by the jet profile. If the inlet Reynolds number iskept constant, this phenomenon is amplified for an increasinginlet dimension.

ABSTRACT This paper presents a preliminary investigation of oscillatoryflow caused by two opposing free convection boundary layers, whichcan be found in a number of building airflow applications. Assecond order numerical simulation is carried out to investigateboth the 2D and 3D colliding free convection boundary layers atlow Rayleigh numbers. The present predicted non-dimensional frequencyof the periodic flow and onset of oscillation agree well withthe experimental data of Kitamur et al. (1984). It is found thatthree-dimensional oscillations of the flow at some Rayleigh numbersare accompanied by a well-organised array of secondary vortices.It is suggested that the Taylor Rayleigh instability causes theformation of secondary vortices and fingering of fluids acrossthe colliding fluid interface, which then leads the two dimensionaloscillations into three-dimensional instabilities.

ABSTRACT There are a number of methods available concerning withair distribution in buildings. Within control research, one canfind new control algorithms which have not been used in practiceyet. These new algorithms open the possibility of developing andimplementing of new demand controlled ventilation systems. Ina building the internal air motions are due both to differencesin temperature and due to pressure difference induced by the ventilationsystem. Therefore, one fundamental question is to what extentone can with fan powered ventilation control the air motions withina building. The aims of this paper is to report on developmentof methods to study the air motions in a multiroom residence apartmentusing various combinations of exhaust and supply air management.The experimental work includes measurements of air flow ratesin door opening in both directions and use of various tracer gasmethods to determine the supply air flow to each room and identifyingflow paths. In an accompanying paper (Bjorsell 1996) is reportedon the results from a simulation of the performance of differentcontrol algorithms.

ABSTRACT One method of maintaining good indoor air quality withoutextensive energy consumption is to control the ventilation rateaccording to the needs and demands of the occupants. If the systemcan be described by mathematical equations, it is possible tocreate a suitable control system. Indoor climate involves bothfresh air and the right temperature. There is a close connectionbetween temperature control and control of internal flows, becauselarge air motions are set up by temperature differences betweenrooms.

AUTHOR Karimpanah T BIBINF Japan, proceedings of the 5th International Conferenceon Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent '96, held Yokohama, Japan,17-19 July, 1996, Volume 1, pp 287-294. ABSTRACT The air jet issuing from a supply device is the basicflow element in a ventilated room. Thus a careful theoreticalunderstanding and experimental study of the boundary conditionsat exit, wall and the entrainment region are of vital importance.An examination of the behaviour of jets in other industrial applicationsavailable in the literature shows that in a closed space the situationis very complex. There are recirculation effects due to an oppositewall, and there are three different flow regimes at the same time(laminar, transitional and turbulent) and finally the enclosuresize can strongly influence the jet properties. Numerical simulationsof such a complex flow can not be successful when one appliesthe widely used standard k-e turbulence model. A low Reynoldsmodel can be used in the near wall regions but the anisotropyand streamline curvature effects require at least an isotropicsecond moment closure model. The aim of this investigation is:i) to examine the reliability and restrictions of a standardand a non-linear two-equation turbulence model by making comparisonwith experiments, ii) the jet momentum calculation is discussedby exploring a new momentum balance model and compared with anexperimental method for determining the momentum of a jet, iii)the boundary layer thickness calculation, the turbulence integrallength scale and time scale which are based on the measurements,moreover the usefulness of this knowledge in numerical calculationsis discussed.

ABSTRACT Modelling the drop distance using the Archimedes numberis proposed for trajectory control of air jets into a ventilatedairspace. The term"jet drop distance", defined as thehorizontal distance from the inlet to the point where the jetreaches the occupational zone, is used to describe the statusof the jet. The models are functions of the inlet Archimedes number,the inlet opening hydraulic diameter and the inlet height abovethe floor. Experiments on non-isothermal jets were conducted formodeling the drop distance. A inlet, with a bottom hinged flapand a guiding plate on top, was used in the experiments. It isshown that the jet drop distance depends on the inlet Archimedesnumber, the inlet opening and the inlet configuration. The modelsmay be used to predict and control jet drop distances in a practicalon-line control process. Ins such a system, the jetdrop distanceis used as a criterion for control of trajectories, and desireddrop distance of jets may be controlled indirectly by regulatingthe operating pressure and the inlet opening.

ABSTRACT The paper describes the moisture control strategy usedin the case of a multi-story office building located in a hothumid climate and estimates the energy consumed to dehumidifythe ventilation air to avoid condensation. The results show that,in order to achieve a comfortable and stable environment fromboth thermal and humidity perspectives, the ventilation (and dehumidification)system of the building should be operated 24 h/day. If high variationsin the relative humidity are acceptable, important energy savingscan be achieved by switching off the ventilation system at night.When compared to an all-air system, the use of the hydronic radiantsystem for conditioning in a hot humid climate provides similarindoor comfort conditions and requires less energy and peak powerto operate.

ABSTRACT Most office buildings require cooling in winter, evenin such harsh climates as in Canada. This is mainly due to internalheat generation caused by lighting, computers, fax machines, occupants,and so on. This paper reports the result of a simulation studyto investigate the feasibility of off-hour accelerated ventilationin a real office building in order to reduce the air conditioningenergy consumption while maintaining acceptable indoor environmentconditions. A multi-story building equipped with mechanical systemis designed to be employed in either day normal or night acceleratedventilation (free-cooling) mode. The study first involved integratinga multi-zone air flow model, COMVEN, with the multizone thermalmodel from TRNSYS. The results from the protection level and interzonalair-flow point of view show that a coupled air-flow/thermal modelmust be used. Finally, simulations were done to evaluate the energysavings when the off-hour accelerated ventilation technique isused while still respecting physical constraints, such as spatialgeometry and indoor air environment conditions.

AUTHOR Morsing S, Strom J S BIBINF Japan, proceedings of the 5th International Conferenceon Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent '96, held Yokohama, Japan,17-19 July, 1996, Volume 1, pp 401-406. ABSTRACT Great efforts have been made on to predict the air flowpattern in barns with negatively pressured ventilation systems.Some of the studies use the traditional air jet theory, and someuse CFD modelling. It is assumed that all the fresh air is suppliedthrough the inlets, ie. the structure is airtight. This is oppositeof real life conditions, where air leakages always occur. Thispaper presents a description of air leakages and their impacton the supply air jet momentum from the inlets. The results showthat at decreasing air flow rates, the air leakage will play anincreasing role on the supply air jet momentum. If the leakageis not taken into account, serious errors may occur in predictingthe air flow patterns in a room.

ABSTRACT This study is directed at understanding the exchangeflow through a single top vent in an atrium-type of compartmentvia fire trails, and obtaining fundamental knowledge of physicalmechanism necessary to develop a comprehensive atrium fire model.This study focuses on the supply air and pressure boundary conditionsrequired to prevent flow entering thorough the top vent from outsideof the compartment, when the supply air into the compartment islimited. A series of experiments were conducted in a scaled cubicalcompartment with a natural gas burned as a heat source. Undervarious heat release rates with different forced air supply, thecriteria distinguishing the flow between bi-directional flow andunidirectional flow were examined. The result indicates that thecriteria can be characterized by dimensionless parameters of theFroude Number and/or the pressure difference between inside andoutside of the compartment.

ABSTRACT Field measurements of air flow patterns and stryreneconcentration distribution were carried out in a reinforced plasticfactory hall during normal production conditions. The purposewas to produce detailed results which can be compared to CFD-simulations.Measuring equipment included ultrasonic and omnidirectional velocitysensors and an infrared gas analyser. The equipment was installedin a measurement carriage which was then traversed in the hall.The flow pattern of the supply air device was measured in laboratory.The results of measured cross-sections were presented as contourdiagrams and vector plots. Vectorial velocity results can be compareddirectly with CDF-simulations, whereas the comparison with omnidirectionalresults is more complicated. The comparison of predicted and measuredconcentration levels is difficult because of the spatial and temporalvariation of contaminant sources.

ABSTRACT Visual observation in a slot-ventilated enclosure (inletalong one side and exhaust through the ceiling) under isothermalconditions showed a predictable rotational airflow. This was easierto see and document with a 1/10 scale model of the building thenin the full scale room. The visual observations were video tapedin both the 1/10 and full scale units. These subjective observationswere quantified by air velocity measurements taken at correspondinglocations in the 1/10 and full scale units. Initial results indicatesimilar velocities near the floor of the rooms and in certainflow regimes. Considerable differences exist between the two scaledrooms near the air inlet zones, especially where the air jet ischanging directions. This suggest that "scaling factors"may need to be altered in different sections of the ventilatedspace for the conditions of a livestock (pig) housing building.

ABSTRACT In this paper, we present new results on the effectsof aeraulic phenomena on energy consumption and comfort for typicalhousing using a building energy simulation software (Clim2000),The presented results are for different heating scenario withair inlets located in occupation rooms (living room, room 1,2and 3) and outlets are set up in service rooms (bathroom, toilet,kitchen). Radiant phenomena and solar radiation through windowsare also taken into account in the modelling. All simulationsuse data from the TRAPPES weather station (located near PARIS)and are undertaken for a period of seven months, correspondingto the heating season in France. The paper presents a comparisonof energy consumption and temperature field distribution for differentconfigurations (mono-zone, bizone, and multizone). On the basisof multi-zone configuration simulations, we could assess the airdistribution in the house. This enabled us to optimize operatingmode of the heaters in each room of the house, so that minimumenergy consumption and maximum comfort according to distributionof the temperature field could be achieved.

ABSTRACT The influence of ventilation types in rooms, where itsoccupant is the main source of heat and ventilation objects, wasexamined using small water tanks. The Reynolds numbers of theobject rooms and the water tanks were equalized to simulate theventilation flow pattern in the tanks to its in the object rooms.The Grashof numbers of a heated body model and an occupant werealso equalized to simulate the free convection in the water tanksto the object rooms. The examined flow types were upward- anddownward-flows. A jet and diffuser inlets were examined in bothof the types. Of the four ventilation systems, stratificationsof the body heat and effluents were observed in the upper partof the tank only in the upward diffused flow. The direct reachof the fresh supply to the outlet was blocked by the stratification,and the bypass factor of this ventilation showed negative values.However, the stratification was broken when the Reynolds numberof the ventilation exceeded 390. Only when the stratificationwas held, the efficiency of the heat and effluent evacuation washigh.

ABSTRACT The influence of the variation of the thermal boundaryconditions on the global Air Change Efficiency of a balanced mechanicalventilation system in a test room was experimentally evaluatedby means of the "step-down" tracer gas technique. Thetracer gas concentration has been monitored in 25 to 100 samplingpoints inside the test room. The experiments were performed underisothermal condition, varying the air supply temperature respectto the walls and varying the surface temperature of a wall respectto the other walls and the supply air simulating both heatingand cooling situation. Changing the position of the outlet gridtwo different configurations of the ventilation system were tested.The nominal velocity of supply air varied between 0.04 and 0.11m/s, corresponding to a range from 1 to 3 ach, and the temperaturedifferences varied from 0.7 to 5oC. Results are presented in termsof variation of global Air Change Efficiency us, the Archimedesnumber whose values were in the range 0 to 181.

ABSTRACT High contents of organic dust in pig and poultry buildingshave shown to cause health problems (primarily respiratory diseases)in both people and animals. Dust in barns derives from feed, driedfaecal matter, bedding, animal scurf, mites, bacteria, fungi andother organic and inorganic particles. Multi-point dust generationoccurs at feeders, animals and surfaces of the room and the fixtures.Dust particles are transported by the air current which is affectedby the ventilation system and the thermal and geometrical conditionsin the room. some particles are exhausted from the building, andthe others settle on the surfaces. A research team at ResearchCentre Bygholm in Denmark has developed experimental techniquesfor full-scale simulation of dust dispersion in ventilated airspaces. An important part of the experimental set-up is the highmass flow dust generation system which can simulate the dust levelsfound in a real livestock building. A multi-point dust generatorsystem has been built and tested. The system consists of a modifiedrotating-table dust generator and copper tubing for transportof dust to desired dust ejection sites. A commercially availablepowder similar to real barn dust for use in the generation systemis being investigated. The possibility to create a very high dustconcentration is a unique aspect of this full-scale simulationset-up. Research Centre Bygholm plans to use this facility todetermine fundamental information such as dust settling ratesto validate mathematical models of dust transport and to testdust suppression techniques.

ABSTRACT One of the most important factors contributing to indoorair quality is the amount of fresh air that needs to be providedin buildings for occupants undergoing work in varying circumstances.Standards in Europe and America attempt to define the amount offresh air per person, but the data shows that there is a greatvariation between the criteria used by various countries. Oneconclusion is that there may be no fixed figure, but rather avariable amount of fresh air required to deal with varying circumstances.For many years the criterion has been that the CO2 content shouldbe below 1000ppm, but this along as a criterion is inadequate.This project attempts to use chromatography for analysing airsamples taken in four rooms. Questionnaires have been administeredin the spaces and an attempt has been made to correlate the objectiveand subjective measures. Chromatography is a measurement techniquethat has been used for many years in food sciences for studyingtastes and fragrances. This is a pilot project and so there hasbeen limited time to take samples and survey of occupants, butit has shown that this technique is worthwhile developing andstudying in more detail.

ABSTRACT To investigate the performance of turbulence models inthe numerical simulation of recirculating ventilation flows, comparisonshave been made for three types of two-equation models. A modifiedmodel recently proposed by the authors has been introduced andimplemented. All the models are applied with the all-functionmethod. When using the model, an extended-to-wall method is alsoused. Two typical recirculating flows are calculated: the separatedflow behind a backward-facing step with a large expansion ratiorelevant to room ventilation; and the wall-jet-induced flow ina two-dimensional ventilation enclosure. The predictions are comparedwith experimental data. The performance of the models is discussed.The modified model is shown to be an attractive alternative tothe initial model.

ABSTRACT We have done Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of the flowin a three-dimensional ventilated room. A finite volume methodis used with a collocated grid arrangement. The momentum equationsare solved with an explicit method using central differencingfor all terms. The pressure is obtained from a Poisson equation,which is solved with a conjugate gradient method. For the discretizationin time we use the Adam-Bashfourth scheme, which is second-orderaccurate. When using LES, the time-dependent three-dimensionalmomentum and continuity are solved. A subgrid turbulence modelis used to model the turbulent scales which are smaller than thecells. We have used two different subgrid models: the traditionalSmagorinsky model, and the dynamic model of Germano. Instead ofthe traditional time averaging, the equations when using LEA arefiltered in space. With LES we get much more information thanwhen using traditional time averaged turbulence models, sincewe are resolving most of the turbulence. It is found that instantaneousfluctuations are very large. For example, in the region of thewall jet below the ceiling where the time averaged velocity istypically 0.5, the instantaneous velocity fluctuates between 0.3and 0.8.

ABSTRACT As the flow inside livestock buildings is highly time-dependent,Reynolds-averaged turbulence maybe inadequate as they are basedon time-averaging. As a consequence, Large Eddy Simulation (LES)methodology employing a space-averaging procedure is adapted.In the present work LES is used for the airflow inside a room.As base model the subgrid term is computed by the Smagorinskymodel using different variants regarding near wall-damping andwall-boundary conditions.

ABSTRACT A new system of heating and cooling which diffuses airthrough knitted textile fabric stretched to form a false ceilingis studied using both numerical simulation and experimental facilities.As shown in figure 1 the conditioned air flows through the void(8cm) between the fixed ceiling and the impermeable part of thefabric before diffusing into the room through the permeable partof the fabric.

ABSTRACT The goal of this study is to gain and show confidencein the CFD code EOL-3D for routine applications. In this prospect,we performed a triple study based on the same industrial siteof a painting area: evaluation of free low-velocity air supplywith experiment on a scale model, on site measurements with ajet-like air supply diffuser, numerical simulation of both configurations.We are able to confront measurements and calculation results inorder to test the EOL-3D CFD code and we raise the question ofthe uncertainty of numerical simulation versus experiment. Ourmethod leads to acceptable uncertainty indices considering ventilationapplications. Finally, the applicability of CFD modelling to practicalcases is confirmed by our on site measurements in the paintingarea. Main features of the flow according to occupational safetyare well predicted by simulation.

ABSTRACT In the large courtyard of high-rise residential buildings,the exhaust from the kitchen, and the gas water heater, is sometimesdischarged into the public corridors, which can pollute the air.The exhaust heat caused the stack effect, so the outdoor air flowsthrough the openings at the bottom of the courtyard to the top.The purpose of this study is to describe these ventilation characteristicsand to predict the airflow rate for removing the pollutants. Firstly,model experiments were conducted to know the temperature distributionand airflow rates. The result showed that the characteristicsare influenced by the size of the bottom opening area and theposition of heat sources. Secondly, the comparison between mathematicalcalculation and experimental data were nearly in agreement, exceptfor some inconsistencies at the top of the courtyard. This wasdue to the air down flow, when the bottom opening area was notlarge enough.

ABSTRACT A unique evaluation and subsequent rectification of theair distribution system for the Opera Theatre and Concert Hallat the Sydney Opera House have been recently carried out. Likemost auditoriums of that era, conditioned air is supplied at ceilinglevel and returned at floor level. From the outset the halls experiencedsignificant variations in zone conditions resulting in patroncomplaints. Several previous attempts to rectify the problem failedto achieve required results. Our methodology involved measurementand plotting of return air quantities under each seat formulatinga return air chart. This provided valuable air flow data and alsorevealed design constraints that needed addressing. Balancingof the return air was then used to force an even distributionof supply air at seating level across the hall. The final resultis the achievement of a far superior comfort level with uniformityin temperature and air flow readings.

ABSTRACT This paper presents results of the application of threedifferent thermal analysis computer programs to Gjovik OlympicMountain Hall. Gjovik Mountain Hall is an underground rock cavernused for ice-hockey, exhibitions, concerts, etc. which can accommodate5800 spectators. Measurements in the hall are carried out, withthe intention of using the results to verify design tools forthe prediction of indoor climate and HVAC energy consumption.Continuous measurements have been taken of air flow rates andair temperatures, for one year. The data has been collected fromBuilding Management System (BMS). The first computer program,Fres, was used for design energy calculations. Fres is a buildingsimulation program for predicting heating, cooling and ventilationenergy consumption. A building can contain one or several roomswith arbitrary number of walls and windows between them. The temperatureprofile of walls is solved with a one-dimensional Finite Differencemethod. The second program, LescoCool, is a simple zonal model.The model couples ventilation heat flow and the thermal responseof the walls assuming i) displacement ventilation ii) a convectiveheat transfer coefficient iii) semi-finite wall thermal responseiv) thermal equilibrium for radiative heat gain. The wall thermalresponse of the hall can be characterised with a single parameter,the mean thermal effusivity. The parameters determining thesedesign parameters (including the wall surface area covered byacoustic panels) are discussed. Thirdly, measurements have beencompared with the program RockHall, which is a 2 dimensional programfor calculating conduction and heat fluxes through surfaces andheat exchange between surfaces. This program is developed speciallyfor rock halls and is the most detailed of the three candidates.

ABSTRACT In first part of fire, when smoke expel can be dominating,fast operating of the fire ventilation is required. In industrial,airtight hall, after turning on outlet ventilators, an underpressureappears. Larger amount of outdoor air will get inside. To ensureproper smoke removal process, outdoor air flows must be properlydirected. It is necessary to design appropriate air inlets, mountedinside the hall. Resigning of control over indoor airflow canlead to smoke spread in whole room and decrease efficiency oflife-saving activities. Problems of air movement in large capacityroom in case of fire ventilation operation are presented in thispaper.

ABSTRACT For thermal comfort applications, an office air distributionsystem should introduce air into a room such that the resultingair speed and temperature distribution within the occupied zoneis as uniform as possible to minimise areas of high velocity andto prevent the occurrence of steep temperature gradients. Whenconsidering air-conditioned offices, the main driving flows arethe cold air jet and the plumes created by internal heat loads.So, in order to study thermal comfort in air-conditioned offices,laws to describe this type of driving flows and specially forthe cold air jet have to be provided. The purpose of this experimentalwork is to analyse the cold air jet characteristics and to attemptto rely them with the indoor air-thermoconvective field.

ABSTRACT A PIV system to measure airflow distribution throughthe pattern tracking on VTR images visualized with smoke or mistparticles are presented. Speeding up of the pattern tracking byusing successive abandonment through F-inspection make it possibleto extract many vectors at different times on multiple points.Mistracked vectors can be eliminated adequately by post processingthem. Although the usage of reduced search area by predictingvelocity vectors, coupled with the successive abandonment cannotreduce computation time significantly, it brings the increaseof extracted vectors. Two examples of application to measure atime average velocity field of fluctuating airflow and a temporalvariation of velocity filed which varies periodically are presented.They are measured adequately by using our PIV system.

ABSTRACT Optimisation of a displacement ventilation system, andcontrol of system operation, require accurate modelling of theaeraulic and thermal phenomena which contribute to the establishmentor destruction of thermal stratification in the room ventilated.This fine analysis is carried out on typical, although artificiallysimplified configurations, in order to achieve optimum controlof the boundary conditions of the phenomena studied. It is basedon an experimental mock-up, representing a room equipped witha displacement ventilation system, operated by the Poitiers ThermalStudies Laboratory. We propose two types of simplified model forevaluation of mean temperature in the room. The level of precisionfor each model differs according to requirements. The first isa zonal model, based on division of the room into two superimposedregions, with the hot air floating above the fresh air. The plumeis analysed using Zukosky correlations. Boundary layer flows alongthe vertical wall surfaces are modelled by means of Jaluria correlations.According to their directions and mean temperatures, the parietalflows feed a third zone occurring either below the cold zone,above the hot zone, or between the two. The temperature gradientin the room is integrated for modelling the boundary layers. Thenumerical result obtained concord well with experimental measurements,and provide a correct representation of mean temperatures in eachzone. We then propose a one-dimensional model for finer representationof the thermal gradient in the room. According to analysis ofexperimental results, the isotherms are all horizontal insidethe cavity. We have also developed elementary models (formal types)on this basis, integrated in the CLIM2000 Building Energy SimulationTool. This means that the elementary models can be connected toother components or phenomena (wall surfaces, solar input, radiation,scenarios involving occupation or operation etc), for global representationof a building equipped with a displacement ventilation system.

ABSTRACT In Building K of the Head Office in Tokyo, environmentalmeasurements were carried out during periods of cooling and heatingin spaces occupied by 1) a large conference room and 2) a housinginformation service. Both spaces are serviced by an air conditioningsystem that employs displacement ventilation. In addition, forthe large conference room, a numerical simulation was performedfor a cooling period using the same conditions as those for themeasurements. Based on a comparison of the simulation and measurementresult, the ventilation efficiency was calculated. The purposeof these measurements was to determine if the premises servicedby the air conditioning system have a comfortable thermal environmentwith neither temperature fluctuations nor drafts. An additionalpurpose was to verify that the ventilation was at a comfortablelevel. This was done through calculation of the ventilation efficiencyby means of a numerical analysis based on three-dimensional turbulentflow, as the efficiency could not be determined by actual measurements.A displacement ventilation system blows out air at or somewhatbelow room temperature near floor level. It is a system of stratifiedair conditioning that exploits the difference in specific gravitythat arises from the difference between the temperature of theair being blown out and room temperature. This system is widelyused primarily in northern Europe. But if the system were reproducedin Japan as is, people might not be completely satisfied. Thereasons for that are as follows: Summers in Japan are hotter andmore humid than those in northern Europe; and since winters innorthern Europe are extremely cold, buildings are better insulatedand more air-tight then those in Japan. Moreover, there are otherconsiderations, such as the fact that the temperature at whichpeople feel most conformable is lower for Westerners than forJapanese. That being the case, various measures are being devisedto ensure that Japanese people feel comfortable. Interest in thissystem has been rising in Japan recently, but projects in whichit has actually been used are extremely rare. The present projectis the first time that this system has been seriously implementedin Japan. That makes the environmental measurement and numericalsimulation results in this report quite valuable; and they willundoubtedly be very useful to future projects that employ a systemof stratified air conditioning.

ABSTRACT An investigation was performed through model experimentand numerical simulation into the relation between air changeefficiency and the outlet/return-intake configuration employedunder ventilation or heating conditions. The results revealedas follows: 1) During ventilation operation, the local air changeindices are in the range of 0.9 - 1.2 in every case, and thereis little difference of values amount outlet-return-intake configurations.2) During heating operation, the local air change indices differlargely according to the configuration of the outlet/return-intakesystem. In the case of a ceiling outlet-ceiling return-intakeconfiguration, the mean local air change index is approximately0.3; a very low value compared with that found in other cases.3) In cases employing a floor outlet system, the occupied zoneair change indices are 0.8 - 0.9, showing nearly complete diffusion,regardless of the return-intake position, even during heatingoperation. 4) The results of numerical simulation and the modelexperiment coincide well with each other.

ABSTRACT Indoor spaces are supposed to offer occupants adequateclimate. That is, air quality and thermal comfort according tospecifications given in regulations or standards or what is decidedin order to achieve enhanced occupant productivity. One issueof increasing importance, is to accomplish the specified criteriaat a minimum use of energy. Ventilation, heating and cooling musttherefore be designed with regard to being efficient as well aseffective. The potential for energy saving design is present forlarge rooms. Effective and efficient climatization of indoor spaceshas the best chance for success when the design work is carriedout in a logical, subsequent manner with increasing detail richnesstowards final design, and in the framework of a design procedure.A framework for a design procedure is suggested, and ventilationand energy efficiency indices for design assessment are reviewed.An energy efficiency index is developed and discussed for a large-enclosurewith an HVAC system.

AUTHOR Jung A, Zeller M BIBINF Japan, proceedings of the 5th International Conferenceon Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent '96, held Yokohama, Japan,17-19 July, 1996, Volume 3, pp 71-79. ABSTRACT The main problems with the application of the pulse methodare high curvatures and low signal-to-noise ratios making it difficultto accurately resolve the local concentration curves. The reasonfor this is the demand of a dosing period being negligibly smallin comparison with the nominal time-constant of the room. Froma single-zone-model an analytical relation was derived that takesfinite dosing periods into account and hence extends the applicabilityof the pulse method. To determine the air exchange efficiencyby means of the step-up, the step-down or the pulse method definitestep changes of the concentration of a tracer gas at the supplyinlet are necessary. If the HVAC-System runs in recirculationmode, it would not be possible to maintain this boundary condition.To overcome this problem an analytical relation was derived fora single room with multiple supply inlets in recirculation mode.

ABSTRACT When the air flow through a ventilated room is increased,the degree of ventilation also increases according to the massbalance. It is shown here, however, that the air change efficiencyin the room can change when the ventilation flow rate changes.This phenomenon causes unexpected variations in the ventilationprocess, whose main purpose is to renew the room air and continuouslytransport contaminants out of the room. Measurements and numericalsimulations are used to find a relation between the selected ventilationflow rate and the estimated air change efficiency. The resultsare discussed and reasons for the variations are found by analyzingroom air flow patterns at different Reynolds numbers.

This allows the generalisationof any conventional CFD code to be applied for predicting thecontribution ratios and sojourn time scales.

ABSTRACT Indoor air quality of large enclosures containing unconfinedpollutant sources is a really challenging problem. Local captureventilation systems cannot be used because the contaminant sourceis either too large or even moving; available design principlesfor general ventilation systems are not very often applicableeither, because they generally would lead to enormous air flowrates.It is the purpose of this paper to tackle this problem by usingcomputational fluid dynamics methods. Two practical examples chosenin the domain of occupational health are presented. The firstcase concerns the ventilation of underground building sites ofcar parks. Here pollution produced by the earth movers is madeof dust and diesel engines exhaust gases. In the second examplea ventilated tunnel is used to protect the occupied zone of alarge workshop from styrene vapours produced by the manufacturingof large fiber glass reinforced plastic pipes. For every exampleseveral ventilation strategies are tested, by performing numericalsimulations of the resulting air and pollutants flow fields. Inthe second application a parametric study is carried out to optimisethe design of the tunnel. Both cases have already been successfullyimplemented and tested on sites. All computer simulations areperformed with the EOL-3D software developed at INRS. This papershows that CFD is a real design tool for ventilation systems incomplex industrial situations.

ABSTRACT In many applications the 3-D distribution of temperaturein an imperfectly mixed ventilated air space is determined bythe air mass transport or the flow pattern. A grey box model hasebeen developed to predict the dynamic behavior of the 3-D distributionof temperature to non-linear variations of the ventilation rateV and heat supply Q (Watt) as control inputs. In the grey boxmodel physical laws are combined with a mathematical identificationprocedure. Every parameter has a physical meaning which can beinterpreted in relation to the air flow pattern. In a laboratorytest installation 100 experiments were performed to identify themodel parameters in function of the ventilation rate and the heatsupply as control inputs. After the identification procedure fivevalidation experiments were performed in which the ventilationrate was varied randomly between 80 and 300m3/h and in which theheat supply was set to a constant level of 0 or 400 Watt. Fromall these validation experiments the model was found to predicttemperature with a mean square error of 0.3C.

The velocity profile changesshape and the maximum velocity in the lower part of the room islocated higher above the floor than in the empty room. It is foundthat the obstacles influence the flow in the entire room, andbecause the obstacles not only redistribute the velocity profilebut also decrease the overall velocity level in the room the momentumflow is reduced.

ABSTRACT The use of various air flow models at different levelsof complexity as design tools of the ventilation of atria is discussed.Advantages and requirements are explained. For an atrium spacein an office building, Grafenau Zug, Switzerland, measured dataare compared with model prediction. Temperatures at differentheights in the atrium and outside are monitored throughout theyear by the building control system. In addition, velocity profilesin the occupied zone and the airleakage characteristics of thewhole atrium have been measured. Simple models for downdraft alongcold glazings and natural ventilation in summer, and complex modelsinvolving computational fluid dynamics, are applied and comparedwith the collected experimental data.

AUTHOR Cooper P, Linden P F BIBINF Japan, proceedings of the 5th International Conferenceon Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent '96, held Yokohama, Japan,17-19 July, 1996, Volume 3, pp 203-210. ABSTRACT This paper describes research into the flow and stratificationin naturally ventilated rooms containing either point sourcesof heat or a distributed source of heat on one vertical wall.Plumes from point sources on the floor of the room with ventsat the top and bottom produce a vertical density profile consistingof several distinct, fully mixed layers. The paper includes asummary of a theoretical model that predicts the depths and densitiesof these layers. The positions of the interfaces between the layersare found to be function only of the effective area, A, of theenclosure openings the height of the enclosure, H, and the ratiosof the strengths of the two sources of heat. The theoretical approachhas been validated using water-filled scale models. In the casewhere one wall of the room is uniformly heated a multiple-layerstratification also develops.

AUTHOR Andersen K T BIBINF Japan, proceedings of the 5th International Conferenceon Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent '96, held Yokohama, Japan,17-19 July, 1996, Volume 3, pp ABSTRACT Based on the equations for mass balance, energy conservationand vertical momentum and on the modified Bernouilli equation,a set of formulas is derived for air velocities, temperature differencesand ventilation capacities in relation to opening areas, net heatinput, and building geometry. The validity of the formulas isdiscussed in relation to temperature stratification, positionof the neutral plane, and the orientation of the openings. Further,specific topics are discussed concerning air velocity and ventilationcapacity as affected by the opening area ratio (ie. inlet area/outletarea), optimum opening area ratio, and finally the size of requiredopening area related to required ventilation capacity or requiredtemperature difference. The set of formulas constitutes an easy-to-usedesign method that can be programmed as an independent computerprogram or integrated into a building energy analysis tool. Besides,the formulas are well suited for analytical purposes.

ABSTRACT It has been impossible to predict the air change rateof a room with a single opening exposed to natural wind by thepressure differences generated by the wind. In order to establishthe simple method to predict the airflow rate through a singleopening, some experiments were conducted with a cubic model enclosurecontaining a single opening in a wind tunnel. Under several conditionsof wind velocity, wind direction and approaching flow, characteristicsof local airflow in the vicinity of opening and airflow rate throughan opening were measured. through investigations, it is foundthat the airflow rate is in proportion to local mean velocityin the vicinity of the opening. In conclusion, the ultimate equationfor predicting the air flow rate of a room with a single openingexposed to natural wind was presented in this paper.

ABSTRACT This paper describes an innovative study in which small-scalelaboratory experiments and simple theoretical models examine naturalventilation by the combined effects of stack and wind and areused to predict the airflow and temperature stratification withinan enclosure under a wide range of climatic conditions. In thepresent experiments a Perspex tank of rectangular cross-sectionis suspended in a flume. The flume produces a controllable, steadyhorizontal flow which is used to model the wind. A number of openingsin the tank both at high/low levels and on windward/leeward facesallow a wide range of generic ventilation flows to be examined.In this paper two main ventilation flows have been identified:i) those where the buoyancy and wind forces reinforce one anotherand ii) those where the buoyancy and wind forces oppose one another.The experiments have shown that the type of ventilation flow observed,ie. whether displacement or mixing, is critically dependent uponthe relative magnitudes of the wind and buoyancy forces as wellas upon the size and location of the openings. Some of the implicationsof the flows to the natural ventilation of enclosures are discussed. KEYWORDS natural ventilation, wind effects #NO 9815Natural ventilation in atria - a case study.

ABSTRACT Many buildings in Japan are furnished with a large stairwellin the centre, called "void". Gas water heaters areoften installed in the void, consuming the air inside and dischargingthe exhaust gas into the void. The behaviour of the exhaust gasin the void space has become a great concern. Model experimentand three dimensional CFD have been conducted to investigate,in detail, flow characteristics in the void space. The study selectsa simple rectangular void space which accommodates gas water heatersdischarging exhaust gas from the corners. Good agreement has beenobtained between the CFD results and experimental data regardingthe velocity distribution at the top of the void, thereby validatingthe CFD method employing the k-e model of turbulence. Detailedconsideration has been made to identify the flow field in thevoid space by using the CFD results.

ABSTRACT An enclosing fence around a single unit house often givesstrong influence on the indoor airflow caused by cross-ventilation.The influence of fences on cross-ventilation is examined by CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) in this paper. The calculationarea of numerical simulations of cross-ventilation should havenot only the indoor space but also the surrounding outdoor spaceof a house to analyze the airflow continuously. The heights offences and the distances between fences and a model house areused as parameters of simulation models. The results of the numericalsimulations for the model houses with the fences are comparedeach other and with that of the model house without the fence.When the fence is higher, the indoor airflow pattern greatly changedand the cross-ventilation rate decreases. However, the distancebetween the fence and the model house has little influence onboth the indoor airflow pattern and the cross-ventilation rate.

ABSTRACT Airflow within an apartment is important for the performancein terms of providing thermal comfort. Cross-ventilation is themost effective cooling method against the hot-humid climate. Thispaper aims to study impact of partition walls on air velocityand air distribution in apartments with cross-ventilation. Airflowpatterns and velocities in six apartments, constructed in southernChina, have been studied. A commercial program Flovent, basedon Computational Fluid Dynamics, is used for simulations. Theresults of the study have indicated that the different modificationof internal walls designed by users create different airflow patternswithin the same configuration of the apartments. They have a significantinfluence on internal air distribution. In one bedroom ventilationis bad, but if ventilated holes are added to the partition wallof the room, ventilation within the room could be improved.

ABSTRACT Displacement ventilation offers improved air qualityand reduced cooling costs relative to ventilation systems thatmix supply and room air. However, thermal stratification at highinternal loads can cause excessive variation of temperature withheight which violates thermal comfort requirements.

Abstract: Terminals on the exhausts of all types of ventilationsystems alter system performance as they interact with the exhaustflow and the wind. They cause a pressure loss and the wind mayeither assist the exhaust flow, cause a resistance or even flowreversal. The precise effects depend on terminal design, exhaustflow rate, wind speed, wind angle and wind direction. This paperdiscusses a suitable test procedure and rating method which allowsterminals to be selected on a basis of performance. The widelyvarying performance of some popular designs is discussed.

Abstract: Knowledge of air flow patterns and thermal parametersare essential in the design of a ventilation system for largeenclosures. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the possibilityof using computer simulation to predict the airflow pattern andremoval effectiveness of ventilation systems in large enclosures.The quality of air and thermal comfort in a three-floor shoppingcentre are studied by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method.Two ventilation systems are selected. In System 1, rooms are ventilatedby two ceiling slot diffusers, supplying air downward into therooms. The halls are equipped with wall jet diffusers, deliveringair in a horizontal direction. Airflow and air quality, underboth summer and winter conditions, are investigated. In System2, the air in each room is supplied in a radial manner by fourceiling rectangular diffusers. The hall and balconies have jetdiffusers which supply air vertically downward. Different ventilationrates, outdoor air ratios and supply air temperatures are studies.Occupants are simulated by heat and CO2 sources without aerodyamicblockages. It was found that the summer and winter air temperaturedifference in the shopping centre differ by approximately 2 oC.The rectangular air diffusers should be used in the rooms andthe jet diffusers in the halls and balconies.

Abstract: In this article, five k-e, two-equation models are studied:the standard k-e model, a low-Reynolds-number k-e model, a two-layerk-e model, a two-scale k-e model, and a renormalization group(RNG) k-e model. They are evaluated for their performance in predictingnatural convection, forced convection, and mixed convection inrooms, as well as an impinging jet flow. Corresponding experimentaldata from the literature are used for validation. It is foundthat the prediction of the mean velocity is more accurate thanthat of the turbulent velocity. These models are neither ableto predict anisotropic turbulence correctly nor to pick up thesecondary recirculation of indoor air flow; otherwise the performanceof the standard k-e model is good. The RNG k-e model is slightlybetter than the standard k-e model and is therefore recommendedfor simulations of indoor air flow. The performance of the othermodels is not stable.

Coogan J J USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 1, 1996, (preprint), 9 figs,refs. Abstract: Differential flow control is the most common methodof room pressurization practiced today. It has long been appliedto constant-volume spaces and is now frequently applied in variable-volumerooms as well. However, differential flow is not a direct indicationof pressurization. As a result, questions have lingered aboutwhere it should be applied and what it takes to ensure success.This paper analyzes the relationship between a controlled differentialflow and the actual infiltration flows from the surrounding spaces.Several fairly simple cases are examined to establish some limitson the applicability of this concept. The following conclusionsare drawn. The method is extremely reliable when the pressurizedspace is in contact with one other space. In more complicatedlayouts, infiltration paths significantly increase the flow differenceneeded for negative pressurization. Also in more complicated layouts,changes in the surrounding pressures can cause pressurizationto fail. Infiltration paths to spaces with varying pressures (includingthe outside of the building) should be minimized.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to predictthe indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated room and overallventilation effectiveness of air distribution systems. The predictionsof indoor thermal comfort is based on Fanger's comfort equationsincorporated into the CFD model. A radiation heat exchange modelis included for the calculation of mean radiant temperature aswell as heat transfer through room boundaries. The overall ventilationeffectiveness is related to the energy required for achievingindoor thermal comfort and good air quality. These indices wereused to evaluate room air distribution systems for heating andcooling operations. It has been found that the most effectiveair distribution system for heating operation differs from thatfor cooling. It is shown that an air distribution system thatresults in upward displacement ventilation performs better thanothers in terms of indoor air quality and energy use by may causelocal thermal discomfort.

Abstract: Local thermal discomfort in offices with displacementventilation is investigated using computational fluid dynamics.The standard k-e turbulence model is used for the prediction ofindoor air flow patterns, temperature and moisture distributions,taking account of heat transfer by conduction, convection andradiation. The thermal comfort level and draught risk are predictedby incorporating Fanger's comfort equations in the airflow model.It has been found that for sedentary occupants with summer clothingcommon complaints of discomfort in offices ventilated with displacementsystems result more often from an unsatisfactory thermal sensationlevel than from draught alone. It is shown that thermal discomfortin the displacement ventilated offices can be avoided by optimizingthe supply air velocity and temperature. It is also shown thatoptimal supply air conditions of a displacement system dependon the distance between the occupant and air diffuser.

Abstract: The ventilation design concept, model experiment results,two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation, and on-sitemeasurements are presented for the Danish Pavilion project atthe 1992 World Exhibition in Seville. The paper gives a shortproject history for the building and the ventilation system. Theair-conditioned restaurant and exhibition hall have a floor areaof 450 m2 (4,850 ft2) and a mean height of 18m (59 ft). It isventilated by a 'cooling wall' with a height of 12m (39 ft). Theflow from the cooling wall is similar to the flow in a room withdisplacement ventilation. Scale-model experiments and computationalfluid dynamics simulations indicate a velocity level in the occupiedzone of approximately 0.6m/s (120fpm) and the results are confirmedby on-site measurement in the exhibition hall. It is shown thateven a simplified two-dimensional flow simulation will give valuableinformation to be used in the design procedure.

Abstract: Glazed facades may cause thermal discomfort due to downdraught.Convectors placed close to the facade can prevent downdraughtbut cause an increase in the energy consumption. The objectiveof the research has been to investigate if the structural systemof a glazed facade can be used to reduce downdraught and to avoidthermal comfort problems in the occupied zone. The effect of largeobstacles on a cold boundary layer flow has been investigatedfor different temperature differences between a cold surface andthe room air, different distances between the obstacles and differentsizes of the obstacles. The effect of the obstacles on the boundarylayer flow depended on the characteristics of the flow and ofthe sizes of the obstacles. With turbulent flow and an obstaclelarger than the boundary layer thickness the boundary layer flowseparated from the surface and a new boundary layer was establishedbelow the obstacle. The risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraughtwas reduced considerably.

Abstract: In buildings with large glazed facades there may byproblems with thermal discomfort due to downdraught. Convectorsplaced close to the facade can prevent this but they will causean increased energy consumption. Recent research has shown thatthe risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraught can be reducedby structural measures. Laboratory experiments has shown thatlarge obstacles, such as the structural system of a glazed facade,which is placed in the cold boundary layer, can reduce downdraughtconsiderably. This paper deals with the ability of ComputationalFluid Dynamics to predict downdraught at a plane wall and at awall with large obstacles. Quite simple boundary conditions wereused in this study.

Shao L, Riffat S B, Whittle J K UK, University of Nottingham, Institute of Building Technology,1995, 17pp, 5 figs, 2 refs. Abstract: Natural ventilation systems assisted by passive stacksare currently designed without incorporating heat recovery leadingto wasteful heat loss. Heat recovery is not used because the pressureloss caused by a conventional heat exchanger is large and couldcause the ventilation system to fail. The heat pipe promises highercapacity because it has much higher thermal conductance than conventionalheat exchangers. Individual heat pipes can be independently locatedin ventilation stacks, making it easier to achieve lower pressuredrops. Experimental results show that for a heat recovery efficiencyof 50% and stack flow speed of 0.5 m/s, the pressure loss acrossan existing type of heat-pipe assembly is about 1 Pascal. Computersimulation of pressure and flow loss caused by heat-pipes wascarried out using computational fluid dynamics. It has been shownthat heat-pipes located at the bottom of the stack produce greaterinsertion flow loss (IFL) than those located at the top and heatpipes next to the stack walls give rise to less IFL than thosein the centre. Furthermore, it has been shown that the IFL isthe preferred indicator. The temperature of the heat pipe haslittle effect on flow loss performance of the heat exchangers.

Panneer Selvam R USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 1, 1996, preprint, 6 figs,refs. Abstract: Flow over and around a building is computed using theF3Dke model, which is based on the k-e turbulence model. The convectionterm is approximated using the hybrid upwind (HU) and the streamlineupwind (SU) procedures. Fine and coarse grids are considered tostudy flow features and pressure coefficients. Flow separationon the roof and sides of the building is captured using the finegrid but not the coarse grid and the HU and SU procedures. Thecomputed flow features over a two-dimensional building using theSU procedure are similar to the wind-tunnel model prediction.The computed pressure coefficients using coarse and fine gridsare almost the same for two-and three dimensional buildings. Thecomputed pressure coefficients around a building at a universitycompare well with field measurements.

Abstract: The two-layer methods combining the k-e model in theexternal, fully turbulent flow region with either the one-equationmodel or the low-Reynolds-number modified k-e model in the near-wallarea have been tested in computing the wind conditions arounda cubic building. Results were compared with those from the k-emodel computation as well as those from the experiments. Comparisonshows that neither the k-e model approach nor the modified k-emodel-based two-layer method can represent the flow separationabove the roof surface and near the side walls. The one-equationmodel based on the two-layer approach, however, is effective inpredicting the separation. The numerical prediction of the windinduced pressure n building surfaces, especially on the roof andside walls, is also improved as compared with the other two methods.

Abstract: Two new tools have been developed for the analysis ofwind effects on both ventilation systems and building constructions.They make possible the optimisation of an investment in naturalventilation systems; mechanical ventilation system performanceand the type of building construction. Up till recently, lackof knowledge and poor estimations of difficult to predict windeffects have often led to ventilation systems with no optimalperformance and to poor building design in relation to wind hinderand wind load. This increases ventilation costs. Measures to reducewind problems on buildings afterwards are often not fully effective,while costs are much higher compared to measures taken in thedesign stage. Present analysis tools, like wind tunnel tests andcomputer model studies, and considered relatively expensive andnot well fitted to serve designers' needs. The two new tools haveovercome these disadvantages and costs are reduced to about 10%.Data input and output are easy to handle by users with littleexperience.

Abstract: Contains a final synthesis of the simulation exerciseson the Collins building, consisting of the thermal simulationof a commercial building coupled with a VAV conditioning system,performed within the IEA - Annex XVII research project (BuildingEnergy Management Systems). The main goal of Annex XVII was toanalyse and to develop methodologies and tools that could be usedto evaluate 'building energy management systems' (BEMS). One ofthe Annex XVII activities consisted of utilizing procedures ofnumerical simulation to evaluate the control strategies usuallyimplemented in BEMS. The main concern was not only the potentialenergy savings, but also thermo-igrometric comfort performancesof HVAC systems. The system chosen for the simulation exercisesdealing with conditioning applications was the 'Collins building'.It is a multistorey commercial building in Glasgow, Scotland,that was already analysed and simulated during previous IEA researchprojects (Annex IV and Annex X). The simulation activity startedwith common exercises (ex. 1,2) aimed at defining a referencecase and testing existing simulation codes. This activity continuedwith diversified exercises (ex. 3,4) aimed at the implementationand evaluation of different control strategies. Most of the participantcountries used TRNSYS code to run the simulation exercises. Forthis reason, a reference library of TRNSYS subroutines (TRNSYStypes) and a reference input file (TRNSYS deck) were developed.The report is divided into three sections: The first section containsa synthesis of the last common simulation exercise (Ex. 2).

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a three-dimensionalmathematical model to compute heat transfer within a radiantlyheated or cooled room, which then calculates the mass-averagedroom air temperature and the wall surface temperature distributions.The radiation formulation used in the model accommodates arbitraryplacement of walls and objects within the room. The convectionmodel utilizes Nusselt number correlations published in the openliterature. The complete energy transfer model is validated bycomparing calculated room temperatures to temperatures measuredin a radiantly heated room. This three-dimensional model may beapplied to a building to assist the heating/cooling system designengineer in sizing a radiant heating/cooling system. By couplingthis model with a thermal comfort model, the comfort levels throughoutthe room can be easily and efficiently mapped for a given radiantheater/cooler location. In addition, obstacles such as airplanes,trucks, furniture, and partitions can be easily incorporated todetermine their effect on the radiant heating system performance.

Moser A, Off F, Schaelin A, Yuan X USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 101, Pt 2, 1995, preprint, 8pp,6 figs, refs. Abstract: The thermal comfort and buoyancy-induced motion of airin a room are determined by the interaction of different typesof heat transfer and of thermal storage in building components.Heat transfer includes energy transport by radiation, convection,and conduction (within air and the building fabric). The drivingforces of buoyancy of air become more pronounced for tall spaces.Therefore, proper modeling of these interactions becomes morecrucial in the design of large enclosures. In atria, in particular,solar and infrared radiation are important because of large-areaglazing. The boundary conditions for airflow, surface-to-surfaceradiation, and building dynamics are linked by surface temperaturesthat may vary in time and space. Numerical methods for the directcoupling of computational fluid dynamics with thermal dynamicsand radiation are proposed and demonstrated at a case study buildingof IEA Annex 26.

Abstract: Flow and temperature distributions in an atrium witha tall ceiling height (H = 130m) are analyzed by means of computationalfluid dynamics (CFD) and radiation simulation. The occupied region(the space near the floor) of the atrium, which is open to a largevoid space, is partially air conditioned. The effects of the flowand temperature fields of the void space on the occupied regionare analyzed in detail. Then the effects of ventilation in theupper space of the atrium on the temperature distribution areexamined. The analyzed void space, 130 m high, is sandwiched betweentwo high-rise office buildings. The west and east sides are coveredwith glass walls, through which much solar heat is introducedinto the void space. In summer, only the lowest portion of theatrium is well air-conditioned, and the rest of the space, especiallythe upper part, is heated by the sunshine and becomes hot. Theatrium has open bridges at every floor to connect the two officebuildings, so the flow and temperature around these bridges aregreatly affected by the atrium air. The analysis includes solarradiation (shortwave) simulation, radiative heat transfer (infrared)simulation, heat conduction simulation, and airflow and temperaturedistribution analysis of the atrium space (CFD analysis). Ventilatingthe upper space effectively limits the temperature rise in theupper part of the atrium to within an acceptable level. The radiationand convection simulations clearly show the characteristics ofthe flow and temperature fields of the large-scale atrium.

The validity of the solutionis discussed in relation to temperature stratification, positionof neutral pressure plane, and orientation of the openings. Specifictopics are discussed concerning: air velocity and ventilation capacity as affected by openingarea ratio (i.e. inlet area/outlet area), size of opening areas required for ventilation capacity orrequired temperature difference, optimum opening area ratio, and coefficients of interest (i.e., velocity, contraction, discharge,and resistance coefficients).

Abstract: Vertical temperature differences tend to be great ina large indoor space such as an atrium, and it is important topredict variations of vertical temperature distribution in theearly stage of the design. The authors previously developed andreported on a new simplified unsteady-state calculation modelfor predicting vertical temperature distribution in a large space.Comparisons between calculated values and the results of testchamber experiments verified that the model can be used to makeaccurate predictions for conditions of no solar radiation. Inthis paper, this model is applied to predicting the vertical temperaturedistribution in an existing low-rise atrium that has a skylightand is affected by transmitted solar radiation. Detailed calculationprocedures that use the model are presented with all the boundaryconditions, and analytical simulations are carried out for thecooling condition. Calculated values are compared with measuredresults. The results of the comparison demonstrate that the calculationmodel can be applied to the design of a large space.

Abstract: The climate in a glazed space and the energy requirementin it are greatly affected by the outside climate, particularlyby solar radiation. When calculations are made for a glazed space,solar radiation must therefore by treated considerably more fullythan for a conventional building with windows of normal size.In order that the proportion of solar radiation utilized in differenttypes of glazed spaces may be assessed, calculations have beenmade with the computer program DEROB-LTH. The calculations demonstratethat the type of glazing, the transmissivity of the glass, andthe absorptivity of the surfaces inside the glazed space (i.e..the dark and light surfaces) have a great significance for theproportion of transmitted solar radiation retained inside theglazed space. On the other hand, the geographical location ofthe glazed space in Sweden, its orientation, and the time of yearare of less importance. The proportion of transmitted solar radiationretained in the glazed space may vary between about 30% and 90%.A simple manual calculation method has been developed for theassessment of the temperature and energy requirement in glazedspaces. The effect of the glazed space on the energy requirementsof surrounding buildings can also be estimated. It is intendedthat this calculation method be used as early as possible duringthe preliminary design stage so that an idea may be gained ofthe difference between alternative designs.

Abstract: This paper presents the combination of a linear temperaturestratification model and the use of ISO 7730 for calculating thermalcomfort. Measurements have shown that close to linear temperatureprofiles are common in atria, mainly due to large hot and coldsurfaces. the presented stratification model is integrated intoa dynamic single-zone energy simulation program. Based on thestratified air temperature and calculated surface temperaturesof an atrium, thermal comfort is calculated for five location.Results are presented as hourly and accumulated curves, and hourlydata are compared to measurements. The simulations show some deviationsfrom measured values, as expected for the simplified approaches,and the results are analyzed to locate the main sources of errors.In spite of the less accurate results, tools like this are ofgreat value in design and retrofit processes because of theirwide availability and simple use.

Abstract: This paper describes a general principle for accuratecalculation of the effect of shading objects on surfaces exposedto direct solar radiation. The principle used is known as 'polygonclipping', a technique for determining every subpolygon that ariseswhen two or more polygons overlap one another. In this case, theobstructing objects are approximated by polygons in space, projectedas seen from the sun, at any given time of the year, onto theexposed surface of interest, so that every sunlit region and thefully or partly shaded regions of the plane surface can be determined.The technique has been implemented in a PC software application,which can function as a stand-along design tool or may be integratedwith programs for thermal simulation of buildings or solar systems.The paper gives examples of the use of application, shows itsfunctionality when integrated with a thermal simulation tool,and presents comparative validations against the standard ASHRAEalgorithms for calculations of overhangs and side fins.

Buchan, Lawton, Parent Ltd Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, June 1992, 55pp. Theproject consisted of design development, construction, and follow-uptesting and inspection of ten typical single-family house basementsin Southern Ontario. One non-typical house was also investigated.A range of builders participated in the project constructing housesand commenting on their experiences. This is a final report consistingof results from the construction phase and the soak test phase.Of the schemes tested, six were insulated from the exterior, fourfrom the interior, and the additional house had an insulatingblock wall scheme. General findings from the construction phasewere that interior insulation schemes were favoured over exteriorones, but that both systems have different detailing problemsfor which training is required to resolve. Rigid glass fibre insulationwas found to be easier to apply to exterior walls with commonly-foundirregularities than were rigid polystyrene materials. Panelizedabove-grade insulation protection products offer some advantagesover site applied ones, but they tend to be difficult to adaptfor residential use. Composite geotextiles wall drainage panelsand ledge blocks require further development to improve theirapplicability to residential construction. Other basement designconfigurations (ie. modifications to the methods tried) may solvesome of the problems encountered by builders in this project.The soak testing indicated that for the basement systems demonstratedand the soil conditions at these sites, the moisture handlingmethods were generally successful in limiting leakage problems.Soil conditions on the test sites provided fair to good drainage.Care must be taken to avoid gaps with the drainage of insulationmaterials and finish detailing where moisture ingress can be concentrated.It is evident that builders and trades persons require more technicalinformation and experience on the use of materials where moisturehandling is important.

Abstract: Glazed facades may cause thermal discomfort due to downdraft.Convectors placed close to the facade can prevent downdraft butcan cause an increase in the energy consumption. The objectiveof this research was to investigate whether the structural systemof a glazed facade can be used to reduce downdraft and avoid thermalcomfort problems in the occupied zone. The effect of large obstacleson a cold boundary layer flow was investigated for different temperaturedifferences between the obstacles, and different sizes of theobstacles. The effect of the obstacles was dependent on the characteristicsof the flow and the sizes of the obstacles. With turbulent flowand an obstacle larger than the boundary layer thickness, theflow separated from the surface and a new boundary layer was establishedbelow the obstacle. The risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraftwas reduced considerably.

Abstract: A simplified ground heat loss calculation method forslab-on-grade floors and basements is developed. The method isbased on the results from the ITPE method and is suitable forseasonal heat loss calculation. The simplified method consistsof a set of equations for estimating the monthly total heat flowbetween a building and the ground as a function of a wide rangeof variables such as building dimensions, insulation configurations,and soil thermal properties. The equations are designed to acceptcontinuously variable input values. The simplified method predictionsare tested against Mitalas's and ITPE results. The agreement betweenthe correlations and the ITPE method is found to be within 10%for the annual mean, amplitude, and phase angle of total buildingheat loss.

Abstract: Describes how field testing found that uncontrolledair flows and building depressurisation are widespread in a sampleof eight Florida commercial buildings. These eight buildings experiencedsubstantial depressurisation under normal operation. In tightbuildings, only a small imbalance of air flow can produce seriousdepressurisation problems. In very leaky buildings, large airflow imbalances may produce only moderate depressurisation. Theproblems caused by depressurisation in these buildings includehigh humidity levels, mould and mildew growth on wall surfacesand in building cavities, moisture damage to building materials,extinguished pilot lights, combustion equipment backdrafting,flame roll-out, sewer gas entering the building, and doors beingdifficult to open.

Lindstrom A B, Proffitt D, Fortune C R Indoor Air, No 5, 1995, pp 258-269, 11 tabs, refs. Abstract: Indoor air quality (IAQ) was assessed in homes in anexperimental community of single-family dwellings that had beenbuilt with materials chosen for low pollutant emission and othermodified design features to provide enhanced residential indoorair quality. The IAQ was measured in six of these experimentalhomes and also in three conventionally built homes of similarsize and price range. The IAQ was assessed shortly after constructionbefore the houses were occupied and again after each of the houseshad been occupied for five months. Before occupancy, there werehigher levels of airborne particles and of some volatile organiccompounds in the conventional homes than in the experimental homes.During occupancy, benzene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, ando-xylene were all higher in the conventional homes, but dichloromethane,Freon 11, and trichlorethylene were higher in the experimentalhomes. In the conventional homes, mean levels of benzene and chloroformincreased, whereas methylchloroform and toluene levels decreasedfrom preoccupancy to occupancy. In the experimental homes, dichloromethaneincreased, and m-and p-xylene and o-xylene decreased from preoccupancyto occupancy. The results suggest that attached garages, geographicalsiting, and occupants' activities substantially influenced theIAQ in these homes. The enhanced indoor air quality homes testedin this study were judged to be a least partially effective, withthe most obvious sustained IAQ benefits being related to the lackof an attached garage.

Chow W K Tunnelling Underground Space Technol., April 1995, Vol 10, No2, pp 225-245, 15 figs, 3 tabs, refs. Abstract: Ventilation design for underground car parks is studied,first through a brief review of the ventilation requirement. Carbonmonoxide concentration is believed to be the most important chemicalspecies to be considered. Some results on field measurement ofunderground car parks reported in the literature are reviewed.The well-mixed model, which is a basic design model for studyingthe transient variation of carbon monoxide concentration, is described.The model is then revised to describe multiple sources of emissionfor several cars staying in a carpark with their internal combustionengines operating. Two mixing models proposed by Sandbert 1981)-Model1, based on a displacement ventilation system and Model 3, basedon a ventilation system with a short-circuiting air flow path-areapplied to study the ventilation design in car parks. The techniqueof computational fluid dynamics is used to verify those existingmodels and then to compute the mixing factors concerned. Key systemperformance parameters are calculated, and a set of graphs relatingthose system performance parameters with the input design datais presented. These graphs can be used for designing the requiredventilation rate for the system under different carbon monoxideloads. Eight local car parks are surveyed to illustrate the applicationof the model. Field measurement data on underground car parks,as described above, are reviewed and applied to justify the mixingmodels.

Abstract: Particle size distribution is important to characterizeairborne dust and to design particulate matter control strategies.New data are needed on particle size distribution in swine buildings,and the existing particle size distribution models need to beevaluated. The log-normal, power law, and Weibull models did notadequately describe the particle size distribution of dust samplescollected in rooms housing pigs. An alternative two-parameterempirical model was developed that fit the data much more closelythan the other models. The parameters of the particle size distributionfunction did not vary significantly among rooms housing pigs indifferent stages of production, suggesting that similar dust controlstrategies may be developed for a wide variety of pig housingfacilities.

Zhang Y, Barber E M, Patience J F, Feddes J J R USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 101, Pt 2, 1995, preprint, 13pp,8 figs, 2 tabs, refs. Abstract: Sprinkling a small amount of mineral oil onto the floorarea in a livestock building has been demonstrated as an effectivemethod to reduce dust concentration. The objective of this studywas to evaluate mechanical properties of different types of oilssprinkled at different temperatures and pressures. Six biologicaloils (purified canola, crude canola, corn, sunflower, flax, andsoybean) and one mineral oil (baby oil) were evaluated at temperaturesbetween 10 and 40oC (50 and 104oF). Density and viscosity of theoils were measured using a viscometer. Sprinkleability in termsof droplet diameter and uniformity was measured under differentpressures using a computer image processing system and a microscope.Oil mist at the animal and human breathing levels (0.1, 0.8, and1.6 m [0.33, 2.62, and 5.25 ft] above floor) were examined during,and 10 seconds after, oil sprinkling. Proper oil sprinkling shouldbe carried out at a pressure and temperature that produces oildroplets smaller than an upper threshold diameter (UTD) to ensuregood sprinkleability, but larger than a lower threshold diameter(LTD) to avoid producing oil mist. Optimum range of temperatureand pressure for each type of oil are recommended. Keywords: dust, animal house #NO 9440 A Finnish classification system for a healthy indoorclimate.

Abstract: The problems of developing countries are often verydifferent to those of the industrialised regions of the world.The impact of VOC pollution in large cities in developing countrieshas not been adequately considered. Many of these cities haverapidly growing numbers of motor vehicles in climates that promotethe formation of photochemical smog. The health implications ofthis, together with the cancer risks associated with several VOCshave not yet been properly evaluated. The levels of a varietyof volatile organic compounds (VOC) were measured in several citiesin Asia;Bangkok, Manila and Beijing, and in South America, SaoPaulo, Santiago and Caracas. Preliminary results of studies inthese countries have indicated that VOC levels are higher thannormally encountered in European counties and that indoor levelsare not significantly different to those outdoors. It is likelythat the majority of VOCs measured indoors and outdoors are attributableto motor vehicles, although the results of samples currently beinganalysed will enable a more detailed analysis to be given.

Measurements of VOCs were carried outin the indoor and outdoor air in six office buildings, along withthe measurement of other chemical, sensory and physical parameters.The number of VOCs found in each building was higher than sixty.The most abundant VOCs were aliphatic and aromatic compounds.The VOCs detected in the outdoor air show a strong relation tothe traffic existing in the nearby area. Correlation of the concentrationsfound in the indoor and outdoor air shows that the outdoor aircontributes significantly to the chemical pollution of the indoorair in some of the buildings.

Comfort ventilation isassessed by measuring occupant perceptions of indoor air quality,including their assessments of odors, thermal conditions, andventilation adequacy. For health ventilation, indoor spaces mustreceive air that is free from hazardous chemical or microbiologicalcontaminants.

Abstract: The term"healthy building", has been popularizedin recent years as a response to the previously popular term,'sick building'. It is difficult to define healthy buildings orto establish criteria for classifying buildings as healthy withoutreferring to the presence or absence of problems, occupant complaints,and illnesses. In practice, we generally define 'sick buildings'by the prevalence rates of occupant health, and comfort problems.The complexity of modern buildings, the diversity of actors involvedand processes for making them, and the importance of buildingenvironments for people in modern western societies present largechallenges to those who would create healthy buildings. A newparadigm is needed to understand buildings, how they become unhealthy,and how to keep them from becoming 'sick'. 'Building ecology'is a conceptual framework for understanding buildings and creatinghealthy ones. Practical steps are recommended to develop a morecomplete theoretical framework and application principles. A fewcriteria for healthy buildings can serve as examples for the developmentof a more complete set.

Abstract: The appropriate specific short term technical fixesfor a facility with Indoor Air Quality concerns will always bebased on HVAC system limitations, any ability to eliminate orreduce pollutant sources, associated health risks, and the budgetsthat can be identified for corrective actions. Decreasing thelikelihood of any facility to have Indoor Quality problems mustbegin with sound conceptual building system designs and includea cost effective easy to maintain HVAC system. With detailed designand construction work we are confident that a good quality, lowmaintenance, central ventilation system can be installed in mostschools within the project budget. Unit ventilators may have alower first cost but their life cycle costs will be far more thancentral systems taking energy and maintenance into considerationover the 30 year life span of a typical school project. Additionally,unit ventilators will never deliver the high quality indoor environmentthat is possible with a well designed and operated centralizedsystem be it displacement or conventional. Finally, the conceptsutilized in the design of a vertical displacement ventilationsystem for high density human occupied spaces are very similarto the concepts utilized for the design of an industrial application.We look forward to the opportunity to move the concept to bothother climatic regions and an industrial application, ad the situationmay arise.

Abstract: There is little data available on the concentrationof volatile organic compounds is dwellings and office buildingsin the Czech Republic. There is data on formaldehyde concentrationsin buildings but it is mostly collected from buildings where peoplehave complained about the quality of indoor air, especially whenit is known that the building materials or furnishings may containformaldehyde. Since the complaints of occupants of a buildingare generally non-specific, it is sometimes very difficult toguess what is the main problem in the building. When it is suggestedthat the problem could be due to something familiar and variouspossibilities, for example dry air or volatile organic compounds,are put forward these suggestions are often accepted. Probablybecause they are familiar and understood by the occupants. Wehave made some measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC)in non-industrial and non-occupational environments. People wereasked about any problem they had with the environment. Most oftenthey replied that the problems were of annoyance or unpleasantsmells. A common complaint is dryness of mucous membranes. Thisproblem is not dangerous from the point of view of people's healthbut does concern their quality of life. For people with chronicrespiratory disease, including allergies, such irritation of themucous membrane, or skin, could worsen their condition. The lowconcentrations of VOC's and formaldehyde that we found indoorsin non-industrial environment are probably not dangerous, butcan reduce the quality of life for the people in the buildings.The quality of life if said to have some connection with the immunesystem. From that point of view even the low concentration ofchemical compounds indoors can affect people.

Abstract: Exposure to VOCs present in the air we breathe may haveeffects on people's health and well-being. Exposure in our homescan make a significant contribution to our total exposure to VOCs.To investigate the factors determining the concentration of VOCsand formaldehyde in homes, diffusive sampling techniques havebeen used to monitor the indoor air in five UK homes and one outdoorlocation over a three year period. The main total volatile organiccompound (TVOC) concentration recorded indoors was 200 ug m3 andthis was six times higher than the outdoor concentration. Therelative amounts of individual compounds recorded indoors andoutdoors varied depending on the relative importance of indoorand outdoor sources for each compound. Differences in concentrationsdetected between rooms in the same home indicate that an individual'sexposure to formaldehyde and VOCs will be influenced by the timespent in different rooms of the home. There was significant variationin the concentrations of formaldehyde and VOCs over time. Forformaldehyde seasonal effects were found to dominate, with higherconcentrations being recorded in summer than in winter, whilstfor other VOCs occupant activities were more important. For example,higher concentrations of TVOCs and undecane were found to relateto greater amounts of painting in the home.

Levy L S Indoor Environ, No 4, 1995, pp 254-262, 1 fig, 3 tabs, 35 refs. Abstract: The last decade has seen the publication of an increasingnumber of scientific papers in which lung tumours have been inducedin rats following chronic exposure by inhalation to a range ofinsoluble, respiratory-sized particulate dusts which hithertohave been considered to be biologically inert. Such substancesinclude talc, titanium dioxide, volcanic ash and carbon black.Such particles have generally been considered 'nuisance dusts',possibly capable of eliciting fibrogenic changes, but not cancer.The one feature that all these studies in rats have in commonis that the experimental exposures induced 'over-loading' of thelung as evidenced by an increase in lung weight, retention ofparticles and chronic and marked inflammatory changes. All ofthis was preceded by an underlying 'overloading' of the alveolarmacrophages to the point where they stopped removing particlesfrom the lung. This can happen in a number of experimental species,but it is only the rat that appears to respond with lung tumoursas an additional pathological response. This points to the lungtumours being a rat-specific response and thus not a very usefulend-point for human risk evaluation for such biologically inertparticles. In support of this view is the remarkable observationthat in the one well-studied occupational group that routinelyhas 'particle overload; in the lungs, namely coal miners, thereis no evidence that they experience an excess risk of lung cancer.

Zock J-P, Heederik D, Kromhout H UK, Ann Occup Hyg, Vol 39, No 6, 1995, pp 841-854, 2 figs, 5 tabs,refs. Abstract: Exposure to organic dust components was studied in fourpotato processing plants because preliminary results showed highexposures accompanied by work-related health complaints. Ambientair concentrations of inhalable dust ranged from below 0.4 upto 44mg m-3 [geometric mean (GM) 0.64 mg m-3}. Respirable dustconcentrations were considerable lower. Personal concentrationsof inhalable dust were somewhat higher, and strongly related toa few working tasks dealing with dried starch or protein. Ambientair concentrations of endotoxin ranged from 0.5 to more than 60,000endotoxin units (EU) per m3 for the inhalable size fraction (GM+ 280 EUm-3). For the respirable size fraction, endotoxin concentrationswere lower (about the same factor as for dust). Personal endotoxinconcentrations were lower than ambient air concentrations, probablybecause workers did not work the whole period of the shift nearendotoxin sources. Endotoxin exposure was evaluated as very high;23%of the workers had a mean exposure above 1000EUm-3 (100ng m-3).Differences between plants had a large influence on both dustand endotoxin exposure. A fairly good correlation was found betweencounts of airborne gram-negative bacteria and airborne endotoxinof the respirable size fraction. Ambient air levels of bacteriaand endotoxin were strongly related to process water temperature,suggesting that exposure reduction can be achieved by loweringthis temperature or by other measures that inhibit bacterial growth.We conclude that recycling of process water probably constitutesan exposure source of bacteria and endotoxin in many facilities.

Maghirang R G, Riskowski G L, Christianson L L, Manbeck H B USA, Ashrae Transactions, 1995, Vol 101, Pt 2, preprint, 2 figs,refs. Abstract: Dust in animal buildings should be controlled to levelsthat affect health only minimally. Dust control strategies includereducing the rate of emission (source control), effective ventilation(ventilation control), and air cleaning (removal control). Sourcecontrol strategies include use of feed additives, cleaning dustysurfaces and spraying water or oil over dusty surfaces. Ventilationcontrol includes purge ventilation and effective room air distribution.Air cleaning strategies involve filtration, electrostatic precipitation,or wet scrubbing. Promising techniques for livestock buildingsinclude the use of additives, oil or water spraying, purge ventilationand effective room air distribution. Technical and economic constraintshave prevented these methods from being widely practiced. Effectiveand economically feasible dust control methods should be developedand systematically tested under both controlled laboratory andfield conditions. Other research and development needs include:1) characterization of dust particles, dust sources and sinks;and 2) development of sensors and control devices that incorporatethe dust control technology into the environmental control system.

Abstract: A registry-based case control study, involving 120 cases(28 males, 92 females) of lung cancer deaths, was conducted in1985 in the city of Guangzhou to investigate whether lifestylefactors are associated with an increased incidence of lung cancerin never-smoking individuals. The cases were matched with twocontrol groups which consisted of non-respiratory-disease-relateddeaths or non-respiratory-related cancer deaths. Lifestyle factorsassessed in the study include: personal history of nonmalignantrespiratory diseases, practice of fresh vegetable consumption,lifetime occupation and occupational exposure histories, exposureto ETS, degree of indoor air pollution, general conditions ofhome residence, cooking practices and environments, and familyhistory of cancer. Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrateda negative association between fresh vegetable consumption andlung cancer risk in both sexes, suggesting that vegetables mayexert a 'protective' effect against lung cancer in humans. Inmales, elevated risks were found between lung cancer and occupationalexposure. In females, indoor air pollution and kitchen environmentwere associated with risk of lung cancer. No statistically significantassociation was observed between lung cancer and all other factorsexamined, including exposure to ETS. A second case-control, studywas performed in 1986 to investigate the possible associationbetween spousal smoking and lung cancer deaths. Cases consistedof 75 never-smoking females and the two control groups consistedof 126 cases of deaths due to tumors except lung cancer. Whencases were matched against"death-unrelated-to-tumor"controls, the odds ration [OR] for ETS exposure was 1.19, as gaugedby whether or not there was ETS exposure;0.72 and 1.62, when ETSwas assessed based on exposure to less than 20 or to 20 or morecigarettes/day. When ETS exposure was measured by 'smoking years'. Keywords: tobacco smoke, lung cancer, health #NO 9475 Determination of human exposure to environmentaltobacco smoke.

Abstract: The increased use of water-based paints (WBP) has changedexposure conditions for Swedish house painters but few exposuremeasurements have been made during the indoor application of WBP.The main aim of this study was to identify and quantify exposure,particularly to volatile organic compounds (VOC)during the indoorapplication of water-based paint. A secondary aim was to evaluatethe efficacy of different sampling absorbents for the measurementof the major VOCs emitted from WBP. Exposure measurements of VOCsformaldehyde, ammonia, dust and metals were performed by personalsampling during the indoor application of WBPs commonly used inSweden, VOCs were sampled on different sorbents, and were analysedby gas chromatography with a mass selective detector. The desorbtionefficiency of different sorbents was also determined and XAD-7was found to be the most appropriate for glycols and glycol ethers.Exposure to VOCs formaldehyde, ammonia and metals was low, comparedwith current Swedish permissible exposure limit values (PEL) butdust exposures were found in excess of the PEL of 10mg m-3. Alarge proportion of the VOCs consisted of propyleneglycol (PG),diglycol ethers, Texano (2,2,4-trimethyl 1,3-pentanediol monoiso-butyrate),and iso-butanol. The introduction of water-based paints has improvedthe work environment for most house painters by reducing the totalVOC exposure, but VOC exposure has now shifted towards compoundswhich are more polar and which have higher boiling points.

Norback D Indoor Air, No 5, 1995, pp 237-246, 7 tabs, refs. Abstract: There is a growing concern about indoor air quality(IAQ) in schools, We have studied relations between subjectiveindoor air quality (SIAQ) and measured IAQ among school personnel(N=97) in six mid-Swedish primary schools. Information on SIAQand the psychosocial work environment was measured by a self-administeredquestionnaire, using analogue rating scales. Indoor exposureswere quantified by hygienic measurements. Perception of high roomtemperature was related to a poor climate of cooperation, fleecywall materials, and the concentration of volatile organic compounds(VOC), including xylene, limonene, and butanols. Perception ofair dryness was related to atopy, work stress, poor climate ofcooperation, high room temperature, low air humidity, and highVOC concentration,including, limonene, and n-alkanes. Perceptionof dusty air was related to work stress, the role of schoolteacher,and exposure to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. No relations were found betweenSIAQ and CO2. building age, or respirable dust. To achieve a goodSIAQ, room temperature should be kept at a maximum of 22oC, andexposure to VOCs and fleecy materials should be minimized. Finally,a sound psychosocial work climate is essential for the perceptionof a good physical indoor climate.

Hodgson A T Indoor Air, No 5, 1995, pp 247-257, 1 fig, 5 tabs, refs. Abstract: Numerous methods attempt to measure the combined concentrationsof volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air as total VOCs(TVOC). This paper reviews TVOC methods recently presented inthe literature and at an international conference on indoor airquality, for the purpose of identifying common practices and ofassessing the impacts that choices of sample collection mediaand analytical methods and instrumentation can have on TVOC results.The paper also presents the results of laboratory and field comparisonsof three TVOC methods. These are a flame-ionization-detector (FID)method, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method,and a method employing a photoacoustic infrared (IR) gas monitor.The laboratory experiments were conducted with eight differentmixtures of VOCs. The FID method demonstrated an average accuracyof 93+18per cent when the measured values were calculated as concentrationsof carbon. The FID and GC/MS methods demonstrated average accuraciesof 77+37 and 75+22 percent, respectively, when the measured hydrocarbon-equivalentvalues were compared to the expected mass concentrations of themixtures. The higher uncertainty for the FID was largely due tothe low mass response of 27 percent for chlorinated compounds.The response of the IR gas monitor varied between 6 and 560 percentfor different classes of compounds. Air samples from ten buildingswere analyzed by both the FID and GC/MS methods. The results werehighly correlated and similar, with the GC/MS values approximately20 percent higher on average.

The sub-foil region was small compared withthe crawl space and in direct contact with the soil, and becausethe influence of ventilation and radon emerging from buildingmaterials was largely suppressed. The experimental data was analyzedusing various types of models including a simplistic mass-balancemodel, a regression model, and a two-dimensional numerical modelbased on Darcy flow of soil gas and combined diffusive and advectivetransport of radon. The main outcome of the work was that :(i)The soil-gas entry rate per Pascal depressurization was at theorder of 1 m3 h-1 corresponding to an effective soil permeabilityof 5.10-10m2, (ii) the stack-related part of the depressurizationof the crawl space (approx. 0.1 PaoC-1)was controlled by the temperaturedifference between the living room of the house and the outdoors(not by the difference between the crawl space and the outdoors),(iii) that part of the wind-related depressurization that wasmeasured by the pressure transducers seemed to force radon intothe crawl space in the same proportion as the stack-related partof the depressurization, (iv) the ratio of advective and diffusiveentry was approx. 0.7, when the crawl space was depressurized1.5 Pa,(v) the effective diffusivity of the foil was found tobe three orders of magnitude larger than that measured in thelaboratory (the enhanced diffusivity was most likely caused byleaks in the foil and by mixing fans located in the crawl space),and (vi) there was no measurable mitigative impact of having thesheets of foil on the crawl-space floor even if the crawl spacewas artificially pressurized or depressurized.

Under natural conditions 2 to3% of the total crawl-space ventilation flow seemed to come fromthe soil. This flow accounted for 1/3 of the total radon entryfrom the soil.

Abstract: Historic buildings often consist of uninsulated masonrywalls. Such structures have lasted well because the absence ofinsulation and relatively low humidity levels of interior airhave kept the stone cladding warm and dry. The growing need forcontrolled conditions inside the existing building have led toan increase in typical levels of humidification, which presentsserious threats to the integrity and performance of traditionalwall construction. The dynamic buffer zone (DBZ) has been designedto introduce an intentionally controlled space between the controlledinterior environment and the variable exterior environment. Thislimits the migration of moisture-laden air from the interior intothe exterior masonry wall, thereby greatly increasing the potentialservice life of such assemblies. Further benefits of the DBZ canbe derived by integrating the DBZ with the building's HVAC systems.This paper describes the building physics issues, the DBZ system,and outlines its application to a 60 year old building in Toronto.

Price D L, Ramey D L, Ahearn D G Paper from: USA, University of Tulsa, 8th Indoor Air PollutionConference, proceedings, held September 25-27, 1995. Abstract: Heating ventilating and air conditioning duct insulationin a building located in south Florida was removed because ofheavy fungal infestation of the building. Samples of these materialswere examined by direct microscopy and enrichment culture. Additionalinsulation samples were desiccated for three weeks over silicadrying gel, weighed, then placed over saturated salt in watersolutions at known relative humidities. At relative humiditiesapproaching 95% some insulation samples on an average gained 6%of their dry weight in water. The water gain at various relativehumidities ranged from a low of 2% to a high of 9.3% of the dryweight. The hygroscopic nature of duct insulation and its capacityto absorb or trap organic particulates or volatiles is most likelya contributing factor in fungal colonization. The urea and formaldehydelevels in some insulations may control which fungi colonize thesesubstrates. This paper also reviews efforts to made the face coatingof insulation more resistant to fungal colonization.

Abstract: Describes a case study which involves a nursery schoolin which fungal infestation led to serious health complaints fromstaff members. Despite only partial implementation of the investigators'recommendations, the situation was improved. The structure inquestion is a nursery school that occupies a large brick one-storybuilding in eastern Canada. The school is a nonprofit organisation,and several parents had contributed to the design and constructionof the facility. Because of inadequate funds, part of the basementremained unfinished. The building housed about 80 children andstaff members. The 6,000 square foot, one-year old building hada concrete basement floor under one-half of the structure. Theother half of the basement was covered with sand, which becamehumid due to lack of good drainage. The main retaining wall wascovered with gyproc going from the ceiling to the sandy floor.There was no mechanical ventilation in the building, except forwashroom air exhausts. The building had openable windows, exceptin the unfinished basement area, which had air vents and an outsidedoor.

It seems notpossible to all members of the operating staff to realize thermalcomfort. The different activity levels and the different clothingplay an important role. Thereby we suppose that the surgeon willbe dressed in hygienic clothing and he will receive heat radiationfrom the operating lamp, so he will wish the lowest temperature.For the anesthetist who is often dressed lighter and has a loweractivity can cold complaints arise.

Abstract: Past thermal comfort research has shown differencesin the thermal sensation votes given in field and laboratory settings.However, such research tends to compare the votes of differentgroups of people in different environments rather than comparingthe same people in each environment. Therefore, a two-phase studywas conducted of the thermal comfort of 30 BRE employees in theirhome, in their office, and in a climate chamber. In the firstphase each subject spent two 3h sessions in each environment andthe temperature was adjusted between sessions within the range18-26oC. Data loggers were used to record the air and mean radianttemperature, air velocity and relative humidity; subjective ratingsof thermal sensation were obtained using questionnaires. The subjectswore the same clothing in each session and were allowed to conductonly sedentary activities. The reported thermal sensation voteswere compared with those predicted using ISO 7730. The observedneutral temperatures for each of the three environments differedby up to 2oC and were up to 1oC different to those predicted.This finding has implications for energy use. In the second phase,the subjects were studied in their home and office only. No restrictionswere imposed on clothing, previous or current activities, or environmentalconditions. The observed thermal sensation votes were very poorlycorrelated with those predicted and with operative temperature.

Abstract: Acceptable thermal environmental conditions for healthypeople may be determined using thermal sensation votes and physiologicaldata, but, for laboratory animals, alternative methods are necessary.Previous reports have shown that exposed body surfaces play animportant role in thermoregulation. The noninvasive procedureof thermography does not disturb the natural behavior of the animalsbut allows for the estimation of comfortable temperatures by measuringchanges in skin temperature. Using this procedure, it was observedthat tail skin temperatures of rats, mice, and house musk shrewscaged singly differed from individual animals of the same specieshoused in groups. Also, a temperature gradient between the animalcage and the climatic chamber was detected; the gradient was smallerfor singly caged animals than for groups. The data suggest thatcomfortable temperatures for rats range from 26 to 27.5oC; 25to 27oC for mice; and 23 to 25oC for house musk shrews.

Abstract: Detailed air turbulence characteristics in a full-scaleand running fan-filter unit type clean room (4.20m x 2.97m x 2.70m)with and without a clean bench loaded are investigated experimentally.The measurements of the three components of air velocity wereconducted by means of a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer.Velocity vectors, turbulence intensity, turbulence kinetic energyand probability density functions of velocity direction and velocitycontours in the space domain are presented. The results show thatthe non-uniformity and deflection angle of air velocity are within13% and 7.9 degrees, respectively. Moreover, the mean flow patterns,turbulence characteristics, and histogram features of the airflow are discussed. The detailed experimental data are not onlyuseful for clean room design and equipment layout but also helpfulfor use in the evaluation of numerical modeling in clean roomflow fields.

Dhital P, Besant R W, Schoenau G J USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 101, Pt 2, 1995, preprint, 12 pp20 figs, 7 tabs, refs. Abstract: The effect of using run-around heat exchanger systemson energy use and the energy life-cycle cost of a typical largeoffice building has been investigated. The run-around heat exchangersystem was used for both preheating and pre-cooling the supplyventilation outdoor air. The performance of the building usingrun-around systems was studied using the DIE-2.1D program. Inorder to simulate both the building systems and the run-aroundsystems, an existing computer program that can accurately simulatea run-around system was incorporated into DOE92.1. An investigationwas also conducted to determine the maximum outdoor air ventilationrate a run-around heat exchanger system allows without any increasein energy use (or energy cost) for the building. The simulationswere conducted for Chicago, Denver, Edmonton and Fort Worth. Theresults show that, compared to the energy performance of the buildingwithout the run-around systems, the use of run-around heat exchangerssystems in the office building can reduce annual electrical energyconsumption, natural gas consumption, and total energy costs byup to 3.5%, 40.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Boiler and chiller sizescan be reduced by up to 32.6% and 8%, respectively. It was alsofound that, through the use of run-around systems, the ventilationrate into the building can be increased by several hundred percentcompared to 62-1989, without increasing energy costs.

Meckler M USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 101, Pt 2, 1995, preprint, 9 pp,10 figs, 2 tabs, refs. Abstract: Microorganisms are well protected by the moisture surroundingthem if the relative humidity is above 70%. They can cause manyacute diseases, infections, and allergies. Humidity also has aneffect on air cleanliness and causes the building structure andits contents to deteriorate. Therefore, controlling humidity isa very important factor to human health and comfort and the structurallongevity of a building. To date, a great deal of research hasbeen done, and is continuing, in the use of both solid and liquiddesiccants. This paper introduces a desiccant-assisted systemthat combines dehumidification and mechanical refrigeration bymeans of a desiccant pre-conditioning module that can serve twoor more conventional air-conditioning units. It will be demonstratedthat the proposed system, also having indirect evaporative coolingwithin the preconditioning module, can reduce energy consumptionand provide significant cost savings, independent humidity andtemperature control, and therefore, improved indoor air qualityand enhanced occupant comfort.

Abstract: Results are reported from a detailed parametric studyto evaluate the performance of a newly proposed hybrid solar housingdevelopment in Monymusk, Scotland. The development embodies solarcollectors forming part of the roof structure itself and indistinguishablein appearance from the local vernacular, a new optimised solarroof collector system which combines both heating and ventilationfunctions and the ability to automatically switch between a rangeof heating and/or ventilation modes. Each dwelling unit was modelledusing degree-day properties, and the thermal performance was simulatedover a period of one year, based on expected occupancy and usage,and using meteorological data appropriate to the geographicallocation. It is concluded that with careful construction, goodthermal insulation, moderate thermal mass and properly controlledventilation, the collector system can meet the space and domestichot water heating requirements almost entirely. The annual totalheating bill, with full price electricity, could be less than50 per dwelling at 1994 prices.

Abstract: It has been estimated in the Energy Conservation inBuildings and Community Systems Strategy Plan (IEA, 1994c) thatabout one quarter of all energy is consumed in dwellings withinthe countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment. Also, in dwellings, within the Air Infiltration andVentilation Centre's member countries, the energy used for spaceheating and cooling accounts for between 60% - 70% of the totalenergy consumed. Furthermore, it is predicted (IEA, 1994c) thatventilation and air movement is expected to become the dominantheat and cooling loss mechanism in buildings of the next century.As part of its programme of work, the AIVC has co-ordinated attemptsto quantify the part of delivered energy that is specificallyassociated with infiltration and ventilation of buildings. Thishas been achieved by means of a workshop, a survey and a conference.The purpose of this paper is to present estimates of the currentsituation for dwellings. The calculations given here have beenperformed for each of the member countries. This article expressesthe energy impact in terms of both delivered energy and the consequentcarbon dioxide production. For some countries the air change-relatedenergy data have been found from published sources, and in othercases, a nominated representative, from a particular country hasestimated the situation, or has approved such an estimation.

Mundt E Sweden, Stockholm, Royal Institute of Technology, Building ServicesEngineering, Bulletin No 38, March 1996, 155 pp + app. Abstract: In a displacement ventilated room the air flow patternis mainly governed by the convection flows from the differentheat sources. The interaction of the convection flows influencesthe contamination distribution in the room. The distribution alsodepends on the position and strength of the contamination sources.Local values at the same height in the room may differ significantly.The distribution is also sensitive to 'disturbances' in the formof e.g. persons moving around. The factors governing the air flowpatterns were investigated by measurements of temperature gradients,convection flow rates in plumes and contamination distributions.The efficiency of the ventilation was measured for many differentcombinations of ventilation flow rates, heat loads and contaminationsources. The temperature gradient was strongly correlated to theventilation flow rate and very stable. People moving around orwalking in and out of the room did not influence the shape ofthe gradient. Models for the temperature gradient in balancedand unbalanced conditions were developed. The convection flowrate in a plume and its maximum height were influenced by thetemperature gradient. Models for the convection flow rate in aplume from a point or a line source are given including the heightwhere the plumes disintegrate due to the gradient in the surroundings.The air change efficiency increased with the ventilation flowrate as long as the convection plumes reached the ceiling, anddecreased when the plume disintegrated below the ceiling. Thecontaminant removal effectiveness was dependent on the positionof the contamination (tracer gas) source and on the interactionof the convection flows in the room. A small change in the positionof the tracer gas source caused a great change in the contaminantremoval effectiveness. The interaction of the different convectionflows in the room also caused a great variation in the local airquality indices measured at the same level at different positionsboth with the tracer gas source in a plume and outside a plume.When the tracer gas source was outside a plume a heavy tracergas spread to the floor in all measured cases while a light tracergas spread to the floor only at low temperature gradients independentof the ventilation flow rate. Opening and closing of a door wasenough to destroy a stratification of contaminants with the tracergas source outside a plume. The local air quality indices measuredin the room with a person moving around or close to a person standingstill approached those for mixing ventilation and in some caseseven lower values were measured with the source outside a plume.With the tracer gas source in a plume the local air quality indicesmeasured close to a person in all cases were higher than the valuesmeasured at the same level in the surroundings. When monitoringthe local air quality index close to the nose of a person walkingaround or sitting still much higher values than in the surroundingswere measured.

Arnold D USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 1, 1996, preprint, 6 figs,refs. Abstract: This paper examinesaon alternative strategy for heating,cooling, and ventilating buildings that attempts to combine thebest features of both natural and mechanical systems. It involvesa holistic approach to design that treats the building and engineeringequally. Such climate-responsive integrated building/engineeringsystems are intended to operate in the natural mode whenever possibleto minimize energy use and only use mechanical systems under peakconditions at the extremes of external temperatures. The periodof use of natural systems can be extended by using passive coolingtechniques and fabric thermal storage. Some of the building mass,walls, ceiling slabs etc, are used as thermal storage media andare allowed to cool overnight and absorb heat the next day. Thetechnique requires some automated control of natural ventilationbut both reduces energy use and, by virtue of the thermal massinvolved, limits the rise in internal temperature on occasionswhen normal design criteria are exceeded. The paper describedthe philosophy and operation of mixed-mode systems used in conjunctionwith fabric thermal storage and suggests some guidelines for thedevelopment of the design of a practical system.

Holmes M J, Wilson A USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 1, 1996, preprint, 8 figs,3 tabs, refs. Abstract: Ventilation of the building fabric is one method toachieve storage of heat and cold. A popular European method isto pass air through ducts within the floor and ceiling slabs.That air can either be at the outside air temperature or fromthe air-conditioning plant. In the former case, the intentionis to transfer cold from night to day and in the latter to reducepeak loads by cooling the room surfaces and thus increase comfortvia radiant cooling. The performance of such systems can be assessedby comparison with direct nighttime ventilation (say, throughwindows) and traditional air-conditioning systems operating duringoccupancy. The paper presents the development of a numerical modelof a ventilated floor slab for use in a dynamic thermal modeland the application of that model to a current design project.Energy consumption cannot be ignored; however, a complete analysisof the implication of storage systems would be a major paper.This paper therefore considers the main energy implications associatedwith slab storage systems.

Abstract: There is currently an upsurge of interest in the applicationof buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation systems and chilledceiling devices in the office environment within the UK's heating,ventilation and air conditioning industry. As part of a seriesof research projects in the field of displacement ventilation,the BSRIA has undertaken a programme of work to investigate whetherit is feasible to combine displacement ventilation systems andchilled ceiling devices while still maintaining adequate levelsof thermal comfort and a predominant upward air movement. Thesestudies were achieved by using both physical measurements andnumerical modelling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD)techniques. When displacement ventilation without cooled ceilingswas considered, the airflow patterns were chiefly upward whenthe internal thermal loads were equivalent to the cooling capacityof the displacement ventilation system. On condition that thesupply air temperature and air velocity were maintained withinthe recommended values, a high order of thermal comfort and airquality were predicted. The addition of chilled beam devices tooffset higher internal thermal gains progressively eroded thepredominant upward air flow region as thermal loads were increased.Indeed when the cooling load of the chilled ceiling devices wasabout three times that of the displacement ventilation system,the flow field was virtually similar to a conventional mixed airflowsystem, except in the vicinity of heat sources where upward convectiveplumes entrain air from the displacement cool air layer at floorlevel. The simulation of displacement ventilation with chilledpanels, however, showed that the radiant cold panels slightlyincreased the depth of the mixed warm and contaminated upper region,but it did not affect the displacement airflow characteristicsof the lower part of the room. The environmental thermal comfortconditions, however, were of a very high order in all cases considered. Keywords: displacement ventilation, ceiling #NO 9535 AIVC Guide to ventilation.

Abstract: The subject of this paper is the computational determinationof the air diffusion performance index (ADPI) of a cold air jetin an enclosure. The jet outlet size, temperature, momentum andArchimedes number were varied to produce a range of attached andseparate flow regimes. The cooling load was produced by heatingone of the room walls. The effect of using conventional and coldsupply jets was investigated for two heat source locations. Theresults indicate that, for the type of diffuser and room configurationstudied, an optimum ADPI was obtained when the jet separationdistance is approximately equal to the room characteristic length.Room airflow, conditions produced by conventional and cold airsupply temperature air are almost identical to each other whenthe same separation distance criteria, ie. same momentum flux,are used.

Simmonds P USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 1, 1996, preprint, 8 pp,12 figs, refs. Abstract: When designing comfortable workspaces, traditional designcriteria such as dry-bulb temperature and operative temperatureare not always sufficient. Using the predicted mean vote (PMV)as the design parameter, it becomes evident as to what systemshould be used to condition the space. The projects describedin this paper show that the mean radiant temperature (MRT) hasa large influence on the comfort results. Therefore, the applicationof radiant heating and cooling panels would prove an optimal solutionto the conditioning of the space within comfort limits (PMV+/-0.5).

Meierhans R A USA, Ashrae Transactions, Vol 102, Pt 1, 1996, preprint, 5 figs,2 tabs, refs. Abstract: Active control of the storage mass of an office buildingin Horgen, Switzerland, by means of a water-carrying pipe systeminstalled in the core of the concrete ceilings has already provensuccessful over a period of three summers. Comfort measurementsin practice and under load-simulated operating conditions haveconfirmed the suitability of the system for small and medium loads.During the day, only the supply air volume of the mechanical ventilationsystem is cooled to a temperature of 19 degree C (66.2 degreesF); the heat stored in the concrete mass is discharged overnight.However, the proportion of cooling water generated in the free-coolingmode remained below expectations. This is attributable to theclearly lower inner thermal loads and the facade insulation whichis no longer up-to-date. Since the building already dispensesa part of its heat via the facade on cooler summer nights, theutilization efficiency of the free concrete core-cooling systemdiminishes somewhat in importance. The experience gained, however,is recommendation enough for the employment of the embedded pipeworksystem, not only for the cooling but also for the heating of well-insulatedbuildings with small and medium cooling loads.

Abstract: Indirect evaporative cooling (IDEC) is a proven technologythat can reduce mechanical cooling demand and energy requirements.Various concepts are available in predesigned configurations forincorporation with packaged or semi-custom manufactured heating,ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Applicationof indirect evaporative cooling in large built-up HVAC systemsis often not considered, thereby missing the opportunity for significantsavings potential. This paper discusses four concepts that havebeen successfully applied in large systems and the associatedcooling and energy savings and is an overview of previously publishedwork (see bibliography). These savings can provide a significantcontribution toward meeting the proposed Tier 1 energy savingsrequirement of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989R.

Abstract: If the cooling capacity is introduced into a room abovethe heating sources, mainly in rooms with mixed flow, certainair velocities not being able to be kept within will be foundin the room even if the outlets are adjusted optimally. This knowledgeexisted already earlier. Experiments with cooled ceilings shownow that these velocities depend only on the cooling capacityrelated to the floor area for a given geometry. The experimentalresults also give hints to which area the capacity has to be related.The good agreement with the known velocities in mixed flows encouragesto extend the results of cooled ceilings to mixed flow.

Abstract: The purpose of ventilation is to maintain and improveair quality in a building by removing polluted air and supplyingfresh air. In principle, the required ventilation rates for desiredair quality can be calculated if the pollution loads, outdoorair quality and requested indoor air quality are known. This methodis often referred to as an air quality method in ventilation design.A European prestandard 'Ventilation for Buildings - Design Criteriafor the Indoor Environment' outlines such a method. The data forthe application of the standard is rapidly accumulating throughextensive measurements and is soon available for the general applicationin ventilation design. Because the data are not yet completedfor practical use, additional prescriptive requirements and criteriahave to be used in the design of ventilation systems. These criteriainclude such aspects as the selection of ventilation strategy,ventilation rates, balancing of airflows, ventilation effectiveness,local exhaust systems, cleaning of intake air, location of airintakes, cleanliness of equipment, air recirculation, air tightness,noise control and demand controlled ventilation. The reasoningbehind these requirements is presented and discussed in the paper. Keywords: building design, health #NO 9548 International trends in ventilation standards.

Abstract: The space between neighbouring two detached houses hasbeen often narrow in built up areas and becomes smaller in recentsuburban areas. It is sometimes too narrow to be used as a reasonablespace, which means that it is a dead space, and such a space iscalled an inter-house gap in this paper. However, the authorscarried out a field survey to examine the thermal conditions andair flow in an inter-house gap in summer to find that the microclimate in the space was different from the thermal environmentin the surrounding space. The air temperature in the inter-housegap is lower than that in the surrounding outdoor space in thedaytime, and the air flow in the space was controlled by the shaperof the inter-house gap. These results indicate that it is possibleto use the inter-house gap as a thermal buffer zone between indoorand outdoor space or a useful natural cooling resource in summer,although it is not useful as an ordinary active space. Therefore,if the neighbouring two houses are well designed to utilize thecharacteristics of the thermal conditions in the inter-house gap,it will contribute to the indoor thermal environment. The naturalventilation is one of the most effective methods to introducethe cool air in an inter-house gap into neighbouring indoor spaces,since the air flow in an inter-house gap may be controlled bythe shaper of the inter-house gap to be useful for this device.For this purpose, the characteristics of the air flow in an inter-housegap, especially the wind pressure on the neighbouring walls, haveto be studied more deeply. A series of wind tunnel tests to examinethe characteristics of the wind pressure on the walls facing tointer-house gaps are reported in this paper.

Norlen U, Andersson K Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 393-401, 3 figs, 3tabs, refs. Abstract: A nationwide energy and indoor climate survey has beencarried out in Sweden (the ELIB study). The study indicates thatbetween 600,000 and 900,000 Swedes or about 10% of the populationare exposed to indoor climates that can affect their health andwell-being. Ventilation, in particular, is poor in Swedish dwellings.Ventilation does not come up to the norms in four of five single-familyhouses and in about half of the apartments in multi-family buildings.Another finding is that residents in new, large multi-family buildingsand people suffering from allergies are most troubled by defectsin the indoor climate. By increasing the ventilation, the problemsof humid indoor air and high radon concentration would be reducedconsiderably. The percentage of single-family houses with humidityof indoor air exceeding 45% RH in the air would decreased from19% to only 4%. The proportion of dwellings with radon concentrationsabove the norms would be reduced considerably. The consequencesof ventilation on the dryness of indoor air in some buildingsmust also be taken into account, however. An increase n ventilationwould lead to a substantial increase in the energy used. The ventilationlosses in the housing stock would increase by about 36% (fromabout 22 TWh to about 30 TWh annually).

Wiech C, Raw G J Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 425-430, 2 tabs, refs. Abstract: The house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus)is found in furnishings in most homes. Although only a fractionof a millimetre in size, it has been identified as an importantrisk to health because of the allergens both on its enticle andin the faeces. When the allergen becomes airborne, it is a potentprovoker of asthma and almost certainly contributed to the 2000asthma-related deaths which occur each year in the UK.The widespreadoccurrence of D.pteronyssinus and its potential for causing seriouseffects on health have prompted research to establish ways ofremoving it from homes. In principle then, increased ventilationshould be capable of reducing indoor humidity and eliminatingdust mites. This raises the question of what humidity must beachieved and whether, in practice, ventilation alone can maintainthe critical humidity. The critical humidity for dust mite survivalhas been stated as 7g/kg absolute humidity, equivalent to about40-45% RH (Korsgard 1982). The Danish results suggest that installingwhole-house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) willnot only cause a significant reduction in dust mite populations,but bring about a clinically relevant reduction in asthma symptoms.Full MVHR achieves a controlled air flow, ensuring a reliablesupply of outside air to all rooms and extraction from moisture-producingrooms (kitchen and bathroom). It is claimed that the clinicalbenefits are greater than those obtained with any prophylacticdrugs. Furthermore, it has been shown (using assumed rates ofmoisture production indoors) that the critical humidity can beachieved using MVHR for much of a typical winter over much ofthe UK (McIntyre 1993). In the UK, the outdoor humidity exceeds7g/kg for 5% of the winter (from December to March) but is generallybelow 5g/kg during this period. Extracting moist air from thehouse and replacing it by relatively dry air from outside couldtherefore reduce humidity levels indoors to below those requiredfor HDM survival. In spite of the existing findings, there aresome doubts as to the likely impact of MVHR on mites in UK homes:(a) the critical humidity of 7g/kg is achieved for a smaller proportionof the year in the UK than in Denmark, (b) furnishings and cleaningpractices may differ between the two countries and (c) UK homesare typically less tight than those built in Denmark, which willrender MVHR less effective. It is therefore important to replicatethe Danish work in the UK. To achieve an improvement in asthmatics'symptomsit is necessary not only to reduce the number of dust mites butalso to remove the allergen already present in the home. The regularuse of a high efficiency vacuum cleaner designed to collect dustwithout recirculating fine dust into the room air is thought tobe capable of reducing the allergens reservoir in soft furnishings.

Abstract: There are many reasons for promoting a thorough examinationof requirements for domestic aeration and ventilation systems:There is an emerging awareness of the relationship between homeand health. Pollution levels inside the home, often higher thanthose outside, can only be brought down to within acceptable limitsby using efficient specific ventilation systems. About one fifthof French homes have no specific ventilation system. Insufficientventilation is one of the major errors committed when renovatingold buildings. Paradoxically enough, systematic installation ofairtight windows is rarely compensated by provision for a suitableair circulation system. About 30% of renovated buildings sufferfrom this serious defect. Many older ventilation systems are nowin urgent need of replacement or adaption. Wide-reaching publicinformation programmes on energy saving fail to mention the needfor aeration.

Abstract: An office building situated in downtown Zurich was investigated.It contains 750 workstations on 5 floors, each separated into3 large open space offices. Floors and walls were mainly coveredby carpets and smoking was generally allowed. The goal was tostudy the effects of interventions on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)and the Building Symptom Index (BSI). The building was investigatedright before, in August 1994, and one month after each change,in November 1994 and February 1995. Key IAQ parameters were measured(CO2, TVOC, VOC, oxidizable gases, formaldehyde, temperature andhumidity). A questionnaire was distributed to a large sample ofoccupants to assess their judgment on air quality and buildingrelated symptoms. Carpet cleaning lead to a higher air acceptabilityand partly to a reduction of the BSI. A combination of carpetcleaning and non-smoking had only small positive effects on BSIand the air acceptability. The effects of reducing the mean temperaturehad only insignificant positive effects on the judgments of occupantsand the reported symptoms. The measured physical and chemicalIAQ parameters did not show significant differences between theinvestigated offices and the three periods. Conclusions: The useof the questionnaire is an important additional tool to assessindoor air conditions. Chemical and physical parameters alonedo not necessarily represent the perceived IAQ. Cleaning of carpetedwalls with a liquid extraction system, combined with a small reductionof total carpet surface, has a positive effect on the perceivedair quality which could be explained by a reduction of surfacepollution emission. Additional non-measured factors seem to havean important influence on the perceived IAQ and the building relatedsymptoms. Radiant temperature and illumination, in relation tosun exposure, could be such factors.

Abstract: As part of a coordinated effort by the United StatesEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate radon reductionschools technology, indoor air quality measurements were conductedin 12 school buildings across the U.S. to establish a databaseof specific contaminant levels. A subset of this data consistedof particle measurements reflecting real-time particle countsin conjunction with time weighted average gravimetric PM-10 data.Elevated levels of gravimetric indoor PM-10 concentrations weremeasured in the schools. These levels may be attributed to variousfactors including low ventilation rates, high occupant density,classroom activity and entrainment of particles released fromcarpeted floors. A relation between the particle counts and PM-10measurements is presented in this paper from the measurementstaken in the non-smoking school environments. The relation doesprovide an initial tool to approximate PM-10 concentrations asa function of particle count data. While premature, at present,it does hold promise as more paired counts and PM-10 measurementsare added from other schools throughout the U.S. Keywords: particle, school, radon #NO 9556 The effect of ventilation on environmental tobaccosmoke characteristics in a sub tropical climate.

Abstract: Human exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)is a function of two factors: (i) ETS generated in the indoorenvironment, and (ii) ETS removed from indoor air by ventilationand air filtration processes. One principal aspect of both issize distribution of the particulate phase of tobacco smoke. Theaim of the research presented here was to investigate size characteristicsof ETS in several residential and public places and the effectventilation had on time change of the characteristics. An importantconclusion from this research is that natural ventilation whichis the most common type of ventilation in sub tropical climates,is often not sufficient for reducing human exposure to ETS. Insome residential houses, ETS concentration was still high threehours after generation and the mean particle size remained unchangedfor most of the measurement period. A broad, well defined ETSpeak with concentration in the peak up to 5 x 10 to the powerof 4 particles cm-3 is often observed in club air during eventswhen large numbers of smokers are present, regardless of the effortsto improve air quality by natural ventilation.

Abstract: There is a growing awareness among the health and safetyauthorities, building and environmental regulatory bodies, buildingowners and more importantly the building users of the importanceof preventing or at least reducing the risk of environmental tobaccosmoke (ETS) in public buildings. This awareness coincides withthe studies around the world on whether the levels of carcinogensin the diluted sidestream smoke of tobacco products are sufficientto cause cancer. It has been reported that passive smoking increasesthe risk of lung cancer in non-smokers, and that it may also beconnected to heart disease. This risk was reported to be in therange of 10 to 30%. In addition, ETS has irritant effects suchas eye irritation, headaches, throat and nasal symptoms, and canaggravate asthma. It can obscure vision and creates an unpleasantodour. The UK government's code of practice on smoking in publicplaces promotes the use of separate rooms for smokers, with nonsmoking being the norm in most places. In some establishments,however, it is impractical to supply totally separate rooms forsmokers and non-smokers and the space may be divided into smokingand non-smoking areas with limited physical partitioning. Thisallows ETS to migrate from the smoking areas to the non-smokingareas, and the extent to which this takes place depends upon theventilation and partitioning strategy. Guidance needs to be providedfor such cases on how best to ventilate the spaces and what effectpartial partitioning will have. In this paper a comparative assessmentof alternative ventilation strategies and space partitioning forminimising migration of tobacco smoke in to public building enclosuresis reported. The study is based on computational fluid dynamics(CFD) modelling and uses an airborne contaminant as the 'marker'for ETS migration.

Abstract: Following considerable lobbying by anti-smoking campaignersin the UK, environmental health officers employed by the localcouncils have agreed to test pubs which have been reported as'too smoky'. Whereas a customer may enter a smoky atmosphere andthen decide to walk away from it, this option is not availableto staff. Of more significance therefore, and to employers aswell as to the individuals is the potential effect of passivesmoking on the staff who work in public houses. Legislation inthe UK (Health and Safety Executive, 1974) places a duty of careon employers to provide and maintain a safe working environmentfor employees without risks to health. Previous work by the authors(Currie and Capper, 1994) involved the assessment of public housesin the north of England and southern Scotland with the aim ofidentifying potential problems and considering improvements thatcould be made to accommodate best environmental practice. Environmentaltobacco smoke (ETS) surrogates were measured, together with carbondioxide (CO2) as a general air quality indicator. The air qualityassessments in each establishment identified potential problemsin respect of the traditional design approach to ventilated spaces.Recent studies have tended to concentrate on the subjective assessmentof environmental health issues and there is therefore a need formore objective assessment methods. A computerised fluid dynamics(CFD) model ARIA has been used to model airflows with the aimof identifying inefficiencies in existing ventilation systems,for example air distribution 'dead-spots'.

Abstract: In the last ten years an increased attention has beendevoted to the indoor air quality for different reasons: 1) ithas been emphasised that many domestic components (that is buildingmaterials, furniture, fuel for heating and cooking, etc.) canemanate chemical or radioactive pollutants or that biologicalcontaminants can be present in indoor air; 2) energy saving programs,born in the seventies, led people to reduce the air exchangesin indoor environments and 3) in urban areas most people spendmost of their time indoors at home or indoors elsewhere, thatis schools, offices, etc. In particular, for the Italian population,in the frame of the recent representative National Survey on radonindoors, data on the permanency indoors at home and indoors elsewherehas been collected: it showed that on the average the Italianpopulation spends about 80% of its time in indoor environments(F. Bochicchio et al., 1994a). As a development of the NationalSurvey, in the last years a pilot study was designed and is beingcarried out in Rome (F.Bochicchio et al.1994b) to study the mainparameters influencing the exposure of radon and radon progenyin domestic environments. Among these parameters natural ventilationhas been studied, because in most of the Italian houses forcedventilation systems are very rarely used. For this reason thedetection of the eventual effective decrease of radon and radonprogeny concentration indoors due to natural ventilation couldhave useful implication for domestic environments in temperateclimate areas, in search of a balance between energy conservationand air exchange rates.

Abstract: In Portugal a national indoor radon survey was developedby the Health Physics and Safety Department and some regions withhigh indoor radon levels were identified. Actually some proceduresare being studied in order to reduce the indoor radon levels.This paper refers two different situations. In the first case,an experimental room was built and the walls were covered withphosphogypsum which is sometimes employed as building material.Integrated measurements had been performed with nuclear passivetrack detectors, LR-115s, exposed for 1-2 month periods. Afterwards,two types of wall coverings are being studies, with the purposeto mitigate the increase of indoor radon due to the utilisationof phosphogypsum employed as building material. The other situationconcerns the application of reduction techniques in a real dwellingsituated in a granitic and uranium mining region with high indoorradon concentrations. In this case, the main radon source termhad been identified. Some mitigation procedures, including naturalventilation, replacement of the floor with a vinyl material andthe wall cracks sealed were performed.

Abstract: It is well recognised that greater part of environmentalradiation dose to human comes from natural radiation, while itsmajor contribution is from radon and its short-lived decay productsin air. Their inhalation can induce lung cancer which had broughtabout popular notice. The effect of indoor radon and its daughtersin air on inhabitants' health is concerned as their main livingspace is indoor. Indoor radon concentrations in air are approx25 Bq/m3 under normal living conditions in China, i.e. doors andwindows are opened or closed normally. But it can vary due toalter some housing conditions, such as fixing air conditionerand so on. Along with the improvement of Chinese Peoples' livingstandards, air conditioners have already come into population'shome right now. It has actual living standards, air conditionershave already come into populations home right now. It has actualmeanings to study their affection on indoor radon level as a previousresearch in health physics field.

Abstract: The indoor air quality IAQ is of fundamental importancewith regard to the evaluation and certification of healthy buildings.Because only precise, accurate and statistically controlled analyticalresults allow conclusions to be drawn about the quality of airand the risks related to chemicals, quality assurance for airanalysis is the object of advanced research. The decrease of airinfiltration existing in modern buildings, due to the presenceof indoor sources of contaminants emitted by materials, the increaseof outdoor polluted air, and the problems related to ventilationenergy costs, assign a primary consideration in ventilation engineering.Monitoring and controlling the mechanical ventilation is the mainreason to develop suitable sensors, since IAQ cannot be measuredobjectively, the concept for acceptable air has been defined.This applies to air which does not contain any known contaminantsin harmful concentrations and which is accepted without complaintby more than 80% of those people exposed to it . Among organicsubstances those with molecular weight greater than 300 are generallyodourless, and even if potent olfactory stimuli derived from somesubstances can be perceived at very low concentrations, they maynot be detected by existing instruments. Olfactory sensitivityoften is able to detect potentially harmful substances at concentrationsbelow dangerous levels and therefore able to eliminate them. Itis important to consider odour as a IAQ indicator because a sensoryapproach (odours and irritations) has a fundamental role for theIAQ characterisation, being a complementary method of the traditionalphysic, chemical and microbiological studies utilised to measurethe exposure (Kirchner et al., 1994). Odours and irritants thresholds,however, because of a poorly available systematic review, mayvary by several orders of magnitude - and further studies mustbe carried out in order to determine more precise indications.Although the perceived indoor air quality presently can only bemeasuredby means of test subjects rather than with measuring instruments,reference to this approach is nevertheless appearing in HVAC ventilationstandards (CEN, 1994); critical review showed that these standardscould be based on scientific definitions to allow measurable outcomesindicating adverse effects on comfort, such as annoyance and irritationas a function of dilution ventilation (Rehva, 1995). A look atthe limitations of present IAQ guidelines suggests a promisingalternative approach for judging the acceptability of IAQ basedon antropic gases (CO2 and/or NH3) monitoring as an integratedmeasure of all airborne contaminants present in ambient air, todo it the IAQ guidelines can be based on both specific contaminantsof pollutant mixtures and global presence of contaminants in themixtures (Light et al, 1992). The possibility to apportion contaminantsto major classes of emission sources, is generally obtained usinga sensory panel, CO and CO2 measurements. Many studies have apportionedthe perceived IAQ degradation to three categories: occupants,smoking and building materials including HVAC system. CO servesas a surrogate for cigarette smoking, CO2 for bioeffluents, butpresently only sensory measures can significantly indicate theimportance of the HVAC system and building materials as contaminantsources (Fanger, 1988). Unfortunately, the relationship of thesensory responses to physical-chemical measures is not clear.In particular, nonlinearity and thresholds of sensory responsesshould be taken into account when identifying sources quantitatively(Batterman et al, 1995, Pejtersen et al, 1993). The concentrationof CO2 in a room remains a subjective variable for the evaluationof IAQ, even though its value can be defined exactly. Except forparticular boundary conditions, no relationship (Persily, 1993)can be found between the CO2 concentration in a room and the IAQperceived by the human nose. Otherwise, first one substance andthen another would dominate the sense of smell. It is thereforeof little significance to measure concentration of individualgas selectively, leading to the assumption that the gas mixturemust be evaluated as a whole. That is what the mixed gas sensorsdo. Keywords: indoor air quality, health, sensor #NO 9563 Measuring ventilation rates and air quality usingcarbon dioxide monitoring equipment. Saffell J R Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 833-842, 3 figs, 2tabs, 11 refs. Abstract: The use of non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) to measureequilibrium carbon dioxide concentration, and hence to infer ventilationrate, is rapidly gaining acceptance. However, other applicationsuse both the time-dependent and equilibrium carbon dioxide concentrationto determine other ventilation parameters including: tracing ofreintrainment routes, determining air-mix ratios, assisting incommissioning and rebalancing of HVAC systems, performing walk-throughIAQ audits and checking for ventilation short-circuiting. Thecommon technology of NDIR offers its advantages and disadvantageswhen compared with other technologies, especially electrochemicalcells which offer low power, fast response and better resistanceto shock and humidity. This paper compares the accuracy and easeof use of these technologies in different applications.

Nielsen P V Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 922-928, 5 figs, 14refs. Abstract: Healthy buildings are to a great extent a question ofindoor air quality. The processes involved in air quality canbe looked upon as a number of links in a chain. Typical linkswill be emission from building materials, convection and diffusionin the room, local airflow around a person, personal exposureand at last the effect of the air quality on the occupant. Thebest results will obviously be obtained by using building materialswith low emission. However, there will always exist some emissionand the ventilation will consequently be an important link. AalborgUniversity has worked with several inks as shown in figure 1.The elements in a model for emission from building materials (1)will be discussed in the first chapter of this paper. Transportby convection and diffusion (2) will be addressed in the followingchapter, and the flow around a person (3) will be handled in athird chapter. An occupant's role as emission source (4) is describedby examples in the last chapter.

Abstract: Experiments on the adsorption/desorption of volatilecompounds on building materials have been performed in a 1 m3dynamic chamber ventilated by clean air. Different types of materialscommonly found in buildings (glass plate, floor and wall coverings,gypsum board and acoustic tiles) have been exposed to the vapourof 2-butoxyethanol introduced in the chamber at constant concentration.Both adsorption and desorption phases where followed under differentenvironmental conditions (16, 23 and 30 degrees C , 45 and 70%RH). Mathematical modelling of the data has been used to describethe observed sink phenomena. Except for the glass plate, 2-butoxyethanolpresents clear evidence of adsorption and desorption on all othertested materials. Temperature and humidity significantly affectthese reactions. Complementary methods aimed at describing themicrophysical shape of the materials appear to be useful for theevaluation of their adsorbing properties.

Abstract: In order to investigate the factors influencing airquality inside hospitals, the concentration of atmospheric gasesand of pollutant vapours was monitored in air-conditioned andnaturally ventilated hospital buildings located in urban areaswith different vehicular traffic density. The quality of insideair is strongly dictated by outside pollution, the latter mainlydepending on hospital position with reference to automotive sources,as far as showed by measured CO and CO2 time profiles. CO2 indoorpollution is mainly dependent from human presence and its effectis particularly relevant in conditions of crowding and insufficientventilation of environments, where CO2 build-up higher than 3500mg/m3 can cause subjective discomfort. Indoor pollution from volatileorganics can be traced to peculiar sources and is characteristicof hospital activities, with respect to other collective buildings,mainly due to the extensive use of cleaning products and sanitaryauxiliaries.

Abstract: In wards used for Patients recovering from bone marrowtransplants, it is necessary to ensure a high degree of air cleanlinessinside the rooms. The patients themselves also have to be includedas sources of pathological agents. Differential pressurizationbetween zones of high and low contamination is necessary, anda reliable differential pressurization can be obtained only bymeans of a mechanical ventilation system and different flow ratesof supply and return air. A high degree of air sterility can beobtained by introducing outdoor air into the occupied space afteradequate filtration.

Abstract: The energy and mass transfer in a ventilated room takesa major influence on the temperature and mass (eg. particles,gases, contaminants) distribution and thus on the thermal comfortand air quality of the room occupants. There are important differencesbetween the different ventilation systems concerning the energyand mass transfer. Especially for displacement flow the energy-and mass transfer is considerable because there is a marked temperature-and concentration distribution in the room. The aim of this investigationis to show the different mechanisms which are responsible forthe temperature- and concentration distribution in rooms withdisplacement flow.

Abstract: Displacement ventilation systems in German called 'Quelluftung'become more and more popular and have proved themselves in manydifferent applications in comfort as well as in industrial airconditioning systems. However, there are many uncertainties accordingto the design of the systems. In a research project the basisand the technical conditions had been worked out. The influenceof the air outlet and the heat sources on the temperature andcontaminant distribution within the room was investigated. Displacementventilation introduces supply air into the room at or near floorlevel and at a temperature lower than that of the ambient roomair. The supply air thus fills the room from the floor up, displacingthe old air and any contaminants that it carried. Additional buoyancyflows caused by heat sources are overlapping the displacementflow. The buoyancy flow is greater than the displacement and thiscauses the typical stratification of source flow. There is a layerof supply air near the floor, upwards there is a layer of mixedair, which is primarily influenced by the location and intensityof the heat sources. Above the mixing zone there is another displacementzone up to the ceiling, where the exhaust air is taken. When roomventilation is by displacement, temperature and contaminant concentrationsincrease with the height of the room. Without any heat sources,this gradient would be uniform. However, in typical rooms, heatsources such as people or equipment should cause convection currentsthat result in the cleaner air near the floor being forced upwardinto the breathing zone at a rate higher than the displacementflow. The displacement flow rate should be lower than the convectionflow rate because maintaining a low velocity in the supply airprevents drafts from becoming a problem. Displacement ventilationflow rate should ideally remain below 0.2 metres per second.

Abstract: One reason for complaints about air-conditioning systemsin offices is draught. As a consequence of this, air-conditioningsystems were developed in which the inlet air streams slowly intothe room showing the following characteristics: low degree ofturbulence, low air velocity and low temperature at ground level.The inlet air therefore forms a 'lake' of around heated bodiesby self-convection and are accordingly low. In order to facilitatehigher cooling loads, so-called 'ceiling-coolings' are used inaddition. The range of applicability of such air-conditioningsystems, with regard to thermal comfort, was investigated by theFraunhofer-Institut fur Bauphysik (IBP) and the results are describedin the paper. The main results are: 1. The air temperature atfoot level should not fall below a value of 22oC. 2. The operativetemperature at head level should not exceed a value of 24oC.

Abstract: Fifty six office buildings in nine European countrieswere audited during the heating season of 1993-1994 (1) The auditswere performed according to a standard procedure, within the frameof the 'European Audit project to optimize indoor air qualityand energy consumption in office buildings', sponsored by theEuropean Community through the Joule II programme. The main aimof this EC-Audit was to develop assessment procedures and guidanceon ventilation and source control, which help to assure indoorair quality and optimize energy use in office buildings. 15 institutesfrom 11 countries (The Netherlands, Denmark, France, Belgium,United Kingdom, Greece, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Germanyand Portugal) participated. By determining the pollution load(chemically and sensory), the ventilation performance and theenergy consumption, and by identifying the pollution sources,recommendations can be made to avoid excessive energy consumptionand ensure air quality by source control and ventilation. A commonagreed Europe-wide method to investigate indoor air quality inoffice buildings, including a common agreed European questionnaireand walk-through survey checklist were developed (2).

Abstract: Fifty-six office buildings, selected in nine Europeancountries for being as far as possible representative of the buildingstock, were audited between December 1993 and March 1994. Theseaudits were performed according to a standard procedure, withinthe frame of the 'European Audit Project to Optimise Indoor AirQuality and Energy Consumption in Office Buildings', part of theJOULE Programme (CEC-DG XII). The main purpose of office buildingsis to provide a comfortable working environment for occupants.This includes, among others, thermal, visual and acoustical comfortas well as indoor air quality. One of the objectives of the surveywas hence to assess the actual quality of the indoor environmentin office buildings. Measured parameters concerning the qualityof indoor environment included occupant satisfaction, sick buildingsymptoms and concentration of contaminants. Yearly energy consumptiondata were also gathered for each building. Ventilation performancein terms of air flow rate and indoor air quality was comparedto a proposed European pre-standard and related to occupant satisfactionand energy consumption. Theoretically, energy is required to controlthe indoor climate and indoor air quality. Therefore, it is acommon perception that energy savings will result in a poorerquality indoor environment. It was interesting therefore to relateenergy consumption to various parameters describing the indoorenvironment. The results show that good indoor environment iscompatible with low energy consumption. Good quality energy servicesdo not necessarily incur a high energy use.

Abstract: Recent rapid increases in global atmospheric contaminationlevels, especially in metropolitan areas, lead to high attentionto indoor air qualities in commercial buildings located in thepolluted areas. One of the most common methods to provide officeworkers with a clean and comfortable indoor air environment isventilation, in which a certain portion of the return air fromthe interior spaces is replaced by outdoor air in the air handlingunit (AHU). Indeed, ventilation is the most effective method ofmaintaining a high quality indoor air environment when the outdoorair is fresher than the indoor air. However, ventilation usuallycauses higher energy consumption in HVAC system due to the temperatureand humidity controls with the raw outdoor air. Therefore, itis a key objective of this field study to identify the impactof outdoor air intake rates at the air handling units on the indoorair contaminant levels in commercial office buildings especiallylocated in metropolitan areas. A total of four commercial officebuildings located in Seoul, Korea and Tokyo, Japan were selectedfor field measurements. The concentration levels of the indoorair pollutants were monitored at different outdoor intake ratesand the odor and discomfort ratings were made by the occupantsthrough questionnaire surveys.

Abstract: The paper presents the main experimental methods forthe assessment of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and ventilation systemsperformance in buildings, with special attention to large enclosures.There are subjective methods, in which human beings are the objectsof measurements or act as 'Sensors' themselves, and objectiveones, that is, methods making use of experimental apparatuses.Attention is drawn on the last ones and particularly on the techniquesbased on gaseous pollutant concentration monitoring. The mainIAQ and ventilation performance indicators are presented and theirmeasurement techniques are described. Full scale experiments resultsillustrate the application of the above mentioned techniques.

Abstract: Ventilation systems may act as important sources ofimpurities in indoor air if they become contaminated with dustor micro-organisms. This may pollute the supply of air. Constructiondebris and processing oil residues are commonly found to existeven in the ventilation ducts of new buildings. The average surfacedensity of dust settled in the supply air ducts of 14 Finnishoffice buildings was found to be 13.2 g/m2 and the average annualaccumulation rate 1.8 g/m2. It contained 80% of inorganic material.The average count of viable fungal spores was 3370 cfu/g. IN thepresent studies, the surface density of dust settled in ventilationducts of single family houses was investigated. The ducts andother parts of the ventilation systems were cleaned, ventilationwas balanced and small faults observed were repaired. Air flowrates were measured before and after cleaning and other servicemeasures.

Tuomaala P Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1537-1542, 3 figs,5 refs. Abstract: Simulation of air infiltration and ventilation, andheat transfer processes of buildings are combined in this buildingsimulation program called BUS. A network assumption is adoptedfor both air flow and thermal simulation. An iterative methodis used for air flow simulation, and a heat balance method isselected for thermal simulation. The program includes mass balance,momentum, and heat balance equations. This makes it possible totake into consideration the interaction between ventilation andheat transfer processes, obtain more reliable simulation resultsthan earlier, and simulate time-dependent processes.

Brohus H, Nielsen P V Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1555-1560, 7 figs,refs. Abstract: When the task is to control the indoor exposure, itis important to know how persons are exposed to a contaminantsource. Personal exposure to a contaminant depends on the ventilationand the location of the source relative to the person. Previousstudies have shown that the exposure may differ more than oneorder of magnitude due to different velocity fields (Brohus andNielsen, 1994). This fact stresses the importance of taking thisparameter into account when we want to control the exposure anddevelop guidelines for exposure reduction. The objective of thisstudy has been to determine the personal exposure to a contaminantsource in a uniform velocity field. This was done by full-scalemeasurements and computer simulations. The results showed a significantdependence on the velocity field both regarding the directionand the magnitude. The results also showed that the disturbancecreated by a person in a flow field may be a very important factorto consider, when the person is turning the back to the flow field.It was found that the wake created behind a person was able toentrain contaminants from a distance exceeding the usual operationrange. Guidelines for personal exposure reduction in a uniformvelocity field are discussed.

Kujawa T Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1567-1572, 7 figs,8 refs. Abstract: Ducts with orifices reinforced with perforated sheetare used frequently in ventilation systems. Design works concerningventilation systems require the knowledge of how orifice geometryinfluences the velocity distributions of air flow as well as theknowledge of local resistance coefficient. Most often, designersassume that, if the shape of duct remains unchanged, the principleof uniform productivity or constant outflow velocity on the wholeorifice length and width can be accepted. In the course of investigationson a number of ventilation elements, it has been observed thatthe above approach was much simplified. The investigations werecarried out for both, laboratory conditions and real ventilationsystems. The above observation was reason to undertake experimentalresearch in order to state how the size and different geometryof orifice, reinforced with perforated sheet, influence the areaof velocity of outflowing air and local resistance coefficient.The orifice was located on side wall of ventilation duct withrectangular cross-section. Orifice was the last ventilation elementin the duct.

Schibuola L Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1573-1578, 9 figs,6 refs. Abstract: External air treatment cost in building climatizationplant can be a considerable quota of the global annual managementcharges. The possibility to reduce this cost then assumes fundamentalimportance also for healthy requirements. In fact it can makemore proposable exchange rates greater than minimum standard onesfixed by low with a real improvement of internal comfort conditions.In this case psychometric processes of outside air normally involveremarkable energy consumption for humidification during winter,for dehumidification in summer and sometimes in spring and autumn.Various innovative plant solutions have been therefore proposedfor these applications. The introduction of desiccant systemsand evaporative cooling can permit techniques alternative to thetraditional ones both in air conditioning and heating periods.In particular the convenience and sometimes the necessity to usechemical dehumidification is just well-known in some applicationcases characterized by low thermal or humidity levels required.In this paper suitable combinations of these two fundamental processesare proposed and their performances are investigated for buildingclimatization purposes. Performance comparison between these techniquesand traditional ones is carried on by annual simulation of building-plantsystems in dynamic conditions for different climatic situations.

Nantka M B Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1609-1614, 4 figs,4 refs. Abstract: The loads of building deciding of the air flows andchange are of different character and mostly depend on stack andwind effect. The main ways to gain information about air changerate are measurements and computer simulations based on variousbuilding models. Measurement method (tracer gas and pressurizationtests) cannot be applied in simultaneous of vast inner areas characteristicof multizone structures. Therefore, analytical methods based onmathematical models of buildings and processes taking place inthem are most frequently used. These models divide the buildinginto a given number of zones (spaces) mutually combined. In mostcases, the division of a building usually consists in separationof buildings with natural ventilation and where wind effect ispredominant. However, the results of the calculation do not conformto the results of measurements made in selected spaces of existingbuildings. On the basis of such comparisons it has been assumedthat the air flow and change rate taken as average for a flatis rarely representative of each of rooms located in this flat.This conclusion has become the basic reason to make an attemptof creating a new method of air flow prediction.

Woolliscroft M Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1637-1643, 3 figs,1 tab, 10 refs. Abstract: A great deal of research has not gone into many aspectsof the problem of indoor air quality but it has been almost exclusivelyat the purely technical level. Some of the health effects of variouspollutants have been determined and measurements taken in thefield to determine whether guidelines are exceeded. In some casescontrol of emissions from materials have been proposed or ventilationrates recommended to reduce pollution levels. Supporting workhas been carried out on modelling of pollutant emissions and absorptionand so on. Some work has been carried out on the interaction ofIAQ and energy. Little consideration has been given to the conceptof IAQ as an economic good, inevitably in competition for scarceresource with other goods. It is the purpose of this paper toapply elementary economic concepts to the question of Indoor airQuality and ventilation in dwellings. Scientists, engineers andother technical people often feel a sense of frustration in thattheir seemingly logical advice is not followed. Often this isbecause they fail to appreciate the winder dimensions, one ofwhich is economic, within which policy makers have to operate.The purpose of this paper is to try to widen the debate aboutIAQ to include at least one other dimension besides the purelytechnical one. The paper is essentially conceptual and attemptsto apply a range of economic concepts and techniques to the problemof indoor air quality.

Meier S Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1743-1750, 7 figs,1 ref. Abstract: The distribution and conditioning of the air are significantcost factors in the operation of ventilation and air conditioningsystems. Plant operating hours are normally kept under controlby the use of time switches or by manual operation. In most cases,However, these methods by no means exploit the full potentialfor a reduction in operating hours. Compared with conventionalmethods of control, a far more significant reduction in operatingcosts can be achieved by basing air renewal on actual (measured)demand. The additional capital investment can be recouped within1 to 5 years, the payback period depending primarily on the airflow rate. At an air flow rate of 2000 m3/h, the payback periodis approximately 5 years, and falls, with increasing air flowrates, to as little as under a year. In automatic mode, the airquality control system switches the fan stages on and off or,in the case of VAV systems, adjusts the fan speed or damper position.Demand-based ventilation systems are not just restricted to newsystems; cost-effective conversion kits are available for existingsystems. In a converted system, manual and/or time-switch controlare replaced by an air quality control system. Other analogueor digital controls (such as temperature) remain unaffected. Onthe basis of empirical values, preset as parameters in the controller,demand-based ventilation systems can be started automaticallyat the touch of a button.

McIntyre D A, Palin S L, Edwards Healthy Buildings '95, edited by M Maroni, proceedings of a conferenceheld Milan, Italy, 10-14 September 1995, pp 1805-1810, 3 figs,5 refs. Abstract: It has become clear over recent years that the presenceof house dust mites exerts an influence upon the health of occupants.Research has suggested that if house dust mite population is controlled,then the incidence of asthma is reduced. The simplest way of achievingthis is to reduce indoor relative humidity levels. As part ofa continuing project (sponsored by the EATL Core Research Programme)to compare the effectiveness of ventilation strategies in inhibitingthe growth of house dust mites, three ventilation systems wereinstalled in the EA Technology Ventilation Test House, and weremonitored over the winter of 1993/1994. Results are presentedfor the variation in humidity levels between rooms for each ventilationsystem. On the basis of the results obtained, mechanical ventilationwith heat recovery appears to be the most effective means of reducingindoor humidity and in coping with peaks of moisture production.When compared to passive stack ventilation, the heat recoverycapability of the mechanical system compensates for the associatedhigher air change rates and the energy consumption associatedwith fan operation.

Since the electromechanical phenomenon in synthetic polymer gels was first observed in 1982 by Tanaka et al. [1] several workers have been studying the volume changes and the deformation behavior of polymer gels in an electric field. Applications such as artificial muscles [2-5]actuators [6] and controlled drug delivery [7] for these gels have been explored. The polymers used are mostly random copolymer or polymer blends having acrylic acid or sulfonic acid pendant groups. The major problems with these polymers are their weak mechanic strength and long response times. In this work, we studied the electromechanical behavior of an elastomeric hydrogel, heavily sulfonated styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene triblock polymer [8] and showed that this material represents a new class of electro-response polymers. EXPERIMENTAL Materials: Styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene (Kraton G-1652) block copolymer was sulfonated using SO3/triethyl phosphate [8]. The level of sulfonation of the styrene blocks ranged from ca. 15 and 68 mol%. Films of the sulfonic acid form were prepared as described elsewhere [8]. The dried films were about 0.2 mm in thickness and were neutralized in aqueous NaOH before being swollen in de-ionized water for at least two days. Electromechanical Properties: The gel was swollen in the appropriate solutions for more than 24 hours. The electrodes were platinum plates with dimensions of 25 x 30 mm and were 43 mm apart. One end of the gel film was attached to a piece of vinyl tubing that was placed midway between the electrodes. The gel and the electrode faces were parallel to each other and immersed in Na2SO4 solutions. A Lambda model LK342A FM regulated dc power supply was used to provide the voltage, which was between 5 and 35 V and corresponded to field strengths between 1 and 8 V/cm. The electromechanical response of the gel was observed using a CCD camera and recorded with a VCR. The bending profile with time was analyzed by a PC with Optimas, an image analysis software. RESULTS & DISCUSSION Swelling Experiments: The swelling ratios for different sulfonation levels are plotted in Figure 1. As anticipated, the gels swell more as the degree of sulfonation increases. The swelling is apparently not linearly dependent on the degree of sulfonation, which is similar to what has been observed with PAMPS [9]. Electromechanical Response: When a dc field was applied, the gel bent toward the negative electrode, i.e., the cathode, which is consistent with other reports for polyanions such as PAMPS. The gel bending increased rapidly at beginning of applying the field and finally reached an equilibrium value. The degree of bending is dependent on the size of the gel, so throughout the experiments, the gel dimensions were kept constant as much as possible. Figure 2 plots the equilibrium bending angles at different solution concentrations when we used the same gel and same applied field strength. A maximum bending at 0.02 M Na2SO4 was obtained. This is probably due to the following reasons. When the salt concentration is low, the osmotic pressure in the gel is high, and the osmotic pressure difference between the two sides of the gel, which is believed to be the driving force of the bending, is therefore also large, so the bending increases with a decrease in the Na2SO4 concentration. However, as the Na2SO4 concentration decreases, the conductivity of the solution also decreases and the voltage across the gel is lower since more and more voltage drop occurs between the solution and the electrodes. The concentration gradient is therefore lower. A maximum occurred at ~ 0.02 M Na2SO4 because of these two contradicting effects. The current as a function of sodium sulfate concentration is also shown in Figure 2. We also studied the speed of bending. Here we define the time that it takes the gel to bend to half of the equilibrium bending angle after the electric field was turned on as the response time and similarly, the time for the gel to relax to half of the equilibrium bending angle as the relaxation time. The response times were basically unchanged for all the sodium sulfate concentrations and the relaxation was faster at higher concentrations. That the response time did not change with the salt concentration indicated no fundamental difference in the bending mechanism between low and high sodium sulfate concentrations. Using the same gel and same salt solution, the gel bending as a function of voltage is plotted in Figure 3. Bending increased at the beginning with the voltage and eventually leveled off although the current continued to increase as voltage increased. A plot of the angle vs current indicated that they are not linearly related. The response time decreased with the increasing voltage, so the bending is faster at larger field, most likely due to the faster diffusion rate. The relaxation of the gel, on the other hand, remained unchanged. The bending for gels with different sulfonation levels is also plotted in Figure 1. As expected, the bending increased with the sulfonation level, but appeared to increased more sharply at higher sulfonation level. Both the response and relaxation times were essentially unchanged at different sulfonation levels. The gel swung when the polarity of the applied field alternated. Figure 4 is a typical response curve for a 50% sulfonated gel at 8 V/cm, in 0.02 M sodium sulfate solution. The bending reaches a maximum in about 2.5 seconds. CONCLUSIONS We have studied the swelling and electro-response of a new elastomeric hydrogel at different solution concentrations, degrees of sulfonation, and field strengths. The bending exhibited a maximum when the salt concentration was about 0.02 M Na2SO4. Bending was larger at higher sulfonation levels and higher field strengths although the bending tended to level off at higher field strengths. Further experiments are underway to optimize the response and to understand more about the bending mechanism.

Our Primer is broken into a number of easy to read sections - the first is a bit of background and history of fuel cells, next we spend a moment discussing the components of an individual cell, and then we chat a bit about how a stack (or collection of individual fuel cells) produces electricity …(this is the really cool part). The Primer concludes with a short discussion (and picture) of a functioning DAIS fuel cell prototype. We all hope you enjoy this part of our Web Site. Your comments about this Primer are most welcome. There is a "feedback" icon at the left of this section which makes it easy for you to send us your thoughts. Thanks for stopping by and let the journey begin .... Section I - Background and History A. Background Electrical energy is produced by a fuel cell as if by magic for it has no moving parts and makes no noise. The secret behind the "magic" is to force a fuel (hydrogen) to produce electrical energy by means of a chemical reaction. Fuel cells are functionally superior to batteries because a fuel cell's lifetime limitation is the supply of the two things -- hydrogen and oxygen (which are called 'reactants' in technical jargon). Batteries by contrast have a defined lifetime, are heavy, have disposal restrictions, and may require extended periods of recharging before reuse. The fuel cell "battery" has four attractive features over existing power sources (including internal combustion engines): provides power as long as each cell has hydrogen and oxygen - no recharging required a fuel cell 'stack' has no moving parts to wear out! will produce energy at equal costs to existing forms of power (using the DAIS materials and technology this is now a true statement!). it is absolutely noise-free is "environmentally friendly." B. History (what would a 'Primer" be without a bit of history …) A bit of "fuel cell" history -- the first working fuel cell was produced by Sir William Grove in 1842. The technology advanced slowly over the years but took a giant leap in the 1960's. During the early 1960s General Electric produced the first practical application for a fuel cell when it provided on-board electrical power for the Gemini and Apollo space capsules. In the early 1970s, DuPont introduced the Nafion® membrane from which all PEM fuel cells have traditional been constructed -- until now. Because Nafion® based fuel cells (and similar membrane products from a handful of other manufacturers) is so expensive and requires a specialized environment (additional heat, compression, hydrated oxygen and hydrogen) to operate efficiently, fuel cells have not been affordable to the marketplace. The DAIS material 'inventions' are less expensive and do not require a 'specialized environment' in which to operate. These advances by DAIS make it cost effective to produce commercial devices that can now 'compete' with rechargeable batteries and internal combustion engines. II. Fuel Cell and "Stack" components: Fuel cells are surprisingly simple in their construction. You need: A fuel: hydrogen Oxygen: Taken from the air we breathe Fuel cells: Each cell is a thin, flat, multi-layered "sandwich". The 'sandwich' consists of two electrodes (one is called an 'anode' and the other a 'cathode'). The two electrodes are separated by a plastic sheet (called a 'membrane)'. That is it! These three pieces perform 'magic'! Incidentally - the 'membrane' is the very heart of the "DAIS DIFFERENCE". Please see the drawing below for a cross-sectional view of a fuel cell. A housing: The housing contains multiple fuel cells (referred to as a "stack"), the hydrogen fuel (a bottle of varied sizes), and the unit's controls. Controls: The purpose of the unit's controls is to start and stop the electricity produced by the collection of fuel cells (known as a "stack") [click on image to enlarge] As you can see .. the membrane is "sandwiched" between the two electrodes (the anode and cathode). Coming from the left you see the hydrogen gas while coming from the right you see the oxygen. In the industry this "sandwich" is referred to as a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA). We call this same assembly a POG. In its final form these assemblies look just like the popular kid's toy -- a small round plastic disk. III. Making Electricity --- "The Magic" The four steps to making the 'hardware' pieces described just above create electricity. These four steps are: Step 1: The chemical reaction starts when one side, the anode of each fuel cell, is exposed to the hydrogen fuel. The anode allows the hydrogen to give up its electrons and form a positively charged particle called a proton. Step 2: On the opposite side of the cell, the cathode adsorbs oxygen from the air generating a potential which pulls the electrons through an external circuit to give them to the adsorbed oxygen. When the adsorbed oxygen receives two electrons it forms a negatively charged particle called an oxygen radical (no .. not left over hippies from the '60's!). Step 3: . Now on each side of the membrane you have positive and negative charges that would like to come together. The DAIS 585 membrane, acting as a "one way valve" that blocks electrons, hydrogen gas, oxygen gas, and oxygen radicals - allows only the positively charged protons to diffuse through the membrane. Step 4: When two positively charged protons encounter a negatively charged oxygen radical they join together to form water. The cathode expels the water and the adsorbs more oxygen to start the reaction all over again. That is it! The "real beauty" of the fuel cell is that it is so simple in operation. There are no moving parts. Only water and a little waste heat are the by-products of making electricity. IV. Conclusion(s) -- with three cool pictures: Each fuel cell will generate an electrical potential of up to 1.1 volts depending on how much electrical current it is asked to produce (by the load or the device requesting power). Higher voltages can be created by arranging cells together--similar to connecting several batteries together inside a flashlight. A collection of individual cells is called a stack. The amount of electrical current a cell can produce is proportional to the total area of the cell. For example the greater the area of the cell the more current at a given voltage that can be produced. Thus a fuel cell stack can produce any required amount of electrical potential and current by stacking the proper numbers of cells with each cell having a specific area or size. Ok .. now that you are a fuel cell expert .. what are those clever folks at DAIS up to? The DAIS team is working on producing production ready prototypes of three sizes -- a 25w, a 125w, and a 1kW unit. Each unit uses the novel DAIS membrane and electrode materials (the DAIS POG), and proprietary stack design(s). The pictures below are of three DAIS "PowerCell" fuel cell stacks. The 8W "PowerCell" and the 20W "PowerCell" unit are powering a Coleman two tube lantern. The 50W unit is powering a Coleman Thermoelectric Cooler (cooler not shown).

These three materials combine to form a DAIS POG (or Membrane/Electrode Assembly). The text below outlines briefly the attributes of these materials. Click here to review papers discussing the DAIS ionomer (the DAIS 585 hydrocarbon membrane material). In the coming months the folks at DAIS will be introducing a line of application driven Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEM-FC) based on its novel materials and stack designs. Material Summary Fact Sheet The DAIS 585 Membrane: The DAIS 585 is a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymer. The material is an elastic, hydrocarbon-based hydrogel with cation exchange ability, and good optical transparency. The block copolymer contains approximately 29wt% styrene units. Sulfonation levels (based on styrene units) range from ca.15-60%. Water uptake and extent of swelling depend on the sulfonation level (for more information on this please click here.) Cast films in the acid (H+) forms have ionic conductivity's (when fully hydrated) of greater than 9 x 10-2 S/cm, which are comparable to those of the fluoropolymer Nafion®. Numerous derivatives with different cations, including many that are redox-active, are readily prepared from the parent polymer. The material is available at sulfonation levels of 55%-60% as a pre-cast reinforced film (thickness' ca. 50 - 200 micron) or as a solution in alcohol's (either 5% or 10% solids). Casting instructions are provided. The DAIS POG (Membrane Electrode Assembly): The patent pending DAIS POG (Membrane/Electrode Assembly) contains ca. .5mg cm2 of platinum, and has a 1/8" shorter anode than cathode. This 'shorter' anode will accommodate many different sealing schemes. The MEA is flexible by construction. Each MEA is ca. 45/1000th inch thick. back to the DAIS Home Page.

Most of the requests are the same .. hence the creation of this Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQ) section. The product name for a DAIS fuel cell stack is "PowerCell". Any reference below to "PowerCell" is talking about the combined DAIS technologies � materials and stack design. Here are some other terms for you to know before continuing on: DAIS 585 Membrane : This is the core invention of the DAIS Corporation. This hydrocarbon based membrane (see the Products section for a more detailed description) can be used in fuel cell applications without some of the traditional fuel cell requirements. A piece of DAIS 585 membrane is �sandwiched� in between two electrodes to form a POG. DAIS POG : This is the electrode (cathode), DAIS 585 Membrane, electrode (anode) �sandwich� talked about in the "What is A Fuel Cell" (click on link) section. The traditional fuel cell folks refer to this as a Membrane/Electrode assembly. Like any number of other things DAIS is different! A DAIS POG is entirely made of new materials developed by DAIS. Stack : A collection of POGs �stacked� together. The purpose of a stack is to mechanically affix each individual POG to gather its electrical potential and for even gas distribution. Unit : A unit is a stack contained in an integrated housing. This integrated housing has a gas distribution system, and some simple controls. This is the �final product�. Is this a fully-exhaustive list of possible definitions or questions? No. This section is meant to hopefully address the most popular questions of a person getting familiar with this exciting technology.

Each POG (a PowerCell is made up of multiple POGS stacked together in a housing) weighs approximately 2 ounces (or approximately 60 grams). Each PowerCell has a housing that will vary in weight with the number of POGS it will contain. A 10W PowerCell (stack �housing� and POGS ) will weigh approximately 1.5 lb. (approximately .65 kg.). These numbers do not include the hydrogen fuel tank, regulator, or valve. DAIS is using a custom designed gas distribution arrangement. This gas distribution system weighs approximately 2 lb. (.90 kg.). The total weight of a 10W PowerCell is approximately 3.75 lb. (this number is rounded up a bit). 2. How much fuel does a DAIS "PowerCell" consume? What kind of fuel does the PowerCell use ? What is the efficiency of a DAIS stack ? At 30 degrees C in air, 7/10V per POG in a Stack of 12 POGS using a 40L sized hydrogen tank (2,200 PSI) flowing gas at 2 PSI and 3/10L per minute the run time is approximately 12 continuous hours. 3. What is the required maintenance of the PowerCell ? Talk nicely to it! OK, so that is not the technical answer you are looking for ..sorry. The actual answer is to keep the unit clean or free of any dirt build up (remember the PowerCell needs to breathe -- very much like you and I do). Please do not expose the unit to high temperatures (greater than 100 degrees F°), open flame, or freezing temperatures (for our current version, today we are working on a low-temperature model). Please keep the unit in its protective sack when not in use. That is it. The PowerCell is really durable and can take a great deal of punishment. But ... do keep it clean! 4. Operating environment of the DAIS fuel cell stack ? The DAIS PowerCell is designed to run at ambient temperatures (0 to 40 degrees C), at normal atmospheric pressures, and without any additional treatment (hydration) of the hydrogen gas stream. The unit is either air breathing or uses a forced air scheme. 5. Projected lifetime of the stack? Refurbish v. �trash� ? The lifetime of the PowerCell is broken into two answers. The lifetime of the POG materials is approximately 2,500 hours of continuous use at maximum rated power density. The lifetime of the housing and gas distribution system is the same as glass, i.e. if it is not broken it will work meaning there is no technical lifetime limitation. A unique feature of the PowerCell is that after the rated lifetime of the POG materials is reached � the unit can be refurbished for another 2,500 hours of use. How you do that, and what it will cost is being developed (sorry not to have a better answer right now ..send us a note to say your are interested in getting knowing more about this refurbishment program). 6. Dimensions of the PowerCell ? The initial PowerCell is a 10W unit that is approximately 5" long by 3" wide, and 3" tall. In its system enclosure (stack and gas distribution system in an enclosure) the overall measurements climb to approximately 6" long, 5" wide, and 3.5" tall. 7. What are the applications for a DAIS PowerCell ? Let your mind run wild on this one. Some of the coolest applications we probably haven�t even thought of yet! The finest attributes of the PowerCell technology lend it to any application that requires a stable, noiseless power source for long run time(s). What are some of the applications the DAIS team is aggressively pursuing? Any number of recreation, communication, power equipment, and small transportation uses. Have a cool idea to use a DAIS PowerCell? Send it to us ... we use it ... we give you a PowerCell! Click here contest@dais.net 8. Are any of the materials that go into a DAIS PowerCell harmful to your health or the environment ? The DAIS PowerCell is made of plastics, light weight metal or aluminum, and contains no hazardous materials. 9. Where do I get hydrogen ? Is hydrogen safe ? These are two really great questions. Hydrogen is available from mail order sources OR best sourced locally at welding or industrial gas distributors. The cost to refill the small 40 Liter sized tank DAIS uses with the PowerCell is less than $2.00 USD (based on U.S. hydrogen prices). Using hydrogen, or gasoline, or propane requires taking some safety precautions. Each gas can be dangerous if mishandled. The safety of hydrogen is a constant question. Handling hydrogen is safer than handling gasoline or propane. Why? Hydrogen is a light gas � it �evaporates� into the air 8 times quicker (University of Florida - Miami study funded by the Department of Energy in 1995) than gasoline or propane vapors. Because hydrogen disperses quickly the danger from a concentrated amount of the hydrogen gas is low. This area of hydrogen safety will be a real learning experience for many people. The findings of the DAIS team on this matter is that �perception is reality�. Frankly � before working on this project, seeing how safe using hydrogen is (following simple, known safety measures), and using the gas I personally had a large misunderstanding about hydrogen. Let me end this very very short discussion by saying that in the coming months DAIS will add links to other sites that will answer this question of hydrogen safety to your satisfaction.

HYDROCARBON PEM/ELECTRODE ASSEMBLIES FOR LOW-COST FUEL CELLS: DEVELOPMENT, PERFORMANCE AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES Gary E. Wnek*, Scott G. Ehrenberg, Joseph M. Serpico, Bashir M. Sheikh-Ali, Timothy N. Tangredi, and Eugene Zador The DAIS Corporation, 4326 Clairidge Way, Palm Harbor, Florida 34684 USA *Department of Chemical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23284-3028 ABSTRACT Significant market opportunities exist for affordable, air-breathing fuel cells operating at ambient temperature. Toward that end, we have developed new, low-cost materials that have the requisite performance characteristics to adequately address many projected applications. Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer (Kraton G1650) has been partially sulfonated and successfully employed as a PEM in hydrogen fuel cells. These materials has several attractive characteristics, including high proton conductivity (ca. 0.09-0.10 S/cm when fully hydrated), good mechanical properties, and relatively low cost. However, their hydrocarbon nature required the development of electrodes which can be readily bonded to the membranes and that offer good performance at room temperature. We briefly review market opportunities for low-cost fuel cells and summarize our most recent efforts in the development of these devices. 1.0 INTRODUCTION There is a growing sentiment that the greatest limitation to widespread utilization of fuel cells is cost, and much recent attention is being directed toward economic issues including raw materials and manufacturing costs. These are particularly important in view of the tremendous opportunities for fuel cells in various consumer applications, where costs must be relatively low in order to encourage adoption as an alternative to batteries or portable, gasoline-powered generators. Performance is of course a key issue as well, and many consumer applications will not tolerate cell operating much above ambient or any need for compressed air or oxygen. Toward this end, we have focused on the development of low-cost fuel cells which operate at or near room temperature utilizing ambient air as the source of oxygen for the cathode reaction. We review here our rationale for this focus and summarize recent progress in materials research and development. 2.0 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economical fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources of extended portable power. By necessity, the design objectives of fuel cell development have changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications. In 1993, the DAIS Corporation was founded to address the materials aspects of fuel cell technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance. The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of PEM fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon-based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel electrode/electrolyte interface polymer, and two advanced stack designs. These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under. The primary target market for these PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies. A second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, and marine applications). Any new power generation approach has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100-plus year infrastructure build-up for battery and internal combustion technology, the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness. Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality1. With this in mind, and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above, the conclusion can be drawn that a new form of power-producing technology needs to include the following attributes outlined in Table 1. TABLE 1 Attribute Rank: Attribute Description: 1 Be within a 7% range of existing power costs 2 Easy to use, light in weight 3 "Zero tolerance" for environmental damage 4 Increased lifetime with an equal run time 5 Quieter operation 6 Greater operational efficiency - more of the fuel converted to power. Fuel cell technology has the ability to meet these "new technology" attributes. Fuel cells possess the necessary characteristics to excel as power source in the next wave of technology. 3.0 MATERIALS 3.1 DAIS PROTON-EXCHANGE MEMBRANES We have exploited inexpensive, hydrocarbon-based block polymers as a new class of PEM. Block polymers exhibit a rich array of microphase-separated morphologies2 and we believed that it might be possible to mimic the morphology and properties of Nafion but with less expensive materials. It has been proposed that Nafion possesses an inverted micellar structure, with spherical (ca. 40-50 � diameter) clusters lined with sulfonic acid groups which are interconnected via ca. 10� channels 3-5. We elected to sulfonate Kraton G1650, a commercially available styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock polymer, as it contains a saturated carbon center block which should be inert to the sulfonation reaction6,7. The structure of the polymer is shown in Figure 1. FIGURE 1: STRUCTURE OF PARTIALLY SULFONATED BLOCK POLYMER PEM MATERIAL Transmission electron microscopy of cast films reveals distinct, phase-separated structures which appeared to be comprised of cylinders of partially sulfonated polystyrene blocks6, although more recent micrographs of thin cross-sections are suggestive of a lamellar structure with thicknesses in the range of 250-300�. It is known that the morphologies of block copolymers can be altered depending on whether the solvent is preferential for one of the blocks8. Our typical casting solvent is rich in n-propanol, which should preferentially solvate the sulfonated styrene blocks, and perhaps subtle changes in the solvent evaporation rate can lead to different final morphologies. Regardless, we find that the fully hydrated (i.e., sample immersed in water) proton conductivities are readily reproducible at a constant sulfonation level, suggestion that upon water swelling the sulfonated styrene domains are interconnected. In fact, the conductivities at sulfonation levels above ca. 50 mole% of styrene units exceed that of Nafion under similar measurement conditions. The preferred extent of sulfonation is ca. 60%, affording a good balance of electrical and mechanical properties. The chemical stability of hydrocarbon-based materials will be poorer than that of perfluorinated polymers such as Nafion due to lower C-H bond dissociation enthalpies. The key step in oxidative degradation is atom abstraction from the backbone (most likely tertiary benzylic H in styrenic polymers) by, for example, electro-generated hydroperoxy radicals. As is well known from studies of autoxidation of hydrocarbons9 the resulting polymer radicals can react with molecular oxygen to form peroxy radicals, and ensuing abstraction and cleavage chemistry eventually leads to backbone scission. The longevity of a hydrocarbon-based PEM is dependent on the relative kinetics of electrode reactions which consume free radical intermediates on the way to product water vs. hydrogen atom abstraction on the polymer by the intermediates. This is difficult to quantify, but we believed that PEM degradation would be minimized by fuel cell operation at relatively low temperatures. A predicted lifetime, approximated from reactions of our PEM material in dilute hydrogen peroxide, is about 2500 h at ca. 60oC10 and is likely to be significantly longer near room temperature. Therefore, we conclude that the sulfonated block polymer stability is in excess of that necessary for many low-temperature fuel cell applications. We note that the sulfonated triblock copolymer has other interesting properties. For example, numerous redox-active molecules may be ion-exchanged into the films, and thus the polymers are useful as coatings for chemically modified electrodes11. Also, the polymers are relatively compliant hydrogels, and we discovered that they deform readily in modest electric fields when suspended in aqueous salt solutions, exhibiting a swinging (bending) motion toward the cathode with a response time of about 2 sec. 12. 3.2 ELECTRODES Fuel cell electrodes are multi-functional materials which must meet several important criteria, including (i) good catalyst activity at low temperatures while minimizing the amount of expensive noble metal, (ii) high porosity to allow efficient transport of oxygen to the cathode, especially when air (21% O2) is used, (iii) good ionic conductivity at the electrode/membrane interface, and (iv) hydrophobicity in the vicinity of the catalyst to encourage water rejection to prevent flooding with attendant inhibition of gas transport. Important features of efficient, and therefore practical, fuel cell electrodes for various consumer applications noted earlier are (1) the ability to employ ambient air as the oxygen source; (2) that it be efficient at ambient temperature and pressure, i.e. that it not require external heating or pressurization; and (3) that it operate without external humidification of gases. Commercial electrodes are not economically viable and do not bond well to hydrocarbon-based PEMs, and thus we needed to develop porous gas diffusion electrodes that met all of these requirements. Our performance goal under these conditions is roughly 150 mW/cm2 of electrode area, although this has been exceeded recently. This is specifically for a cell or stack operating at the desired voltage at or slightly above room temperature. Our approach involves the use of Pt/C as the catalyst layer with a sulfonated hydrocarbon polymer interface coating to promote adhesion between the electrodes and the PEM. A conductive, porous cloth which has been rendered hydrophobic comprises the backing layer, which economically combines good breathability for oxygen with good water rejection. Figure 2 shows a current-voltage plot of an MEA prepared using the sulfonated block polymer PEM and our electrodes. A flow-through cell was employed which consisted of graphite blocks which had machined into them an interdigitated, serpentine flow pattern. The oxygen source for the cathode was compressed air and the anode was commercial grade hydrogen, both gases being at atmospheric pressure and without humidification. The platinum loading of both the anode and cathode was approximately 0.5 mg/cm2. The cell was run using approximately twice the necessary stoichiometric flow at peak power. The cell temperature was 40oC. The main feature of the curve is the high open circuit on air of approximately 0.94 V and the power at 0.5 V of about 200 mW/cm2. FIGURE 2: POLARIZATION CURVE FOR AN MEA DERIVED FROM 60 MOL% SULFONATED TRIBLOCK POLYMER PEM AND DAIS ELECTRODES 3.3 PEM FUEL CELL STACKS Stack designs will support both active and passive cell operation with the emphasis placed on the use of low-cost materials (e.g current collectors, flow fields, end plates, etc.) which are simple and inexpensive to fabricate. Compact, lightweight units will afford high volumetric and mass energy densities as well as high packing efficiencies. Complete fuel cell stack systems are being constructed which meet these criteria. 4.0 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK A significant opportunity exists for fuel cell technology in power applications of 1kW and under. However, a key limitation is cost, and our efforts have concentrated on economical materials and designs to meet this projected need. The search for low-cost fuel cells represents an exciting interdisciplinary effort which merges science, engineering and business and which may have important technological implications.

Impact of New PEM Fuel Cell Materials on Commercialization Scott G. Ehrenberg, Timothy N. Tangredi, Gary E. Wnek, Ph.D.1 The DAIS Corporation 4326 Clairidge Way Palm Harbor, Florida 34684 U.S.A. Executive Summary There are many power producing products available on the market today. Batteries and internal combustion engines are foremost among these products. Both batteries and internal combustion engines have an established infra-structure, are priced to fit diverse applications, and are readily available. The disadvantages of these traditional products revolve around practical limitations and environmental issues. Fuel cell technology has the ability to magnify the positive aspects of these existing products while overcoming the practical and environmental challenges. Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economic fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources of longer portable power. By necessity, the design objectives of fuel cell development have changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications. Beginning with the principle of �cost by application,' the DAIS Corporation has developed a series of new proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell materials. These materials include (1) a new membrane, (2) a cost effective electrode structure engineered for use with the membrane, (3) an interface polymer to mate the membrane and electrode, and (4) two novel "stack" or housing designs that make best use of the novel materials. The primary target market for these PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies. A second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, marine applications, and solar hydrogen hybrids). DAIS�s fuel cell technology possesses several advantages over existing battery technologies in terms of weight, energy density, unit lifetime, and cost. Given this unique forum�s mission statement of "The Dawn of Commercialization," it is DAIS�s intention to present a brief summary of these technical advances, and indicate how these novel materials assembled in a fuel cell will impact the marketplace acceptance of fuel cell technology. I. Forms of Power There are many power producing products available on the market today. Batteries and internal combustion engines comprise the majority of these products. Many products that use batteries are standardized to accept the traditional AA, AAA, C, D, or automobile sized batteries. In 1995 there were over 5.3 billion dry cell batteries (of all types) alone sold worldwide2. There are over 62,000 gasoline retailers in the US3. This is a large established infrastructure for obtaining the required fuel for internal combustion engine applications. A grocery store in Minot, North Dakota can sell "AA" sized batteries for approximately the same cost as a similar store in Florence, Italy. This speaks to the accepted form factor of "AA" batteries, and of the relative price acceptance of the battery�s functionality. An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in Troy, NY uses a 5hp, 4 cycle engine that costs approximately $155 per unit to power its line of outdoor power equipment. This is the same unit that a firm in Moline, Illinois would use to power its line of outdoor equipment. People have accepted the design, the availability, the costs , the upkeep, the risks, and the compromises and undesirable aspects of the two primary forms of power. The point is that major forms of power in the world today are an outgrowth of over 100 years of product and technology evolution. This evolution has accepted the compromises of the given technology. And certainly these products are not without deficiency and compromise. The very definition of compromise is the lack of features or functionality that the entire marketplace has had to accept. In today�s battery powered technology these compromises are: weight environmental disposal lifetime A minimal set of compromises for the internal combustion engine include: noise weight environmental damage efficiency of operation Any new power generation approach has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100 plus year infrastructure build up for battery and internal combustion technology, the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness. Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality 4. With this in mind, and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above, the conclusion can be drawn that a new form of power producing technology needs to include the following attributes: Attribute Rank 5 Attribute Description 1. be within a 7% range of existing power costs 2. easy to use, and lighter 3. "zero tolerance" for environmental damage 4. increased lifetime with an equal runtime 5. quieter 6. greater operational efficiency - more of the �fuel� is converted to power rather than going to waste Fuel cell technology has the ability to meet these �new technology� attributes. Fuel cells possess the necessary characteristics to excel as power source in the next wave of technology. II. History that leads to the Future Fuel cell development, since the NASA missions of the 1960s, has focused on high reliability, high cost systems. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. DAIS has adopted the strategy that in order to compete against traditional forms of power generation fuel cell technology must have high reliability and be priced to address the application. Historically fuel cell technology has been priced at approximately $8 per Watt. What is behind this sky-high expense? Quite simply, the cost of the materials forced a need to obtain the highest power output possible. Engineers and scientists added gas hydration, compression, and heat. These ancillary devices, coupled with the basic cost of the materials have produced a situation that violates Required Attribute #1 stated above: staying within 7% of existing power production methods. In 1993, the DAIS Corporation formed to address the materials aspect of this technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). As an example: the average lifetime of a lawnmower powered by a 5hp internal combustion engine in the US is 455 hours.6 the average lifetime of a 125cc Scooter in Europe is 1890 hours.7 the average lifetime of a 6v lantern battery running a Coleman 7300 series camping lantern is 8.5 hours.8 By comparison the DAIS materials all have a rated life that exceeds each application lifetime stated above. Traditional fuel cells have longer lifetimes, and (using the ancillary equipment) higher power densities per cell. This existing technology again violates the first principle of marketplace acceptance - the costs are too high to create an upsurge of support. III. The DAIS Materials The DAIS materials have been engineered to run in the following operational environment: Ambient pressure on the Cathode Operating temperatures of 35 to 500 C No additional hydration of the reactant gases Active controlled air flow over the Cathode Consistent power level of no less than 200 mW/cm2 Power density of .17 to .23 kW/liter and .45 to .61 kW/kg Lifetime minimum of 2,500 hours per cell A. The DAIS 585 Membrane: The DAIS membrane material (known as DAIS 585) is a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymer. The material is an elastic, hydrocarbon-based hydrogel with cation exchange ability, and good optical transparency. The block copolymer contains approximately 29% wt styrene units. Sulfonation levels (based on styrene units) range from ca.15-60%. Water uptake and extent of swelling depend on the sulfonation level. Cast films in the acid (H+) forms have ionic conductivity's (when fully hydrated) of greater than 9 x 10-2 S/cm, which are comparable to those of the fluoropolymer Nafion�. Numerous derivatives with different cations, including many that are redox-active, are readily prepared from the parent polymer. The material is available at sulfonation levels of 55%-60% as a pre-cast reinforced film (approximate thicknesses of 50 - 200 micron) or as a solution in alcohol (either 5% or 10% solids). B. The DAIS electrode and Membrane/Electrode Assembly: The DAIS electrode is a porous gas diffusion electrode comprised of (a) an electronically conductive porous body in electrical contact with (b) a catalyst layer that in turn consists of (i) a catalyst dispersed on the surface of a carbon support; (ii) a water-insoluble sulfonated polystyrene, sulfonated poly(a-methylstyrene) or sulfonated styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer; and (iii) a nonionic fluorocarbon polymer. The preferred sulfonated polystyrenes, poly(a-methylstyrene)s and SEBS's have a conductivity of 0.04 S/cm or greater, a molecular weight from 30,000 to 1,000,000, and are 10 to 60 mole percent sulfonated. The sulfonated polystyrene is percentage of the molecular weight (200,000 to 400,000). The catalyst material is platinum. The DAIS electrodes (and interface polymer), when mated with the DAIS 585 membrane, form a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA). DAIS MEAs come in a variety of shapes with a 6" square presently being the largest. Power densities of the all-DAIS membrane electrode assembly have yielded 165mW/cm2 at 5/10 of a volt. Please click here to view a recent power curve using passive and active air forced over the cathode. C. The DAIS "PowerCell" Stack Designs 9: Traditional stack housing designs require peripheral support devices (compressors, heaters, water inlet/outlet, etc.) to yield high electrical current. The housings tended to be constructed of a block- style heavy gauge stainless steel metal with individual cell components made of a graphite-like (or filled) composite material. By way of contrast -- the DAIS fuel cell housing designs (Radial Air Stack � RAS, and Single In Line Module � SIM) provide special air and hydrogen flows, and successfully manage the water produced by the fuel cell�s electrochemical reaction. The base materials are made of engineering grade plastics. The Radial Air design is unique due to its air flow pattern and use of a single compression bolt along with external hydrogen fuel distribution manifolds. The SIM design is progressive in regards to the ease of parts fabrication, low cost, and active material protection. Each design is lightweight, and is specifically targeted to be used in portable or semi-portable consumer, commercial, or military applications. Figure 1: RAS Stack Design Both novel housing designs (RAS and SIM) are engineered for use with the DAIS Corporation�s patented (or patent pending) Proton Exchange Membrane based fuel cell materials (membrane electrolyte, anode cathode, backing material, and interface polymer). Furthermore , it is possible to combine the best aspects of each design into a single design that is far superior to either design alone. Figure 2: Single In Line Module Design - Passive Both designs can be either passive or active air flow managed. The use of the passive mode makes a less expensive PowerCell device. Adding the active air flow over the cathode generally produces a 3x improvement in the overall power density. Each air management scheme can be adapted to a specific application or price point. IV. Economics 10w 25w 1kW Materials $57 $181 $491 Stack $31 $33 $77 Controls $39 $60 $151 Suggested Retail $128 $274 $720 DAIS requires its materials and designs to not only function and provide stable power but to be financially attractive to end users. This is a fundamental axiom with DAIS, whether the end user is an electrician working with portable power tools on a remote job site or a large multi-national firm that produces outdoor power equipment. The cost and functionality must meet Attribute #1 of cost competitiveness as stated before. The above chart is an estimate of how the DAIS technologies will price at a retail level given a modest level of production volume. V. Conclusions and Summary The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance. The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of this exciting technology of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel interface polymer, and two advanced stack designs. These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under. The entire DAIS team thanks you for taking time to read about our project. Footnotes: 1.

Ehrenberg, Timothy N. Tangredi The DAIS Corporation, 4326 Clairidge Way, Palm Harbor, Florida 34684 USA Louis A. Raboin Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Universityof Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 ABSTRACT Commercially available styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer (Kraton G1652) was partially sulfonated using a SO3/triethylphosphate reagent in a dichloroethane/cyclohexane mixed solvent.Films of the product were cast from lower alcohols to give elasticmaterials with different degrees of sulfonation (ca. 30-60%) asdetermined by titration. Transmission electron microscopy suggeststhat the cast films possess cylindrical sulfonated polystyrenedomains. The films swell in water, with the extent of swellingbeing dependent on the sulfonation level. Ionic conductivitiesas high as 8.5 x 10^(-2) S/cm are obtained when fully hydrated,and compare favorably to those exhibited by hydrated, sulfonatedfluoropolymers such as Nafion. INTRODUCTION Polymers with high protonic conductivities are potentially usefulas proton exchange membranes (PEM's) in fuel cells. Among theearliest PEM's were sulfonated, crosslinked polystyrenes, andthese were employed in fuel cells on the Gemini space missions. [1]More recently, interest has been directed to sulfonated fluorocarbonpolymers, of which Nafion has been most extensively studied. [2-7] This material has a high protonic conductivity (ca. 7 x 10-2 S/cmat 30 oC) [8] when hydrated and is chemicallyrather inert. It has been proposed that Nafion possesses an inverted micellarstructure, with spherical (ca. 40-50 Å diameter) clusterslined with sulfonic acid groups which are interconnected via ca.10 Å channels. [9-11] We sought to mimicthis picture using inexpensive sulfonated, hydrocarbon-based blockcopolymers. Block copolymers in general can exhibit a rich arrayof microphase-separated morphologies depending on relative blocksizes. [12] Such materials provide us with anopportunity to link good ionic (protonic) conductivity throughwater-swellable micro-domains with low material cost and desirablemechanical properties. We note that selected block copolymershave been shown to be useful as alkali metal-based polymer electrolytes, [13] although apparently no efforts have been directed toward obtaininghigh protonic conductivity based on hydrocarbon block polymers. We selected Kraton G1652 for our studies as it contains a saturatedcarbon center block which should be inert to the sulfonation reaction,which in this case employs SO3/triethyl phosphate to achieve highlevels of sulfonation without crosslinking. [14] The reaction is summarized in Figure 1 . The Kraton used in this study contains 29% by weight styrene andexhibits a microstructure of polystyrene phases intermediate betweenspheres and cylinders (ca. 150 Å in diameter) in an ethylene/butylene-rich continuous phase. 16 Sulfonation levels, based onthe moles of styrene units sulfonated, ranged from 35-65% as determinedby titration. We note that sulfonated, saturated Kratons havebeen disclosed in a patent, [15] and that Weissand coworkers [16-18] have explored in detailthe morphology and mechanical properties of lightly sulfonated(up to 12 mol% styrene units) Kraton G1652, the latter representingan interesting new class of ionomers. However, we are unawareof studies directed at highly sulfonated derivatives with theaim of obtaining highly proton conducting films. EXPERIMENTAL Kraton G1652 was acquired from Shell Chemical; dichloroethane(DCE) and cyclohexane were from Krackeler Scientific; triethylphosphate (TEP) and sulfur trioxide (SO3) were from Aldrich. Allmaterials were used without further purification. Sulfonationof the styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) triblock polymerwas carried out in a batch mode using SO3/TEP. [14] The reaction vessel was kept slightly below 0oC and reaction timesranged from 60-90 min. After removing most of the cyclohexaneand DCE, the residue was taken up into lower alcohols. Films werethen cast from these solutions on glass under an IR lamp. Titrations to determine the sulfonic acid content of the filmwere carried out using standardized sodium hydroxide solutions.Films were hydrated in deionized water and washed by placing thefilm in clean deionized water three times for one hour each. About0.15 g of film was placed in a small vial and approximately 12ml of sodium chloride solution was added. After immersion forabout 2 h, titrations to a phenolphthalein endpoint were carriedout. Data are reported as mol% styrene units sulfonated. Samplesfor transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were first stainedfor 15 min in the presence of RuO4 vapor and then cryomicrotomedat -100 degrees celsius using a Reichert-Jung Fc4 microtome. A2000 FX high resolution transmission electron microscope was employedat a magnification of 275,000x. Conductivity measurements were made on samples treated to removeany residual sulfuric acid from the sulfonation reaction. Sampleswere soaked in water for 30 min. and then dried under an IR lampfor 30 min, and this sequence was repeated twice. The conductivityof the membrane was measured by using a pair of pressure-attachedhigh surface area platinum electrodes as described by Zawodsinskiet al.8 The mounted sample was immersed in distilled, deionizedwater at room temperature (ca. 24 degrees Celsius). Once the samplehad completely hydrated, measurements were made from 1 Hz to 10KHzusing a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. Both realand imaginary components of the impedance were measured and thereal Z-axis intercept was closely approximated. The cell constantwas calculated from the spacing of the electrodes (L), the thicknessof the membrane and the area of the platinum electrodes (A). Theconductivity (s) was calculated using the equation s = L/RA. RESULTS & DISCUSSION Films of sulfonated triblock polymer are yellow and relativelytransparent as well as elastomeric. A transmission electron micrographof a microtomed and RuO4-stained film (ca. 45% sulfonation) isshown in Figure 2 and reveals what appear to be cylindrical (ca.150 Å in diameter) sulfonated polystyrene domains in anethylene/butylene matrix. We believe that at this high sulfonationlevel, relatively homogeneous sulfonated polystyrene domains arepresent rather than ionic clusters of sulfonated styrene repeatunits within polystyrene domains as is the case in lightly sulfonatedKratons. [16-18] The films swell upon immersion in water, and the extent of swellingis as expected dependent upon the sulfonation level. These hydrogelsretain their elastomeric character. We have no information onthe organization or the sizes of the sulfonated domains upon hydration,but speculate that these are interconnected upon swelling andperhaps forming bicontinuous phases. X-ray and neutron scatteringexperiments are planned to address this important issue. The filmsremain relatively transparent upon hydration, suggesting thatthe water-swollen domains remain below ca. 400 nm in diameter. Ionic conductivities of fully hydrated films having various levelsof sulfonation are reported in Table 1 . Samples having sulfonationlevels greater than about 45% have conductivities comparable toNafion (ca. 7 x 10-2 S/cm) under similar conditions.(8) The amountof sulfonation within the polystyrene domains is well above thepercolation threshold for ionic conduction of ca. 7 mol%, as recentlydetermined by Yeager, Eisenberg and coworkers [19] for sulfonated homopolystyrene. The high conductivity we observeindicates that the sulfonated domains are interconnected. In summary, we have prepared highly proton conducting, elastomericfilms by sulfonation of a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblockpolymer. Several applications of these materials are being investigated,including their use as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells.

The use of ionomers in electrode modification, introduced by Anson and Oyama [2], provides an elegantly simple approach. With ionomer coatedelectrodes, one can immobilize a wide range of ionic electroactive compounds. The ionomeric systems used include poly(vinyl pyridine) [2], quarternized poly(vinyl pyridine) [3], poly(vinyl sulfate) [3], and Nafion(R) [4]. Of these, Nafion(R) system has been used extensively. Much recent attention has been given to new materials for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and this has led to the development of an inexpensive ionomer system using sulfonated Kraton G1650 (styrene/ ethylene butylene/ styrene block copolymer)[5].The rich array of microphase separated morphologies of block copolymers provides one with an opportunity to link good ionic conductivity through water swellable microdomains with low material cost and desirable mechanical properties. We have found that redox-active cations are easily exchanged into the sulfonated block copolymer films. This preprint describes some preliminary results obtained from studies using this material as a coating for applications involving chemically modifiedelectrodes. EXPERIMENTAL Sulfonated Kraton G1650 in alcohol solution form was a gift from the DAIS corporation. Ferrocenyl methyl trimethyl ammonium iodide was obtained from Strem Chemicals. Methyl viologen dichloride was obtained from Aldrich. The cyclic voltammetric studies were carried out with the aid of an EG&G PARC Model 173 potentiostat/galvanostat coupled with the EG&G PARC 175 Universal Programmer and EG&G PARC 179 coulometer. The initial experiments were carried out on platinum electrodes (Bioanalytical Systems). There was some problem with adhesion of the polymer film to the electrode upon swelling in water. Hence thereafter modification of glassy carbon electrodes (GCE from Bioanalytical Systems) was carried out. The general procedure used in the voltammetric experiments was as follows. The electrode was polished with alumina powder and rinsed with distilled water. The electrode was then cleaned ultrasonically. The polymer, in the sulfonic acid form, was cast on the electrode from a 5wt% alcohol solution. The polymer film was neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and then electroactive cations were exchanged into the ionomeric coating on the electrode. Loading of the cations was followed amperometrically. RESULTS & DISCUSSION Two kinds of electroactive species were used to investigate the behavior of the ionomer-modified electrodes, ferrocenylmethyl trimethyl ammonium ion and methyl viologen. Figure 1 shows the loading curve for the ferrocenylmethyl trim ethyl ammonium ion, wherein the magnitude of the peak current correlates to the amount present in the polymer film. It can be inferred that saturation occurs inabout 4 hours. Figure 2 is the cyclic voltammogram obtained when ferrocenylmethyl trimethyl ammonium ion is immobilized in the ionomer. The peak separation observed is 63 mV, which is very close to the expected value of 59 mV for a reversible system. Figure 3 shows the dependence of peak current on the scan rate with which the potential is ramped. The linearity of the plot implies that the charge transport inside the ionomeric film is diffusion controlled. Figures 4 shows the voltammetric behavior of a methyl viologen-loaded film, one at a lower scan rate (20 mV/s) and the other at a higher scan rate (200 mV/s). As can be seen from these figures, the width of the first oxidation peak depends on the scan rate. Figure 5 shows the time dependence of broadening at a scan rate of 200 mV/s. We propose that the time and scan rate dependent broadening of the first oxidation peak may be the result of the much greater hydrophobicity of the two-electron reduction product, which may diffuse into the hydrophobic domains of the block polymer provided that sufficient time is given. The neutral species thus transported might have a different formal potential than one residing inthe sulfonated, hydrophilic domain. It is worth noting that not all neutral species will diffuse at the same rate. Thus, the electrode would "see" a mixture of species with different formal potentials and hence the broadening of the peak. The time dependence of the reduction in broadening is under investigation. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of the use of sulfonated poly hydrocarbon ionomer has beendemonstrated. The electrochemical kinetics of the redox-active species withinthe ionomer depends strongly on the type of the electroactive species. The redox behavior of methyl viologen may shed light on the internal domains of our ionomericsystem. Further experiments, which are in progress in our lab, will offer details about the charge and mass transport within the ionomer.

The goal is to find a sulfonation that will provide the polymer gel with a maximum conductivity for applications as an ion-conductive membrane and an electromechanically responsive material for an artificial muscle. The first step to this goal was to test the conductivity of the polymer in the H+, Na+, and ferrocenated forms, each in 0.1, 1 and 2M NaCl solutions. These values were compared to the conductivity values of a Nafion-117 polymer gel in the acid (H+) and neutralized (Na+) forms in the three solutions, and the conductivity values of the solution alone. The styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer in the acid form was the most conductive of the three forms. The 2M NaCl solution produced higher conductivities than the more dilute solutions. The acid form of the polymer gel was the most conductive; the neutralized form was less than the acid form, but approximately equal to the conductivities of the solution alone without a polymer; and the ferrocenated polymer was the most resistive. INTRODUCTION In the past two years, Dr. Gary Wnek and his undergraduate research team have been investigating this elastomeric, heavily sulfonated triblock polymer. They discovered that when a DC electric field was applied, the gel bent toward the negative electrode. The gel swelled more as the degree of sulfonation increased. They also found that the maximum bending angle of the gel ocurred at 0.02M Na2SO4 solution concentration. (1) It has been discovered in research on polymethacrylic acid membranes, that a change of ionization state of the membrane can alter insulin flux (2) and reverse hydration in the membrane and permeability to solutes (3). An application of a DC electric field of 6V/cm was tested on polymethacrylic acid gels containing philocarpin. The field induced the release of the drug into the surrounding bath (4). Ionization state, cross-link density, and gel swelling are critical to determining whether the polymer gel Dr. Wnek's research group is investigating could have selectively augmented macromolecular transport properties by electrodiffusion, electroosmosis, and electrophoresis. EXPERIMENTAL The sulfonated polymer was obtained as a gift from the DAIS Corp. and is now available from the Aldrich Chemical Co. (cat. # 44888-5). Several impedance tests using AC voltage were run on the polymer gel. The gel was mounted, first, by a lateral conductivity method, which attaches the platinum electrodes directly to the gel (5). The conductivity and resistivity were calculated for each run. The tests started with a 41% sulfonated gel batch. The impedance test was run with the gel immersed in distilled water. The gel was then placed in an excess NaOH solution for twenty-three hours to neutralize the gel. This neutralized membrane was tested with the lateral conductivity method, just as before. The gel was then placed in an excess solution of ferrocene for eighteen hours and was then was before. The same tests were run again for a batch of gels having a sulfonation level of 57%. A new test cell was formed, which was named the "Double-L" cell. It was named this, because it looks like two letter "L"s facing each other with an O-ring in between them. This cell was constructed to test the conductivity and resistivity of the gel, which was between the two "L"s, and which was filled with different concentrations of solutions. The platinum electrodes each were placed through the top of each the "L"s to sit at ninety degree angles two the cell. The electrodes in this method are not directly connected to the gel. The conductivity was tested for 0.1M KCl solution without the membrane at 21.5 degrees C. From this, an average cell constant was determined, in order to calculate the conductivity of the gel in the new cell. The measured cell constant was 2.952/cm. The cell constant does not have a dependence to polymer type, solution, or concentration of a solution. Tests were run on the polymer in the acid form in distilled water for the "Double-L" cell method. Then the polymer was tested three times while in the acid form, twice in the neutralized form, and once in the ferrocenated form. The acid and neutralized forms of a Nafion-117 polymer were tested once. The polymer gel and the Nafion-117 gel in their specific forms were immersed and tested for each of these three solutions in the "Double-L" cell: 0.1M, 1M, and 2M solutions of NaCl. The conductivity and resistance were measured for these solutions without a polymer gel in between the "L"s, in order to determine what effect the polymer had on the conductivity and resistance. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS The 41% and 57% sulfonated styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer tests, did not produce a trend in the conductivity. The 57% sulfonated polymer had higher values for conductivity for the neutralized and ferrocenated forms, than the 41% sulfonated polymer. However, the 41% sulfonated polymer had a higher conductivity that the 57% sulfonated polymer. There are no reproductions of these tests, so the values may not be accurate. The acid form was the most conductive of the three forms. Figure 1 shows the change in the values of the conductivity measured with the polymer gel from the values measured without the polymer. From Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4, one can see that the acid form of the polymer was the most conductive; the neutralized form's conductivities were less than the acid form, but approximately equal to the conductivities of the solution alone; and the ferrocenated polymer was the most resistive. The 2M NaCl solution produced higher conductivities than the more dilute solutions. CONCLUSIONS One cannot assume that the sulfonation level does not have an effect on the conductivity of the polymer. There have not been enough tests performed on the different sulfonation levels. First, it was to be determined what ion exchange in the polymer produced the highest conductivity results. The acid form, from the tests run on the polymer and the Nafion-117 gel, produced the highest conductivity values. The results show that the polymer consistently produced higher conductivity values than the Nafion-117 gel. It is concluded from the observation that the polymer gel shrunk when ferrocenated, one can conclude that the substitution of the ferrocene ion to the polymer renders the polymer more hydrophobic. The hydrophobicity of this form of the polymer gel caused the polymer to reject the water, with which the polymer was hydrated. The accuracy of the "Double-L" cell tests, may not be desirable. The concentrations of the solutions were not always exactly the same when mixed, because when the NaCl was measured out, the weight was not precise (range = 0.06%). The acid form conductivity values were and average of the three tests. However, the neutralized form was only the values of one trial. The ferrocenated form was only the one set of values that was tested. RECOMMENDATIONS In order to determine the sulfonation level that will provide the polymer with a maximum conductivity, more tests must be conducted to determine the accuracy of the measured conductivity values. Also, the effect of neytralizing cations on conductivity needs to be studied in more detail.

Fuel Cell by BRUCE ADAMS Electricity created almost magically from hydrogen and air may soon power cars, portable electronic devices, lawn mowers, and snow throwers. The quiet, inexpensive, renewable power will come from fuel cells that use revolutionary, low-cost materials invented and patented by DAIS Corp., a Rensselaer incubator company. This scientific advance was recognized Feb. 15, when DAIS received the 1995 Inventor of the Year Award from the Eastern New York Intellectual Property Law Association. The association represents patent attorneys, agents, and support personnel working in the field of intellectual property law throughout the Capital Region, said association president Wayne Reinke. Created in 1982, the Inventor of the Year Award recognizes a person or group of people whose invention the association finds noteworthy. "It is also an expression of appreciation to the community of inventors whose creative efforts have advanced the cause of civilization in this country and throughout the world," Reinke said. "The introduction of an affordable fuel cell will create a new market for this technology, putting it to work in a multitude of everyday uses, such as outdoor power tools," said Scott Ehrenberg, president of DAIS. Fuel-cell technology has been available since the 1960s and was pioneered by the Apollo and Gemini space missions, according to Gary Wnek, professor and chair of chemistry. The high cost of materials has been a major drawback in creating these environmentally friendly power sources, said Wnek, who helped develop the unique new fuel-cell materials. The DAIS Hy-Air fuel cell uses a new, low-cost proton-exchange membrane (PEM) known as DAIS 585. With a price less than half that of its nearest competitor, this technological breakthrough was developed with a grant from DAIS in cooperation with Rensselaer's New York State Center for Polymer Synthesis. (How fuel cellswork). In addition, the DAIS "Hy-Air" fuel cell uses economical new materials for its electrode and stack structure. This makes the fuel cell truly affordable to the general public. The cost of the DAIS cell and its operation will be similar to that of traditional power sources such as small internal combustion engines. But the fuel cell will burn no petroleum, create no emissions, be absolutely noise-free, will not harm the environment, and will be smaller and more compact than traditional engines and motors, said Timothy Tangredi, executive vice president of DAIS. Apart from the "Hy-Air" technology, there are no other low-cost fuel cells on the market, Tangredi said. DAIS plans to introduce a complete line of "Hy-Air" fuel cells this year. back to Publications & Press Info.

The high level of ionic conductivity andthe low relative production cost of the Dais 585, as the new polymeris known, will also enable its use in a wide range of membraneapplications such as gas separation and biomedical coatings. Fuel cell proton electrode membranes (PEM's) require polymerswith high protonic conductivity's. The earliest fuel cells, includingthose developed by General Electric for the Gemini and Apollospace missions, used sulfonated, cross-linked polystyrene polymers.More recently, the membrane materials of choice have been thosebased on sulfonated fluorocarbon materials, such as DuPont'sNafion. The new material, a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylenestyrene triblock copolymer, displays an ionic conductive of .09S/cm2, 10 -15% higher than competitive materials, atalmost 40% lower cost. The material was developed at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Troy, New York, USA with a grant from the DAIS, whose missionis to develop polymeric materials and to use them in low costelectrical power sources. To achieve this, researchers are currently working to improvethe power density and lifetime of the material. Independent research by BCS Technologies in Bryan, Texas, USA has shown power densityresults of 6 watts for a membrane active area of 25cm2,at 500C (in air). Lifetime testing of the novel polymerhas now exceeded 3,000 hours. These results mean that the DAISCorporation will launch a 125w fuel cell, using the DAIS 585 membranepolymer, in the June 1996 timeframe. The Company is offering thenew materials in polymer form at sulfonation levels of 45% - 55%as a precast film or as a casting solution.

Executive Summary There are many power producing products available on the market today. Batteries and internal combustion engines are foremost among these products. Both batteries and internal combustion engines have an established infra-structure, are priced to fit diverse applications, and are readily available. The disadvantages of these traditional products revolve around practical limitations and environmental issues. Fuel cell technology has the ability to magnify the positive aspects of these existing products while overcoming the practical and environmental challenges. Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economic fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources of longer portable power. By necessity, the design objectives of fuel cell development have changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications. Beginning with the principle of �cost by application,' the DAIS Corporation has developed a series of new proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell materials. These materials include (1) a new membrane, (2) a cost effective electrode structure engineered for use with the membrane, (3) an interface polymer to mate the membrane and electrode, and (4) two novel "stack" or housing designs that make best use of the novel materials. The primary target market for these PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies. A second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, marine applications, and solar hydrogen hybrids). DAIS�s fuel cell technology possesses several advantages over existing battery technologies in terms of weight, energy density, unit lifetime, and cost. Given this unique forum�s mission statement of "The Dawn of Commercialization," it is DAIS�s intention to present a brief summary of these technical advances, and indicate how these novel materials assembled in a fuel cell will impact the marketplace acceptance of fuel cell technology. I. Forms of Power There are many power producing products available on the market today. Batteries and internal combustion engines comprise the majority of these products. Many products that use batteries are standardized to accept the traditional AA, AAA, C, D, or automobile sized batteries. In 1995 there were over 5.3 billion dry cell batteries (of all types) alone sold worldwide2. There are over 62,000 gasoline retailers in the US3. This is a large established infrastructure for obtaining the required fuel for internal combustion engine applications. A grocery store in Minot, North Dakota can sell "AA" sized batteries for approximately the same cost as a similar store in Florence, Italy. This speaks to the accepted form factor of "AA" batteries, and of the relative price acceptance of the battery�s functionality. An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in Troy, NY uses a 5hp, 4 cycle engine that costs approximately $155 per unit to power its line of outdoor power equipment. This is the same unit that a firm in Moline, Illinois would use to power its line of outdoor equipment. People have accepted the design, the availability, the costs , the upkeep, the risks, and the compromises and undesirable aspects of the two primary forms of power. The point is that major forms of power in the world today are an outgrowth of over 100 years of product and technology evolution. This evolution has accepted the compromises of the given technology. And certainly these products are not without deficiency and compromise. The very definition of compromise is the lack of features or functionality that the entire marketplace has had to accept. In today�s battery powered technology these compromises are: weight environmental disposal lifetime A minimal set of compromises for the internal combustion engine include: noise weight environmental damage efficiency of operation Any new power generation approach has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100 plus year infrastructure build up for battery and internal combustion technology, the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness. Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality 4. With this in mind, and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above, the conclusion can be drawn that a new form of power producing technology needs to include the following attributes: Attribute Rank 5 Attribute Description 1. be within a 7% range of existing power costs 2. easy to use, and lighter 3. "zero tolerance" for environmental damage 4. increased lifetime with an equal runtime 5. quieter 6. greater operational efficiency - more of the �fuel� is converted to power rather than going to waste Fuel cell technology has the ability to meet these �new technology� attributes. Fuel cells possess the necessary characteristics to excel as power source in the next wave of technology. II. History that leads to the Future Fuel cell development, since the NASA missions of the 1960s, has focused on high reliability, high cost systems. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. DAIS has adopted the strategy that in order to compete against traditional forms of power generation fuel cell technology must have high reliability and be priced to address the application. Historically fuel cell technology has been priced at approximately $8 per Watt. What is behind this sky-high expense? Quite simply, the cost of the materials forced a need to obtain the highest power output possible. Engineers and scientists added gas hydration, compression, and heat. These ancillary devices, coupled with the basic cost of the materials have produced a situation that violates Required Attribute #1 stated above: staying within 7% of existing power production methods. In 1993, the DAIS Corporation formed to address the materials aspect of this technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). As an example: the average lifetime of a lawnmower powered by a 5hp internal combustion engine in the US is 455 hours.6 the average lifetime of a 125cc Scooter in Europe is 1890 hours.7 the average lifetime of a 6v lantern battery running a Coleman 7300 series camping lantern is 8.5 hours.8 By comparison the DAIS materials all have a rated life that exceeds each application lifetime stated above. Traditional fuel cells have longer lifetimes, and (using the ancillary equipment) higher power densities per cell. This existing technology again violates the first principle of marketplace acceptance - the costs are too high to create an upsurge of support. III. The DAIS Materials The DAIS materials have been engineered to run in the following operational environment: Ambient pressure on the Cathode Operating temperatures of 35 to 500 C No additional hydration of the reactant gases Active controlled air flow over the Cathode Consistent power level of no less than 200 mW/cm2 Power density of .17 to .23 kW/liter and .45 to .61 kW/kg Lifetime minimum of 2,500 hours per cell A. The DAIS 585 Membrane: The DAIS membrane material (known as DAIS 585) is a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymer. The material is an elastic, hydrocarbon-based hydrogel with cation exchange ability, and good optical transparency. The block copolymer contains approximately 29% wt styrene units. Sulfonation levels (based on styrene units) range from ca.15-60%. Water uptake and extent of swelling depend on the sulfonation level. Cast films in the acid (H+) forms have ionic conductivity's (when fully hydrated) of greater than 9 x 10-2 S/cm, which are comparable to those of the fluoropolymer Nafion�. Numerous derivatives with different cations, including many that are redox-active, are readily prepared from the parent polymer. The material is available at sulfonation levels of 55%-60% as a pre-cast reinforced film (approximate thicknesses of 50 - 200 micron) or as a solution in alcohol (either 5% or 10% solids). B. The DAIS electrode and Membrane/Electrode Assembly: The DAIS electrode is a porous gas diffusion electrode comprised of (a) an electronically conductive porous body in electrical contact with (b) a catalyst layer that in turn consists of (i) a catalyst dispersed on the surface of a carbon support; (ii) a water-insoluble sulfonated polystyrene, sulfonated poly(a-methylstyrene) or sulfonated styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer; and (iii) a nonionic fluorocarbon polymer. The preferred sulfonated polystyrenes, poly(a-methylstyrene)s and SEBS's have a conductivity of 0.04 S/cm or greater, a molecular weight from 30,000 to 1,000,000, and are 10 to 60 mole percent sulfonated. The sulfonated polystyrene is percentage of the molecular weight (200,000 to 400,000). The catalyst material is platinum. The DAIS electrodes (and interface polymer), when mated with the DAIS 585 membrane, form a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA). DAIS MEAs come in a variety of shapes with a 6" square presently being the largest. Power densities of the all-DAIS membrane electrode assembly have yielded 165mW/cm2 at 5/10 of a volt. Please click here to view a recent power curve using passive and active air forced over the cathode. C. The DAIS "PowerCell" Stack Designs 9: Traditional stack housing designs require peripheral support devices (compressors, heaters, water inlet/outlet, etc.) to yield high electrical current. The housings tended to be constructed of a block- style heavy gauge stainless steel metal with individual cell components made of a graphite-like (or filled) composite material. By way of contrast -- the DAIS fuel cell housing designs (Radial Air Stack � RAS, and Single In Line Module � SIM) provide special air and hydrogen flows, and successfully manage the water produced by the fuel cell�s electrochemical reaction. The base materials are made of engineering grade plastics. The Radial Air design is unique due to its air flow pattern and use of a single compression bolt along with external hydrogen fuel distribution manifolds. The SIM design is progressive in regards to the ease of parts fabrication, low cost, and active material protection. Each design is lightweight, and is specifically targeted to be used in portable or semi-portable consumer, commercial, or military applications. Figure 1: RAS Stack Design Both novel housing designs (RAS and SIM) are engineered for use with the DAIS Corporation�s patented (or patent pending) Proton Exchange Membrane based fuel cell materials (membrane electrolyte, anode cathode, backing material, and interface polymer). Furthermore , it is possible to combine the best aspects of each design into a single design that is far superior to either design alone. Figure 2: Single In Line Module Design - Passive Both designs can be either passive or active air flow managed. The use of the passive mode makes a less expensive PowerCell device. Adding the active air flow over the cathode generally produces a 3x improvement in the overall power density. Each air management scheme can be adapted to a specific application or price point. IV. Economics 10w 25w 1kW Materials $57 $181 $491 Stack $31 $33 $77 Controls $39 $60 $151 Suggested Retail $128 $274 $720 DAIS requires its materials and designs to not only function and provide stable power but to be financially attractive to end users. This is a fundamental axiom with DAIS, whether the end user is an electrician working with portable power tools on a remote job site or a large multi-national firm that produces outdoor power equipment. The cost and functionality must meet Attribute #1 of cost competitiveness as stated before. The above chart is an estimate of how the DAIS technologies will price at a retail level given a modest level of production volume. V. Conclusions and Summary The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance. The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of this exciting technology of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel interface polymer, and two advanced stack designs. These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under. The entire DAIS team thanks you for taking time to read about our project. Footnotes: 1.

Wnek Professor Organic and Polymer Sciences Dr. Wnek received a Ph.D. in polymer science and engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1980 under Prof. J.C.W. Chien, and a B.S. in chemical engineering from WPI in 1977. He was a member of the faculty of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT from 1980-1987. He is presently the Chair of the Department of Chemistry. Research Areas Synthesis of Polymers with Unusual Electrical and Optical Properties Electroactive Polymers in Biomedicine Morphology Modulation Using Electric and Magnetic Fields Probes of Interfacial Adhesion in Composite Materials Synthesis of Polymers with Unusual Electrical and Optical Properties A major component of our research program has as its broad theme the synthesis and characterization of polymeric materials, with particular attention given to materials having interesting electrical and optical properties. For example, we recently developed a new approach for the functionalization of silicones which may have utility as dielectrics, electrolytes or non-linear optical materials, and now we are evaluating these materials using a variety of electrical and optical characterization techniques. Electroactive Polymers in Biomedicine Exciting technological opportunities are envisioned for polymers which are good conductors of electricity or, perhaps more importantly, are redox-active. Of particular interest to us are applications of electroactive polymers in biology. A number of properties change as the degree of oxidation or reduction of an electroactive polymer changes, such as electrical resistance, optical absorption, and ionic permeability. These electrically-induced changes can be exploited in the development of biosensors, matrices for controlled release of both small and macromolecular substances, and substrates for cell growth. Morphology Modulation Using Electric and Magnetic Fields Electric fields have a profound effect on the morphology of polymer blend films and may be useful processing aids. Anisotropic properties resulting from field-induced phase alignment are being measured. The effect of electric fields on the morphology of block copolymers is currently being studied. Probes of Interfacial Adhesion in Composite Materials ESR spin probes have been attached to silica surfaces in order to assess the quality of the interfacial bond in glass/polymer composites as a function of temperature, moisture, and mechanical cycling. Experiments with high-performance composites are in progress. to the DAIS Team Page. to the Publications & Press Info.

Autoignition temperature: 440 C (824 F) Flammable Limits in Air, % by Volume: lel: 2.1, uel: 13.5 Explosion: Above flash point, vapor-air mixtures are explosive within flammable limits noted above. Vapors can flow along surfaces to distant ignition source and flash back. Special Info: In the event of a fire, wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus with full facepiece operated in the pressure demand or other positive pressure mode. If a leak or spill has not ignited, use water spray to disperse the vapors and to protect persons attempting to stop leak. Water may be used to flush spills away from exposures and to dilute spills non-flammable mixtures. Section VII Reactivity No. 1(P) Stability: Stable under ordinary conditions of use and storage. Hazardous Decomposition Products: Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may form when heated to decomposition. Other minor amounts of toxic gases are acrolein, acids, ketones, and aldehydes. Hazardous Polymerization: Will not occur Incompatibility: Reacts violently with potassium-tert-butoxide. Can react vigorously with oxidizing materials. May function as a catalyst for reaction of selected organic compounds. Section VIII Spill and Leak Procedures No. 1 Spill/Leak Procedures: Ventilate area of leak or spill. Remove all sources of ignition. Clean-up personnel require protective clothingand respiratory protection from vapors. Small spills may be absorbed on paper towels and evaporated in a fume hood. Allow enough time for fumes to clear hood, then ignite paperin a suitable location away from combustible materials. Contain and recover liquid for reclamation when possible. Larger spills and lot sizes can be collected as hazardous waste and atomized in a suitable RCRA approved combustion chamber, or absorbed with vermiculite, dry sand, earth or similar material for disposal as hazardous waste in a RCRA approved facility. Do not flush to sewer! Water can be used to dilute to raise flashpoint and to flush away from possible sources of ignition. Ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations. Section IX Storage and Disposal No. 1 Storage: Material is to be kept away from high temperatures. Optimum storage temperature is between 10 and 30 degrees Centigrade. Due to its flammable nature, large quantities (> 1 liter quantities) of the material should be stored in a flame retardant metal cabinet. Disposal: Small quantities of the material (up to .5 liter) can be put in glass dish and the solvents allowed to evaporate in a fume hood. The resulting polymer film can then be washed with water to remove small trace amounts of sulfuric acid and put into the ordinary trash. Large quantities (> .5 liter) ofthe material should be incinerated. Section X Handling and Protective Equipment No. 1 Handling: Use with adequate ventilation to avoid breathing mist. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Material is harmfulif swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Protective Equipment: Eye protection and rubber gloves back to Products & Pricing. ©DAIS Corporation designed & hosted by Sun Coast Web DAIS Corporation Web Server 21st Century Fuel Cell Technology Design , Manufacture and Marketing of Environmentally Friendly Electrical Power Sources PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE HYDROGEN STACK MEA MEMBRANE ELECTRODE ANODE CATHODE ALTERNATE POWER NYSERDA RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE BUSINESS INCUBATOR RPI SMARTSTACK SMARTCELL POWERCELL HY-AIR ION EXCHANGE MEMBRANE EHRENBERG SERPICO SHEIKH-ALI WNEK JACKSON TANGREDI KARUPPAIAH MICROPHASE-SEPARATED POLYMER ELECTROCHEMICAL POWER FOOL CELL GENERATOR SCIENCE COLEMAN MOTOROLA ALTERNATE POWER SOURCE BATTERY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ULTRACAPACITOR WALL STREET JOURNAL ELECTRICITY EFFICIENT RENEWABLE RESOURCE POLLUTION FREE ENERGY STORAGE SPECIFIC ENERGY WATER H2O NEW TECHNOLOGY FORMULA SCHNENECTADY PLASTICS POG PHYSICS CHEMISTRY STARTUP CAMPING OUTDOORS AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTATION ECOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL GREEN EPA DOT DOD NASA AEROSPACE MARINE SCIENTIFICWT01-B07-115IA030-000648-B030-47http://www.dais.net:80/table1.htm 207.158.236.70 19970122131522 text/html 8877HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 13:15:20 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Fri, 08 Nov 1996 14:15:17 GMTETag: "45ef71-21bb-32834075"Content-Length: 8635Accept-Ranges: bytes  DAIS Corporation Web Server : Sulfonation Levels and Ionic conductivities of Fully Hydrated Polymer Films for 21st Century Fuel Cell Technology Design , Manufacture and Marketing of Environmentally Friendly Electrical Power Sources PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE HYDROGEN STACK MEA MEMBRANE ELECTRODE ANODE CATHODE ALTERNATE POWER NYSERDA RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE BUSINESS INCUBATOR RPI SMARTSTACK SMARTCELL POWERCELL HY-AIR ION EXCHANGE MEMBRANE EHRENBERG SERPICO SHEIKH-ALI WNEK JACKSON TANGREDI KARUPPAIAH MICROPHASE-SEPARATED POLYMER  ELECTROCHEMICAL POWER FOOL CELL GENERATOR SCIENCE COLEMAN MOTOROLA ALTERNATE POWER SOURCE BATTERY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ULTRACAPACITOR WALL STREET JOURNAL ELECTRICITY EFFICIENT RENEWABLE RESOURCE POLLUTION FREE ENERGY STORAGE SPECIFIC ENERGY WATER H2O NEW TECHNOLOGY FORMULA  SCHNENECTADY  PLASTICS POG PHYSICS CHEMISTRY STARTUP CAMPING OUTDOORS AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTATION ECOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL GREEN EPA DOT DOD NASA AEROSPACE MARINE SCIENTIFIC Sulfonation Levels and Ionic conductivities of Fully Hydrated Polymer Films Percent Sulfonation [a] mmol/g [b] Conductivity [c] (S/cm) 35 .96 .068 43 1.16 .075 50 1.33 .080 65 1.72 .089 Table Notations [a] Mole % based on styrene units, determined by titration.

AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTATION ECOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL GREEN EPA DOT DOD NASA AEROSPACE MARINE SCIENTIFIC How Fuel cells Work by GARY E. WNEK, Ph.D A fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that generates electricity through a controlled reaction between inexpensive hydrogen and air, said Gary Wnek, professor and chair of chemistry. Fuel cells are functionally superior to batteries in that a fuel cell's lifetime is limited only by the supply of air and a tank of hydrogen. In contrast, batteries have a defined lifetime, are heavy, have disposal restrictions, and may require extended periods of recharging. In any spontaneous chemical reaction, electrons are redistributed and energy is released that can be put to work. When hydrogen and oxygen react spontaneously, in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as platinum, to form water, electrons flow from the hydrogen to the oxygen. To control the electron flow and make it useful as electrical energy, the gasses must be kept apart. Otherwise they would react explosively, Wnek said. In a fuel cell, the gasses are not in physical contact. They are separated by a membrane, which only permits positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to cross over to the oxygen side and form water. Electron flow is localized at thin platinum electrodes on opposite sides of the membrane. Electrons from the hydrogen-side electrode flow across a wire to the opposite electrode. This flow provides the electricity to power electric motors or other devices. Most fuel cell units are designed to be stacked - looking like a stack of sandwiches. Adding more cells to a stack provides greater power. back to Inventor of the Year Press Release. ©DAIS Corporation designed & hosted by Sun Coast Web DAIS Corporation Web Server 21st Century Fuel Cell Technology Design , Manufacture and Marketing of Environmentally Friendly Electrical Power Sources PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE HYDROGEN STACK MEA MEMBRANE ELECTRODE ANODE CATHODE ALTERNATE POWER NYSERDA RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE BUSINESS INCUBATOR RPI SMARTSTACK SMARTCELL POWERCELL HY-AIR ION EXCHANGE MEMBRANE EHRENBERG SERPICO SHEIKH-ALI WNEK JACKSON TANGREDI KARUPPAIAH MICROPHASE-SEPARATED POLYMER ELECTROCHEMICAL POWER FOOL CELL GENERATOR SCIENCE COLEMAN MOTOROLA ALTERNATE POWER SOURCE BATTERY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ULTRACAPACITOR WALL STREET JOURNAL ELECTRICITY EFFICIENT RENEWABLE RESOURCE POLLUTION FREE ENERGY STORAGE SPECIFIC ENERGY WATER H2O NEW TECHNOLOGY FORMULA SCHNENECTADY PLASTICS POG PHYSICS CHEMISTRY STARTUP CAMPING OUTDOORS AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTATION ECOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL GREEN EPA DOT DOD NASA AEROSPACE MARINE SCIENTIFICWT01-B07-122IA030-000648-B028-231http://www.dais.net:80/guest/addguest.html 207.158.236.70 19970122130939 text/html 1929HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 13:09:38 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 07 Nov 1996 15:34:18 GMTETag: "25edcc-698-3282017a"Content-Length: 1688Accept-Ranges: bytes DAIS Corporation Web Server : Add to Our Guestbook environmentally friendly fuel cell technology ADD TO OUR GUESTBOOK Fill in the blanks below to add to our guestbook.

Allocations: Licence offers were made on 15 November1996. The successful applicants had one week in which to confirmacceptance of the licences offered, and a further week in whichto arrange payment of 10% of the licence fee as a deposit. Thefollowing tables reflect the allocation of licences as acceptedrather than the original offers. Applications for both species of squidexceeded the number of licences available by a significantamount. Loligo 34 applications were received for licences to fish for Loligosquid. The majority of applications were for long-term licences.14 licences were offered and accepted. This is a decrease fromthe 17 vessels which have operated in recent first seasons. Thereduction in licences has been necessary as the effective fishingeffort of the vessels involved in the fishery has been graduallyincreasing. All the vessels in the Loligo fishery havelong-term licences which expiry dates ranging between 1997 and2001. Illex Approximately 160 applications for Illex licences inrespect of jigging vessels were received. 90 of theseapplications have been successful. Effort in the Illexfishery has been held at 1993 levels. In view of early closuresof the Illex season in recent years and the results ofjoint Argentine/British research cruises, it is felt that anyincrease in effort on Illex would not be justified. A small number (15) of Illexlicences have been offered in respect of jigging vessels on along-term (5 year) basis. This development complies with thecurrent fisheries policy. It is seeking to encourage localFalkland involvement in the Illex fishery to move onto asounder footing. As in previous years, trawlers have takenup a number of seasonal Illex licences. The newlyintroduced combined Illex and restricted Finfish licencefor trawlers has attracted a high number of applicants.

Major said that Britain continuesto seek a stable and productive relationship with Argentina, notjust because of the interests both countries have in common,"but because as you have repeatedly told us, it's inyour interest too, as the progress on oil exploration has vividlyshown us". "You have the right to live underthe flag of your choice , and we shall continue to ensure thatyou enjoy that right, and that you enjoy security",underlined the Prime Minister. The remarks come as rumours of amassive reduction in the current British troop levels in theFalklands-Malvinas are being circulated and just a few daysbefore the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo begins a shortvisit to the islands. Major also talked about the opportunitiesand challenges that the prospects of commercially exploitable oilreserves being discovered in the islands could bring. "Someof you I know are nervous about the implications for yourenvironment and your traditional way of life and I understandthose fears. We've had to face in many ways similar challenges,but I believe they can be surmounted". Finally theBritish Prime Minister also talked about a long term fisheriesagreement with Argentina. The fishing industry, particularlysquid licenses, remains the islands main income. "I knowhow important fishing remains to your prosperity. It seems to methat one of the priorities 1997 should be to make progress on anagreement with Argentina to assure the fish stocks of the SouthWest Atlantic". BARONESS THATCHER ALSOSENDS HER GREETINGS STANLEY.(MP).- As has beentradition since she left power, the former British Prime Ministerand now Baroness Thatcher also sent her personal Xmas greetingsto the Falklanders, this time congratulating the islanders fortheir British loyalty. With very emotive words, appealing tomemories of the past during the 1982 conflict, Baroness Thatchertold the islanders how close to the Falklands-Malvinas her heartand mind remain, and with particular admiration for the UnitedStates, -"the only nation truly founded on freedom-",remembered "how very important Casper Weinberger (thethen US Secretary of Defence) with his assistance, had been atthat time". Baroness Thatcher went on to say how gladshe felt when reading, in the FI Newsletter (the islands lobbypublication in London), the official policy of the islands:"The Falklands-Malvinas are British and will continue tobe British. Any alteration is something which is to be entirelyself-determined by the people of the islands". But theformer Prime Minister who recovered the islands in 1982, alsoreminded the Falklanders that "we must never take forgranted the bravery and generosity of America not the heroism andservice of those to whose sacrifice and sense of duty we will beeternally in debt". DI TELLA SENDS XMAS GIFTS TOISLANDERS STANLEY. (MP).- For the fourth yearin succession Argentine Foreign Secretary Guido Di Tella has senta Xmas gift to the islanders: this year 600 copies of the shortallegory "The Little Prince", written andillustrated by French author Antoine de Saint-Expury. In theaccompanying letter addressed "my dear neighbour",Di Tella explains why he picked this particular book: "adelightful little book that the author says it was written forgrown ups full of imagination and dreams, who were children notso long ago" Last year Di Tella sent a photograph ofhis many grandchildren, several of whom he maintained were "foreigners"because of their European background. In Xmas 1994 the gift was avideo cassette of the popular BBC series "Pingu thePenguin", while previously he had sent a colouredpostcard of Buenos Aires. Reaction in the islands to Di Tella'scharm policy as usual, was of indifference or regretful thatArgentine tax payers money was not used for a better purpose."This is a pointless exercise by an eccentric man",said Councilor John Birmingham. FULL SPEED AHEAD IN THEJOINT COOPERATION AREA STANLEY (MP).- British andArgentine representatives are working at full speed to ensurethat seismic surveying in the joint co-operation area can getstarted by next February and the oil exploration licensing roundat the end of 1997. The 18.000 square kilometres special jointco-operation area in the South Atlantic, (where Argentine andFalklands-Malvinas waters overlap), was created in the 1995 NewYork oil agreement between Prime Minister Major and PresidentMenem. Phyllis Rendell Director of the Oil Department of theFalklands-Malvinas just back from a meeting of the South AtlanticHydrocarbons Committee (SAHC), held in London, said that thebasic idea behind the co-operation is that levels and standardsfor the oil industry are made extensive to the whole SouthAtlantic. "We will encourage companies working on ourwaters to participate in activities in the special co-operationarea", underlined Mrs. Rendell. Mrs. Rendell said thatthe SAHC is drafting proposals to ensure that both governmentsequally share income generated in the special area and has alsoreceived several proposals to outline the trenches. "Twoseismic companies are already interested in operating which weexpect could begin next February, and by the end of '97 the oillicensing round should be launched", remarked Mrs.Rendell. But in spite of the overall optimism and the 1998timetable agreed during the SAHC meeting, Mrs. Rendell warnedthat there is an enormous work load ahead since the Argentine andBritish licensing systems are so radically different. Experts ofthe SAHC are scheduled to meet again next March in Buenos Aires. ARGENTINE JOURNALISTS WILLVISIT THE ISLANDS STANLEY. (MP).- A smallteam of journalists from Buenos Aires will be joining the twoArgentine groups of next of kin relatives when they travel to theislands to visit the war cemetery in Darwin in mid January andFebruary. The announcement was made public by a member of thelocal Legislative Council after "receiving a request"from the Argentine government. The group of journalists willinclude a news editor from the Buenos Aires Herald, a televisionteam from "Multimedia America" and a reporterfrom TELAM, the official Argentine news agency. The first visitof this kind to the war cemetery in Darwin where 234 Argentinesare buried took place in March 1991. On this occasion theArgentines will be staying overnight at the Darwin lodge. POSSIBLE OIL BONANZA LEADSTO FRICTIONS WITH BRITISH PRESS STANLEY. (MP).- Oil hasyet to be found and in commercially sustainable volumes, butcontroversy has already taken off. First it was Tony Lloyd,Labour MP and shadow spokesman for the area who after a shortvisit suggested that the islands would have to pass on to theBritish Treasury some of the enormous revenue expected from thecoming oil bonanza. This was followed by reports from Britishjournalists, guests of the islands' government, who indicated thepossibility of a 1,1 billion pounds oil revenue in twenty yearstime, and wondered what could this mean for the personality andunique life style of the Falklanders. The Times went further andin an editorial reminded the islanders that "citizenshave as many obligations as rights, the main of which is to paytaxes according to their means". Although a colonyislanders are full British citizens. The Falklands-Malvinasgovernment, in spite of the recent optimism about oil, has triedto down play the controversy by arguing that it's not possible topretend a fixed rate, "when we still don't know how muchwe will be receiving". Councillors on the other handconfirmed in a release that "it was on their owninitiative that they wrote a letter two years ago to the Britishgovernment offering to defray the cost of the defence of theFalkland Islands should a sufficient quantity of oil be found".
